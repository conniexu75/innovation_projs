https://openalex.org/W1966772288,"The average first flowering date of 385 British plant species has advanced by 4.5 days during the past decade compared with the previous four decades: 16% of species flowered significantly earlier in the 1990s than previously, with an average advancement of 15 days in a decade. Ten species (3%) flowered significantly later in the 1990s than previously. These data reveal the strongest biological signal yet of climatic change. Flowering is especially sensitive to the temperature in the previous month, and spring-flowering species are most responsive. However, large interspecific differences in this response will affect both the structure of plant communities and gene flow between species as climate warms. Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones."

Epicenters of the tremors were distributed along the strike of the subducting Philippine Sea plate over a length of 600 kilometers. The depth of the tremors averaged about 30 kilometers, near the Mohorovic discontinuity. Each tremor lasted for at most a few weeks. The location of the tremors within the subduction zone indicates that the tremors may have been caused by fluid generated by dehydration processes from the slab."
https://openalex.org/W2015762135,We provide evidence of large-scale changes in the biogeography of calanoid copepod crustaceans in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean and European shelf seas. We demonstrate that strong biogeographical shifts in all copepod assemblages have occurred with a northward extension of more than 10° latitude of warm-water species associated with a decrease in the number of colder-water species. These biogeographical shifts are in agreement with recent changes in the spatial distribution and phenology detected for many taxonomic groups in terrestrial European ecosystems and are related to both the increasing trend in Northern Hemisphere temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation.
https://openalex.org/W2130074917,"Pattern completion, the ability to retrieve complete memories on the basis of incomplete sets of cues, is a crucial function of biological memory systems. The extensive recurrent connectivity of the CA3 area of hippocampus has led to suggestions that it might provide this function. We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a genetically engineered mouse strain in which the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor gene is ablated specifically in the CA3 pyramidal cells of adult mice. The mutant mice normally acquired and retrieved spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze, but they were impaired in retrieving this memory when presented with a fraction of the original cues. Similarly, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mutant mice displayed normal place-related activity in a full-cue environment but showed a reduction in activity upon partial cue removal. These results provide direct evidence for CA3 NMDA receptor involvement in associative memory recall."
https://openalex.org/W2120397217,"Using the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer on the Mars Odyssey, we have identified two regions near the poles that are enriched in hydrogen. The data indicate the presence of a subsurface layer enriched in hydrogen overlain by a hydrogen-poor layer. The thickness of the upper layer decreases with decreasing distance to the pole, ranging from a column density of about 150 grams per square centimeter at -42 degrees latitude to about 40 grams per square centimeter at -77 degrees. The hydrogen-rich regions correlate with regions of predicted ice stability. We suggest that the host of the hydrogen in the subsurface layer is ice, which constitutes 35 +/- 15% of the layer by weight."
https://openalex.org/W2072871667,A biogeochemical model of vegetation using observed climate data predicts the high northern latitude greening trend over the past two decades observed by satellites and a marked setback in this trend after the Mount Pinatubo volcano eruption in 1991. The observed trend toward earlier spring budburst and increased maximum leaf area is produced by the model as a consequence of biogeochemical vegetation responses mainly to changes in temperature. The post-Pinatubo decline in vegetation in 1992-1993 is apparent as the effect of temporary cooling caused by the eruption. High-latitude CO(2) uptake during these years is predicted as a consequence of the differential response of heterotrophic respiration and net primary production.
https://openalex.org/W2150494204,"Global distributions of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutron fluxes have been mapped during late southern summer/northern winter using the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer. These fluxes are selectively sensitive to the vertical and lateral spatial distributions of H and CO 2 in the uppermost meter of the martian surface. Poleward of ±60° latitude is terrain rich in hydrogen, probably H 2 O ice buried beneath tens of centimeter-thick hydrogen-poor soil. The central portion of the north polar cap is covered by a thick CO 2 layer, as is the residual south polar cap. Portions of the low to middle latitudes indicate subsurface deposits of chemically and/or physically bound H 2 O and/or OH."
https://openalex.org/W2092782423,"Coherence of interacting oscillating entities has importance in biological, chemical, and physical systems. We report experiments on populations of chemical oscillators and verify a 25-year-old theory of Kuramoto that predicts that global coupling in a set of smooth limit-cycle oscillators with different frequencies produces a phase transition in which some of the elements synchronize. Both the critical point and the predicted dependence of order on coupling are seen in the experiments. We extend the studies both to relaxation and to chaotic oscillators and characterize the quantitative similarities and differences among the types of systems."
https://openalex.org/W2083303664,"Multimillion-atom molecular-dynamics simulations are used to investigate the shock-induced phase transformation of solid iron. Above a critical shock strength, many small close-packed grains nucleate in the shock-compressed body-centered cubic crystal growing on a picosecond time scale to form larger, energetically favored grains. A split two-wave shock structure is observed immediately above this threshold, with an elastic precursor ahead of the lagging transformation wave. For even higher shock strengths, a single, overdriven wave is obtained. The dynamics and orientation of the developing close-packed grains depend on the shock strength and especially on the crystallographic shock direction. Orientational relations between the unshocked and shocked regions are similar to those found for the temperature-driven martensitic transformation in iron and its alloys."
https://openalex.org/W2171221345,"After 55 days of mapping by the High Energy Neutron Detector onboard Mars Odyssey, we found deficits of high-energy neutrons in the southern highlands and northern lowlands of Mars. These deficits indicate that hydrogen is concentrated in the subsurface. Modeling suggests that water ice–rich layers that are tens of centimeters in thickness provide one possible fit to the data."
https://openalex.org/W2171135124,"We investigated the cutaneous expression of genes and enzymes responsible for the multistep conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and further to melatonin. Samples tested were human skin, normal and pathologic (basal cell carcinoma and melanoma), cultured normal epidermal and follicular melanocytes, melanoma cell lines, normal neonatal and adult epidermal and follicular keratinocytes, squamous cell carcinoma cells, and fibroblasts from dermis and follicular papilla. The majority of the samples showed simultaneous expression of the genes for tryptophan hydroxylase, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT). The products of AANAT activity were identified by RP-HPLC with fluorimetric detection in human skin and in cultured normal and malignant melanocytes and immortalized keratinocytes; HIOMT activity was detected in human skin, keratinocytes, and melanoma cells. N-acetylserotonin (NAS) was detected by RP-HPLC in human skin extracts. NAS identity was confirmed further by LC/MS in keratinocytes. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the human skin expresses intrinsic serotonin and melatonin biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2105859448,"Sunspots, dark magnetic regions occurring at low latitudes on the Sun's surface, are tracers of the magnetic field generated by the dynamo mechanism. Recent solar dynamo models, which use the helioseismically determined solar rotation, indicate that sunspots should form at high latitudes, contrary to observations. We present a dynamo model with the correct latitudinal distribution of sunspots and demonstrate that this requires a meridional flow of material that penetrates deeper than hitherto believed, into the stable layers below the convection zone. Such a deep material flow may have important implications for turbulent convection and elemental abundance in the Sun and similar stars."
https://openalex.org/W2070004885,"Glaciation in the humid tropical Andes is a sensitive indicator of mean annual temperature. Here, we present sedimentological data from lakes beyond the glacial limit in the tropical Andes indicating that deglaciation from the Last Glacial Maximum led substantial warming at high northern latitudes. Deglaciation from glacial maximum positions at Lake Titicaca, Peru/Bolivia (16 degrees S), and Lake Junin, Peru (11 degrees S), occurred 22,000 to 19,500 calendar years before the present, several thousand years before the Bølling-Allerød warming of the Northern Hemisphere and deglaciation of the Sierra Nevada, United States (36.5 degrees to 38 degrees N). The tropical Andes deglaciated while climatic conditions remained regionally wet, which reflects the dominant control of mean annual temperature on tropical glaciation."
https://openalex.org/W2067439258,"Bone resorption in balance with bone formation is vital for the maintenance of the skeleton and is mediated by osteoclasts. Cathepsin K is the predominant protease in osteoclasts that degrades the bulk of the major bone forming organic component, type I collagen. Although the potent collagenase activity of cathepsin K is well known, its mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we report a cathepsin K-specific complex with chondroitin sulfate, which is essential for the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme. The complex is an oligomer consisting of five cathepsin K and five chondroitin sulfate molecules. Only the complex exhibits potent triple helical collagen-degrading activity, whereas monomeric cathepsin K has no collagenase activity. The primary substrate specificity of cathepsin K is not altered by complex formation, suggesting that the protease-chondroitin sulfate complex primarily facilitates the destabilization and/or the specific binding of the triple helical collagen structure. Inhibition of complex formation leads to the loss of collagenolytic activity but does not impair the proteolytic activity of cathepsin K toward noncollagenous substrates. The physiological relevance of cathepsin K complexes is supported by the findings that (i) the content of chondroitin sulfate present in bone and accessible to cathepsin K activity is sufficient for complex formation and (ii) Y212C, a cathepsin K mutant that causes pycnodysostosis (a bone sclerosing disorder) and that has no collagenase activity but remains potent as a gelatinase, is unable to form complexes. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of bone collagen degradation and suggest that targeting cathepsin K complex formation would be an effective and specific treatment for diseases with excessive bone resorption such as osteoporosis.

Various bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, certain forms of arthritis, and osseous metastases are characterized by excessive osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The resorptive step can be divided into two basic processes: (i) mineral solubilization and (ii) focalized matrix degradation. Whereas mineral solubilization depends on the production and secretion of acid by the osteoclast, matrix degradation is mainly due to the activity of the cysteine protease, cathepsin K (1Bromme D.

Among all mammalian collagenases, cathepsin K is the only protease capable of cleaving interstitial collagens at multiple sites within their triple helical structures (5Garnero P. Borel O.

Deficiency in cathepsin K activity leads to an accumulation of undigested collagen fibrils in lysosomes within osteoclasts (7Everts V. Aronson D.C. Beertsen W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as observed in patients with the autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia pycnodysostosis (8Gelb B.D. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Analysis of cathepsin K mutants revealed that the collagen degradation defect is not necessarily coupled with the loss of proteolytic activity of cathepsin K. One disease causing mutation, Y212C, that is remote from the active site of the protease, only mildly affected the overall proteolytic activity of cathepsin K but completely eliminated its collagenase activity (9Hou W.-S. Brömme D. Zhao Y. Mehler E. Dushey C. Weinstein H. Miranda C.S. Fraga C. Greig F. Carey J. Rimoin D.L. Desnick R.J. Gelb B.D. J. Clin.

This observation indicated that in addition to the catalytic activity of cathepsin K, other features are required for the hydrolysis of collagens by cathepsin K. We have recently demonstrated that bone- and cartilage-resident glycosaminoglycans specifically enhance the degradation of interstitial collagens of types I and II by cathepsin K, an effect not observed with cathepsin L or matrix metalloproteinase I (10Li Z. Hou W.S. Bromme D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the collagenase activity of cathepsin K requires specific interactions between cathepsin K protein and glycosaminoglycans. The mechanism by which cathepsin K degrades collagen, however, remained elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K depends on the formation of a novel oligomeric complex of cathepsin K protein with chondroitin sulfate. Wild-type human cathepsin K and its mutant protein, Y212C, were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (9Hou W.-S. Brömme D. Zhao Y. Mehler E. Dushey C. Weinstein H.

Chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S)1 was purchased from Sigma and fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 Superfine column. The molecular masses of the individual fractions were determined by dynamic light scattering (see below). Cathepsin K complexes were obtained by mixing purified cathepsin K and excess C4-S in acetate buffer, pH 5.0 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mm EDTA. 40 μg of purified recombinant human cathepsin K were preincubated with 0.1% C4-S (with 16-, 25-, and 29.8-kDa fractions, respectively, as determined by dynamic light scattering, see below) in the elution buffer for 20 min and then applied to a Superdex200 column and eluted either in the presence or absence of 300 mm NaCl with 100 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA/DTT. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm, and cathepsin K activity was assayed for the hydrolysis of the cathepsin K substrate Z-Leu-Arg-MCA as described previously (4Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Steady state kinetics were performed with fluorogenic dipeptide substrates as described previously (4Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was followed by monitoring the release of the fluorogenic leaving group, MCA, at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm using the Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini spectro-microfluorimeter. The k cat and K m values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis. The cathepsin K activities were assayed at 25 °C in the absence or presence of 0.1% C4-S at a fixed enzyme concentration (0.5 nm) and variable substrate concentrations (1–100 μm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT and 2.5 mm EDTA. In addition, Z-Leu-Arg-MCA hydrolysis was assayed in the presence or absence of 300 mm NaCl. The active site concentration of cathepsin K and the mutant protein were determined by titration with E64 (12Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). DCG-04, an epoxide inhibitor derivative of E64 containing a tyrosine residue for iodination and a biotin moiety (13Bogyo M. Verhelst S. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Toba S. Greenbaum D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. M. Bogyo, (Celera Corp., South San Francisco, CA). The compound was iodinated as described in Ref. 14Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar. An aqueous solution of 15 μm (0.1 μCi/ml) of [125I]DCG-04 was incubated with recombinant human cathepsin K (or recombinant Y212C mutant; both at 2.5 μm) in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2.5 mm DTT and 2.5 mm EDTA for 4 h. Free inhibitor was removed by gel filtration using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). 50 ng of [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K were preincubated in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 mm EDTA/DTT in the presence or absence of 0.1% of C4-S, respectively, for 20 min and then mixed at 37 °C with nonreducing protein loading buffer and preheated agarose gel. The sample was loaded into the well of a 0.5% agarose gel and separated at room temperature at 55 V, 250 mA for 30 min in a running buffer containing 125 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Chaps. The gel was dried and subsequently exposed to an x-ray film. To determine the effect of NaCl concentration on the formation of cathepsin K·C4-S complexes, labeled cathepsin K was incubated as described above in the presence of increasing NaCl concentrations (100, 200, and 300 mm). Equal salt concentrations were added to the agarose gel and the electrophoresis running buffer. To determine the complex ratio between cathepsin K protein and C4-S, a constant amount of C4-S (292 pmol) was incubated with variable amounts of [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K and then applied to 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretically separated bands of free cathepsin K represented the exact amount of cathepsin K in its free form in the equilibrium. The free form of labeled cathepsin K was detected by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The free cathepsin K concentrations were determined using a calibration curve derived from known concentrations of cathepsin K. Plotting the quotient cathepsin Kc/C4-S ([cathepsin K in complex] divided by [C4-S]; complex cathepsin K = total cathepsin K-free cathepsin K) versus total cathepsin K concentration, the ratio between cathepsin K and C4-S in the complex could be determined. With increasing cathepsin K concentrations, the value for cathepsin K·C4-S increased until reaching saturation. The data could be fitted to the following equation, which was developed using the equilibrium equation and the assumption of a 1:1 complex, [CatKc]/[C]t=(Kd+[CatK]t+[C]t−((Kd+[CatK]t+[C]t)2−4[C]t[CatK]t)0.5)/2[C]tEquation 1 where [CatK]t is the total cathepsin K concentration, [C]t is total C-4S concentration, and [CatKc] is the cathepsin K concentration in the complex form. The saturation line of the curve represents the complex ratio of cathepsin K to C4-S. The molecular masses of monomeric cathepsin K, C4-S, and the CatK·C4-S complex were determined using a DynaPro-801 TC (ProteinSolutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) with helium/neon laser light scattering. The samples were dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 80 mm NaCl. CatK·C4-S complexes were generated by mixing cathepsin K and C4-S (29.8-kDa fraction) at a ratio of 1:1. The data were analyzed using Dynamics 4.0 software (ProteinSolutions), and the molecular masses were calculated from experimental hydrodynamic radii using the Pullunan standard curve for C4-S and a globular protein standard for monomeric cathepsin K and its complex form. The experiment was performed in the Optima XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge using a Beckman An50-Ti 8 hole rotor equipped with a six-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece and quartz windows. The absorbance data were acquired at 280 nm as an average of 10 measurements at each radial position in 0.003-cm increments. A total of six data sets were collected corresponding to three different concentrations (10, 20, and 50 μm of cathepsin K and C4-S in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm NaCl) and two speeds (6000 and 8000 rpm). Data editing and evaluation of the equilibrium were performed using the programs REEDIT and MATCH, respectively (provided by the National Analytical Ultracentrifugation facility of the University of Connecticut). The data were analyzed using the program NONLIN (15Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) allowing a global fit to s, where s = M(1 −vD)w2/RT is the reduced apparent molecular mass. Calculation of the molecular mass was performed using molar masses (24.8 kDa for cathepsin K and 29.8 kDa for C4-S) and partial specific volumes (0.714 for protein and 0.58 for glycosaminoglycan) (16Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). 0.4 mg/ml type I collagen (calf skin, Calbiochem) were incubated with human cathepsin K (800 nm) or its mutant protein (800 nm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. Collagen digestion was performed at 28 and 37 °C in the absence and the presence of 0.15% (w/v) C4-S. Heat-denatured type I collagen (gelatin) was incubated with cathepsin K (0.5 nm) or its mutant (1 nm). The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μm E64 after 4 and 8 h. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using 4–20% Tris/glycine gels that subsequently were stained with Coomassie Blue. The glycosaminoglycans present in commercial type I collagen were removed by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. 100 μl of 8 mg/ml collagen (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, were incubated with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) at 25 °C for 4 h. The residual glycosaminoglycan content was determined as follows: 8 mg/ml collagen were heated at 70 °C for 20 min and then incubated with 0.1 mg/ml pepsin at 25 °C, pH 3.7, for 2 h. Glycosaminoglycan concentration was measured using the Blyscan glycosaminoglycan assay kit (Biocolor Ltd., Newtown Abbey, Northern Ireland). A human femoral head bone specimen obtained after hip joint replacement surgery was washed several time with ice-cold water and was milled under liquid nitrogen. The bone powder was defatted with acetone at 4 °C for 2 h, washed with ice-cold water, and eventually demineralized in 10% formic acid for 3 days at 4 °C with daily renewals of formic acid. Subsequently, the washed demineralized bone powder was freeze-dried. 4 mg of bone powder were degraded for 4 h with 800 nm cathepsin K at 25 °C in 0.3 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. The soluble glycosaminoglycan content was determined using the Blyscan glycosaminoglycan assay kit. For experiments to identify complex formation, glycosaminoglycan-containing supernatants were heat-inactivated at 70 °C for 10 min after cathepsin K digestion. Heat-inactivated supernatants were then incubated with [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described above. As a control, supernatants of undigested bone powder were used. Size exclusion chromatography of purified recombinant cathepsin K and C4-S mixtures revealed proteolytically active, high molecular mass complexes. The molecular masses varied between 180 and 310 kDa depending on the molecular mass fraction of C4-S used (16, 25, and 29.8 kDa determined by dynamic light scattering) (Fig.1 A). When cathepsin K·C4-S mixtures were eluted in the presence of 300 mm NaCl, cathepsin K activity corresponded to a peak of 25 kDa, which was identical to the elution peak obtained when cathepsin K was applied to the gel filtration column without C4-S. The complex form was also detected in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K in the presence of C4-S. Cathepsin K in the presence of C4-S migrated further to the anode than the enzyme without C4-S. In the presence of 0.3 m NaCl, the complex dissociated and cathepsin K migrated identically to the protease sample in the absence of C4-S (Fig. 1 B). For the dissociation of the complexes, NaCl concentrations of >0.2m are required (Fig. 1 B). The existence of high molecular mass cathepsin K·C4-S complexes was confirmed by DLS and analytical ultracentrifugation. Measurements by DLS yielded a molecular mass of 274 ± 12 kDa, and the value obtained by ultracentrifugation was 285 kDa using the 29.8-kDa fraction of C4-S. Mobility shift assays allowed us to determine the ratio of [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K to C4-S in the complex. The plot of the amounts of cathepsin Kc·C4-Sversus cathepsin K resulted in a saturation curve that reached a plateau at a 1:1 ratio of cathepsin K to C4-S (Fig.2). Based on the molecular mass of the complex determined by DLS and analytical ultracentrifugation and the ratio of 1:1 of cathepsin K to C4-S, we suggest the following stoichiometry for the complex: (CatK)5 (C4-S)5. The calculated molecular mass of the complex is 275 kDa (based on the masses of its components: cathepsin K, 25.2 ± 1.2 kDa, and C4-S, 29.8 ± 3.2 kDa as determined by DLS) and is in close proximity to the experimental values obtained by DLS and ultracentrifugation. The hydrodynamic radius of the complex was determined by DLS to be 65 ± 1.4 Å. To determine whether chondroitin sulfate and sodium chloride affect the catalytic activity of cathepsin K, we determined the kinetic parameters for the cathepsin K-catalyzed hydrolysis of the synthetic fluorogenic substrate, Z-Leu-Arg-MCA, in the absence and presence of C4-S and sodium chloride, respectively (TableI). C4-S increased the specificity constant, k cat/K m, 2-fold, which was equally reflected in slight decreases in theK m value and increases in thek cat value. NaCl had no or only a very weak effect on the appropriate K m andk cat values in the presence or the absence of C4-S. This suggests that the observed activating effect of C4-S on cathepsin K activity toward Z-Leu-Arg-MCA is not associated with the formation of high molecular cathepsin K complexes. A potential effect of complex formation on the substrate specificity of cathepsin K was excluded by the kinetic analysis of second order rate constants for the hydrolysis of dipeptide substrates (Z-Xaa-Arg-MCA, where Xaa = Leu, Phe, Val, or Arg) in the presence or absence of C4-S. The formation of cathepsin K complexes had no effect on the substrate specificity of the S2 subsite pocket (Fig.3). The order of preference for P2 amino acid residues in the tested substrate series was identical in both assay conditions (Leu > Phe > Val > Arg), suggesting that the binding and cleavage preferences were identical in the free and the complex forms of cathepsin K.Table IKinetic parameters for the cleavage of Z-Leu-Arg-MCA by cathepsin K in the presence or absence of C4-S (1.5 mg/ml) and NaCl (0.3m)Conditionk catK mk cat/K ms−1μm×106m−1 s−17.957 ± 0.3036.632 ± 0.4681.1997NaCl8.420 ± 0.4058.570 ± 0.6980.9825C4-S9.730 ± 0.1094.047 ± 0.1022.4042C4-S/NaCl11.375 ± 0.2117.045 ± 0.2541.6146 Open table in a new tab Type I collagen was incubated with free cathepsin K or with cathepsin K·C4-S complexes at 28 and 37 °C in the presence or absence of 300 mm NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, type I collagen was completely degraded by the protease·C4-S complex, whereas in the presence of NaCl cathepsin K alone or in a mixture with C4-S showed no or only a minimal degradation of the extracellular matrix protein even at 37 °C (Fig.4 A). Because the degradation of native collagen requires longer incubation times, the question was raised whether this activity is facilitated by an increased stability of the enzyme in the presence of C4-S. The residual activities listed in Table II indicate that both C4-S and NaCl stabilize cathepsin K activity. However, the stabilizing effects were nonadditive. Of note, there was no difference in the measured residual activities when the enzyme was incubated with C4-S alone or together with NaCl. Because the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K·C4-S complexes was abrogated in the presence of NaCl, we conclude that the observed collagenolytic activity depends solely on the complex formation and not on the stabilization of the protease. In contrast, neither C4-S nor NaCl had any significant effect on the degradation of denatured type I collagen (gelatin) (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that complex formation is not required for the cathepsin K-catalyzed degradation of noncollagenous protein substrates.Table IIStability of cathepsin K in collagen I degradation assays in the presence or absence of C4-S (1.5 mg/ml) and NaCl (0.3 m) at 28 °CConditionsResidual activities4 h8 h%7.8 ± 1.82.8 ± 1.0NaCl26.7 ± 7.69.3 ± 3.1C4-S57.1 ± 6.434.1 ± 5.5C4-S/NaCl50.8 ± 8.130.6 ± 3.8Residual activities were measured using Z-Leu-Arg-MCA as fluorogenic substrate.

Contrary to this report, previous studies have shown a collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K in the apparent absence of chondroitin sulfate (4Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol.

This activity is probably caused by glycosaminoglycan contaminations in commercially available collagen preparations (approximately 0.2 μg/ml in soluble type I calf skin collagen fromCalbiochem after pepsin degradation). At this concentration, C4-S was sufficient to partially form cathepsin K·C4-S complexes and to exhibit a relatively minor but detectable collagenase activity as shown in Fig. 5. A reduction of the glycosaminoglycan content in the collagen preparations by pretreatment with chondroitinase ABC resulted in a significant reduction of the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K toward type I collagen (Fig.5 B), whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect on the activity of cathepsin K toward synthetic peptide substrates (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the presence of traces of glycosaminoglycans in collagen preparations concealed the fact that monomeric cathepsin K does not have collagenolytic activity. With increasing C4-S concentrations, the collagenolytic activity dramatically increased and reached a maximum of activity at ∼10 μg/ml C4-S (∼500 nm), which was close to the protease concentration used in the assay. This again is suggestive for a cathepsin K to C4-S ratio of 1:1. The main sources of chondroitin sulfates in human bone are the proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan. Following incubation of human bone powder with cathepsin K, glycosaminoglycans were found in the supernatant at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (0.75% of dry weight of bone powder), which probably only represents the amount of glycosaminoglycans released from the surface of the bone powder particles. Because no soluble glycosaminoglycans were detected prior to the treatment with cathepsin K, we suggest that the protease degrades proteoglycans and releases the glycosaminoglycans. When [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K was incubated with supernatants of cathepsin K-predigested bone, we observed a shift in the mobility in agarose gel electrophoresis typical for cathepsin K·C4-S complexes. Preincubation of labeled cathepsin K with supernatants of undigested bone did not show the shift, and the enzyme migrated identically to the free enzyme (Fig.6). These data clearly indicate that surface digestion of bone particles by cathepsin K releases sufficient amounts of glycosaminoglycans required for the generation of cathepsin K complexes. Moreover, they explain the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K using bone powder as substrate as described previously by Garnero et al. (5Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M. Drake F.H.

The data presented are derived from in vitro experiments and do not indicate whether complex formation is an in vitro artifact or a physiological feature of the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K in vivo. To address this question, cathepsin K mutations that cause pycnodysostosis were reviewed. Nine mutations were either nonsense defects that obliterated the protein or missense mutations that resulted in unstable proteins (17Gelb B.D. Brömme D. Desnick R.J. Sriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.CS. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. III. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 3453-3468Google Scholar). A single mutation, Y212C, produced a cathepsin K polypeptide that lacked collagenase activity but retained its gelatinase activity (9Hou W.-S. Brömme D. Zhao Y. Mehler E. Dushey C. Weinstein H. Miranda C.S. Fraga C. Greig F. Carey J. Rimoin D.L. Desnick R.J. Gelb B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When tested, no complex formation between Y212C and C4-S was observed (Fig. 7 A). Similar to cathepsin K in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, the Y212C protein did not have collagenase activity in the presence nor in the absence of C4-S, even at 37 °C (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the lack of complex formation for the Y212C variant provides an explanation about the inability of this mutant to hydrolyze native collagen. In contrast, the gelatinase activities of wild-type and mutant Y212C cathepsin K in the presence of C4-S were comparable (Fig. 7 C), supporting the hypothesis that complex formation is required for the in vivo collagenase activity of cathepsin K but not for its action toward noncollagenous substrates. Type I collagen constitutes the major organic component in bone and is subjected to a constant turnover during the bone remodeling process. Only a few proteases are capable of degrading native triple helical collagens. Besides cathepsin K, several members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are classified as mammalian collagenases. MMPs cleave interstitial collagens at a distinct Gly-(Ile/Leu) bond to generate ¾ and ¼ fragments (18Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol.

Although PRMT2 was found to interact with two other coactivators, the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein (PRIP), no synergistic enhancement of ERα transcriptional activity was observed when PRMT2 was coexpressed with either PRIP or SRC-1.

An equal number of cells in suspension was collected by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activity was determined (Galacto-light kit, Tropix, Bedford, MA). Three independent assays were performed. The GST alone and GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translation was performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. In GST pull-down assays, a 25-μl aliquot of GST fusion protein loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins for 2 h in 500 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The binding was assayed in the presence or absence of specific ligands: 17β-estradiol (1 × 10−6m) for ER; BRL49653 (1 × 10−5m) for PPARγ; 9-cis-retinoic acid (1 × 10−6m) for RXRα and RARα; Wy-14, 643 (1 × 10−5m) for PPARα; and T3 (1 × 10−6m) for TRβ1. Bound proteins were washed five times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCDNA3.1-ERα and 5 μg of pCMV-FLAG-PRMT2 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (Sigma) or control serum. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-ERα. Purified GST, GST-PRMT2, GST-PRMT2M, or GST-PRMT1 (10 μg) was incubated with 20 μCi ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in the buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 10 min. The protein was trapped on HAWP 02500 filter (Millipore). The filter was washed with the buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mmMgCl2) to remove unboundS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. The filters were dried, and the amount of boundS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. CV-1 cells (1 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected for 5 h with 1.25 μg of luciferase reporter DNA, 20 ng of plasmid expressing the receptor, and 1.25 μg of appropriate expression plasmid DNA or as indicated in the figure legends using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen); 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (CLONTECH) DNA was always included as an internal control. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Tropix). Three independent transfections were performed for each assay. Using full-length ERα as a bait in yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated from human mammary gland cDNA library a partial cDNA encoding PRMT2 (amino acids 10–433). To examine the influence of estrogen on the interaction, pACT2-PRMT2, which was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening and expressed as fusion protein between GAL4 activation domain and PRMT2 (amino acods 10–433), or pACT2 was cotransformed with PGBKT7-ERα expressing fusion protein between GAL4 DNA binding domain and ERα or PGBTKT7 into yeast HF7C. The β-galactosidase activity was measured as an indication of the relative strength of interaction in the presence or absence of ligand. In the absence of ligand, we observed an interaction between ERα and PRMT2 that resulted in a ∼40-fold increase in the β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). The presence of the ligand estrogen did not significantly affect the interaction between PRMT2 and ERα (Fig. 1). The direct interaction between PRMT2 and ERα was further tested by in vitro GST binding assay. The immobilized GST-PRMT2, but not GST alone, retained [35S]methionine-labeled ERα both in the presence and absence of estrogen (Fig. 2). Moreover, PRMT2 also showed the ligand-independent interaction with ERβ, PR, TRβ, RARα, PPARγ, and RXRα (Fig. 2). To determine which region of ERα binds to PRMT2, a GST pull-down assay was performed using fusion proteins between GST and different regions of ERα. As shown in Fig.3 A, PRMT2 bound to the AF1 region, DNA binding domain, and hormone binding domain but not to the hinge region. The binding to ERα hormone binding domain was ligand-independent. The interaction between PRMT2 and ERα AF-1 region or DNA binding domain is stronger than that between PRMT2 and ERα hormone binding domain. PRMT2 contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that binds to proteins with a proline-rich motif and plays a pivotal role in a wide variety of biological processes (38Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A GST pull-down assay revealed that PRMT2 with a SH3 domain deletion was still able to bind to the GST-ERα fusion protein but not GST alone. Therefore, this domain is not considered necessary for PRMT2 and ERα interaction (Fig.3 B). The region of PRMT2 that interacts with ERα was further defined by GST pull-down assay using different truncated PRMT2 fragments. A fragment from amino acid 133 to 275 was found to interact with ERα (Fig. 3 C). The potential interaction between PRMT2 and ERα in the intact cell was examined by coexpressing ERα and FLAG-tagged PRMT2 in COS-7 cells followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.4, PRMT2 interacts with ERα both in the presence and absence of estrogen. The potential interaction between PRMT2 and other known nuclear receptor coactivators was investigated using the GST pull-down assay. We detected the interaction of PRMT2 with PRIP and SRC-1 (Fig.5). No interaction was observed between PRMT2 and PBP or PRMT2 and CBP (Fig. 5). The methyltransferase PRMT1 is able to form homodimer or homooligomers (39Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 40Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Scoriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). A GST pull-down assay was performed to see if PRMT2 exhibits this property. GST and PRMT2 fusion protein but not GST alone retained [S35]methionine-labeled PRMT2 suggesting that PRMT2 is capable of forming homodimer or homooligomers (Fig.6) PRMT2 was initially isolated by its protein sequence similarity to other PRMTs and so far no methyltransferase activity has been revealed. Using bacterially expressed GST-PRMT2 fusion protein, we did not demonstrate that PRMT2 was capable of methylating histone and ERα (data not shown). We then tested the ability of PRMT2 to bind the methyl donorS-adenosylmethionine by a filter binding assay. Just like PRMT1, PRMT2 was found to be able to bindS-adenosylmethionine, whereas PRMT2 with point mutation in the S-adenosylmethionine binding motif (41McBride A.E. Weiss V.H. Kim H.K. Hogle J.M. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) failed to bindS-adenosylmethionine (Fig.7). Having established that PRMT2 is an ERα-binding protein, we investigated the effect of increased levels of PRMT2 upon ERα transcriptional activity in CV-1 cells. The luciferase activity expressed from ERE-TK-LUC that contains one copy of ERE serves as the indicator of the ERα transcriptional activity. Expression of PRMT2 increased the estrogen-dependent transcription of luciferase gene by about 8-fold with minimal effort on basal transcription, which provided evidence that PRMT2 acts as a coactivator for ERα (Fig. 8). However, the mutated PRMT2 that was incapable of bindingS-adenosylmethionine enhanced the ERα transcriptional activity by about 2.5-fold, which is much less than the 8-fold obtained with wild-type PRMT2 indicating the importance of the potential methyltransferase activity for the role of PRMT2 as a coactivator (Fig.8). On the other hand, PRMT2 with deletion of the SH3 domain increased ERα activity to the same extent as that for wild-type PRMT2, indicating that the SH3 domain is dispensable for its coactivator function (Fig. 8). As ERα contains the autonomous activation domain AF-1 and ligand-dependent activation domain AF-2, we further examined the effect of increased expression of PRMT2 on their individual activities. The AF-1 (1–184) and AF-2 (251–595) were fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, respectively, and then cotransfected with GAL4 responsive element-directed luciferase as the reporter gene. In comparison with the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone, AF-1 increased the luciferase activity by about 3-fold. The expression of PRMT2 further increased AF-1-mediated luciferase expression by about 4.5-fold (Fig.9 A). Therefore, PRMT2 is able to enhance the ERα AF-1 activity. Just as other nuclear receptors show transcription repression in the absence of their corresponding ligands, the hormone-dependent AF-2 slightly decreased the luciferase activity without estrogen over the control. The addition of estrogen increased the AF-2-mediated luciferase expression by about 3-fold, which is further enhanced by coexpression of PRMT2 by about 5-fold, demonstrating that PRMT2 also potentiates the AF-2 activity (Fig. 9 B). Given that PRMT2 binds to SRC-1 and PRIP, we sought to determine whether there was synergistic enhancement of ERα activity by PRMT2 and SRC-1 or PRIP. In transient transfection assay with ERα and its reporter gene, PRMT2, SRC-1, and PRIP all enhanced the expression of reporter gene to different levels (Fig.10). When PRMT2 was cotransfected with either SRC-1 or PRIP, the expression of the reporter gene luciferase was modestly decreased in comparison with PRMT2 alone (Fig. 10). Therefore, there appears no synergistic activation when PRMT2 are coexpressed with either PRIP or SRC-1. To investigate whether PRMT2 acts as a coactivator for other nuclear receptors, transient transfection assays were performed with PR, PPARγ, and RARα responsive element-directed luciferase gene. PRMT2 enhanced the PR ligand-dependent transcriptional activity by about 8-fold. In comparison with ERα and PR, PRMT2, which also increased the ligand-dependent PPARγ and RARα transactivation by about 5- and 4.5-fold, respectively, showed less effect on PPARγ and RARα transactivation (Fig. 11). In an effort to define the mechanism by which PRMT2 acts as a coactivator, we tested if PRMT2 contains intrinsic transcriptional activity similar to that reported with other coactivators such as SRC-1 (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). PRMT2 was linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and transfected into CV-1 cells along with GAL4 responsive element-directed reporter gene luciferase. In comparison with GAL4 DNA binding domain alone, GAL4-PRMT2 fusion protein produced no additional activity whereas GAL4-SRC-1 fusion protein increased the luciferase activity by about 7-fold and served as a positive control (Fig. 12). Therefore, PRMT2 does not have intrinsic transcriptional activity. Using a yeast two-hybrid system with ERα as bait to screen a human mammary gland cDNA library, we isolated PRMT2 as a new ERα-interacting protein. The interaction between PRMT2 and ERα was confirmed by in vitro binding and in vivoimmunoprecipitation assay. A transient transfection assay demonstrated that PRMT2 increased the ERα transcriptional activity. In agreement with the finding that PRMT2 bound to both ERα AF-1 domain and the hormone binding domain, PRMT2 enhanced both ERα AF-1 and AF-2-mediated transactivation. These results established that PRMT2 is a coactivator of ERα. However, unlike other coactivators such as SRC-1 family and CBP that show ligand-dependent binding to the nuclear receptors, PRMT2 binds to ERα both in the presence and absence of estrogen but enhances the ERα activity only with the estrogen. It appears that the interaction between ERα and PRMT2 is not enough for ERα transcriptional activation, which occurs only after the binding of estrogen resulting in most probably the recruitment of other ligand-dependent coactivators. Two types of PRMT activities have been identified in mammalian cells (31McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Type 1 PRMT enzymes including PRMT1, PRMT3, and CARM1 catalyze the formation of monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine. Type 2 PRMT enzymes catalyze the formation of monomethylarginine and symmetric dimethylarginine. PRMT5/JBP1 is the only type II enzyme identified so far (43Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z.H. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Based on the protein sequence, PRMT2 was identified as a methyltransferase most probably belonging to type I enzyme, but so far its methyltranferase activity has not been identified (37Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Sliver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated PRMT2 is capable of bindingS-adenosylmethionine, we failed to detect any methyltransferase activity using bacterially expressed GST-PRMT2 fusion protein with substrates including histone and ERα (data not shown). A systematic approach to identify the substrates for PRMT2 will be required, and it is also possible that some modification such as phosphorylation or some cofactor may be required for its activity. Nevertheless, the mutation in the conserved PRMT2 binding site forS-adenosylmethionine, which would abolish the potential methyltransferase activity, substantially diminished the PRMT2 coactivator function. The finding that PRMT2 does not have any intrinsic transcriptional activity favors the hypothesis that PRMT2 acts by modifying chromatin structure or the transcriptional apparatus through methylation. The elucidation of the substrates will be crucial for the understanding of PRMT2 coactivator function. PRMT1 and CARM1 are two arginine methyltransferases that have been found to participate in the nuclear receptor transcriptional activation. Both PRMT1 and CARM1 interact with the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of coactivator GRIP1 and are able to methylate histones H4 and H3, respectively. PRMT1 or CARM1 enhance the nuclear receptor activity mildly by itself but substantially when coexpressed with GRIP1, suggesting that PRMT1 and CARM1 act as the secondary coactivators that are recruited by the first coactivator to modify the chromatin structure. Instead, PRMT2 strongly enhances the ERα transcriptional activity by direct interaction with ERα. Although PRMT2 was found to interact with other coactivators SRC-1 and PRIP, no synergistic activation was found with coexpression of PRMT2 and PRIP or SRC-1. The coexpression of SRC-1 or PRIP even modestly decreased PRMT2 coactivation. Therefore, although PRMT2 is a protein arginine methyltransferase highly homologous to PRMT1 and CARM1, PRMT2 may have a very different mechanism by which it acts as a coactivator, possibly because it has different substrates involved in transcriptional activation.

DSBs can be repaired through homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) to ensure the maintenance of genome integrity in eukaryotic organisms (8Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More significantly, deficiencies in the mammalian NHEJ pathway can lead to an increase in the frequency of chromosomal translocations and the rate of neoplastic transformation (9Roth D.B. Gellert M.

BRCA1 binds to the Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 complex and can form radiation-induced foci with this complex (14Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The yeast counterpart of this complex, Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2, is required for both NHEJ and HR (15Tsukamoto Y. Ikeda H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has been implicated in homology-based recombination repair (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In the study described by Moynahan et al. (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), a reporter substrate containing two differentially mutated neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) placed in tandem, with one harboring an I-SceI cleavage site, was integrated into the genome of both wild-type or Brca1 exon 11 deleted embryonic stem (ES) cells. Upon expression of the I-SceI endonuclease, ES cells containing the Brca1 exon 11 deleted mutant, but not wild-type Brca1, showed a deficiency in intra- and interchromosomal recombination (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these Brca1 mutant cells showed a slight increase in nonhomologous repair processes characterized by nucleotide deletion or addition (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). However, neither precise end joining, which may account for nearly 60% of the end-joining events in the I-SceI-inducible DNA DSB repair (17Lin Y. Lukacsovich T. Waldman A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8353-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), nor a microhomology-mediated end-joining activity that may recover a functional neo gene independent of gene conversion was taken into consideration in this assay system (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is likely that repair by HR contributes much more than NHEJ in ES cells because of their relatively short cell cycle duration (18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential role of BRCA1 in NHEJ may not be revealed by this reported assay system (16Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 cells, a much slower rate and less extensive amount of DSB repair, as measured by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) at 6 h after ionizing irradiation, has been observed as compared with the same cells expressing wild-type BRCA1 protein (19Scully R. Ganesan S. Vlasakova K. Chen J. Socolovsky M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1093-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The altered kinetics of the PFGE assay primarily reflects the inefficiency of chromosomal break rejoining, which is commonly observed in mutant cells deficient in NHEJ mutant but not in HR (20Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This finding, albeit circumstantial, suggests that BRCA1 may participate in NHEJ. To address the potential role of BRCA1 in NHEJ, we utilized three independent in vivo approaches demonstrating that BRCA1 promotes NHEJ mediated by microhomology. Transfection of a linearized plasmid in which expression of the reporter gene required precise end joining indicated that Brca1−/− MEFs display a moderate deficiency when compared withBrca1+/+ MEFs. Further, Brca1 promotes efficient retroviral infection, which depends on an intact NHEJ pathway. Most importantly, Brca1-deficient MEFs exhibit severely impaired end-joining activity mediated by microhomology in response to I-SceI restriction endonuclease induced chromosomal double-stranded DNA break. These results support a role for Brca1 in NHEJ and provide a biochemical basis for the caretaker function of BRCA1 in the maintenance of genome integrity. To prepareBrca1−/− :p53−/− andp53−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs),Brca1+/− mice derived from a Brca1-ko(o)3 targeted ES clone (21Liu C.Y. Flesken-Nikitin A. Li S. Zeng Y.Y. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were crossed withp53−/− mice (Jackson Laboratory). Brca1-ko(o)3 contained a neo cassette in the opposite orientation within Brca1 exon 11. The resultant F1 Brca1+/− :p53−/− mice were then crossed with each other, and embryos about 9.5 days old were used to prepare MEFs as described (22Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Primers for genotyping Brca1 were as described (21Liu C.Y. Flesken-Nikitin A. Li S. Zeng Y.Y. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In short, a 236-bp PCR product was the diagnostic indicator of the targeted Brca1 allele, and a 150-bp product was diagnostic of the wild-type allele. For the targeted p53 allele, a 140-bp PCR product was generated using a sense oligonucleotide, 5′-AGTTCGAGGCCATCTCTGACTACAC-3′ and an antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGTGCTCTAGTAGCTTTACGGAGC-3′, within the PolII promoter. A 320-bp PCR product was diagnostic of the wild-type allele using the same sense oligonucleotide and an antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GAGGGGAGGAGAGTACTGGAAGAGA-3′, within exon 5 of thep53 gene (23Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Brca1−/− :p53−/− and p53−/− MEFs were seeded in identical plates at 4000 cells/6-cm dish in regular medium for 24 h. Cells were then irradiated with 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 grays using a Mark I, model 68A, irradiator. After 14 days, the colonies were fixed and stained with 2% methylene blue in 50% ethanol and then counted. pPGK3XNLS-I-SceI was kindly provided by P. Berg and G. Donoho (Stanford University). The entire I-SceI DNA fragment was digested with SalI and PstI and cloned into the pBluescript vector, referred to as pBSK-I-SceI. This plasmid was then digested withNotI and XhoI to release I-SceI and inserted into the AdTrack.CMV plasmid (a gift from B. Vogelstein) (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) to form the AdTrack-CMV-I-SceI plasmid. The adenovirus was then produced following the protocol as described (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Mouse Brca1 cDNA-encoded amino acids 788–1135 was translationally fused to glutathione S-transferase in-frame, and the bacterially generated fusion protein derived from this construct was used as an antigen for producing mouse polyclonal antisera. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (14Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). pGL2 plasmid (Promega) was completely linearized by restriction endonuclease HindIII or EcoRI and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The linearized DNA was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in sterilized water. DNA was then transfected into cells with Fugene 6 following the procedures described by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity as described (22Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). MEFs were plated at 5 × 105/10-cm dish and infected with a 477H recombinant retrovirus carrying a hygromycin resistance gene for 24 h (25Chen P.L. Chen Y.M. Bookstein R. Lee W.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The infected cells were then selected by hygromycin (200 μg/ml) for 10–14 days. The resulting hygromycin-resistant colonies were counted on three plates for each infection titer, and the experiments were repeated three times. pBSK-S1hygro was constructed by inserting an endonuclease I-SceI recognition sequence into the unique NcoI site of pBSK-PGKhygro as described below. The NcoI site was filled in using Klenow fragment and ligated with an 18-bp I-SceI recognition sequence of 5′-CATGATTACCCTGTTTATCCCTA-3′. A DNA cassette containing puromycin resistance gene driven by the SV40 T antigen promoter was then inserted into pBSK-S1hygro. The entire S1hygro with puromycin gene was propagated as a plasmid, and the plasmid DNA was then transfected into MEFs followed by a selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cell clones that contained one to two copies ofS1hygro identified by genomic DNA blotting analysis were selected for further experiments. The entire S1hygro with puromycin gene was released and inserted into an engineered murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-based retroviral vector. TheS1hygro virus, produced by transfecting the constructed viral vector DNA into Phoenix Ampho packaging cells as described (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), was used to infect MEFs. MEF clones grown out from the selection of puromycin (2 μg/ml) and containing a single copy of proviral DNA of S1hygro substrate were used for the end-joining experiments. MEF clones containing a single copy of S1hygro substrate were transfected with pPGK3Xnls-I-SceI or infected with I-SceI adenovirus to express I-SceI endonuclease that cleaves the I-SceI site at the proviral hygromycin DNA. The cells were subsequently selected in medium with hygromycin (200 μg/ml) for 14 days, and the hygromycin-resistant colonies were counted. To examine whether these resistant colonies arose from the microhomology-mediated end-joining repair, genomic DNA was extracted for PCR analysis using the primers hygro-4 (5′-CCTGCGGGTAAATAGCTGCGCCGATG-3′) and hygro-5 (5′-CATACAAGC CAACCACGGCCTCCAG-3′) within the hygromycin resistance gene to generate a 595-bp DNA fragment that included the original inactivatedNcoI and I-SceI sites. Recovery of theNcoI site by microhomology-mediated end joining was indicated by the cleavage of the 595-bp fragment into a 379- and a 216-bp fragment following NcoI restriction enzyme digestion. Previously, mice carrying a mutated Brca1allele with a small 5′ portion of exon 11 replaced by a neomycin gene were generated and shown to be viable (21Liu C.Y. Flesken-Nikitin A. Li S. Zeng Y.Y. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, mice with both alleles mutated were embryonic lethal at postnatal days 5–7 (22Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This phenotype was much more severe when compared with mice carrying both alleles of Brca1 deleted for exon 11, which displayed an extended embryonic life span (4Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MEFs derived from our Brca1 knock-out mouse may be useful in exploring the full function of the Brca1 gene. Because the mutant Brca1 embryos died too early to generate MEFs, survival ofBrca1−/− mutant embryos could be extended with the ablation of the p53 gene (4Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 29Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Potter J. Mak T.W. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). MEFs with Brca1−/− :p53−/− orp53−/− genotype were then established from E9.5 embryos (Fig. 1 A) derived from a cross ofBrca1+/− :p53−/− mice (21Liu C.Y. Flesken-Nikitin A. Li S. Zeng Y.Y. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Protein analysis by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting revealed no full-length BRCA1 protein in theseBrca1−/− :p53−/− MEFs (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, the Brca1-deficient MEFs exhibited hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation when compared with thep53−/− MEFs (Fig. 1 C). The degree of γ-irradiation sensitivity of thisBrca1−/− :p53−/− MEF is greater than mouse embryonic stem cells or MEFs carrying a Brca1 exon 11 spliced variant (5Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 6Cressman V.L. Backlund D.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Leadon S.A. Godfrey V. Koller B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7061-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine the potential contribution of Brca1 in DSB repair, the established Brca1-deficient MEFs were used in a plasmid end-joining assay utilizing transient transfection of a linearized pGL2 plasmid harboring a luciferase reporter gene. If the reporter plasmid was linearized with restriction endonuclease HindIII, which cleaved at the linker region between promoter and coding sequence, any end-joining activity with small deletion or insertion would not affect the expression of the luciferase gene and could be considered an overall end-joining activity. However, if the reporter plasmid was digested with EcoRI at the luciferase coding region, only precise end joining would restore the original sequence (Fig.2). Repair efficiency was calculated from the luciferase activities of linearized reporter constructs compared with that of the intact plasmid. We observed no difference in the overall end-joining activity between theBrca1−/−:p53−/− andp53−/− MEFs, but Brca1-deficient MEFs exhibited about a 50% reduction in precise end-joining activity (Fig.2). It has been reported that cells deficient in proteins involved in NHEJ show a reduced efficiency of retroviral infection (30Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,31Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E. Mitchell R.S. Butler S.L. Lieber M. Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that NHEJ is critical for the resolution of DNA DSBs that arise during retroviral infection. The first report suggested that NHEJ is required for retroviral DNA integration that proceeds through the repair of gapped intermediates arising from the linkage of viral and host cell DNA in an early reaction catalyzed by the viral integrase protein. The repair of gapped intermediates, which consist of nonjoined viral DNA 5′ ends, results in a 4–6-base pair repeat of host cell DNA flanking each proviral end (30Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The second report demonstrated that cells with mutated NHEJ proteins suffer a high level of cell death upon retroviral infection (31Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E. Mitchell R.S. Butler S.L. Lieber M. Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and proposed that, instead of being involved in an early step of retroviral integration, the NHEJ proteins are required to circularize the linear viral DNA to conceal the exposed DSBs to prevent subsequent apoptosis (31Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E. Mitchell R.S. Butler S.L. Lieber M. Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In either case, NHEJ appears to be essential for retroviral infection. Based on these findings, we decided to examine the efficiency of retroviral infection in the Brca1 deficient cells. Following infection with a retrovirus, 477H, carrying a hygromycin resistance gene (Hygro r), the frequency of hygromycin-resistant colonies was found to be 5–10-fold lower in the Brca1−/− :p53−/− MEFs as compared with the matchedBrca1+/+ :p53−/− MEFs (Fig 3, A and B). Similarly, a 3–5-fold reduction in the number of hygromycin-resistant colonies was also observed in infectedKu80−/− :p53−/− MEFs (13Lim D.S. Vogel H. Willerford D.M. Sands A.T. Platt K.A. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3772-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as compared withKu80+/− :p53−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the notion that DNA end-joining activity is significantly reduced in Brca1-deficient cells. In an attempt to further substantiate the contribution of Brca1 in NHEJ, we modified a DSB repair assay system (32Liang F. Romanienko P.J. Weaver D.T. Jeggo P.A. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8929-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that permitted us to measure the frequency of NHEJ at a defined chromosomal DSB. For this purpose, we established p53−/− and Brca1 −/− :p53−/− MEF cell lines that carried a single integrated copy of a defined DSB repair substrate. This substrate, S1hygro, contained one copy of the hygromycin resistance gene (Hygro r ) carrying an 18-base pair recognition sequence for the rare cutting restriction endonuclease I-SceI inserted into a naturally occurringNcoI site (Fig. 4), therefore leaving 4 bp of CATG microhomologies (residual NcoI site) flanking the I-SceI site (Fig. 4 A). This modification resulted in the inactivation of the hygromycin resistance gene. However, upon I-SceI endonuclease cleavage, hygromycin-resistant activity could be restored, if this defined DSB was resected to a point at which the CATG microhomologies could be detected, and rejoined to restore the NcoI site, thereby generating an intact hygromycin resistance gene (Fig. 4 A). The original sequence was unlikely to be restored by homologous recombination due to the absence of homologous sequence. Importantly, this type of NHEJ repair promoted by an I-SceI-induced DSB at the S1hygro gene could be assayed by selecting for hygromycin-resistant cell clones and physically analyzing the repair products by genomic DNA blotting or by direct PCR followed by digestion with NcoI endonuclease. Using a similar system, the Ku80 protein has been demonstrated to be crucial for NHEJ of a defined chromosomal DSBin vivo (32Liang F. Romanienko P.J. Weaver D.T. Jeggo P.A. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8929-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The S1hygro DSB repair substrate containing a puromycin selection cassette was stably integrated into the genome of wild-type,p53−/− , andBrca1−/− :p53−/− MEFs by either plasmid transfection or retroviral infection. Puromycin-resistant clones were selected and analyzed by Southern blotting and PCR. MEF clones containing a single copy ofS1hygro were chosen for the chromosomal DSB-promoted NHEJ repair assay as described above. To generate DSBs, I-SceI endonuclease was introduced by transfection of an I-SceI expression vector (33Donoho G. Jasin M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4070-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) into the MEFs. In the mock transfection experiment, few or no hygromycin-resistant colonies were obtained following a selection against hygromycin. However, expression of the I-SceI endonuclease in either the wild-type or thep53−/− MEFs produced numerous hygromycin-resistant colonies (Fig. 4 B and TableI), indicating that I-SceI cleavage occurred at the S1hygro substrate and hygromycin resistance arose almost exclusively from the repair of the I-SceI-cleaved substrates. These results demonstrate that a defined chromosomal DSB can stimulate NHEJ as much as 100-fold above the spontaneous level.Table IBrca1 promotes NHEJ of Chromosomal DSBsCell lineNo. of Hygror colonies1-a1–2 copies of S1hygro were introduced into the cells by plasmid transfection.GenotypeMock-transfectedI-SceIWT-1Wild type1 ± 150 ± 3p53-3p53 −/− Brca1 +/+<186 ± 19p53-4p53 −/− Brca1 +/+<190 ± 161H-5p53 −/− Brca1 −/−<1<1Number of Hygror colonies1-bSingle copies of S1hygro were introduced into the cells by retroviral DNA integration.GenotypeMock-transfectedI-SceIRP-3p53 −/− Brca1 +/+<145 ± 17RP-4p53 −/− Brca1 +/+<182 ± 41RP-6p53 −/− Brca1 +/+<145 ± 15RH-1p53 −/− Brca1 −/−<1<1RH-3p53 −/− Brca1 −/−<11 ± 1RH-6p53 −/− Brca1 −/−<1<11 × 106 cells were used in each assay.1-a 1–2 copies of S1hygro were introduced into the cells by plasmid transfection.1-b Single copies of S1hygro were introduced into the cells by retroviral DNA integration. Open table in a new tab 1 × 106 cells were used in each assay. Expression of I-SceI in either wild-type orp53−/− MEFs yielded 45–82 hygromycin-resistant colonies/106 cells (4.5 × 10−5-8.2 × 10−5). By contrast, only background levels of hygromycin-resistant colonies were obtained after transfection of I-SceI in Brca1−/− :p53−/− MEFs (Table I). The transfection efficiency of the parental Brca1−/− :p53−/− MEF was 2-fold lower than Brca1 wild-type cells. However, each individual clone harboring S1hygro had a varied transfection efficiency of between 2-fold lower (RH3) to 3-fold higher (RH1) when compared with the clones derived from Brca+/+ :p53−/− MEF (RP3 and RP4), as measured by a transient transfection assay with a SV40 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (data not shown). Only background levels of hygromycin-resistant colonies were formed in a Brca1−/− :p53−/− MEF clone (RH1) despite its highest transfection efficiency. Therefore, mutation ofBrca1 decreased the formation of hygromycin-resistant colonies by 1–2 orders of magnitude. The repair of DSBs by NHEJ in the hygromycin-resistant clones would be expected to restore the naturally occurring NcoI restriction site, which was destroyed by the insertion of the 18-bp I-SceI recognition site during construction of theS1hygro substrate. To verify that the hygromycin-resistant colonies derived from I-SceI-induced DSB repair did in fact arise from NHEJ, a 595-bp DNA fragment of the hygromycin resistance gene encompassing the inactivated NcoI and I-SceI restriction sites was amplified by PCR and subjected to NcoI restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 4 C). Nine of 10 PCR products generated from the hygromycin-resistant colonies were completely cleaved by NcoI but were resistant to I-SceI digestion. In contrast, PCR products derived from parental clones harboring S1hygro were readily cleaved by I-SceI but not by NcoI (Fig. 4 D). These results indicated that cleavage followed by end processing must have occurred in these cells to restore the NcoI site. To ensure a high level of I-SceI expression, an adenovirus, AdTrack-CMV-I-SceI, encoding I-SceI and GFP under two distinct promoters was generated (Fig.5 A). We then tested this adenovirus over a series of m.o.i. by tracing the fluorescence derived from GFP to monitor the infection efficiency. As shown in Fig.5 B, the expression of GFP in Brca1 mutant or wild-type MEFs was comparable following the infection of AdTrack-CMV-I-SceI in the range of m.o.i. used, suggesting that there was no significant difference between these two MEFs in terms of adenovirus infection and expression. We observed that the hygromycin-resistant colonies increased in proportion to the amount of m.o.i. infected inBrca1+/+ :p53−/− MEFs compared with Brca1−/− :p53−/− MEFs, which remained negligible regardless of the high m.o.i. used (Fig.5 C). Taken together, these results suggested that the Brca1 mutant cells exhibited a severe defect in the repair of DSBs by microhomology-mediated NHEJ. To establish that the above described microhomology-mediated end joining preceded independent of drug selection, we examined the repair process of the S1hygro substrate in these MEFs upon expression of the I-SceI endonuclease at earlier time points. TheseBrca1+/+ :p53−/− andBrca1 −/− :p53−/− MEFs were infected with different m.o.i. levels of the adenovirus, AdTrack-CMV-I-SceI, for 36 h. To demonstrate that I-SceI endonuclease was expressed efficiently in both cell types, the genomic DNA of these cells was extracted, and the 595-bp hygromycin DNA fragment was amplified by PCR. The resistance of the 595-bp hygromycin DNA fragment to I-SceI digestion indicates that a NHEJ must occur after I-SceI cleavage. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the I-SceI-resistant fragment appeared in both Brca1-proficient and -deficient MEFs with very similar kinetics. This result also suggested that a deficiency of Brca1 did not affect the overall NHEJ activity. If NHEJ was to proceed through the designed CATG microhomology, the resulting repair product could be cleaved by theNcoI restriction enzyme as described above (Fig.6 A). Consistent with our previous observation, a portion of the NHEJ proceeded through the CATG microhomology, thereby restoring the original NcoI site in the Brca1 wild-type cells. Therefore, the 595-bp hygromycin DNA fragment derived from genomic PCR could be cleaved by NcoI into two fragments, as either directly revealed by ethidium bromide staining (Fig.6 C) or by DNA blotting using the cDNA of the hygromycin resistance gene as a probe (Fig. 6 D). This type of NHEJ activity was readily detectable in the Brca1-proficient MEFs but not in Brca1-deficient cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that Brca1 plays an important role in microhomology-mediated end-joining activity in the repair of DNA DSBsin vivo. BRCA1 plays an essential role in DNA DSB repair either through HR or NHEJ. The results described above suggest that Brca1 may have an important role in NHEJ. Using a plasmid end-joining assay, it was shown that Brca1 plays a moderate role in precise end joining rather than in overall NHEJ. Brca1 was also found to promote efficient retroviral infection, likely reflecting a role in retroviral DNA end-joining activity. Furthermore, repair of a defined chromosomal DSB mediated by microhomology annealing is severely impaired in Brca1-deficient MEFs. Taken together, these observations suggest that BRCA1 has a critical role in microhomology-mediated end joining rather than in overall nonhomologous end-joining activity. These results are consistent with the recent observation that cell extracts derived from Brca1-deficient MEFs significantly reduced end-joining activity with 4-bp homology in vitro (34Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Mechanistically speaking, NHEJ can proceed through distinct subpathways determined by the nucleotide sequence immediately surrounding the break site. Often, NHEJ generates junctions with sequence homologies consisting of only a few nucleotides. DNA ends can be joined either precisely, without nucleotide loss through sequence homology at the DNA termini, or imprecisely, through nucleotide deletion or addition, to generate microhomologies flanking the break site. Alternatively, broken DNA ends can be joined without microhomology (15Tsukamoto Y. Ikeda H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In an assay for gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), the rate of non-homology-mediated GCRs was increased ∼600-fold in yeastrad50, mre11, and xrs2 mutants (35Chen C. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 81-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex appears to be important in suppressing non-homology-mediated end-joining processes. Previous work has demonstrated that BRCA1 physically interacts with the Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 complex in vivo and in vitro(14Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BRCA1 can be isolated from cells in a high molecular complex with Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 (36Chiba N. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38549-38554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the function of BRCA1 in DSB repair is mediated, at least in part, through its association with the Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 complex (Fig.7 A), although the possibility exists that BRCA1 functions through other associated repair component such as FANCD2 (37Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 38Lundberg R. Mavinakere M. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The function of the mammalian Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 complex in DSB repair is not entirely known at present. However, substantial evidence has suggested a functional conservation between the mammalian Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 and yeast Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 in NHEJ. It has been shown that the yeast Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 purified complex can bind and bridge DNA ends together. The addition of the yeast homologues of Ku70/80, HdfA and HdfB, enhances this DNA end-bridging activity of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex. The DNA-bound Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex can then directly recruit Dnl4/Lif1 (equivalent to mammalian DNA ligase IV and Xrcc4) to complete the DNA end ligation process (40Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Similarly, mammalian Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1 has also been to exhibit DNA end-tethering activity (39Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41Huang J. Dynan W.S.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Therefore, purified proteins that include Rad50·Mre11·Nbs1, Ku homologues, and DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 can carry out NHEJ in vitro. These results implicate a potential conservation of these two complexes in nonhomologous end joining. The NHEJ pathway represents an efficient, energy-saving process to rescue cells following extensive DNA damage. NHEJ can be error-prone in mammalian cells. However, NHEJ may utilize microhomology sequences to minimize error rates. If complimentary sequences are left at the DNA termini, these DNA termini can be joined readily without nucleotide loss by annealing the complementary sequences. Experimental evidence has suggested that this type of error-free NHEJ could represent up to 60% of overall end joining in mammalian cells (17Lin Y. Lukacsovich T. Waldman A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8353-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and more than 90% in yeast when a cohesive overhang is present at the DNA termini (15Tsukamoto Y. Ikeda H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, microhomology sequences may serve as a platform for stabilizing protein-DNA interactions, attenuating nuclease attack, recruiting other repair factors, and bridging DNA ends together (Fig.7 B). BRCA1 has been shown to associate with this type of DNA structure in vitro, suggesting that BRCA1 may participate in this process (38Lundberg R. Mavinakere M. Campbell C. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that in the presence of multiple chromosomal breaks, homology-directed translocation can be observed at a frequency as high as that of conservative gene conversion (45Richardson C.

The timing for this complex to function in either pathway may be dependent on the cell cycle status, at which the availability of the other repair factors of these two pathways is critical. Inefficient or error-prone DNA repair resulting directly from mutational inactivation of BRCA1 can lead to global genomic instability and a concomitant accrual of functionally inactivating mutations at genetic loci involved in breast tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2089185704,"The human kidneys filter 70 liters of blood plasma every day. The hallmark of almost all kidney diseases, whether acquired or genetic, is the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine because of alterations in the glomerular filtration unit of the kidney. In this regard, the human mutations in nephrin, podocin, α-actinin-4, COL4A3, and COL4A5 genes expressed in the glomeruli have been implicated to cause alterations in glomerular filtration apparatus. Nevertheless, the expression of these proteins in relation to each other in mouse models for glomerular vascular leak is unknown. Additionally, within the glomerulus, the central question of whether the primary filtration barrier is the basement membrane or the epithelial slit diaphragm remains ambiguous. Therefore, in this study, we examined the localization and expression of glomerular epithelial slit diaphragm and glomerular basement membrane proteins implicated in glomerular vascular leak using mice deficient in either the α3 chain of type IV collagen, the major constituent of glomerular basement membrane, or LMX1B transcription factor, which regulates the expression of key glomerular type IV collagen genes COL4A3 and COL4A4 or nephrin, a glomerular epithelial slit diaphragm-associated protein. This study demonstrates that decreased expression of slit diaphragm protein, nephrin, correlates with a loss of glomerular filter integrity. Additionally, we demonstrate that defects induced by proteins of glomerular basement membrane lead to an insidious plasma protein leak, whereas the defects induced by proteins in the glomerular epithelial slit diaphragms lead to a precipitous plasma protein leak.

Rector Jr., F.C. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991: 2424Google Scholar). Despite the prevalent nature of a defect in plasma ultrafiltration, which is common to many kidney pathologies, a central question regarding molecular cues that initiate plasma protein leak (proteinuria or glomerular vascular leak) in these etiologically diverse diseases still remains unanswered. Every day, 70 liters of plasma is filtered by the 2.5 million renal glomeruli of the human kidneys (1Brenner B.M. Rector Jr., F.C. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991: 2424Google Scholar). The glomerular filtration barrier of the kidney is a tuft of capillaries composed of a defined 300-nm thick basement membrane, which is lined on one side by fenestrated endothelium (facing the blood side) and lined on the other side by a specialized epithelium (facing the urinary space side) with long and extensive foot processes that give these specialized glomerular epithelial cells the name “podocytes” (2Abrahamson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F783-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tracer experiments with ferritin have suggested that the fenestrated endothelium with a potential pore size of 500–1000-Å diameter is freely permeable to many large plasma proteins (3Anderson W.A. J.

Such studies have also implicated that the crucial barrier for plasma proteins larger than 70 kDa is maintained by the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)1 and the glomerular epithelial slit diaphragms (GESD) (4Farquhar M.G.

GBM has been implicated as an important component of the filtration apparatus (12Caulfield J.P. Farquhar M.G. J.

Studies with dextrans have collectively suggested that the structural integrity of the GBM is pivotal for the maintenance of a highly regulated barrier permeable only to water, small solutes/ions, and smaller proteins but not plasma proteins larger than 70 kDa (4Farquhar M.G.

GBM is composed of several large molecules such as type IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, perlecan, and nidogen (2Abrahamson D.R. Am. J.

These molecules assemble in an ordered fashion to provide a highly cross-linked insoluble compact structure with a net negative charge contributed predominantly by the proteoglycan moieties within the GBM (20Kanwar Y.S.

The importance of GBM was further validated when the human mutations in type IV collagen were identified as responsible for chronic renal injury associated with microhematuria and glomerular vascular leak (GVL) or proteinuria (21Barker D.F.

A different school of thought, which has been proposed for many years, includes a critical role of glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) in the regulation of glomerular permeability barrier (5Graham Jr., R.C.

A podocyte in the glomerulus can be divided into two different zones, a primary cell body and secondary processes, which constitute initial branching and again subsequent branchings (podocyte processes) that directly interact with the GBM (2Abrahamson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F783-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key component of the epithelial barrier has been suggested to include a modified adherens junction between the foot processes of the podocyte called GESD (4Farquhar M.G. Wissig S.L. Palade G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2645-2662PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rodewald R. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In 1974, Rodewald and Karnovsky (14Rodewald R. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) published a model of GESD based on electron microscopy studies. According to this study, the slit diaphragm is composed of rodlike structures connected to a central pole providing a zipper-like structure (14Rodewald R. Karnovsky M.J. J.

Mice deficient in nephrin and cd2ap exhibit kidney defects associated with GVL (31Shih N.Y., Li, J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S.

Nephrin, CD2AP, and podocin have all been shown to interact with each other, further implicating a potential complex of these proteins in the regulation of glomerular permselectivity features (36Schwarz K. Simons M. Reiser J. Saleem M.A. Faul C. Kriz W. Shaw A.S. Holzman L.B. Mundel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Whereas several recent discoveries have been made regarding the molecular constituents of GBM and GESD, the specific role of each of these molecules in the regulation of glomerular vascular permeability has not been addressed. The mouse Nphs1 genomic construct was cloned from a BAC library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) isolated by hybridization to a 1.3-kilobase human nephrin cDNA probe representing exons 1–10 of the human cDNA. The BAC contained the entire mouse Nphs1 gene including the promoter region, the entire transcribed region from the transcription initiation site, and the 5′-untranslated region through the coding region, the 3′-untranslated region, and polyadenylation signal sequence. Subclones were cloned and sequenced. KpnI-linearized pBluescript II with nephrin genomic sequence plasmid was used for the gene-targeting construct (Fig. 4). It had a “short” flank (0.95 kb) containing the mouse Nphs1 promoter and the beginning of exon 1 in a frame with GFP-pA/PGK-Neo-pA cassette (2.8 kb). This was followed by a “long” flank (5.0 kb), which consists of the rest of exon 1 through intron 11. In total, 34 bp surrounding theNphs1 ATG codon (from −1 to +33) were deleted and replaced with the GFP-pA/PGK-Neo-pA cassette. Adjacent to the “short” flank, a TK-DTA-pA cassette (1.2 kb) was inserted into a uniqueSacII site for negative selection in ES cells (Fig. 4). TheKpnI-linearized targeting vector was electroporated into 129/Sv-derived ES cells. The cells were selected in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen). 12 ES clones were positive by PCR using two pairs of primers, a sense primer of the Nphs1 gene (5′-CAC AAG GGA AGA TGG AGG AGT TG-3′) and an antisense primer of the Nphs1gene (5′-TCC ACT CAC CTG TGG TCA GCA TTC-3′) or an antisense primer of the GFP sequence (5′-AGT CGT GCT GCT TCA TGT GGT C-3′). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 40 s, 64 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2 min with 40 cycles. Three clones from positive pools were confirmed by Southern blot with a probe described in Fig. 4A. These clones were used for BALB/c or C57BL/6 blastocyst injections, and 11 chimeras were obtained. They were mated with normal 129/Sv mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), and three chimeras with satisfactory germline transmission were further evaluated. Three different lines ofnephrin-deficient mice on pure 129/Sv background were obtained by intercrossing the F1 heterozygotes independently for an individual line. The mice are genotyped according to the PCR described above. The excised kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Kidney samples were sectioned at 3-μm intervals, and three sections per slide were mounted. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Transmission electron microscopy was done as described previously (37Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Kotelianski V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence analysis, fresh kidneys were removed and embedded in OCT aqueous compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan). They were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 4-μm sections were obtained using HM 505N cryostat (Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). The slides were fixed in cold (−20 °C) 100% acetone for 3 min and then air-dried for 1 h. For COL4 stainings, cold 95% ethanol was used as fixative, and slides were denatured using 6.0 m urea and 0.1 mglycine, pH 3.5, at 50 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the slides were washed three times in 10 mm PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted using 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS, applied to the sections, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. The slides were then washed three times with 10 mmPBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted together at 1:100 in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS and applied for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with 10 mm PBS, Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, App Imaging, Santa Clara, CA) anti-fade mounting medium was applied, and sections were coverslipped and imaged. The staining was analyzed by Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For controls, normal rabbit and mouse sera were used in place of primary antibodies, or sections were directly incubated with secondary antibodies. The polyclonal anti-nephrin, podocin, P-cadherin, FAT, and α-actinin-4 antibodies were produced in the New Zealand White rabbits. The peptide sequences used as the antigens are as follows: nephrin, GPWDLHWPEDTYQDPRGI; podocin, SSSRESRGRGGRTPHKENK; P-cadherin, SDQDQDYDYLNEWGSR; FAT, YESGDDGHFEEVTIPPLDSQ; and α-actinin-4, YYDSHNVNTRCQKICDQWDNLGS. KLH-conjugated peptides in Freund's complete adjuvant were injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Taconic, Germantown, NY). The rabbits received an injection of 250 μg of purified antigen intraperitoneally and were boosted at 2-week intervals. Six weeks after the first immunization and three boosters, the animals were killed, blood was harvested, and serum was separated from the plasma. The specificity of the antisera was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence using human and mouse kidney sections, and Western blotting of mouse kidney extracts (data not shown). The polyclonal anti-CD2AP antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal anti-laminin α2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA).

From newbornnephrin +/+, +/−, and −/− mice, urine was collected and 4 μl of unconcentrated urine was loaded to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For Western blotting, the proteins were extracted from newborn kidneys of nephrin +/+, −/−, Lmx1b +/+, and −/− mice and from 8-week-old kidneys of α3 +/+ and −/− mice. They were homogenized with protease inhibitors in 10 mm PBS, suspended in 2% deoxycholate, and then stirred for 4 h at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed three times with ice-cold distilled water. The lysate was solubilized in the lysis buffer (0.05 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.01 mCaCl2, 4 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 25 mm ε-aminohexanoic acid), mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblots were blocked with 5% skim milk-containing TBST buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 140 mm NaCl). Western blotting was performed by incubating with the indicated antibodies in TBST buffer followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and then developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL kit, AmershamBiosciences). Type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane is predominantly composed of α3, α4, α5 chain isoforms (43Desjardins M. Bendayan M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Among them, the α3 chain is one of the most abundant protein constituent of the GBM proper and assembles with the other two α-chains to form higher ordered structures called protomers (44Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 45Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Protomers constitute the basic building unit of the GBM scaffold (46Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Human mutation in the α3 chain results in some cases of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, which is associated with microhematuria and GVL (22Lemmink H.H. Mochizuki T. van den Heuvel L.P.

Mice deficient in the protein, α3KO, develop chronic renal failure associated with proteinuria and die at approximately week 14 after birth (47Cosgrove D. Meehan D.T. Grunkemeyer J.A. Kornak J.M. Sayers R. Hunter W.J. Samuelson G.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2981-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The α3KO mice are normal until week 4 with the exception of sporadic ultrastructural defects in the GBM, a lack of α3 (the deleted gene), α4, and α5 chains of type IV collagen in the GBM, and alterations in the GBM laminin content (Fig.1, data not shown) (47Cosgrove D.

In this study, we demonstrate that up until week 4, the molecular make-up of the glomerular slit diaphragm is normal despite significant structural defects within the GBM as recorded by electron microscopy (Fig. 1). The normal expression of podocyte/slit diaphragm-associated proteins such as integrin α3β1, nephrin, podocin, α-actinin-4, CD2AP, synaptopodin, ZO-1, and P-cadherin are observed in the α3KO mice up until week 4 (Fig.2, data not shown) (26Kestila M.

Mesangial matrix associated proteins such as laminin α2 chain, which is known to translocate to the GBM during GVL, also maintains normal expression pattern at this stage (Fig. 2) (37Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Kotelianski V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J.

The inception of GVL starting week 5 in these mice is associated with slit diaphragm alterations, podocyte effacement, and a significant alteration in the expression of glomerular slit diaphragm-associated protein, nephrin (Fig. 2). The expression pattern of all of the other proteins tested was exactly as at week 4 prior to the inception of GVL (Fig. 2). Additionally, the expression of laminin α2, a mesangial matrix-associated protein, is now also expressed in the GBM as was reported previously for this model of GBM defect (Fig. 2) (37Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Kotelianski V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J.

In the LMX1B transcription factor-deficient mice (Lmx1b KO), the expression of α3 and α4 chains of type IV collagen is vastly diminished in the GBM because of the requirement of this transcription factor for binding to the adenine-thymine-rich FLAT sequence in the promoter region (Fig. 1) (50Morello R. Zhou G. Dreyer S.D. Harvey S.J. Ninomiya Y. Thorner P.S. Miner J.H. Cole W. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Oberg K.C. Lee B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to the α3KO with GBM defects, theLmx1b KO mice die immediately after birth associated with massive GVL. An analysis of GBM suggests ultrastructural defects and also a lack of slit diaphragms and podocyte effacement (51Chen H. Lun Y. Ovchinnikov D. Kokubo H. Oberg K.C. Pepicelli C.V. Gan L. Lee B. Johnson R.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A further examination of these KO mice in the present study demonstrated additional alterations in the expression of slit diaphragm associated proteins such as nephrin, CD2AP, and podocin (Fig.3). An evaluation of the promoter region within the genes of these proteins shows the presence of adenine-thymine-rich LMX1B binding site (data not shown). This finding suggests that along with α3 and α4 chains of type IV collagen, nephrin, CD2AP and podocin may also be subject to the transcriptional dysregulation in the Lmx1b KO mice (data not shown). GVL in these mice is associated with alteration in the GBM architecture and alteration in the expression of nephrin, CD2AP, podocin, and synaptopodin (Fig. 3). The laminin α2 transition from the mesangial matrix to the GBM was also observed in this model of GVL, consistent again with such transition in mice with primary GBM defects (Fig. 3). These experiments further suggest that the precipitous GVL observed in the Lmx1b KO mice may be associated with podocyte defects rather than the GBM defects, because the α3KO mice with a similar GBM defect do not develop GVL until 4 weeks after birth (Fig. 1and 2). To further delineate the contribution of the GESD and the GBM properly in the regulation of GVL, we generated anephrin-deficient mouse (nephrin KO). As previously reported for a similar knock-out mouse, our mice die at day 2 after birth, and the death is associated with massive GVL and an absence of GESD (Fig. 4) (35Putaala H. Soininen R. Kilpelainen P. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The GBM architecture is normal by electron microscopy, and the expression of several GBM proteins such as type IV collagen and laminins are normal (Fig. 1, data not shown). An analysis of several podocyte-specific proteins in the nephrin KO mice demonstrates that their expression is normal (Fig. 5). In addition, the expression of ZO-1, P-cadherin, and FAT in the podocyte is also normal (data not shown) (34Inoue T. Yaoita E. Kurihara H. Shimizu F. Sakai T. Kobayashi T. Ohshiro K. Kawachi H.

Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of nephrin in association with a lack of GESD is the only molecular defect that we can identify in the kidneys of nephrin KO mice (Fig. 5). Collectively, our results using three different genetic mouse models for GVL unequivocally suggest that podocyte and the GESD-associated protein, nephrin, constitutes the most critical determinant for proteins greater than 70 kDa during the glomerular plasma filtration. Although GBM is also an important component of the filtration apparatus, it definitely plays more of a passive role in the maintenance of vascular permeability in the kidney glomerulus. The debate over the importance of GBM and the GESD in the regulation of glomerular vascular permeability has spanned well over three decades now (4Farquhar M.G. Wissig S.L. Palade G.E. J. Am. Soc.

Physiol. 2001; 281: F579-FF96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that both structures may be important for maintaining a stringent barrier for plasma proteins larger than 70 kDa. This study provides compelling evidence of the GESD and nephrin as the primary regulators of glomerular vascular permeability. Studies with α3KO mice suggest that significant ultrastructural defects in the GBM along with molecular alteration within two of the most abundant proteins such as type IV collagen and laminin do not lead to a precipitous GVL. The primary defect in these KO mice leads to a gradual insidious GVL dependent on the eventual accumulation of defects in the GESD and podocyte architecture potentially mediated by nephrin (Fig. 2). The altered podocyte GBM interaction attributed to defective GBM might contribute to eventual nephrin dysregulation, but this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, these studies provide the first time proof for a secondary role for GBM in the regulation of GVL. In the experiments with Lmx1b KO mice, we provide further evidence for the slit diaphragm defects as responsible for precipitous GVL. Although these mice have overlapping GBM defects as observed in the α3KO, the additional defects in the GESD lead to a precipitous GVL immediately after birth, potentially leading to the death of these mice. Again, these experiments provide additional support for the notion that GESD constitute the pivotal barrier for plasma proteins greater than 70 kDa. The nephrin KO mice generated for this study provide the unequivocal evidence for the role of GESD and nephrin as the primary regulators of glomerular vascular permeability. In these KO mice, the expression of type IV collagen, laminin, nidogen, and perlecan is normal, and this is associated with the normal architecture of the GBM. The only ultrastructural defect observed in the kidney of these mice is the obvious absence of the glomerular slit diaphragm and podocyte effacement. An examination of the several different podocyte and GESD-associated proteins in the kidney of these KO mice reveals that nephrin deficiency does not lead to alterations in the expression of these various GBM and GESD proteins such as podocin, CD2AP, α-actinin-4, synaptopodin, integrin α3, and type IV collagen α3, α4, α5 chains (Figs. 1 and 5). These results lead to a strong suggestion that nephrin is a pivotal protein for the maintenance of normal GESD structure and in turn the proper function of the glomerular permeability barrier. Interestingly, GESD-mediated GVL resulting from primary defects in GBM leads to a transition of laminin α2 from the mesangial matrix (normal distribution) to the GBM (abnormal localization). Direct GESD defect does not lead to such transition, suggesting that the primary contribution of aberrant cell matrix alterations is because of GBM defects in laminin α2 transition. An evaluation of the functional consequence of such transition attributed to GBM defects needs further explanation. Thus, although GBM defects can lead to glomerular vascular leak in the kidney, the precipitous factor seems to involve a compromise of the GESD structure. How defects in the GBM lead to eventual GESD defects remains unanswered. Nevertheless, this study provides strong evidence for nephrin as a crucial determinant of glomerular vascular permeability.

https://openalex.org/W2168194237,"In contrast to animal lectins, no evidence has indicated the occurrence of plant lectins, which recognize and bind ""endogenous"" receptors and accordingly are involved in recognition mechanisms within the organism itself. Here we show that the plant hormone jasmonic acid methyl ester (JAME) induces in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum (var. Samsun NN) the expression of a lectin that is absent from untreated plants. The lectin specifically binds to oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine and is detected exclusively in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Both the subcellular location and specificity indicate that the Nicotiana tabacum agglutinin (called Nictaba) may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in stressed plants through specific protein-carbohydrate interactions with regulatory cytoplasmic/nuclear glycoproteins. Searches in the databases revealed that many flowering plants contain sequences encoding putative homologues of the tobacco lectin, which suggest that Nictaba is the prototype of a widespread or possibly ubiquitous family of lectins with a specific endogenous role."

This widely expressed enzyme constitutes an important repair mechanism for oxidatively damaged proteins, which accumulate during the manifestation of certain degenerative diseases and aging processes. In addition, it is discussed to be involved in regulatory processes. Here we address the question of how the enzyme's diverse functions are reflected in its subcellular localization. Using fusions of the human version of MSRA with the enhanced green fluorescence protein expressed in various mammalian cell lines, we show a distinct localization at mitochondria. The N-terminal 23 amino acid residues contain the signal for this mitochondrial targeting. Activity tests showed that they are not required for enzyme function. Mitochondrial localization of native MSRA in mouse and rat liver slices was verified with an MSRA-specific antibody by using immunohistochemical methods. The protein was located in the mitochondrial matrix, as demonstrated by using pre-embedding immunostaining and electron microscopy. Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, MSRA has to be considered an important means for the general reduction of ROS release from mitochondria."

Whether H3 phosphorylation globally affects acetylation, or whether it affects all acetylation sites in H3 equally, is not known. We have taken a genetic approach to this question by mutating Ser10 in H3 to fix either a negative or a neutral charge at this position, followed by analysis of the acetylation states of the mutant histones using site-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, we find that conversion of Ser10 to glutamate (S10E) or aspartate (S10D) causes almost complete loss of H3 acetylation at lysine 9 (Lys9) in vivo. Acetylation of Lys9is also significantly reduced in cells bearing mutations in the Glc7 phosphatase that increase H3 phosphorylation levels. Mutation of Ser10 in H3 and the concomitant loss of Lys9acetylation has minimal effects on expression of a Gcn5-dependent reporter gene. However, synergistic growth defects are observed upon loss of GCN5 in cells bearing H3 Ser10 mutations that are reminiscent of delays in G2/M progression caused by combined loss ofGCN5 and acetylation site mutations.

In recent years, the importance of chromatin remodeling to transcriptional regulation has become especially clear due to the discovery and functional characterization of histone modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (3Vignali M.

Chromatin is built from nucleosomal subunits, which consist of 147 base pairs of DNA spooled around the exterior of an octamer of the four core histone proteins. Post-translational modifications of the histones may alter histone-DNA, histone-histone, and histone-non-histone protein interactions (6Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6676) Google Scholar). These changes can affect the placement and stability of individual nucleosomes as well as the formation of higher order chromatin structures, thereby affecting accessibility of particular DNA elements to trans-acting factors. Histones are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

In the last few years, multiple coactivator complexes that house histone acetyltransferase (HAT)1 activity and corepressor complexes that recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity have been described (10Wade P.A.

These HAT and HDAC complexes directly participate in chromatin remodeling at promoter regions.

The sites for these post-translational modifications are clustered within the first 30 amino acids of the core histones. Histone H3, for example, is acetylated at lysines (Lys) 9, 14, 18, and 23, phosphorylated at serines (Ser) 10 and 28, and methylated at Lys4 and Lys9 (21Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

The juxtaposition of these sites provides potential for cross regulation of different modification events. Indeed, deacetylation of Lys14 in H3 appears to augment methylation of Lys9 at centromeric heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (17Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I.

Ser10phosphorylation also inhibits methylation of Lys9in vitro, and Lys9 methylation limits Ser10phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo (15Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.-W.

Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). This potential for cross-regulation of different histone modifications, together with findings that particular non-histone proteins selectively bind to histones in specific modification states, has led to the idea of a “histone code” (23Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7706) Google Scholar). In this model, not only the levels of modifications but also the individual types and sites of modification directly facilitate or antagonize association of regulatory proteins with chromatin. These proteins may themselves contribute to further chromatin organization, or they may recruit additional activator or repressor activities. The functions of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation are particularly intriguing, because this modification is associated with two apparently disparate processes, which perhaps illustrate the potential of the histone code. H3 Ser10 phosphorylation peaks during mitotic chromosome condensation in all eukaryotes examined, and Ser10 mutations cause defects both in chromosome condensation and segregation in Tetrahymena (18Wei Y., Yu, L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, H3 Ser10 phosphorylation is also linked to chromatin opening and activation of genes in response to certain signals, such as the mitogenic stimulation of c-fos (1Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 20Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In both cases, H3 Ser10 phosphorylation might lead to a transient opening of the chromatin, allowing binding of either condensation factors during mitosis or activation factors during G1. Alternatively, alteration of other modifications upon Ser10phosphorylation might create a “code” on the H3 tail that is “read” by binding of different factors at different stages of the cell cycle to aid either chromosome condensation or gene activation. The functions of Ser10 phosphorylation during mitosis might be redundant with other histone modification states in some organisms, since Ser10 mutations do not affect chromosome segregation or mitotic progression in yeast (18Wei Y., Yu, L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To further probe the function of Ser10 phosphorylation in yeast and to test the hypothesis that this modification is functionally linked to other H3 modification events, we have the examined the effects of Ser10 mutations on global levels of H3 acetylation. Surprisingly, we find that conversion of Ser10to aspartate (Asp) or glutamate (Glu) specifically and drastically lowers acetylation of Lys9. Decreases in Lys9acetylation levels are also observed in the presence of glc7phosphatase mutations (19Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W., Li, X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J.

All Ser10 mutations tested confer synergistic growth defects with loss of the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase, resulting in delayed progression through G2/M. Taken together with previous studies by others that indicate Ser10 phosphorylation enhances acetylation at Lys14 (1Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol.

Moreover, our results suggest that a proper balance of H3 acetylation and phosphorylation is required for normal cell cycle progression. Strains used for this study are listed in Table I. The glc7strains have been described previously (24Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Venturi G.M. Bloecher A.

Mitchell Smith, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) by plasmid shuffle. In brief, MX1-4C contains deletions of both loci that encode histone H3 and H4 (HHT1-HHF1 and HHT2-HHF2). The strain also carries a plasmid with URA3 and HHT1-HHF1. Histone mutations were introduced on a TRP1 and HHT2-HHF2 plasmid, pWZ414-F13 (26Zhang X.Y. Fittler F. Horz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4287-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The TRP1plasmids containing histone mutations were transformed into MX1-4C, and TRP1+ colonies were selected. These colonies were transferred to 5-fluoro-orotic acid media (to select against URA3). Plasmids from the 5-fluoro-orotic acid-resistant colonies were rescued and sequenced to confirm loss of wild type histone alleles and presence of the mutant histone alleles.Table IStrain listNameGenotypeHistone H3 mutationMX1–4CMATα, ura3–52, his3Δ1, leu2–3,112, trp1–289, Δ(hht1-hhf1), Δ(hht2-hhf2), pms327(CEN ARS URA3 HHT1 HHF1)WTJDY16as MX1–4C, except plus pWZ414-F13 instead of pms327WTJDY20as JDY16, exceptΔgcn5∷KanRWTJDY17as MX1–4C, except plus pRS414–59 instead of pms327S10AJDY21as JDY17, exceptΔgcn5∷KanRS10AJDY18as MX1–4C, except plus pJD112 instead of pms327S10DJDY22as JDY18, except Δgcn5∷KanRS10DJDY19as MX1–4C, except plus pJD113 instead of pms327S10EJDY23as JDY19, except Δgcn5∷KanRS10EBMY1as MX1–4C, except plus pBM1 instead of pms327S10D,K9QBMY2as MX1–4C, except plus pBM2 instead of pms327S10D,K9RBMY3as MX1–4C, except plus pBM3 instead of pms327S10D,K14QBMY4as MX1–4C, except plus pBM4 instead of pms327S10D,K14RKT1112MAT a leu2 ura3–52 his3KT1667-aas KT1112, except glc7–129KT1638as KT1112, except glc7–109KT1640as KT1112, exceptglc7–127 Open table in a new tab Mutations were introduced intoHHT2-HHF2 by two approaches. Histone H3 S10A (pRS414-59), S10D (pJD112), and S10E (pJD113) were made using the previously described single strand DNA mutagenesis technique (27Kunkel T. Roberts J. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The combined mutations H3 S10D,K9Q (pBM1), S10D,K9R (pBM2), S10D,K14Q (pBM3), and S10D,K14R (pBM4) were made with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, using the S10D mutant plasmid pJD112 as the template. The entire coding region of both histone H3 and H4 were sequenced in all constructs to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any additional mutations. A PCR-based strategy was used to disruptGCN5. The entire coding region was replaced with thekanr gene as described previously (28Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Both PCR and Southern blot analysis were used to confirm the presence of thegcn5::kanr allele. Equivalent numbers of cells (∼5–25 × 107) in exponential growth were harvested from each yeast strain by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g. Yeast pellets were frozen in a dry ice-methanol bath and stored at −80 °C. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 1.5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, mixed with an equivalent volume of acid-washed glass beads, and vortexed at high speed in microcentrifuge tubes for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were spun through a small hole pierced in the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes and clarified by centrifugation at high speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 min (4 °C). Similar results were obtained from extracts prepared from isolated nuclei and from fresh (never frozen) pellets. For TSA experiments, cultures were treated with 25 μm TSA for 3 h prior to harvest. For GLC7 experiments, extracts were prepared as described by Hsu et al. (19Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W., Li, X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R.

Samples were loaded onto a 22% SDS-PAGE gel (60:0.4 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) or for GLC7 experiments a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride as described previously (29Allis C.D.

Blots were blocked in 2–5% dry milk dissolved in 1× TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1%(w/v) Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Antisera were diluted in block, and blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Dilution of antisera used were: αH3 Ac 9,14 (Upstate) 1:2000, αH3 Ac 9,18 (31Edmondson D.G.

Blots were washed four times for 10 min each in TBST, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; AmershamBiosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in block. After an incubation of 1 h to overnight, blots were washed six times for 5 min each in TBST and developed with SuperSignal (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Indicated yeast strains were transformed with plasmid pPC97-VP16413–470 (a gift from S. Berger, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) and plasmid pLGSD5 (32Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which carries the β-galactosidase gene under the control of a single Gal4 binding site. Multiple colonies of each strain were assayed at least twice. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (33Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990Google Scholar) except that cells were frozen as a pellet at −80 °C prior to extract preparation. FACS was performed essentially as described in Zhanget al. (34Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast in log phase growth were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. After rehydration in PBS, cells were treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA) at 37 °C overnight. PBS-washed cells (1.5 × 106) were stained with 50 mmpropidium iodide in a final volume of 0.1 ml of PBS for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were diluted with 400 μl of PBS, briefly sonicated, and then counted on a Coulter EPICS XL-100 MCL flow cytometer. Phosphorylation of histone H3 peptides at Ser10augments acetylation at Lys14 by Gcn5 in vitro, and conversion of Ser10 to alanine (S10A) decreases activation of some Gcn5-regulated promoters in vivo (1Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R.

These results suggest that prevention of phosphorylation by mutation of Ser10 to alanine weakens Gcn5-mediated acetylation of H3, which normally facilitates gene activation. To directly test the effects of the S10A mutation on H3 acetylation levels, we probed whole cell protein extracts from cells bearing wild type or mutated H3 on immunoblots using antibodies specific for particular acetylated H3 isoforms. In cells bearing H3 mutations, both wild type copies of the H3 gene were deleted so that the plasmid-borne, mutated copy provided the sole source for H3 in the cell (34Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 35Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Smith M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1716-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two antibodies were predominantly used in our studies. One commercially available antibody that is often used to evaluate H3 acetylation levels was raised against an H3 peptide containing acetyllysine at positions 9 and 14 (anti-H3 Ac 9,14). A second antiserum was raised against an H3-peptide with acetyllysines at positions 9 and 18 (anti-H3 Ac 9,18) (31Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We observed a decrease (∼60%) in the amount of H3 acetylation detected by the H3 Ac 9,14 antisera in extracts from cells bearing the H3 S10A mutation (Fig. 1 and Table II), as expected from the above reports. Less decrease was observed using the anti-H3 Ac 9,18 antisera (Fig. 1).Table IIRelative levels of histone H3 detected by Ac H3 antibodiesH3 alleleα H3 Ac 9,141-aNormalized to protein load and average of two experiments (difference less than 1% between experiments for αAcH3 9,14 and less than 14% for αAc H3 9,18).α H3 Ac 9,181-aNormalized to protein load and average of two experiments (difference less than 1% between experiments for αAcH3 9,14 and less than 14% for αAc H3 9,18).Wild type1.01.0S10A0.40.8S10D0.10.6S10E0.10.61-a Normalized to protein load and average of two experiments (difference less than 1% between experiments for αAcH3 9,14 and less than 14% for αAc H3 9,18). Open table in a new tab If the introduction of a negative charge at Ser10 by phosphorylation is important for augmentation of Gcn5 (or other HAT) functions, then placement of a constitutive negative charge at this position should increase acetylation. However, in contrast to our expectations, S10D and S10E H3 mutations reduced acetylation of H3 detected by the anti-H3Ac 9,14 antibody by 90% or more (Fig. 1 and Table II). Acetylation detected by anti-H3 Ac9,18 was also reduced, but to a lesser extent (∼40%). The persistence in staining with this antibody demonstrates that intact H3 is present in extracts from the mutant cells. Acetylation of H4 was not altered in extracts from the mutant strains, indicating that the effects on acetylation are specific for the mutated H3 histone (Fig. 1). The apparent loss of acetylation detected by the anti-H3 Ac 9,14 antisera might reflect a decrease in HAT recognition of the mutant H3, increased HDAC activity toward this mutant, or a destruction of the epitope recognized by this antibody. To determine whether the S10D or S10E H3 mutations preclude acetylationin vivo, cells bearing these mutations were grown in the presence of TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase activities. Under these conditions, both the S10D and S10E mutant forms of H3 exhibited increased acetylation detected by the H3 Ac 9,14 antibody (Fig. 2, upper panel), confirming the ability of these histones to be acetylatedin vivo. Importantly, these results also confirm the ability of the H3 Ac 9,14-specific antisera to recognize these mutant forms of H3, demonstrating that the epitope for the antibody is intact. To further define the effects of the S10D and S10E mutations on particular acetylation sites, we reinvestigated the specificity of the H3 Ac 9,14 antibody. In previous work, we established that Lys14 mutations had negligible effects on detection of H3 by this antibody (34Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of Lys9virtually abolished H3 recognition by the H3 Ac 9,14 antisera. These results suggested either that the antibody has a much higher specificity for acetyl-Lys9 than for acetyl-Lys14 or that bulk yeast histones are acetylated at Lys9 much more frequently than at Lys14. To distinguish these possibilities, we analyzed the ability of the H3 Ac 9,14 antibody to recognize peptides synthesized with acetyllysine at position 9, position 14, or other sites using a slot blot assay. Equal amounts of peptides were applied to the membrane, as confirmed by staining with India ink (Fig. 3). The H3 Ac 9,14 antibody did not recognize the unmodified H3 peptide, but did recognize all H3 peptides containing acetyl-Lys9. In contrast, a peptide acetylated at Lys14, Lys18, and Lys23, but lacking Lys9 acetylation, was not recognized. Therefore, the H3 Ac 9,14 antibody appears largely specific for H3 acetylated at Lys9, although other studies have shown that this antibody can be blocked effectively with a H3 Ac Lys14 peptide (1Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Similar slot blot analysis of the H3 Ac 9,18 antibody confirms its specificity for acetylation events at either Lys9 or Lys18 in H3 (Fig. 3). Together with our above experiments, these results indicate that the H3 S10D and S10E mutations likely inhibit acetylation of Lys9. We confirmed this effect by probing immunoblots of whole cell extracts with antibodies raised against a peptide acetylated individually at Lys9. This monospecific H3 Ac 9 antibody reacted well with wild type yeast H3, but staining was drastically reduced for the H3 S10D or S10E mutants (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Acetylation of Lys9 as detected by this antibody was regained upon growth of cells in TSA, again confirming the ability of this residue to be acetylated within the context of the Ser10 mutations and the integrity of the epitope in the mutant histones. The S10D and S10E mutations, therefore, severely and specifically inhibit acetylation of histone H3 at Lys9. If conversion of Ser10 to Asp or Glu mimics phosphorylation, then phosphatase mutations that increase Ser10 phosphorylationin vivo should also decrease acetylation of Lys9. The Glc7 phosphatase is an essential gene in yeast. Particular mutant alleles of the GLC7 (glc7–127and glc7–129) increase H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels, whereas other alleles of GLC7 (glc7–109) do not (19Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W., Li, X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Immunoblots of equal loads of extracts from isogenic wild type orglc7 cells reveal that H3 acetylation detected by the anti-H3 Ac 9,14 antibody is decreased in the presence of those alleles that result in increased phosphorylation at Ser10(asterisks in Fig 4a). Thus, high levels of H3 phosphorylation cause a decrease in Lys9 acetylation just as did conversion of Ser10 to Asp or Glu. A negative charge at this position in H3 apparently antagonizes acetylation at Lys9, even though it stimulates acetylation at Lys14. Activation of the Gcn5-dependent genes is accompanied by increased acetylation of histones associated with promoter regions (36Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Since Gcn5 exhibits an enhanced recognition of phosphorylated H3 peptidesin vitro (1Cheung P"

In addition, a parallel PI 3-kinase-independent pathway leading to the activation of small GTP-binding protein TC10 appears to function in concert with the PI 3-kinase pathway (15Chiang S.-H.

The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic filament network that is essential for multiple cellular functions including cell movement, morphogenesis, polarity, and cell division (22Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J.

Furthermore, insulin stimulates dynamic actin remodeling at both the inner surface of the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear region that is sensitive to Clostridium difficile toxin B, a Rho family-specific toxin (20Kanzaki M.

Taken together these data suggest that dynamic actin remodeling is essential in the GLUT4 translocation process. Recent evidence has also demonstrated that cholesterol-enriched lipid raft microdomains serve as critical compartmentalized membrane regions that generate specific insulin signals (15Chiang S.-H.

For example, TC10 is mainly localized to the lipid raft compartment enriched in caveolin, the major structural protein of a subset of lipid raft microdomains that forms characteristic Ω-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane termed caveolae (31Brown D.A.

Electron Microsc. 1998; 47: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, these caveolin-containing lipid raft microdomains are necessary for the activation of TC10 through a CAP-Cbl signaling pathway (15Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Watson R.T.

Based upon these data, we hypothesized that lipid microdomains might function as pivotal signaling platforms regulating and/or assembly-specific cellular machinery necessary for insulin action. In this article we demonstrate that adipocytes have a uniquely organized F-actin structure emanating from the caveolin-enriched clustered lipid raft microdomains at the plasma membrane.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was added directly to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a final concentration of 10 mm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling induces dynamic actin rearrangements and that prevention of these events by various types of actin-disrupting reagents, toxins, and inhibitory proteins result in a significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (20Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsiani E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P.

Huang C. Patel N. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have also reported that the organization of the actin cytoskeleton is dramatically changed during the differentiation of adipocytes from a typical stress fiber actin structure in fibroblasts to a relatively thick cortical actin lining the inner surface of the plasma membrane in adipocytes (20Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the reorganization of stress fiber actin to that of cortical actin is an important process of adipocyte differentiation that may be essential for the development of adipocyte insulin responsiveness. To further investigate this differentiation-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, we initially compared the intracellular distribution of F-actin with caveolin (Fig.1). As previously observed, predifferentiated 3T3L1 fibroblasts displayed long organized F-actin stress fibers as detected by rhodamine-phalloidin labeling (Fig. 1,panel e). Caveolin was dispersed throughout the cells with no apparent relationship to the localization pattern of caveolin 1 (Fig. 1 a, panels a, e, andi). Two days after initiation of adipocyte differentiation, the amount of F-actin stress fibers visualized at the cell bottom were markedly reduced, being more diffuse and decreasing in both thickness and length (Fig. 1 a, panel f). At this time, caveolin began to develop a more organized pattern in some of the cells (Fig. 1 a, panels b, f, andj). However, after 6 and 10 days of adipocyte differentiation the stress fiber F-actin became small patches of punctate actin that were co-localized with the caveolin-positive clusters that are characteristic of lipid raft microdomains in adipocytes (Fig. 1 a, panels c, d,g, h, k, and l). We and others have found that individual caveolae in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes are often clustered into ring-like arrays (caveolae-rosettes) that can be visualized by fluorescent microscopy (16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Voldstedlund M. Tranum-Jensen J. Vinten J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, these ring-like caveolae organized structures were observed in the plasma membrane of differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1 b, panel a). A similar pattern was also observed in the labeling of F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin (Fig. 1 b, panels b andc). At higher magnification the caveolae-rosette structures are readily apparent and are co-localized with rhodamine-phalloidin labeling of F-actin (Fig. 1 b, panels d–f). In many cases, the F-actin appears to localize along the inner circumference of the large caveolae-rosettes (Fig. 1 b,panels d–f, arrows) and sometimes fills the center regions of the smaller caveolae-rosettes (Fig. 1 b,panels d–f, arrowheads). We have also confirmed that the rhodamine-phalloidin staining of these structures represents polymerized actin by comparison with the expression of EGFP-actin (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that the caveolae-rosette structures play a role in the formation and/or localization of F-actin at the plasma membrane of differentiated adipocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the small GTP-binding protein TC10 is localized to caveolae-rosettes and inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (15Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Thurmond D.C. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since Rho family members are well established to regulate F-actin, we examined the effect of dominant-interfering TC10 (TC10/T31N) expression on Cav-actin (Fig.2). The expressed TC10/T31N protein displayed a plasma membrane localization similar to that of caveolin and importantly did not disrupt the caveolae-rosette structures (Fig.2, panels a and b). However, rhodamine-phalloidin staining demonstrated a near complete loss of Cav-actin structure (Fig.2, panels c and d). The disruption of Cav-actin is consistent with total loss of cortical actin that also occurs in adipocytes expressing TC10/T31N (20Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The fact that expression of TC10/T31N disrupts the Cav-actin structure without significantly affecting caveolae-rosettes indicates that the clustered organization of caveolae are not dependent upon F-actin. To test this prediction, we next examined the effect of latrunculin B, a red sea sponge toxin that binds to monomeric actin and prevents its polymerization to F-actin (Fig. 3). As previously observed, differentiated adipocytes displayed the typical organization of caveolae-rosettes with the co-localization of F-actin (Fig. 3, panels a, e, and i). Latrunculin B treatment of differentiated adipocytes for 2 h resulted in a marked loss of the Cav-actin structure at the bottom of the cell with little effect on the caveolae-rosette organization (Fig.3, panels b, f, and j). As previously reported (20Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), under these conditions there was also a complete disruption of cortical actin lining the inner surface of the plasma membrane (data not shown). In addition, following removal of latrunculin B the Cav-actin structure reassembled, consistent with these structures undergoing continuous remodeling (data not shown). Similarly the Cav-actin structures were disrupted by toxin B treatment without significant changes in the organization of the caveolae-rosettes (Fig. 3, panels c, g, andk). This also occurred concomitant with the disappearance of the F-actin staining at the center of the cells (data not shown). In contrast, cholesterol depletion with MβCD effectively disrupted the localization of F-actin and, in parallel, dispersed the caveolae-rosette organization (Fig. 3, panels d,h, and l). Together these data indicate that the caveolae-rosettes are responsible for organization of F-actin into the Cav-actin structure. At present, the functional role of this unusual adipocyte Cav-actin structure has not yet been defined. Nevertheless several lines of evidence suggest that Cav-actin may play an important role in the insulin regulation of GLUT4 translocation. For example, depolymerization or stabilization of F-actin inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (20Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsiani E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res.

Shibata H., Li, L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TC10 inhibition of GLUT4 translocation only occurs when TC10 is targeted to adipocyte caveolae-rosettes in parallel with disruption of cortical actin (16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cholesterol deletion or interference with caveolae-rosette assembly also prevents insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M.

Other members of the group IV family, cPLA2β (group IVB) (114 kDa) and cPLA2γ (group IVC) (61 kDa), have ∼30% homology to cPLA2α (40Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J.

Three residues found to be essential for cPLA2α catalytic activity (Arg-200, Ser-228, and Asp-549) are conserved in these cPLA2 paralogs. cPLA2β is also calcium-dependent and contains a C2 domain, but its role is not clear because the cPLA2β message is primarily in an unspliced form (42Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, the calcium-independent cPLA2γ lacks a C2 domain and is membrane-bound. It contains a C-terminal prenylation site and potential acylation sites. cPLA2γ is expressed at high levels in heart and skeletal muscle (40Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L.

It lacks the mitogen-activated protein kinase consensus site but contains potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. In this study we have characterized the enzymatic properties of cPLA2γ. Purified cPLA2γ has higher lysophospholipase activity than PLA2 activity and sequentially deacylates the sn-2 and then sn-1 fatty acyl groups from phospholipid. When expressed in mammalian cells, cPLA2γ is membrane-associated and constitutively releases saturated and unsaturated fatty acids from isolated cell membranes. However, overexpression of cPLA2γ in fibroblasts does not lead to an increase in basal fatty release from intact cells. When overexpressed in lung fibroblasts, cPLA2γ is activated by serum resulting in release of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, unlike cPLA2α, which primarily releases arachidonic acid.

Rhodamine D terminator mix was from AmershamBiosciences, and Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Silica Gel LC-Si SPE columns were from Supelco. An expressed sequence tag clone (R61677) containing full-length human cPLA2γ was cloned into pVL1393 transfer vector into the SmaI and NotI sites, and both strands were sequenced using a thermal Sequenase dye terminator mix and an automated sequencer. The sequence obtained corresponded to that previously reported (40Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A termination sequence 5′ of the initiation sequence was identified and was mutated to introduce an EcoRI site using the PCR primers (5′-GGCTCAGGAGGACTGGAATTCTTCGGACCGCAGTGCACC-3′ and 5′-GCCCAAGTGGATCCAGAGACCC-3′). cPLA2γ was then cloned into the baculovirus expression vectors Biogreen (encoding GFP at the N terminus) and pAchlt-A (encoding a His6 tag at the N terminus) between the EcoRI and PstI sites. For mammalian expression studies, cPLA2γ was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA 3.0. Sf9 cells were routinely grown in suspension at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (Grace's medium supplemented with 3.3 g/liter yeastolate, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) containing 10% FBS and 0.1% pluronic acid. Recombinant baculovirus was generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with the cPLA2γ constructs described above or empty pVL1393 vector (to generate control virus) and linearized baculovirus DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant virus was generated, plaque-purified, and amplified by standard protocols. For expression of cPLA2γ, Sf9 cells were plated into 12-well tissue culture plates at 0.5 × 106 cells/well and were infected with either control virus or recombinant virus for 1 h. After infection, virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were incubated for 42 h. Expression of protein was determined by measuring PLA2 activity in cell lysates and by Western blot analysis using specific antiserum for cPLA2γ. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm MEM sodium pyruvate, 100 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 2 mm l-glutamine (supplemented DMEM). Cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with either pcDNA 3.0 empty vector or with the pcDNA 3.0/cPLA2γ construct using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were washed in serum-free Opti-MEM and then transfected with 4 μg of DNA using 20 μl of PLUS reagent and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE. All transformations were carried out in serum-free Opti-MEM at a final volume of 5 ml. After 4 h, transfection medium was replaced with supplemented DMEM and the cells incubated for 24 h. Transformed cells were selected by adding 1 mg/ml Geneticin to the culture medium, and individual clones were isolated in ∼10 days and expression of cPLA2γ determined by Western blot analysis. The replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses carrying the cPLA2γ cDNA (AdcPLA2γ) and eGFP-cPLA2α cDNA (AdGFP-cPLA2α) were generated using the AdEasy vector system (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cPLA2γ was cloned into the BglII and EcoRV sites of the pShuttle-CMV vector and eGFP-cPLA2α cloned into theXbaI and EcoRV sites. After recombination of linearized shuttle vector and adenovirus backbone vector inEscherichia coli BJ5183, the recombined adenoviral construct was transfected into QBI-293A cells. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and screened by infecting HEK293 cells and determining expression of the phospholipases by Western blotting. Adenovirus clones were amplified in QBI-293A cells and after three passages were used for experiments. Titers of virus stocks were determined by the tissue culture infectious dose method in QBI-293A cells following the Qbiogene protocol. Lung fibroblasts were isolated from mice in which the 85-kDa cPLA2α gene was disrupted, and the cells were immortalized with SV40. 2M. Ghosh, A. Stewart, J. Bonventre, and C. Leslie, manuscript in preparation. The immortalized mouse lung fibroblasts (I-MLF−/−) were plated in 24-well plates (0.2 × 105 cells/well) in supplemented DMEM containing 2% FBS. After incubation overnight the medium was removed, the cells rinsed and adenovirus (diluted in 150 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA) added to the cell monolayer. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, 500 μl of supplemented serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA was added and the cultures incubated for 26 h for optimal expression of the phospholipases. Cells infected with adenovirus containing the cDNA for GFP were used as controls. The radiolabeled fatty acids (0.2 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid, 0.5 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid, and 0.25 μCi each of [3H]oleic, [14C]linoleic, and [14C]linolenic acids/well) were added to the culture medium (0.65 ml final volume) during the 26-h incubation following adenovirus infection as described above. After labeling, I-MLF−/− were washed twice with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and then treated with agonist. Radioactivity in the medium was measured and is expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated, as previously described (43Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fusion protein of GST fused to the N terminus of residues 50–204 of cPLA2γ was generated in bacteria using the pGEX5X expression system. The GST fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose beads using standard protocols. Briefly, 50–100 μg of GST fusion protein in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into the rabbit, followed by booster injections (50 μg) in incomplete adjuvant every 3–4 weeks. The rabbit was bled 10–14 days after each booster injection until maximum titer of antibody was obtained. Cell lysates for Western blot analysis were prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), and 0.1% SDS (w/v). For Sf9 lysates the buffer contained a specialized protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 16 μg/ml benzamidine HCl, and 10 μg/ml phenanthroline) and for HEK293 lysates the buffer contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm activated sodium vanadate. Lysates of I-MLF−/− were prepared in buffer composed of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 300 nmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein reagent. Lysates were diluted in Laemmli buffer and proteins (∼20 μg/lane) separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% Tween 20 (v/v), 3% BSA, and 5% nonfat milk (w/v). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1000 dilution of cPLA2γ-specific polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Sf9 cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, infected with either control virus or cPLA2γ recombinant virus, and incubated for 42 h. HEK293 cells expressing cPLA2γ were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown until 90–95% confluence was reached. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.34 msucrose, and 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors as described above. Cells were scraped into homogenization buffer and sonicated using a probe sonicator. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were rinsed carefully with homogenization buffer and then resuspended in homogenization buffer. PLA2 activity was assayed using 1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine as substrate, as previously described (44de Carvalho M.G.S. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl final volume) contained 30 μm1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine (100,000 dpm), 9 μm dioleoylglycerol (which had been co-sonicated with the substrate), 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 1 mm EGTA, and calcium chloride to give a free calcium concentration of 2 μm. Free fatty acids were extracted using Dole reagent (propan-2-ol, heptane, and 1 nH2SO4; 20:5:1) and separated by silicic acid chromatography as previously described using unlabeled oleic acid (25 μg) as a carrier lipid (45Leslie C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lysophospholipase activity was measured with sonicated dispersions of 50 μm l-1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine (120,000 dpm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, and calcium chloride to give a free calcium concentration of 2 μm. Reactions were started by the addition of membrane, and incubations were carried out at 37 °C for the times indicated. The [14C]palmitic acid released was extracted as previously described (44de Carvalho M.G.S. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of cPLA2γ to use endogenous membrane phospholipid as substrate was evaluated using membranes from [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled Sf9 or HEK293 cells expressing cPLA2γ. Sf9 cells were plated at 6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and infected with control or recombinant viruses. At 30 h after infection, cells were incubated for 18 h in medium containing 10% FBS and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid. HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence and incubated for 18 h in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% fatty acid-free BSA and then once in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cells were scraped in homogenization buffer and sonicated three times for 15 s each time using a probe sonicator. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. Radiolabeled membranes were suspended in PLA2 assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, and appropriate inhibitor mixture), and protein concentration determined. Membranes were diluted in assay buffer containing 5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and calcium chloride (resulting in a final free calcium concentration of 2 μm) and reactions initiated by placing samples in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for the times indicated. Lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method and free fatty acids separated by thin layer chromatography using oleic acid as carrier lipid, in the solvent hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:2). Fatty acids were visualized using iodine, the corresponding area scraped, and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Membranes from control and cPLA2γ-expressing HEK293 cells (unlabeled) were isolated as described above and then diluted into PLA2 assay buffer at a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated and then terminated by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold methanol. Internal standards were added and the solution acidified by the addition of 1 n hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids were extracted into isooctane, then derivatized to their pentafluorobenzyl esters as described previously (44de Carvalho M.G.S. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fatty acid pentafluorobenzyl esters were resuspended in decane and analyzed by temperature-programmed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SSQ 70 quadrupole mass spectrometer; Finnigan, San Jose, CA). For gas chromatography a DB-1 column (10 m, 250 μm (inner diameter), and 0.25-μm film) (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with helium as a carrier gas. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. Amounts of fatty acids were determined by stable isotope dilution calibration curves. Carboxylate anion signals were obtained by selected ion recording of ions of target fatty acids and ratioed to the carboxylate anion from the corresponding stable isotope-labeled fatty acids.

The small GTPase rac1 promotes oxidative stress via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In turn, the homeostatic response to such stress includes up-regulation of the dual function reducing protein/DNA repair enzyme APE/redox factor-1(ref-1). In this report we explore the function and relationship between ref-1 and rac1 in the setting of oxidative stress triggered by re-oxygenation/reperfusion. In a model of mouse hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), recombinant adenoviral overexpression of ref-1 resulted in suppression of reperfusion-stimulated oxidative stress, NF-kB induction, apoptosis, and acute injury, whereas down-regulation of endogenous ref-1 by adenoviral expression of antisense ref-1 led to an increase in these reperfusion-induced parameters. Ref-1 also mitigated ROS production induced by adenoviral expression of an active form of rac1. Finally, overexpression of ref-1 in primary hepatocytes suppressed reoxygenation-stimulated rac1 activity. This work demonstrates a novel function of ref-1 in inhibition of rac1 activity, and rac1-mediated oxidative stress and injury."
https://openalex.org/W2170160758,"Reperfusion injury is considered primarily an inflammatory response to oxidative stress. In vitro, oxygen free radicals induce the formation of oxidized phospholipids with platelet-activating factor (PAF) activity (PAF-like lipids). We examined the following: 1) whether PAF and PAF-like lipids are released during reperfusion; 2) the relationship between these phospholipids and oxidative damage on the one hand, and leukocyte recruitment in renal tissue on the other; and 3) whether antioxidant treatment influences the behavior of these phospholipids, the renal inflammatory response, and the outcome of postischemic acute renal failure. After 60 min of warm renal ischemia in rabbits, a release of PAF and, particularly, PAF-like lipids was seen in the first 15 min of reperfusion. In addition, the release of those phospholipids was associated with intense tissue DNA oxidation and with an increase in myeloperoxidase activity. Vitamin C was able to attenuate these postischemic oxidative changes, decrease PAF and PAF-like lipid levels, and, consequently, reduce myeloperoxidase activity. After 40 min of warm renal ischemia in rats, vitamin C treatment ameliorated renal function and structure. This is the first in vivo demonstration of the release of phospholipid oxidation products as part of an oxidative-inflammatory response after renal ischemia-reperfusion, with the release of phospholipid oxidation products significantly reduced by antioxidant treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2032962654,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-encoded Vif protein is important for viral replication and infectivity. Vif is a cytoplasmic protein that acts during virus assembly by an unknown mechanism, enhancing viral infectivity. The action of Vif in producer cells is essential for the completion of proviral DNA synthesis following virus entry. Therefore, Vif is considered to be an important alternative therapeutic target for inhibition of viral infectivity at the level of viral assembly and reverse transcription. To gain insight into this process, we developed a Vif-specific single-chain antibody and expressed it intracellularly in the cytoplasm. This intrabody efficiently bound Vif protein and neutralized its infectivity-enhancing function. Intrabody-expressing cells were shown to be highly refractory to challenge with different strains of HIV-1 and HIV-1-infected cells. Inhibition of Vif by intrabody expression in the donor cell produced viral particles that do not complete reverse transcription in the recipient cell. The anti-Vif scFv was shown to be specific for Vif protein because its function was observed only in nonpermissive cells (H9, CEM, and U38). Moreover, transduction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an HIV-derived retroviral vector expressing Vif intrabody was shown to confer resistance to laboratory-adapted and primary HIV strains.

The early events of the viral life cycle are potential therapeutic targets that could be inhibited using anti-HIV-1 Vif intrabody-based strategies and may therefore represent a new therapeutic approach to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription. Therefore, strategies that prevent or limit expression of Vif are expected to be beneficial in the treatment of HIV-1 disease (29Cattaneo A. Biocca S. Intracellular Antibodies.

We developed a Vif-specific single-chain antibody from immunized rabbits that was expressed intracellularly and confined to the cytoplasm. Cell lines and primary cells expressing the Vif intrabody were shown to be highly refractory to challenge with the HIV-1 virus or HIV-1-infected cells. Furthermore, replication of an HIV virus constructed to express anti-Vif scFv in cis was highly reduced after challenge with wild-type HIV-1. The formation of completed reverse transcripts was reduced when cells were infected with HIV-1 virus produced from intrabody-producing cells. These results suggest that gene therapy approaches, which deliver Vif intracellular antibodies, may represent a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting HIV reverse transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Viruses, and ReagentsCellsH9, U38, Jurkat, SupT1, and CEM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.

After 24 h Jurkat and H9 cells were co-cultured during 48 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml of dextran. The cells were maintained in RPMI medium plus 15% fetal calf serum. p24 antigen concentration was determined as recommended by the manufacturer (Innotest). For immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa cells were co-transfected by the FuGENE reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 2 μg of pSVLvif and 2-fold molar excess of plasmid encoding intrabodies or with control plasmid, pcDNA3.1/Neo containing no insert. For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysis was performed as described by Anderson (47Anderson N.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 88: 152-159Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, magnetic protein A beads were used as described by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec).Replication Complementation AssayA transient complementation assay was used to provide a quantitative measure of the ability of wild-type or mutant Vif proteins to complement a single round of HIV-1 replication in trans. Briefly, H9 cells (107) were co-transfected by FuGENE (Roche), with 2 μg of either pHXBΔenvCAT or pHXBΔAvrΔenvCAT, 2 μg pSVIIIenv, and plasmids encoding scFv as described (49Helseth E. Kowalski M.

The ability of the intrabody to inhibit a single round of infection was measured by assaying for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in the transfected culture at 9 or 10 days after transfection. CAT assay was performed by ELISA (Roche).Immunofluorescence StainingHeLa cells transfected by FuGENE with 2 μg of plasmids were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and washed with PBS plus 2% fetal calf serum before staining. The fixed cells were incubated with Vif antiserum (1:200) for 90 min at 37 °C, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (1:200) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed, and mounted on glass slides. For immunostaining of scFv, direct immunofluorescence was performed with FITC-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:40). For double immunofluorescence staining of intrabodies and Vif protein, FITC-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used in combination with Vif antiserum at similar concentrations. The imaging setup consists of an Olympus IX-50 inverted microscope, Ludl BioPoint filter wheels and a 12-bit V-scan cool CCD (Photonic Science). Integrated control of filter wheel and image acquisition is achieved by Image-Pro Plus 4.0 and Scope-Pro 3.1 (Media Cybernetics). The settings for image acquisition (camera exposure time, filters, time interval, and storing modes) were determined by custom-made macros. The images were collected with Olympus 40× or 100× plan apo objectives (numerical apertures = 0.95 and 1.4, respectively).Rabbit ImmunizationA rabbit (New Zealand White) was treated with four subcutaneous injections containing 50 μg of purified Vif protein in a 1-ml emulsion of adjuvant (Ribi Immunochem Research, Hamilton, MT). The injections were administered at 2–3-week intervals. Five days after the final boost, spleen and bone marrow were harvested and used for total RNA preparation (48Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S.

Purified Fab fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot with HRP-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 280 nm by the classic Bradford method.DNA ConstructsFor the conversion of a Vif-specific Fab into a scFv, specific oligonucleotides primers were used to amplify VH and VL gene segments from purified phagemid DNA isolated from J4, a Fab fragment specific for the Vif protein. This Fab was isolated from an immunized rabbit by using the phage display approach (50Barbas III, C.F. Burton R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual.

The following primers were used: VL, RSCVK1, 5′-GGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTCGTGMTGACCCAGACTCCA-3′, and RKB9J0-B, 5′-GGAAGATCTAGAGGAACCACCTAGGATCTCCAGCTCGGTCCC-3′; and VH, RSCVH3, 5′-GGTGGTTCCTCTAGATCTTCCCAGTCGYTGGAGGAGTCCGGG-3′, and HSCG1234, 5′-CCTGGCCGGCCTGGCCACTAGTGACCGATGGGCCCTTGGTGGARGC-3′. The purified PCR products were assembled by another PCR using the following primers: RSC-F, 5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGCGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTC-3′, and RSC-B, 5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGCCTGGCCGGCCTGGCCACTAGTG-3′. The resulting overlap PCR product encodes an scFv in which the N-terminal VL region is linked with the VH region through a 7-amino acid peptide linker (GGSSRSS) and a 18-amino acid peptide linker (SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS), named scFv 4B and 4BL, respectively. The DNA fragment was gel-purified, digested with the restriction endonuclease SfiI, and cloned into the appropriately cut phagemid vector pComb3X, a variant of pComb3H. The binding activity of the expressed scFv was confirmed, and the genes encoding the scFv were transferred to pCDNA3.1/Neo (Invitrogen), pBabePuro vectors, and pRRL.SIN. A methionine initiation codon sequence was added into the 4BL and 4B scFv by PCR amplification. The primers used for cloning in pCDNA3.1 were scFv5, 5′-GGCATGGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCCAGCTC-3′, and scFv3, 5′-GCCACCACCCTCCTAAGAAGC-3′. Similar primers were used for cloning anti-Vif scFv in pBabePuro and pRRL.SIN: Vector/scFv5, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGGGCATGGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTC-3′, and Vector/scFv3, 5′-ACGCGTCGACGTCGGATATCGCGGCCGCGGAAGCCACCACCCTCCTAAGAAGC-3′. Downstream of the sequence, we maintained a sequence encoding the HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) followed by a stop codon. Control scFv anti-thyroglobulin was amplified from pHEN2 and Sfi-cloned in pComb3X. A methionine was introduced at the N terminus, and the DNA fragment with a HA-tag at the C terminus was cloned into the appropriately digested vector DNAs. The modified pcDNA3.1/Neo plasmid encoding 4BL, 4B, and anti-thyroglobulin was designated pI4BL, pI4B, and pThyr. Anti-Vif scFv I4BL and anti-thyroglobulin was cloned in pHXBnPLAP-IRES-N+ by inserting the gene in place of PLAP-IRES-nef. The primers used for cloning were scFv5/HIV, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATATGGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTC-3′, and scFv3/HIV, 5′-CCGCTCGAGC- GGGCCACCACCCTCCTAAGAAGC-3′.In Vitro Studies of Anti-Vif Antibody FragmentsThe methods for bacterial expression of anti-Vif scFv were described before (50Barbas III, C.F. Burton R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Briefly, scFv were cloned in pComb3X that allows the expression in the supernatant and purification with a Ni2+-NTA column caused by the presence of a His6 tag at the C-terminal end. After induction of scFv expression by growth in 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 30 °C, analysis of supernatants indicated that both anti-Vif scFv were expressed. For assays of expression of antibody fractions, 1 ml of culture supernatant was concentrated (Amicon 10) and separated by 12% PAGE. For purification of ScFv and Fab proteins, 100 ml of bacterial supernatant were concentrated to 2 ml (Centricon 30), and Ni2+ columns were used (CLONTECH). Relative binding affinities of anti-Vif ScFv were determined via ELISA after coating of the wells with 200 ng of purified recombinant HIV-1 Vif protein. Purified anti-Vif scFv and Fab were diluted at various concentrations starting at 5 μg/ml and added to the wells for further incubation. After washing the wells with PBS, horseradish-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody was applied for detection. Recognition of Vif by anti-Vif scFv and Fab was next demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Vif protein and HIV-1 protease (200 ng) were separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the proteins were probed with anti-Vif Fab and scFv antibody fragments and then with horseradish-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody as a secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Retroviral Gene Transfer: Generation of Transduced H9 and Jurkat CellsThe amphotropic packaging cell line PhoenixAmpho was transfected with pBabe Puro plasmids encoding the anti-Vif scFv inserts (51Pear W. Nolan G. Scott M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). For control purposes pBabe Puro plasmids encoding scFv specific to thyroglobulin were also used (41Griffiths A.D. Williams S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M. Allison T.J. Prospero T.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Nissim A. Cox J.P.L. Harrison J.L. Zaccolo M. Gherardi E. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3245-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). These packaging cell lines were used to generate virus-containing medium for two rounds of infection of H9 and Jurkat cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Calbiochem). Two days after the last infection, transduced H9 and Jurkat cells were selected in puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) by limiting dilution cloning. After 15 days of selection, analysis of cells for anti-Vif expression and infectability was started. The untransduced parental H9 and Jurkat cell lines were named H9-P and Jurkat-P, respectively, and the H9 and Jurkat cells transduced to express anti-Vif intrabodies were named H9-I4BL, H9-I4B, Jurkat-I4BL, and Jurkat-I4B. The cell lines transduced to express the control intrabody anti-thyroglobulin were named H9-thyr and Jurkat-thyro.HIV-1 Infection of H9 and Jurkat CellsTransduced and untransduced H9 and Jurkat cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01–0.05 for 6 h at 37 °C, washed, and then cultured for up to 30 days. To monitor infection, aliquots were taken from the cultures at the indicated time points, and the p24 levels were determined in an HIV-1 ELISA (Innotest).PCR Analysis of HIV-1 Reverse TranscriptionDNase-I-treated stocks of HIV-1NL4–3 or mutant pHIV-1NL4–3Δvif produced from parental Jurkat and H9 cells and cells expressing anti-Vif scFv were used to challenge"

Mitf also is important for the development of melanocytes, osteoclasts, and retinal pigment epithelium. The lineage-restricted phenotypes of Mitfmutations correlate with tissue-restricted expression of Mitf, a feature due in part to the presence of several distinct Mitf isoforms. We report the identification and characterization of a novel mast cell isoform, Mitf-mc. This isoform arises from alternative splicing of a novel 5′-exon onto the common body of the gene and is predicted to encode a unique 43-amino acid sequence at its amino terminus. It is specifically expressed in mast cells. The mast cell isoform functions differently from the melanocyte isoform in its ability to activate cell type-specific Mitf gene targets. Mitf-mc functions only on a mast cell target promoter and fails to activate a melanocyte target promoter despite binding to its E-box element. Moreover, Mitf-mc heterodimerizes with a closely related transcription factor, Tfe3, and dominantly inhibits the ability of Tfe3 to transactivate a melanocyte-specific promoter. These studies identify a new isoform of Mitf with tissue-specific features that may underlie key aspects of the mast cell phenotype of Mitf mutations.

These isoforms differ in their amino termini and arise from differential splicing of a unique first exon onto common downstream exons. Whereas the isoforms differ at their amino termini, they all share the important functional domains of the protein: the transactivation domain, basic domain, helix-loop-helix, and leucine zipper. The genomic structure of the human and mouse Mitf genes have been identified, and the expression of each of these isoforms is controlled by distinct promoters (14Udono T. Yasumoto K. Takeda K.

The expression of Mitf-m is restricted to melanocytes, whereas Mitf-a is widely expressed. Mitf-h is highly expressed in heart tissue, and Mitf-e was identified from mast cells. This genomic structure involving multiple isoforms may have arisen for at least two reasons: 1) the organization allows for the appropriate temporal and spatial expression of the gene, and 2) the distinct isoforms may in themselves possess cell-specific functions.A fascinating observation about Mitf is its essential role for the development of diverse cellular fates. One of the reasons for this property is its highly regulated and restricted expression within these committed cell types. Yet how does Mitf activate the expression of melanocyte-specific genes in melanocytes and mast cell-specific genes in mast cells? Conversely, why does Mitf not activate the expression of mast cell-specific genes in melanocytes and melanocyte-specific genes in mast cells? Other mechanisms that may confer distinct cell-specific functions to Mitf include protein interactions with cell-restricted factors and/or cell specific post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Such events may regulate the specificity of gene target activation within different cell types. A means to produce this specificity could be distinct amino termini of these isoforms, which themselves confer cell-specific properties to the protein.We now report the identification and characterization of a novel mast cell isoform of Mitf, which we call Mitf-mc. Its expression appears to be restricted to the mast lineage, suggesting a distinct tissue-restricted promoter that allows for regulated expression within mast cells. In addition, despite sharing identical transactivation, DNA binding, and dimerization motifs with the other isoforms, Mitf-mc selectively transactivates the MMCP6 mast cell gene target promoter in reporter assays; it fails to activate the tyrosinase melanocyte target promoter when expressed either in melanocytes or mast cells. We show that selectivity for target promoters is largely mediated by the unique amino terminus of Mitf-mc. Mitf-mc homodimers bind melanocyte-specific DNA target sequences; thus, its failure to transactivate melanocyte targets is not explained by DNA binding preferences. Last, we examine the interaction of Mitf-mc with another closely related transcription factor, Tfe3, which is expressed in mast cells. Mitf-mc was able to bind to Tfe3 as expected and also dominantly inhibited the ability of Tfe3 to transactivate the tyrosinase promoter.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel mast cell isoform of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, which we call Mitf-mc. This gene is predicted to encode a unique amino terminus of the protein. The amino-terminal sequence does not resemble any known protein motifs. As expected, the mast cell isoform activates transcription of a mast cell Mitf target gene in reporter assays. Unexpectedly, however, this isoform could not transactivate the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter despite being capable of binding the DNA elements in the promoter. This observation suggests that the mechanism of selectivity for gene target activation is independent of DNA binding preferences and thus is probably due to differential recruitment of protein complexes to the amino terminus of mast cell Mitf. Since this differential effect is seen when a variety of cell types are studied (including melanocytes), the interacting protein(s) that mediate this selectivity are probably ubiquitous.We examined the interaction of the Mitf isoforms with Tfe3, a transcription factor closely related to Mitf, which is also expressed in mast cells and melanocytes. There was no difference in the ability of the melanocyte and mast cell isoforms to heterodimerize with Tfe3. However, in a functional assay, the mast cell Mitf isoform dominantly inhibited the transactivation activity of Tfe3 on a melanocyte-specific target promoter.These findings suggest several potential mechanisms that might account for the tissue-restricted action of mast cell Mitf. In chimeras, the mast cell amino terminus represses the transactivation potential of “core” Mitf for the tyrosinase but not the MMCP6 promoter. This suggests that transactivation of these two promoters by Mitf proceeds via distinct biochemical mechanisms that are harnessed by the mast cell isoform to permit tissue-restricted expression from one gene locus. One possible mechanism to account for these observations is that the mast cell amino terminus might recruit a factor that represses certain promoters (such as tyrosinase) but not others (MMCP6). One argument against this possibility is that the mast cell isoform generally exhibited failure to transactivate rather than true repression (below basal activity). Alternatively, the mast cell amino terminus might intramolecularly prevent association with direct mediators of transactivation, such as p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein. Such a mechanism would prevent activation without necessarily triggering true repression (other than by displacement of promoter elements from transactivating isoforms). The dominant inhibition of Tfe3 may come about either through competition by homodimers for the target promoter element or through heterodimers in which the Tfe3 monomer is insufficient to provide a full activation signal. Since Mitf is of major importance in the development of distinct cellular lineages, the identification of tissue-restricted activities by distinct isoforms is likely to provide key insights pertinent to developmental decisions. Further analysis of the mechanistic basis of this activity will thus be of importance. Mast cells are central effectors of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions.

Alternatively, the mast cell amino terminus might intramolecularly prevent association with direct mediators of transactivation, such as p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein. Such a mechanism would prevent activation without necessarily triggering true repression (other than by displacement of promoter elements from transactivating isoforms). The dominant inhibition of Tfe3 may come about either through competition by homodimers for the target promoter element or through heterodimers in which the Tfe3 monomer is insufficient to provide a full activation signal. Since Mitf is of major importance in the development of distinct cellular lineages, the identification of tissue-restricted activities by distinct isoforms is likely to provide key insights pertinent to developmental decisions. Further analysis of the mechanistic basis of this activity will thus be of importance. We have identified a novel mast cell isoform of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, which we call Mitf-mc. This gene is predicted to encode a unique amino terminus of the protein. The amino-terminal sequence does not resemble any known protein motifs. As expected, the mast cell isoform activates transcription of a mast cell Mitf target gene in reporter assays. Unexpectedly, however, this isoform could not transactivate the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter despite being capable of binding the DNA elements in the promoter. This observation suggests that the mechanism of selectivity for gene target activation is independent of DNA binding preferences and thus is probably due to differential recruitment of protein complexes to the amino terminus of mast cell Mitf. Since this differential effect is seen when a variety of cell types are studied (including melanocytes), the interacting protein(s) that mediate this selectivity are probably ubiquitous. We examined the interaction of the Mitf isoforms with Tfe3, a transcription factor closely related to Mitf, which is also expressed in mast cells and melanocytes. There was no difference in the ability of the melanocyte and mast cell isoforms to heterodimerize with Tfe3. However, in a functional assay, the mast cell Mitf isoform dominantly inhibited the transactivation activity of Tfe3 on a melanocyte-specific target promoter. These findings suggest several potential mechanisms that might account for the tissue-restricted action of mast cell Mitf. In chimeras, the mast cell amino terminus represses the transactivation potential of “core” Mitf for the tyrosinase but not the MMCP6 promoter. This suggests that transactivation of these two promoters by Mitf proceeds via distinct biochemical mechanisms that are harnessed by the mast cell isoform to permit tissue-restricted expression from one gene locus. One possible mechanism to account for these observations is that the mast cell amino terminus might recruit a factor that represses certain promoters (such as tyrosinase) but not others (MMCP6). One argument against this possibility is that the mast cell isoform generally exhibited failure to transactivate rather than true repression (below basal activity).

We investigated the participation of S1P as an inflammatory mediator by assessing interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion and phospholipase D (PLD) activation in human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B). S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, S1P5, and weak S1P2 receptors were detected in Beas-2B and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. S1P stimulated a rapid activation of PLD, which was nearly abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, consistent with S1P receptor/Gi protein coupling. S1P also markedly induced Beas-2B secretion of IL-8, a powerful neutrophil chemoattractant and activator, in a PTX-sensitive manner. This S1P-mediated response was dependent on transcription as indicated by a strong induction of IL-8 promoter-mediated luciferase activity in transfected Beas-2B cells and a complete inhibition by actinomycin D. Beas-2B exposure to 1-butanol, which converts the PLD-generated phosphatidic acid (PA) to phosphatidylbutanol by a transphosphatidylation reaction, significantly attenuated the S1P-induced IL-8 secretion, indicating the involvement of PLD-derived PA in the signaling pathway. Inhibition of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-stimulated IL-8 production by 1-butanol further strengthened this observation. Blocking protein kinase C and Rho kinase also attenuated S1P-induced IL-8 secretion. Our data suggest that PLD-derived PA, protein kinase C, and Rho are important signaling components in S1P-mediated IL-8 secretion by human bronchial epithelial cells.

The maintenance of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation requires intercellular communication between infiltrating cells, the endothelium, and the respiratory epithelium. Interleukin-8 (IL-8),1 a member of the CXC family of chemokines, primarily functions as a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils at sites of acute inflammation (1Baggiolini M. Walz A. Kunkel S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Studies supporting the involvement of IL-8 in pulmonary inflammatory disorders have revealed elevated levels of IL-8 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (2Goodman R.B.

Considerable attention has been recently given to the diverse biological effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid derived from sphingomyelin that is released by activated platelets and multiple other cells in response to a wide array of stimuli (12Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 13Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Thangada S. Thompson B.D. Kluk M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). S1P activates intracellular signaling pathways by ligating, with high affinity, members of a G protein-coupled lysophospholipid receptor family. S1P specifically binds 5 of the 12 identified lysophospholipid receptors, S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5, also known as endothelial differentiation gene (EDG)-1, EDG-5, EDG-3, EDG-6 and EDG-8, respectively (14Hla T.

Constitutively found in nanomolar to micromolar concentrations in human plasma and serum, S1P has been implicated in regulating cellular differentiation, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and apoptosis (15Yatomi Y.

Recently, S1P has been shown to be a complete angiogenic factor and the primary endothelial cell chemotactic factor in serum (19Liu F. Verin A.D. Wang P. Day R. Wersto R.P. Chrest F.J. English D.K.

FASEB J. 2001; 14: 2255-2265Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast to these vascular effects of S1P, reports in non-vascular tissue have described pro-inflammatory effects with IL-6 secretion in airway smooth muscle cells (21Ammit A.J. Hastie A.T. Edsall L.C. Hoffman R.K. Amrani Y. Krymskaya V.P. Kane S.A. Peters S.P. Penn R.B. Spiegel S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and increased expression of IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells (23Schwartz B.M. Hong G. Morrison B.H., Wu, W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y.J. Mok S.C. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 81: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated S1P levels have been measured in the airways of asthmatic (but not control) subjects following segmental antigen challenge in association with inflammatory cell and protein influx (21Ammit A.J. Hastie A.T. Edsall L.C. Hoffman R.K. Amrani Y. Krymskaya V.P. Kane S.A. Peters S.P. Penn R.B. Spiegel S. Panettieri R.A., Jr. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1212-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that extracellular S1P is a mediator of inflammation by regulating proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Phospholipase D (PLD), an important effector enzyme in receptor-mediated signaling pathways, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the most abundant membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, and generates choline and phosphatidic acid (PA). Choline is rapidly phosphorylated to phosphorylcholine, which plays a role in cell proliferation (24Jimenez B. del Peso L. Montaner S. Esteve P. Lacal J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PA and its metabolites, lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, also act as second messengers in the regulation of secretion, mitogenesis, and proliferation (25Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We and others (26Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 11: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have found that the S1P ligation of its G protein-coupled receptor results in a rapid activation of PLD in a variety of cell types. Furthermore, studies have suggested that PLD-derived PA is involved in thrombin-induced IL-6 synthesis in osteoblasts (29Kozawa O. Tokuda H. Kaida T. Matsuno H. Uematsu T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NFκB activation in a myeloblastic cell line (30Plo I. Lautier D. Levade T. Sekouri H. Jaffrezou J.P. Laurent G. Bettaieb A. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), implicating PLD-derived PA as a signaling mediator acting upstream of transcription. These studies support growing evidence that S1P is involved in the complex, tissue-specific process of inflammation. Because details and mechanisms of the inflammatory role of S1P remain unknown, we investigated the effect of S1P on bronchial epithelial PLD activation and its contribution to secretion of IL-8. Our results demonstrate that physiologically relevant concentrations of S1P markedly stimulated IL-8 secretion in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner, indicating the involvement of a Gi-linked S1P receptor. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PLD, along with PKC and Rho, participates in the S1P-mediated signal transduction pathway resulting in airway epithelial cell secretion of IL-8.

All other reagents were of analytical grade. Beas-2B bronchial epithelial cells (passage 32; kindly provided by Dr. Sherer Sanders, Johns Hopkins University) were cultured in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air to 60–70% confluence and serum-deprived by incubation for 12–18 h in MEM containing 0.1% FBS prior to IL-8 secretion experiments. For the PLD activity experiments, cells were effectively serum-deprived by prior overnight incubation in phosphate-free DMEM containing 2% FBS. All experiments with Beas-2B cells were conducted between 35 and 43 passages. Primary epithelial cells (HBEpC) were derived from surgical specimens of normal human bronchi from lung transplant donors and were isolated in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Schleimer (The Johns Hopkins University) by a modification of the method described by Schrothet al. (31Schroth M.K. Grimm E. Frindt P. Galagan D.M. Konno S.I. Love R. Gern J.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (32Wu R. Yankaskas J. Cheng E. Knowles M.R. Boucher R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 311-320PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, airway specimens were rinsed with HEPES-buffered saline solution and then placed in dissociation solution consisting of F-12 media supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and Pronase (1 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 48 h at 4 °C. After incubation, FBS (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 20%, and epithelial cells were detached from the stroma by gentle agitation. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in serum-free hormonally supplemented basal essential growth media (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). All primary cell cultures were grown in basal essential growth media in 35-mm dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Beas-2B and HBEp cells were rinsed two times with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mmglycerophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, and cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After determination of the total protein in the lysates by the bicinchoninic acid method, 6× Laemmli sample buffer was added to cell lysates, and the lysates were boiled for 5 min. Equally loaded proteins were separated on 12% gels by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting with either anti-S1P1 (1:200 dilution), anti-S1P2 (1:1,000 dilution), anti-S1P3 (1:1,000 dilution), anti-S1P4 (1:200 dilution), or anti-S1P5 (1:200 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed at least three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and were incubated for 2–4 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:2,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% BSA) or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk). The immunoblots were developed with ECL according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Beas-2B and HBEp cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, coverslips were incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA in TBST) for 30 min. To detect specific S1P receptors, primary antibody incubations with either S1P1 (1:200 dilution), S1P2 (1:400 dilution), S1P3 (1:1000 dilution), S1P4 (1:100 dilution), or S1P5 (1:100 dilution) were performed in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dye in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After the final 3 washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted using a commercial mounting medium (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Analyses of immunofluorescent staining were performed using a Nikon TE200-S fluorescent microscope with ×60 objective lens and Hamamatsu digital camera and appropriate filter. Beas-2B cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2% FBS for 18–24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. The radioactive medium was removed by aspiration. Pretreatments were in MEM alone or with the specified agents for 1 h prior to stimulation, with the exception of PTX, which was 2 h. Cells were incubated in MEM containing 0.1% BSA with or without S1P or other agents at the indicated concentrations and in the presence of 0.05% butanol for the specified lengths of time. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1 v/v), and lipids were extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) (33Natarajan V. Vepa S. Verma R.S. Scribner W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L400-L408PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]Phosphatidylbutanol (PBt) formed as a result of PLD activation, and concomitant transphosphatidylation reaction (an index of in vivo PLD activation) was separated by TLC with the upper phase of ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethyl pentane:glacial acetic acid:water (65:10:15:50 by volume) as the developing solvent system. Unlabeled PBt was added as a carrier during TLC separation of lipids and was visualized upon exposure to iodine vapors. PBt spots were marked, scraped, and radioactivity-associated PBt was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All values were normalized to 1 million disintegrations/min in total lipid extract and [32P]PBt formed was expressed as dpm/dish or % control. Beas-2B cells were pretreated in MEM with or without PTX (40 ng/ml for 2 h), actinomycin D (1 μg/ml for 1 h), BIM (1 μm for 1 h), or Y27632 (indicated dose for 1 h) prior to stimulation. The pretreatment media were removed, and the cells were treated in MEM containing 0.1% BSA with or without S1P or other agonists at the indicated concentrations for the specified lengths of time. For the experiments involving 1- or 3-butanol (0.05%), pretreatments were for 15 min prior to stimulation, and the alcohol incubations were continued during stimulation with S1P. Cell supernatants were removed, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and frozen at −80 °C for later analysis for IL-8 by ELISA, which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). The human IL-8/luciferase (hIL-8/Luc) reporter plasmid contained the −162 to +44 nucleotide region of the IL-8 promoter cloned into the poLUC reporter plasmid (generously provided by Dr. Allan R. Brasier, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, and Dr. Jeffrey Hasday, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore, MD) (34Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Beas-2B cells at 50–60% confluency were transfected in 35-mm diameter dishes by incubating overnight in 1 ml of Opti-MEM premixed with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 1 μg of hIL-8/Luc reporter plasmid. After 18 h, without changing the medium, the cells were treated with MEM containing 0.1% BSA with or without S1P (final concentration as indicated) for the specified lengths of time. After 6 h of treatment, the medium was removed; the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, and lysates were prepared to independently measure luciferase activity. Luciferase was then normalized to total protein concentrations. S.D. for each data point was calculated from triplicate samples. Unless otherwise stated, data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance, and pairwise multiple comparison was done by Dunnett's method with p < 0.05. S1P binds multiple members of a G protein-coupled receptor family with tissue-specific receptor expression noted in various reports (12Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). S1P1, S1P3, and weak S1P2expression have been demonstrated in an immortalized nasal polyp epithelial cell line (35Orlati S. Porcelli A.M. Hrelia S. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Rugolo M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). S1P4, a recently cloned member of this lysophospholipid family of receptors that preferentially binds S1P, is expressed in lymphoid, hematopoietic tissue, and the lung (36Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The other known S1P-specific receptor, S1P5, is widely expressed in the brain, as well as the lung, spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and aorta (37Im D.S. Clemens J. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14053-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We first examined which S1P receptors were present in Beas-2B and HBEp cells by Western blot analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, S1P1(44 kDa), S1P3 (45 kDa), S1P4 (52 kDa), S1P5 (42 kDa), and faint S1P2 (45 kDa) receptor proteins were detected in both Beas-2B and HBEp cells. Complementing our Western blot results, immunocytochemical localization using S1P receptor antibodies on Beas-2B and HBEp cells is shown in Fig. 1. Immunofluorescent images shown are representative of the homogeneity of the monolayer visualized under the microscope. Overall, the distribution and localization of the individual S1P receptors were very similar for Beas-2B cells and HBEpC. In addition to localization at the plasma membrane, S1P1 was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane and was generally excluded from the nucleus. S1P2 was barely detectable as compared with the staining of the other S1P receptors. The distribution of S1P3 appeared punctate and located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Both S1P4 and S1P5 were primarily localized in the nucleus but were also observed in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Collectively, these findings indicate that the same S1P receptors are endogenously present in both Beas-2B and HBEp cells and that they are of similar quantities and distribution. The activation of PLD, a crucial signaling enzyme in secretory pathways, by S1P has been demonstrated in endothelial cells (28Natarajan V. Jayaram H.N. Scribner W.M. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and other cell types, including the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line (38Meacci E. Vasta V. Moorman J.P. Bobak D.A. Bruni P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18605-18612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1-butanol (0.05%), PLD catalyzes a transphosphatidylation reaction to form PBt instead of PA. By using [32P]PBt formation as an index of PLD activation, a 15-min stimulation of Beas-2B cells with S1P activated PLD in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2A). The activation was significant with 100 nm S1P (2.9-fold over control) increasing 4.5-fold with 1 μm S1P, within physiological concentrations of S1P found in human serum (39Igarashi Y. Yatomi Y. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). S1P (1 μm) induced a rapid activation of PLD in Beas-2B cells (Fig. 2B), significantly increasing after 1 min of stimulation and reaching a maximum at 5 min (4.8-fold over control). This response was somewhat sustained for 30 min but declined after 1 h. Because the S1P-specific receptors are capable of coupling to G proteins (40Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 41Van Brocklyn J.R. Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Hobson J.P. Lipp M. Spiegel S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the S1P-stimulated PLD activity after 2 h of pretreatment with PTX (40 ng/ml), which ADP-ribosylates and specifically inactivates Gi proteins. PTX pretreatment nearly abolished the S1P-induced PLD activity (Fig.3), suggesting the underlying signal transduction occurs via a Gi-coupled S1P receptor. Extracellular S1P has been shown to activate IL-6 secretion in osteoblasts (22Kozawa O. Tokuda H. Matsuno H. Uematsu T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that exogenous S1P can induce IL-6 secretion in human airway smooth muscle (21Ammit A.J. Hastie A.T. Edsall L.C. Hoffman R.K. Amrani Y. Krymskaya V.P. Kane S.A. Peters S.P. Penn R.B. Spiegel S. Panettieri R.A., Jr. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1212-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells (23Schwartz B.M. Hong G. Morrison B.H., Wu, W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y.J. Mok S.C. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 81: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Increases in IL-8 production by airway epithelial cells have been linked to G protein-coupled receptor activation (42Jbilo O. Derocq J.M. Segui M., Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of S1P to modulate bronchial epithelial IL-8 secretion. Treatment of Beas-2B cells with S1P for 3 h resulted in a dose-dependent secretion of IL-8 (Fig.4A) with significant production at 100 nm (1.4-fold over control) and 4.6-fold over control at 1 μm. As with the activation of PLD, IL-8 secretion induced by S1P occurred at physiological concentrations. The release of IL-8 into the medium by Beas-2B cells upon stimulation with S1P (1 μm) significantly increased after 3 h (10-fold) and plateaued for 24 h (Fig. 4B). This time course of IL-8 secretion suggests that S1P-mediated signaling results in regulation of IL-8 at the transcriptional level. To test whether S1P stimulated IL-8 gene expression, the reporter gene luciferase under control of the −162 to +44-nt region of the IL-8 promoter was transfected in Beas-2B cells. As shown in Fig.5A, S1P treatment (1 μm for 6 h) resulted in a 14-fold induction of IL-8 promoter-mediated luciferase activity. Pretreatment of Beas-2B cells for 1 h with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) (an antibiotic inhibitor of transcription) abolished the IL-8 response to S1P (Fig. 5B). These observations confirmed that the downstream effects of S1P occurred at the transcriptional level in inducing IL-8 secretion.FIG. 5S1P-mediated IL-8 transcription. A, Beas-2B cells were grown in 35-mm dishes to 50–60% confluence and transiently transfected with a −162/+44-nt IL-8 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. Eighteen h after transfection, cells were incubated for 6 h with 0.1% BSA (vehicle) or 0.1% BSA plus S1P (1 μm). Luciferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and normalized to total protein. B, Beas-2B cells were grown in 35-mm dishes to 60–70% confluence and serum-deprived for 12–18 h in MEM containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with MEM in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (ActD)(1 μg/ml). Cells were then treated for 3 h with MEM with 0.1% BSA (vehicle) or MEM with 0.1% BSA plus S1P (1 μm). IL-8 secreted into the medium was quantified by ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations and are representative of at least three independent experiments. *, values significantly different from vehicle control (p < 0.05). **, value significantly different from S1P treatment (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the signal transduction involves coupling to Gi proteins, we next studied the IL-8 response in the presence or absence of PTX (40 ng/ml).

PCC 6803, transcription of the <i>mntCAB</i> operon, encoding a high affinity Mn transporter, occurs under Mn starvation (nm Mn) conditions but not in Mn-sufficient (μm Mn) growth medium. Using a strain in which the promoter of this operon directs the transcription of the <i>luxAB</i> reporter genes, we determined that inactivation of the <i>slr0640</i> gene, which encodes a histidine kinase sensor protein component of a two-component signal transduction system, resulted in constitutive high levels of<i>lux</i> luminescence. Systematic targeted inactivation mutagenesis also identified <i>slr1837</i> as the gene encoding the corresponding response regulator protein. We have named these two genes <i>manS</i> (manganese-sensor) and<i>manR</i> (manganese-regulator), respectively. A polyhistidine-tagged form of the ManS protein was localized in the <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 cell membrane. Directed replacement of the conserved catalytic His-205 residue of this protein by Leu abolished its activity, although the mutated protein was present in cyanobacterial membrane. This mutant also showed suboptimal rates of Mn uptake under either Mn-starved or Mn-sufficient growth condition. These data suggest that the ManS/ManR two-component system plays a central role in the homeostasis of manganese in<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2144135799,"Abstract Following prenylation, the proteins are subject to two prenyl-dependent modifications at their C-terminal end, which are required for their subcellular targeting. First, the three C-terminal residues of the CAAX box prenylation signaling motif are removed, which is followed by methylation of the free carboxyl group of the prenyl cysteine moiety. AnArabidopsis homologue of the yeast CAAXprotease STE24 (AFC1) was cloned and expressed in rce1Δ ste24Δ mutant yeast to demonstrate functional complementation. The petunia calmodulin CaM53 is a prenylated protein terminating in a CTIL CAAX box. Coupled methylation proteolysis assays demonstrated the processing of CaM53 by AtSTE24. In addition, AtSTE24 promoted plasma membrane association of the GFP-RacU88402fusion protein, which terminates with a CLLM CAAX box. Interestingly, a plant homologue of the second and major CAAX protease in yeast and animal cells, RCE1, was not identified despite the availability of vast amounts of sequence data. Taken together, these data suggest that AtSTE24 may process several prenylated proteins in plant cells, unlike its yeast homologue, which processes only a-mating factor, and its mammalian homologue, for which prenyl-CAAX substrates have not been established. Transient expression of GFPAtSTE24 in leaf epidermal cells ofNicotiana benthamiana showed that AtSTE24 is exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that prenylated proteins in plants are first targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum following their prenylation."

In this study, we show that treatment of rat and human aortic VSMC with 50 microM 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3,5,7-triol (catechin) and epicatechin (EC) fails to inhibit the PDGF-Rb-activated intracellular signal transduction pathway and VSMC growth. In contrast, 10-50 microM epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG), epicatechin-3 gallate (ECG), and catechin-3 gallate (CG), which all have a galloyl group in the 3-position of the catechin structure, effectively inhibit tyrosine-phosphorylation of PDGF-Rb, PI 3'-K, and PLC-gamma1 as well as the PDGF-BB-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. The PDGF-BB-induced increase in DNA synthesis and cell number was inhibited by ECG, EGCG, and CG, but not by catechin and EC. Epigallocatechin (EGC) that has a galloyl group in the 2-position effectively inhibited VSMC growth without affecting the PDGF-Rb signal pathway. A reduction of 45% and 70% of the intimal and medial cell number in the S-phase, respectively, has been observed in the catheter-injured left carotid artery 7 days after treatment of Wistar Kyoto rats with 10 mg/day EGCG. These results suggest that the galloyl group in the P3-position of the catechin structure is essential for inhibiting the PDGF-Rbeta-mediated intracellular signal transduction pathway."

Cysteine string proteins (Csps) are J-domain-containing, membrane-associated proteins that have been functionally implicated in regulated exocytosis. Therefore, we evaluated the possibility that Csp is involved in regulated CFTR trafficking. We found Csp expressed in mammalian epithelial cell lines, several of which express CFTR. In Calu-3 airway cells, immunofluorescence colocalized Csp with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum and with CFTR at the apical membrane domain. CFTR coprecipitated with Csp from Calu-3 cell lysates. Csp associated with both core-glycosylated immature and fully glycosylated mature CFTRs (bands B and C); however, in relation to the endogenous levels of the B and C bands expressed in Calu-3 cells, the Csp interaction with band B predominated. In vitro protein binding assays detected physical interactions of both mammalian Csp isoforms with the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus, having submicromolar affinities. InXenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, Csp overexpression decreased the chloride current and membrane capacitance increases evoked by cAMP stimulation and decreased the levels of CFTR protein detected by immunoblot.

Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis, whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway produces secretory diarrhea. The folding of CFTR is energetically complex; misfolding and degradation of the protein are features of the most common CFTR mutation (ΔF508) (2Qu B.H. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 5: 483-490Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Skach W.R. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 825-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, ΔF508 CFTR is unable to undergo ATP-dependent conformational changes in the ER that are required for its proper folding. When CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a target for proteolysis by ER-associated degradation mechanisms that police the protein secretory pathway for misfolded or incompletely complexed proteins (4Brodsky J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L39-L42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This degradation involves ubiquitination of the aberrant protein and its delivery to the proteasome (5Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 6Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopita R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Nearly all of the ΔF508 CFTR produced by the cell is destroyed in this manner; and because of its complex folding pattern, much of the wild-type protein is also degraded. The mechanisms that govern CFTR folding/degradation processes are facilitated by chaperone and co-chaperone protein interactions (discussed further below). The primary step in CFTR activation involves cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of its central regulatory (R) domain, which not only permits the channel to gate, but also alters pathways for CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane (7Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In recent years, protein interactions at several CFTR domains have been implicated in channel function and trafficking. The N-terminal cytosolic tail of CFTR is a site of syntaxin 1A binding (8Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and syntaxin 1A overexpression is thought to inhibit CFTR currents by reducing channel gating (9Naren A.P. Di A. Cormet-Boyaka E.

J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A motif promoting CFTR endocytosis has been identified at the C terminus, and this region interacts physically with the plasma membrane endocytic adapter (AP-2) complex (11Prince L.S. Peter K.

The C terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1) binding motif, which interacts with ezrin radixin moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or E3KARP to bring ezrin into proximity with CFTR (13Short D.B.

Csp null mutants in Drosophila produce a temperature-sensitive block of synaptic transmission followed by paralysis and premature death. These findings demonstrate a crucial role for Csp in neurosecretion (22Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S.

Wollheim C.B. Lang J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have confirmed that altered Csp expression elicits an impaired secretory phenotype. Csps contain an N-terminal “J-domain,” a central cysteine-rich “string” region, and a phylogenetically more variable C-terminal domain. The J-domains of Csps are structurally conserved among different species, and this region provides a fingerprint of Csp as a member of the DnaJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein) chaperone family. As observed for other chaperone proteins (29Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), the HPD motif of the Csp J-domain mediates its binding to and activation of the Hsc70 chaperone ATPases, which influence protein conformation/binding. Structural predictions indicate that the C terminus of Csp1 may form a coiled-coil region, and this structure may be important in view of the emerging evidence that Csp can interact with proteins involved in exocytosis, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxins 1A and 4 (21Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,30Leveque C. Pupier S. Marqueze B. Geslin L. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10270-10279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, prior results suggest that Csp could link functions of the SNARE complex with those of Hsc70. The concept that assembly of the core fusion complex requires chaperone activity has been raised previously (21Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, the explicit roles of Csp and Hsc70 in the assembly or disassembly of SNARE components are not yet known. The C terminus of Csp contains the only primary structural difference that exists between the mammalian isoforms: full-length Csp1, and its C-terminal truncated variant, Csp2 (32Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Mastrogiacomo A. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Csp expression in epithelial cells has not been characterized previously. We found that various mammalian epithelial cell lines express two Csp isoforms and that the expression of Csp1 predominated over that of Csp2. In Calu-3 airway epithelial cells, Csp partially colocalized with CFTR in the ER and apical plasma membrane domains. Csp coprecipitated with CFTR from Calu-3 cell lysates and bound selectively to the N terminus and R-domain of CFTR with high affinity. Coexpression of Csp isoforms with CFTR inhibited the functional responses associated with its cAMP stimulation, and exogenous Csp expression decreased the production of mature CFTR. These findings suggest that Csp is a CFTR-binding partner that can influence the biogenesis and trafficking of CFTR. Protein A/G-agarose beads andTaq polymerase were purchased from Invitrogen.

The following primers were used: 5′-ATTAGGATCCatggcagaccagagacagc (sense for human Csp;BamHI restriction site underlined), 5′-ACGAATTCTTAGTTGAACCCGTCAGTGTG (antisense for human Csp;EcoRI restriction site underlined), 5′-ATTAGGATCCATGGCAGATCAGCGGCAGC (sense forXenopus Csp), and 5′-ACGAATTCTCAGTTGAATCCATCGGTGTG (antisense forXenopus Csp). PCR products from Calu-3 and A6 cells were cloned into the pCRII vector using the TOPO cloning reaction and transformation kit (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Crude membranes from various epithelial cell lines or oocytes were prepared as described by Lang et al. (37Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To prepare crude membrane extracts, epithelial cells were detached by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with 1× trypsin, and after two washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min.

After washing away apical secretions, cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde) and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100). Filters were mounted on glass coverslips, and images were obtained using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope as described (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Wild-type Csp1 and Csp2 were subcloned into pGEX-6p-1. cDNAs encoding GST-CFTR R-domain (GST-R), GST-CFTR N terminus (GST-N) and GST-CFTR C terminus (GST-C) were described previously (15Sun F.

GST-CFTR-N random was constructed as GST-N, except for a one-nucleotide shift in the reading frame, which yields a different amino acid composition; its net charge and size are comparable with CFTR-N. Purification and dialysis of GST fusion proteins were performed as described by Sun et al. (15Sun F. Hug M.J. Lewarchik C.M. Yun C.-H.C. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Calu-3 membrane fractions were added, and the incubation continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. After five washes with DIGNAM-D buffer, samples were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-Csp antibodies (1:2,000). Coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described by Sun et al. (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 10 μg of GST-CFTR-R or GST-CFTR-N fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with 106 cpm of 35S-labeled Csp1 or Csp2 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled Csp1 or Csp2. After five washes, samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and signals visualized by autoradiography. HEK293 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the indicated pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids, 4 μg of cDNA/dish. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and either prepared for pulse-chase assays or lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.09% Nonidet 40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and 10 mmNaMoO4). Samples were incubated for 2 h in the appropriate lysis buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were utilized for immunoblot analysis (see figure legends). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of CFTR were performed using methods described previously (39Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfected HEK293 cells were starved in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min, and then metabolically labeled with Redivue Pro-mixl-35S (140 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed immediately or incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the indicated chase periods. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described (40Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) using M3A7 anti-CFTR, kindly supplied by Dr. John R. Riordan. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed using 7% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. CFTR, Csp1, and Csp2 cRNAs were synthesized using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) from linearized plasmids. The quality of synthesized cRNA was determined by spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocyte preparation and cRNA injections were carried out as described by Takahashi et al. (41Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M.B. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1-C8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression proceeded for 2–6 days before current and capacitance recordings, which were performed as described (10Peters K.W. Qi J.-J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M.B. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1-C8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All data are provided as the mean ± S.E. Immunoblotting was performed to determine whether Csp is expressed in several epithelial cell lines. Crude membrane extracts from the mammalian cells HEK293, Madin-Darby canine kidney (type 2), CFPAC-1, Calu-3, and T84, and from the Xenopus A6 cell line were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti-Csp antiserum that does not distinguish between Csp isoforms (32Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As a positive control, membranes from the SY5Y human neuronal (hippocampal) cell line were applied to the gel. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all of the mammalian epithelial cells examined expressed two Csp isoforms. The upper bands in Fig. 1 A are appropriate in size for Csp1 (33–35 kDa), whereas the lower bands in mammalian cells correspond to the size expected for Csp2 (26–28 kDa); this isoform was uniformly less abundant. In contrast, A6 cells expressed only one Csp isoform. It is more closely related to Csp1 than Csp2 (33Mastrogiacomo A. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although its molecular size is slightly smaller than the Csp1 in mammalian cells. The Csp antiserum also recognized in vitro synthesized Csp1 and Csp2 (data not shown). To confirm the expression of Csp isoforms in these cells, reverse transcription-PCR was employed, and the results are shown in Fig.1 B. The sizes of the PCR products were as expected for the cDNAs encoding Csp1 and Csp2. These products are not derived from contaminating DNA because the primers employed span Csp exons. Csp2 protein is truncated relative to Csp1 because of the insertion of a stop codon-containing RNA splice fragment (32Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); this accounts for the smaller size of the Csp2 protein but its larger cDNA and PCR product (Fig. 1 B). Although the PCR results are not quantitative, the Csp amplicon ratios from different cell lines generally agreed with the pattern of isoform expression observed by immunoblot. As with the protein analysis, Csp isoforms were expressed at lower levels in T84 cells. Only one isoform of Csp was detected in A6 cells, in accord with the protein data (Fig. 1 A) and information in the data base. Sequencing of these PCR products confirmed the expression of Csp1 and 2 in Calu-3 cells, and of the single isoform (33Mastrogiacomo A. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) reported in Xenopus A6 epithelia (data not shown). In non-epithelial cells, Csps are membrane-associated and are localized predominantly on large dense core vesicles or synaptic-like microvesicles (22Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N.

A small fraction of Csp is located on the plasma membranes of neurons, neuroendocrine or endocrine cells. Large dense core vesicles are present in epithelial cells having defined secretory products (e.g. pancreatic acinar cells), but Csp distribution in epithelial cells has not been defined previously. To examine the subcellular distribution of Csps in airway epithelial cells, immunofluorescent staining was performed in polarized Calu-3 cells and visualized using confocal microscopy. Sections"

Whereas the involvement of Gi, Gq, G12, or G13 proteins in thrombin signaling has been investigated extensively, the role of Go proteins has largely been ignored. To determine whether Go proteins could contribute to thrombin-mediated signaling in endothelial cells, we have developed minigenes that encode an 11-amino acid C-terminal peptide of Go1 proteins. Previously, we have shown that use of the C-terminal minigenes can specifically block receptor activation of G protein families (1Gilchrist A. Vanhauwe J.F., Li, A. Thomas T.O. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.

In this study, we demonstrate that Go proteins are present in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs). Moreover, we show that thrombin receptors can stimulate [35S]guanosine-5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding to Go proteins when co-expressed in Sf9 membranes. The potential coupling of thrombin receptors to Go proteins was substantiated by transfection of the Go1 minigene into HMECs, which led to a blockade of thrombin-stimulated release of [Ca2+]i from intracellular stores. Transfection of the β-adrenergic kinase C terminus blocked the [Ca2+]i response to the same extent as with Go1 minigene peptide, suggesting that this Go-mediated [Ca2+]i transient was caused by Gβγ stimulation of PLCβ. Transfection of a Gi1/2 minigene had no effect on thrombin-stimulated [Ca2+]i signaling in HMEC, suggesting that Gβγ derived from Go but not Gi could activate PLCβ. The involvement of Go proteins on events downstream from calcium signaling was further evidenced by investigating the effect of Go1 minigenes on thrombin-stimulated stress fiber formation and endothelial barrier permeability. Both of these effects were sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment and could be blocked by transfection of Go1minigenes but not Gi1/2 minigenes. We conclude that the Go proteins play a role in thrombin signaling distinct from Gi1/2 proteins, which are mediated through their Gβγ subunits and involve coupling to calcium signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements.

In addition, thrombin plays a central role in a variety of biological functions such as platelet aggregation, mitogenesis of fibroblasts, monocytic cell chemotaxis, and endothelial cell monolayer permeability (2Bevilacqua M.P. Gimbrone M.A., Jr. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Wu K.K. Thiagarajan P. Annu. Rev.

Many of its actions, including the regulation of biochemical, transcriptional, and functional responses in endothelial cells occur through activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs),1 which belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Four PARs have been cloned so far, but only PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 can be activated by thrombin (5Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). The activation and signal transduction pathways of PAR1, the prototype of the PAR family, have been studied in great detail. Thrombin cleaves the N-terminal extracellular domain of PAR1 at a specific site, which unmasks a new N terminus that then serves as a tethered agonist ligand and activates the receptor by binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor (6Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cleaved,i.e. irreversibly activated, PAR1 can couple to members of the Gi/o, Gq, and G12/13 protein families and regulate a variety of intracellular effectors (1Gilchrist A. Vanhauwe J.F., Li, A.

Although the role of Go proteins has been generally believed to be confined to the brain and heart, several reports indicate that Go proteins may serve to regulate various intracellular pathways in non-neuronal cell lines (7Kajiyama Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8483-8487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several new effectors have been identified that are specifically or differentially regulated by Go proteins (versusGi proteins) (9Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol.

Pertussis toxin (PTX)-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the Cys351 residue in the C terminus of Gi and Go proteins disables their interaction with receptors and thus prevents receptor-mediated activation of these G proteins. Many effects of thrombin are mediated through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (12Huang C.L. Cogan M.G. Cragoe E.J., Jr. Ives H.E. J. Biol.

This method, however, does not distinguish between Gi and Goproteins, and the importance of the latter subtype could be inadequately appreciated (5Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). To dissect out the contribution of Gi1/2 and Go1 proteins in thrombin-regulated signaling pathways in HMECs, we have designed a dominant negative strategy based on minigene vectors that encode the C-terminal 11-amino acid sequence from Gα. Previously, we have shown that these minigenes are quite specific in such a way that Gq-based minigenes blocked only thrombin activation of Gq protein-mediated pathways (phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis and intracellular calcium increase) but not Gi1/2 or G12/13protein-mediated pathways (1Gilchrist A.

The specificity of Gα C-terminal peptides has been shown dramatically by Gilchrist et al.(20Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M.R. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Proctor W.R. Lupica C.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Hamm H.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), where one or two amino acid substitutions inhibited the ability of peptides to block receptor-mediated activation of signaling pathways. To delineate specific functions for Gi and Goproteins in the signaling of thrombin receptors, we have introduced these minigenes into HMECs. Our findings indicate that HMECs contain Go proteins and that PAR1 has the potential to couple to Gi and Go proteins when co-expressed in Sf9 cell membranes. In addition, we show that Go1minigenes block thrombin-stimulated release of [Ca2+]i, whereas Gi1/2minigenes do not. The involvement of Go proteins, but not Gi proteins, was further established in pathways that are known to be downstream of calcium signaling, such as stress fiber formation and endothelial barrier permeability. Together our data demonstrate the importance of Go proteins in the signaling of thrombin receptors in endothelial cells. All of the cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C and at an ambient atmosphere in suspension in a shaking incubator and transfected as described before (21Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Harvested Sf9 cells were washed with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, resuspended in hypotonic 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Bio-Homogenizer (BioSpec Products, Inc.) at high speed. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. [35S]GTPγS binding experiments were performed as described previously (22Vanhauwe J.F. Ercken M. van de Wiel D. Jurzak M. Leysen J.E. Psychopharmacology. 2000; 150: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of Sf9 cell membrane protein was diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml saponin, and 1 μm GDP and preincubated with TRAP for 15 min at room temperature in a volume of 125 μl in a 96-well plate. Then 25 μl of [35S]GTPγS diluted 1000-fold in assay buffer was added to the wells, and the assay mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by rapid filtration, after which the filters were washed four times with 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. Filter-bound radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Nonspecific [35S]GTPγS binding was measured in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS and never exceeded 10% of basal binding. Basal [35S]GTPγS binding was estimated in the absence of TRAP. For our studies we used a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line that was transformed using SV-40 (HMEC-1; obtained from Dr. E. Ades (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA). The cells were maintained in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml; 5000 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (500 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (0.01 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and subcultured after detachment with 0.05% trypsin,/0.5 mm EDTA. All of the studies utilized cell passages 18–26. cDNA minigene constructs were designed as described previously (19Gilchrist A. Bunemann M., Li, A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (βARK-ct) has been shown to be a potent and specific Gβγ inhibitor (23Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The βARK-ct construct codes for residues 548–671 of the rat homolog βARK. Retroviral minigenes were constructed as follows. The cDNA encoding the last 11 amino acids of human Gα subunits (Gαi1/2 and Gαo) or the Gαi1/2 C terminus in random order (GαiR) were synthesized (Great American Gene Company) with newly engineered 5′- and 3′-ends. The 5′-end contained a BamHI site followed by the ribosome-binding consensus sequence (5′-GCCGCCACC-3′), a methionine (ATG) for translation initiation, and a glycine (GGA) to protect the ribosome-binding site during translation and the nascent peptide against proteolytic degradation. A HindIII site was synthesized at the 3′-end immediately following the translational stop codon (TGA). The DNA was brought up in sterile double distilled H2O (stock concentration, 100 μm). Complimentary DNA was annealed in 1× NE Buffer 3 (50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol; New England Biolabs) at 85 °C for 10 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The annealed cDNA were ligated for 1 h at room temperature into a Tet-inducible retroviral vector pRevTRE2 in murine Maloney tumor virus (CLONTECH) previously cut with BamHI andHindIII. Following ligation, the samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min to deactivate the T4 DNA ligase. The ligation reaction (1 μl) was electroporated into 50 μl of competent ARI814 cells (Bio-Rad Escherichia coli Pulsar), and the cells were immediately placed into 1 ml of superoptimal catabolite medium (Invitrogen). After 1 h at 37 °C, 100 μl was spread on LB/ampicillin plates and incubated at 37 °C for 12–16 h. To verify that insert was present, several colonies were grown overnight in LB/ampicillin, and their plasmid DNA was purified (Qiagen SpinKit). The plasmid DNA was digested withNcoI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C and run on a 1.5% (3:1) agarose gel. Vector alone produced one band (6.5 kb), whereas vector with insert resulted in two bands (5.1 and 1.4 kb). DNA with the correct pattern was sequenced (Northwestern University Biotechnology Center) to confirm the appropriate sequence. For optimal results, the retroviral vectors were packaged using the pantropic GP-293 cell line (CLONTECH) with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, an envelope glycoprotein from the vesicular stomatitis virus. As a control, we used the enhanced GFP inserted into the parental vector (pRevTRE2-dEGFP; CLONTECH). Retroviral minigenes were generated by infecting the packaging cells GP-293 with pRevTRE2 minigenes and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein using Effectene reagent according to instructions from the manufacturer (CLONTECH). 12–16 h later, the medium was replaced by 5 ml of fresh medium/10-cm dish, and the virus produced by the cells was collected 2–3 days post-transfection by filtration through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filters and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The virus titer reached 4 × 106plaque-forming units/ml. For pcDNA-based minigenes, HMECs were transiently transfected with DNA (2 μg/100-mm plate or 500 ng/well for a 6-well plate) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). To monitor the efficiency of transfection, the cells were co-transfected with pEGFP, a plasmid vector containing enhanced green fluorescent protein to monitor stress fiber formation, or DsRED (CLONTECH), a plasmid vector containing red fluorescent protein for [Ca2+]i imaging. After 3 h, the medium was changed, and fresh medium was added. After 48 h, the cells co-transfected with the fluorescent proteins were replated onto coverslips and analyzed using a fluorescent microscope to determine the efficiency of transfection. Adenylyl cyclase and HMEC monolayer permeability experiments were performed using cells infected with retroviral minigenes. HMECs were infected with retroviral minigene virus (2 × 106 plaque-forming units/well for 6-well plate). The expression of the minigene peptide was induced 24 h after viral infection with 2 μg/ml doxycyclin, and the experiments were performed 24 h after induction. Use of retroviral minigenes led to ∼100% transfection efficiency. This was confirmed using infection of the pRevTRE2-dEGFP vector, which exhibited expression of GFP in virtually every cell (data not shown). Endothelial cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% separating gel under reducing conditions. For immunoblotting analysis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using standard semi-dry transfer method. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with indicated primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) at 4 °C overnight. Following washes, the membranes were incubated at room temperature with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and detected using luminol-based chemiluminescent detection system (LumiGLO, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). HMECs were seeded onto 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with retroviral minigene constructs, and 24 h before the assay, the cells were seeded into a 24-well plate. Thereafter, the cells were washed once with serum-free medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and further incubated for 20 min in 500 μl of serum-free medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After the preincubation, 50 μl of preincubation medium supplemented with forskolin (final concentration, 10 μm) was added to each well. To detect the inhibitory effect, 100 nm thrombin or 10 μm NECA was added along with forskolin. Basal cAMP accumulation was measured in the absence of forskolin and compounds. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCLO4. The samples were frozen and thawed, and 200 μl of KOH/K3PO4 (0.5 m, pH 13.5) was added to neutralize the samples (final pH, 7.4). After formation of the KClO4 precipitate (30 min at 4 °C), the plates were centrifuged (10 min at 650 × g, 4 °C). The amount of cAMP in each well was determined with a commercial125I-labeled cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). In single cell fluorescence measurements, the DsRED (CLONTECH) fluorescence reporter gene was used to confirm the transfected cells. HMECs were transfected with pcDNA-Gi1/2, pcDNA-Go1, or pcDNA-GiR minigene DNA and with or without βARK-ct DNA along with DsRED. After 48 h, the cells were transferred to coverslips at a low confluency in a 24-well plate and allowed to adhere for at least 2 h. The medium was aspirated, and each coverslip was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of loading buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.83 mm Na2HPO4, 0.17 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm mannose) containing 0.1% (v/v) Pluronic F127 and 10 μm Oregon Green Bapta-1 acetoxymethyl ester. The cells were washed twice with and incubated in Ca2+ buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.55 mmMgCl2). The coverslips were placed in the chamber that was mounted on the stage of an upright microscope. The experiment was performed at room temperature. The transfected cells were identified using a green filter by observing DsRED fluorescence. The basal conditions were established for 40 s before addition of thrombin (∼70 nm). Recordings (exposure time) were made every 10 s and continued for 170 s after stimulation with thrombin. The images were quantified using the NIH Image Program. As a marker for transfected cells, the pEGFP plasmid containing the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein was transiently co-transfected together with minigene constructs as described above. HMECs were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips, serum-starved for 24 h, washed with HBSS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in 100 mm glycine in HBSS to quench and remove the fixative followed by three washes for 10 min in HBSS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed three times for 10 min in HBSS. Thereafter, the cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 200 nm Alexa Fluor 568-phallodin to visualize polymerized F-actin. The coverslips were washed three times for 10 min in HBSS and labeled with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min to visualize the nucleus. The coverslips were finally washed three times for 10 min in HBSS and mounted on a drop of ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). The cells were observed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (New York, NY) using 364-, 488-, and 568-nm excitation laser lines to detect DAPI (BP 385–470 nm emission), fluorescein isothiocyanate/Alexa 488 (BP505–550 emission), and rhodamine/Alexa 568 fluorescence (LP585 emission) with the ×63 1.4 NA water immersion objective. The acquired images were later assembled using Adobe Photoshop, MS PowerPoint, and Macromedia Freehand image processing software. Endothelial cell retraction measured in real time in response to thrombin was measured as described before (24Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). HMECs were infected with retroviral minigene constructs and seeded on gelatin-coated gold electrodes (4.9 × 104 cm2) and grown to confluence. The small and larger counter electrodes were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was applied by a 1 V, 4000 Hz AC signal connected serially to 1mΩ resistor between the small and large counter electrodes. The voltage between the small electrode and the large counter electrode was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer. The same computer controlled the output of the amplifier and switched the measurement to different electrodes in the course of the experiment. Prior to the experiments, the monolayers were washed two times with serum-free medium and incubated for 2 h in 1% serum-supplemented medium. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student’s t test. The experimental values were considered significant at p < 0.05. Thrombin is known to couple to multiple G proteins including Gi, Gq, and G12/13proteins (25Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activation of the thrombin receptor results in initiating an array of signal transduction pathways such as phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, mobilization of Ca2+ stores, induction of stress fiber formation, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (1Gilchrist A.

Some signaling pathways regulated by thrombin have been shown to be sensitive to PTX,e.g. intracellular calcium release, activation of Na+/H+ exchanger, arachidonic acid release, induction of PAR1 gene expression, von Willebrand Factor release, and endothelial relaxation (12Huang C.L.

PTX abolishes the interaction between receptors and all members of the Gi subfamily (except Gz) through ADP-ribosylation of the Cys351residue in the C terminus of the Gα subunit. The effect of PTX has often been attributed to Gi proteins, because Go proteins are generally believed to play a role in the brain, where it constitutes about 1% of the total protein content (26Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PAR1, the most characterized thrombin receptor, can potentially couple to Go proteins, we expressed this receptor in Sf9 cells along with Gαo1, Gβ1 and Gγ2, and measured TRAP-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes prepared from these cells. As a negative control, we co-expressed PAR1, Gβ1, and Gγ2 (but not Gαo) in Sf9 cells. Fig 1 shows that TRAP stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding up to 700 ± 50% above the basal level in a concentration-dependent manner in Sf9 membranes co-expressing PAR1 and Gαo1β1γ2 proteins. In Sf9 membranes co-expressing only PAR1 and Gβ1γ2, TRAP stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to a significantly lower level (230 ± 10% above basal level) (p < 0.05). In addition, we found that TRAP could stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes prepared from Sf9 cells co-expressing PAR1 and Gαi1β1γ2, Gαi2β1γ2, or Gαi3β1γ2 heterotrimers. The level of stimulation in the latter membranes was apparently lower than in membranes co-expressing the Gαo1β1γ2 heterotrimer. Because we did not determine the level of PAR1 expression (because of the lack of commercially available radioligands), we could not conclude whether the lower stimulation level by Gαiβ1γ2 reflected a lower coupling efficiency or a lower expr"

This protein contains 23 cationic residues, which are scattered over its entire surface, resulting in a high pI of 9.39. To understand the molecular basis for the selective binding of hGIIA to anionic membranes, 14 single-site, spin-labeled hGIIA proteins were analyzed in the presence and absence of vesicles of anionic phospholipid by time domain and continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin relaxant techniques. Surprisingly, for hGIIA bound to anionic vesicles, all of the spin labels were highly protected from water-soluble spin relaxants. Together with light scattering studies, these EPR results suggest the formation of a supramolecular aggregate involving clusters of hGIIA molecules bridging together multiple vesicles. This anomalous mode of binding of hGIIA to anionic phospholipid explains previous data in which charge reversal mutation of a few cationic residues on multiple faces of hGIIA leads to a comparable and modest reduction in affinity of the protein for anionic vesicles.

A key issue in understanding the behavior of sPLA2s is to determine why different members of this family of enzymes display dramatically different affinities for membranes composed of anionicversus zwitterionic phospholipids. For example, human group X sPLA2 displays high enzymatic activity on both anionic phosphatidylserine and zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine vesicles, whereas human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) hydrolyzes anionic vesicles several orders of magnitude faster than zwitterionic vesicles (6Bezzine S.

Differential interfacial binding to anionic versuszwitterionic membranes accounts for the differences in kinetic behavior of these two sPLA2s, rather than the differences in the abilities of the active sites to accomodate phospholipids with different polar head groups. 2S. Bezzine, J. Bollinger, S. L. Veatch, S. L. Keller, and M. H. Gelb, submitted for publication.This has direct physiological consequences. For example, hGIIA readily acts on the highly anionic phosphatidylglycerol-rich outer membrane of a variety of Gram-positive bacteria (8Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Infect.

In some cells that have been transfected with hGIIA, this sPLA2 acts on membranes to release arachidonic acid for eicosanoid biosynthesis.

A new technique using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been recently developed to study the binding of peripheral membrane proteins to the interface of anionic phospholipid vesicles (14Lin Y.

This method involves site-specific labeling of the protein with a nitroxide and the use of an aqueous- or membrane-soluble spin relaxant to measure the distance of the spin label from the membrane-aqueous interface. Studies using this method have shown that interfacial binding of bee venom sPLA2 is driven by the shallow penetration into the membrane of a collar of hydrophobic residues that surround the opening to the active site slot (14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2 penetrates into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane below the phospholipid head group region using two hydrophobic residue-rich surface loops (15Ball A.

The EPR method provides an accurate orientation of the protein with respect to the membrane surface. In the current study, we have applied this EPR method to study the structural features of binding of hGIIA to anionic phospholipid vesicle membranes and to mixed micelles of anionic phospholipid dispersed in Triton X-100 aggregates.

Our results reveal a number of unusual features governing the binding of highly basic hGIIA (pI of 9.39, due to the presence of 13 lysines and 10 arginines scattered over the surface of the protein) to anionic phospholipid surfaces. These features help to explain the dramatic dependence of the interfacial binding of hGIIA on the presence of anionic phospholipids in the lipid aggregate. Expression of hGIIA in Escherichia coli, site-directed mutagenesis, refolding hGIIA from inclusion bodies, and protein refolding and purification were carried out as described (12Koduri R.S.

Nitrogen (99%) or oxygen (medical air) was passed through the EPR sample chamber at 21 °C to saturate the sample with the desired gas (by diffusion through the sample tube in <20 min). Samples with mixed micelles contained 12.6 mm DTPM and 126 mmTriton X-100 instead of LUV. Some experiments were carried out with co-vesicles of DTPM or DOetPS in DOetPC (20Hixon M.S. Ball A.

TD experiments were used to measure the electron spin-lattice relaxation rate (R1 = 1/T1), where T1 is the electron spin-lattice relaxation time. These TD experiments included saturation recovery (SR) and pulsed electron double resonance (pELDOR) EPR spectroscopies (21Mailer C. Haas D.A. Hustedt E.J. Gladden J.G. Robinson B.H. J. Magn.

The15N relaxants used were 1 mm TEMPAMINE (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amine) or 1 mmTEMPOL (2,2, 6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-ol) or 1 mm CTPO (3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidinyloxyl), labeled at N1 with 15N (gift from Dr. A. H. Beth, Vanderbilt University). Right angle scattering was measured in a spectrofluorometer (ex/em 500 nm, 6 nm slits) on samples containing 1 ml of EPR buffer with 50 μm DTPM vesicles and 85 nm hGIIA at 22 °C. An electrostatic calculation was carried out to explore the stability of the protein-vesicle supramolecular aggregate described under “Discussion.” The calculation was done on a subset of the supramolecular structure, comprising two LUV, each of radius 500 Å, brought into proximity by a patch of protein on the surface of one of the LUV. The patch was modeled as a planar disc with a uniform charge density given by the difference in charge between the proteins and the lipid beneath. In the model, each protein contains 20 positive charges, and the protein density within the disc is given in the discussion section. Each lipid contains a single negative charge and occupies 70 Å2. The electrostatic potential of this system was calculated for a grided surface over the LUV and the patch assuming a screened coulomb interaction. The calculation was carried out as a function of the distance between the patch (on one LUV) and the second LUV. The system is attractive when the characteristic screening length is less than 55 Å. The ionic strength of the buffer predicts a Debye screening length of around 15 Å for the EPR buffer; therefore we are well within the range of attraction. Twelve single-site hGIIA mutant proteins were produced by replacing a surface residue with cysteine and tagging its SH group with a nitroxyl reagent (14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L.

Residues 3, 10, and 19 are on the putative interfacial binding surface (IBS) previously proposed (12Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

The specific activities for the mutants on DOPM/Triton X-100 mixed micelles are all similar (Table I). Two spin-labeled mutants were also prepared (nitroxide at positions 56 and 120) containing the charge reversal mutation cluster K52E/R53E/K56E/R57E. Although the respective specific activities of 70 and 92% of wild type suggest a native structure, these proteins were more sensitive than the others to DTT-induced reduction of hGIIA disulfides, suggesting a lower stability. Site-specific nitroxide-labeled proteins are used as a basis for locating the position of each spin label relative to a membrane interface. The interface, which is composed of negatively charged lipids, generates an electrostatic gradient. This electrostatic gradient creates a concentration gradient of Crox, because Crox is a water-soluble, membrane-impenetrable, negatively charged spin relaxant (14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Exposure of the nitroxide within the Crox gradient is defined by four experimental conditions: protein in the presence and absence of vesicles and in the presence and absence of Crox. The shift (ΔP2 = P2+Crox − P2−Crox of the CW EPR rollover parameter P2 upon addition of Crox measures the collision-induced relaxation of nitroxide, which is proportional to the local concentration of Crox (14Lin Y.

Robinson B.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 475-496Google Scholar). Measurements in the absence of membrane account for the effect of the local protein electrostatic potential on the concentration of Crox and provide a reference for the response to Crox for each spin-labeled mutant. From previous studies on proteins with values of pI near neutrality, a bulk concentration of 10 mm Crox was found to give a response which made optimal use of the finite range of the experimentally obtainable P2values. In each case, the local electrostatic effect of the protein was weak, and membrane electrostatics dominated the distribution of Crox in the vicinity of the protein when bound to the membrane surface (14Lin Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have introduced the use of the TD techniques SR and pELDOR to directly measure the shift (ΔR1 = R1+Relaxant − R1−Relaxant) in spin-lattice relaxation rate R1 (Equation 3 in Ref. 14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as an alternative to the CW ΔP2 measurement (14Lin Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ΔR1, like ΔP2, is proportional to the local concentration of relaxant; however, the ΔR1 measurement is often more accurate. 3R. Nielsen, S. Canaan, J. G. Gladden, M. H. Gelb, and B. H. Robinson, manuscript in preparation. Both TD and CW data were acquired for hGIIA mutants in the presence and absence of DTPM LUV. Accurate measurement of the P2parameter in the presence of 10 mm Crox without membrane was impossible, due to a large electrostatic interaction between hGIIA and Crox (Fig. 1). ΔR1could only be obtained for one mutant (S113C-sl) in the absence of membrane (Table I). The protein-Crox interaction will be described below in detail. Fig. 1 shows typical CW data for spin-labeled hGIIA (S120C-sl), consisting of the four CW power saturation curves that define P2 values in the presence and absence of membranes and Crox. The curve for protein without membranes and in the presence of Crox does not “roll over,” indicating an inability to saturate the collisional relaxation process with experimentally realizable microwave powers. Decreasing the Crox concentration could bring this rollover into a detectable range, but would compress the resolution of Crox responsiveness for protein bound to membranes. The response of membrane-bound S120C-sl to Crox measured by CW EPR (Fig. 1) is typical of data obtained for all 12 mutants on vesicles and represents a high degree of protection from Crox due to protein-membrane binding. The TD method confirms the CW results (Fig.2, upper left, ± Crox, + DTPM). The R1 value without Crox, in the presence of membrane, for S120C-sl is 0.422 ± 0.007 Mrad/s; with Crox the R1 value is 0.541 ± 0.007 Mrad/s (see Table I, column 2, +DTPM/LUV for conditions that include Crox). The value of R1 in the presence of Crox, without membrane, is greater than 10 Mrad/s (Table I, column 1). Mutants V3C-sl, K10C-sl, and F23C-sl, which contain spin labels in the vicinity of the putative IBS, exhibited total protection from Crox by membranes. The small Crox-induced shift of S120C-sl is surprising, because this mutant is located on the face of the protein opposite the putative IBS, and a large exposure would be expected, as seen in previous applications of this EPR method (14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The neutral relaxing agent NiEDDA was used to investigate S120C-sl on vesicles, because NiEDDA concentration is not modulated by the electrostatic potential of the anionic membrane or protein surface charge. A small R1shift of the same magnitude as that found with 10 mm Crox was measured for membrane bound hGIIA in the presence of 10 mm NiEDDA, reinforcing the conclusion of minimal exposure for S120C-sl to the aqueous phase (data not shown). The nearly uniform protection of all spin labels (Table I, columns 1 and 2) is qualitatively supported by the additional observation that the CW spectra of all mutants exhibit motional slowing of the spin label upon binding to membranes, suggesting a binding-induced steric interaction. Because the spin-labeled sites decorate multiple sectors of the protein surface, protection of all sites from Crox and NiEDDA implies limited accessibility of the entire surface of the membrane-bound protein to the aqueous phase. To assess the depth of penetration of residues into the membrane hydrophobic core, ΔP2 and ΔR1 were measured in the presence and absence of O2, which is an electrically neutral spin relaxant with a 4-fold higher concentration in the membrane hydrophobic core than in buffer (15Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). No enhancement of O2 relaxation was detected when protein was absorbed onto membranes, indicating that the spin-labeled residues did not access the O2 in the membrane.3 The large relaxivity of Crox for spin labels of hGIIA in the absence of membranes (Fig. 1, open squares; Table I, column 1) would appear to be due to an attraction of anionic Crox (nominal charge −3) to the highly cationic surface of hGIIA (pI = 9.39). This implies a greater influence of protein electrostatic interactions than seen in our previous EPR studies (14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We quantified this interaction to understand the possible role of protein electrostatics in binding of hGIIA to anionic vesicles. The electrostatic potential of hGIIA was investigated at three sites (S35C-sl, N70C-sl, and S120C-sl). The universally strong ΔP2 or ΔR1 response to Crox found in the absence of membrane provides a means of site specifically probing the protein electrostatic potential. Line broadening of the CW spectrum at site S35C-sl as a function of Crox concentration (0.05–10 mm) indicated a local concentration of Crox that exceeds the bulk concentration by at least a factor of 10. For example, ∼4.5 Gauss of line width broadening was observed for S35C-sl with 10 mm Crox instead of the ∼0.5 Gauss expected for a spin-labeled neutral protein under the same electrolyte conditions (14Lin Y.

As these conditions decrease our ability to conduct long-term manned space missions, and increase bone frailty in the elderly, the identification of genes responsible for the apparition of these physiological changes will be of great benefit. Thus, we developed and implemented a new microarray approach to investigate the changes in normal WI38 human fibroblast gene expression that arise as a consequence of space flight. Using our microarray, we identified changes in the level of expression of 10 genes, belonging to either the tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) or interleukin- (IL) related gene families in fibroblasts when WI38 cells exposed to microgravity during the STS-93 Space Shuttle mission were compared with ground controls. The genes included two ligands from the TNF superfamily, TWEAK and TNFSF15; two TNF receptor-associated proteins, NSMAF and PTPN13; three TNF-inducible genes, ABC50, PTX3, and SCYA13; TNF-alpha converting enzyme, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and IL-15 receptor alpha chain. Most of these are involved in either the regulation of bone density, and as such the development of spaceflight osteopenia, or in the development of proinflammatory status."

Chavez S. Truss M. Steroids. 1996; 61: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A number of transcriptional cofactors (coactivator or corepressor) have been identified that associate, in a ligand-dependent fashion, with the AF-2 regions of the steroid hormone receptors.

AR has been thought to be quite unique among the nuclear receptor superfamily members, because most, if not all, of its activities are mediated via the ligand-independent constitutive activity of AF-1 function (21Bevan C.L.

This is in strong contrast to estrogen receptor α (ERα), in which the overall transactivation capacities are primarily dependent on AF-2 (23Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domain is important for exerting the full AR transactivation capacity (21Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell.

Among these cofactors, cyclin E is known to interact with U2 Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) (33Seghezzi W. Chua K. Shanahan F. Gozani O. Reed R. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that AR-AF-1 might be involved in the pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms. The fundamental role of AR-AF-1 was also further supported by our recent clinical finding (34Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J.

We isolated a cDNA sequence that encoded a protein named ANT-1 (androgen receptor N-terminal domain transactivating protein-1) as the AR-AF-1-binding protein. The ANT-1 was identical to a protein that binds to a human splicing factor U5 snRNP, a human homologue of yeast splicing factor prp6p (35Nishikimi A. Mukai J. Kioka N. Yamada M. Biochim. Biophys.

By using a three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal microscopic images, the spatial interrelationship between two distinct subnuclear compartments, one formed by steroid hormone receptors and another by splicing factors, was elucidated. pEYFP-ANT1 and pANT-myc were constructed by inserting the ANT-1 cDNA into KpnI and SmaI sites of pEYFP-C2 (CLONTECH) and KpnI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-myc-his, respectively. pCMVhAR, pCMXhAR-(1–703 aa), pCMXhAR-(502–919 aa), pCMXhGR, pCMXhGR-(1–550 aa), pCMXhGR-(415–777 aa), pGEX-AR, pGEX-AR-(1–532 aa), pGEX-GR-(13–438 aa), and the reporter plasmid pMMTV-luc, containing the luciferase gene driven by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat harboring hormone-response element for both AR and GR, have been described previously (34Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The human aromatase gene fragment encompassing exon Ib and the upstream promoter region (38Harada N. Utsumi T. Takagi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (−1101 to +60, containing the glucocorticoid response element at −333 to −319) was subcloned into pGL3-luc (CLONTECH), thus creating pAROM-luc. The expression plasmids for human ERα (pSG5-ERα) and a reporter plasmid for ERα (pERE2-tk109-luc), pGEX-4T-ERα-(29–180 aa), and pGEX-4T-ERα-(282–595 aa) were provided by Dr. Shigeaki Kato (University of Tokyo, Japan). The expression plasmid for human cyclin E was provided by Dr. Makoto Nakanishi (Nagoya City University, Japan). MatchMaker Plus (CLONTECH) was used for the yeast two-hybrid screening. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from primary cultured human skin fibroblasts. cDNA library was constructed using TimeSaver cDNA Synthesis Kit (AmershamBiosciences) with random primers (Amersham Biosciences) and was inserted into pLexA-BD included in the MatchMaker Plus kit. A cDNA fragment, used for bait, encoding N-terminal transactivating domain (1–532-aa residue) of human AR was ligated in-frame into pB42-AD, thus creating pB42-AD-AF1-expressing AR-AF-1 fused to the GAL1 activation domain. The yeast EGY48 strain was transformed with the pLexA-BD carrying the human fibroblast cDNA libraries and with the pB42-AD-AF1 according to the manufacturer's protocol, and thereafter the transformants were selected on an appropriate nutrition medium. Positive candidate plasmids for AR-AF-1-binding proteins were recovered from the yeast, and the nucleotide sequences were determined using the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The specificity of interaction was further confirmed by a liquid galactosidase assay. To obtain full-length ANT-1 cDNA, the partial cDNA fragment encoding 78–495-aa residues of ANT-1, obtained by the two-hybrid screening, was 32P-labeled as a probe for the screening of human prostate cDNA library carried by a λgt10 phage vector (CLONTECH). The full-length ANT-1 cDNA was ligated into pcDNA3 to create pcDNA3-ANT-1. For the Northern blot analysis, MTN blots were purchased from CLONTECH. A DNA fragment covering 463–703 amino acids of ANT-1 was labeled as a probe with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 and ALVA-41 prostatic cancer cells (5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plate), cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were transiently transfected using a Superfect Transfection Kit (Invitrogen). Generally, 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA (0.2–1.0 μg of pcDNA3-ANT-1, 0.2 μg of pCMVhAR, 1.0 μg of pMMTV-luc) per well were used for the transfection, whereas the total amounts of the transfected DNA were kept constant by adding pcDNA3 plasmid. At 16 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed and re-fed with medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum with or without steroid hormones (10−8m dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17β-estradiol, and 10−7m dexamethasone, respectively). After an additional 18 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Full-length AR (AR-(1–919)) fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells, thus generating GST-AR-(1–919). GST fusions with AR-(1–532), AR-(564–919), AR-(622–919), GR-(13–438), GR-(421–777), GR-(486–777), ERα-(29–180), and ERα-(282–595) were expressed inEscherichia coli. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using the TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) and pcDNA3-ANT as a template. For the GST pull-down analysis, GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with35S-labeled ANT-1 at 4 °C for 2 h in the NETN buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The pellets were washed 5 times in a washing buffer (replacing 200 mm NaCl in NETN buffer with 500 mm NaCl) and resuspended in an SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The radiolabeled proteins were detected with STORM860 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). For the immunocoprecipitation analysis, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged ANT-1 and full-length or truncated AR and were maintained with or without 10−8m DHT. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in a buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture). In one experiment, nuclear lysates were prepared as described previously (39Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the antibody against c-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture) and then were further incubated with protein-A-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. A Western blot analysis was performed using either antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the full-length or N-terminal transactivating domain fragment of AR or using antibody C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the C-terminal fragment. The COS-7 cells were divided into 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.) and then were transfected with 0.5 μg of pAR-CFP and pANT-1-YFP using 2.5 μl/dish of Superfect reagents (Qiagen). Six to 18 h post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced with a fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10−8m DHT. One hour after adding DHT, the cells were scanned using a Leica TCS-SP system (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (40Tomura A. Goto K. Morinaga H. Nomura M. Okabe T. Yanase T. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28395-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were imaged for yellow or cyan fluorescence by excitation with the 514 and 450 nm line, respectively, from an argon laser. The emissions were viewed through either a 530–590-nm bandpass filter for yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) or a 470–500-nm bandpass filter for cyan fluorescence protein (CFP). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml) and were imaged by excitation with the 350-nm line from an ultraviolet laser, and the emission was viewed through a 400–450-nm bandpass filter. A series of 30–50 images were collected for each single nucleus. In each plane, the cyan, yellow, and ultraviolet fluorescence were consecutively collected using serial scanning methods equipped in Leica TCS-SP system. Three-dimensional image reconstruction was performed using either the three-dimensional analysis TRI Graphics Program software package (Ratoc System Engineering, Tokyo) (40Tomura A. Goto K. Morinaga H. Nomura M. Okabe T. Yanase T. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28395-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or the deconvolution method (nearest neighbors). To identify the cDNA encoding proteins binding to AR-AF-1 sequence, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. Because AR-AF-1 possesses a strong autonomous transactivation capacity, we could not use pLexA-BD, which is regularly used as the bait protein plasmid vector. Instead, we inserted AR-AF-1 cDNA into pB42-AD, and cDNA libraries representing human skin fibroblast mRNAs were carried by the pLexA-BD. By employing this “swapped” modification, the background false-positive blue colonies representing the transactivation capacities of the bait protein in yeast strain EGY48 became very weak, thus allowing us to perform the two-hybrid screening. Although during the second and the third screens retesting the specific ability of the candidate clones was critical, about 2 × 105independent clones were subjected to the screening. We identified one positive clone harboring ∼1.3 kb of the open reading frame, and then this fragment was used to obtain the full-length cDNA. The translation of the coding sequence revealed that the putative protein consisted of 941-aa residues with a predicted molecular mass of 102 kDa, which was named ANT-1. The homology search of the known amino acid sequences revealed that ANT-1 was identical to a nucleoprotein that binds to a human splicing factor U5 snRNP (GenBankTMaccession number AF221842) (35Nishikimi A. Mukai J. Kioka N. Yamada M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Achsel T. Luhrmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ANT-1 contains 19 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) elements, two LXXLL motifs (41Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), and one leucine zipper motif (Fig.1a) (42Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Typically, the TPR motif appears in a tandem array and thus provides the scaffolds to mediate protein-protein interactions (43Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A Northern blot analysis revealed the ANT-1 sequence to be ubiquitously expressed among the tissues examined (Fig. 1b). To confirm the binding capacities of ANT-1 with AR-AF-1, a GST pull-down analysis was performed using a series of GST-fused fragments of AR (Fig. 2a), GR, or ERα (Fig. 2b). Ligand-independent binding was observed, not only for full-length AR-(1–919) but also for AR-(1–532) covering AF-1, AR-(622–919) covering the ligand binding domain, or AR-(564–919) covering DNA binding domain and ligand binding domain. Furthermore, ANT-1 interacted with GR. The truncated GR fragments, such as GR-(14–438) covering AF-1, GR-(486–777) covering ligand binding domain, and GR-(421–777) covering ligand binding domain and DNA binding domain, were bound to ANT-1 without ligand. No significant difference was observed between the incubations with or without specific ligands. In contrast, two fragments covering ER-(29–180) for the AF-1 of ERα or ER-(282–595) for the AF-2 region failed to bind to ANT-1. The addition of 17β-estradiol did not promote such binding (data not shown). Next, immunocoprecipitation experiments using either whole cell extracts (Fig. 3, a, c, and d) or nuclear extracts (Fig.3b) were performed to test whether or not ANT-1 binds to AR in living cells. A plasmid expressing Myc-tagged ANT-1 was transfected into COS-7 cells together with expression plasmid for the full-length or truncated mutants of AR, and then the cells were maintained with or without 10−8m DHT. The full-length AR was specifically precipitated with Myc-tagged ANT-1 in the presence of DHT (Fig. 3, a and b). In addition, AR-AF-1, which exists in the nucleus without DHT (44Saito M. Takayanagi R. Goto K. Fukamizu A. Tomura A. Yanase T. Nawata H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was precipitated with Myc-tagged ANT-1 in a ligand-independent fashion (Fig. 3c). In contrast to the in vitrobinding in the GST pull-down experiments, ANT-1 did not bind to AR-AF-2 in living cells (Fig. 3d). To examine the effect of ANT-1 on the transactivation function of AR, GR, or ERα, we cotransfected an expression plasmid for each receptor together with the plasmids expressing ANT-1 and an appropriate reporter plasmid (pMMTV-luc for AR or GR, pERE2-tk109-luc for ERα, respectively) into ALVA-41 human prostatic cancer cells or COS-7 cells. The reporter geneluc+ (CLONTECH) harbored in pMMTV-luc does not contain any intronic sequences. As shown in Fig.4a, ANT-1 further enhanced the ligand-induced transactivation function of full-length AR and GR (10−8m DHT and 10−7m dexamethasone, respectively). When the plasmid expressing the truncated AR-AF-1 (aa residues 1–622) or AR-AF-2 (aa residues 563–919) was transfected, ANT-1 enhanced the constitutive transactivation function mediated by AR-AF-1 by from 2- to 3-fold. However, no enhancement of the ligand-dependent transactivation mediated by AR-AF-2 was observed. A similar profile of the domain-specific transactivation was also observed for GR. In contrast, ANT-1 did not enhance the ERα-dependent transactivation (Fig. 4b). Whereas the ANT-1 is identical to the human homologue (the p102 U5 snRNP-binding protein) of the yeast splicing factor prp6p, involved in the spliceosome (37Stevens S.W. Ryan D.E., Ge, H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 45Elliott D.J. Bowman D.S. Abovich N. Fay F.S. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the transfection of ANT-1 did not enhance the basal promoter activities of reporter plasmids measured by luciferase activity (data not shown). In addition, the reporter gene luc+ (pGL3-luc from CLONTECH) harbored in pMMTV-luc does not contain any intronic sequences. Therefore, it was suggested that the observed enhancements of the reporter gene activities were not mediated by the nonspecific enhancement of the splicing activities but were mediated through AR- or GR-dependent transcription. Together with the findings in the immunocoprecipitation experiments, we concluded that ANT-1 is primarily an AF-1 interacting transcriptional coactivator for AR or GR but not for ERα. The ANT-1-mediated transactivation was further confirmed in a reporter assay using natural authentic promoter (P450 aromatase exon Ib upstream promoter (38Harada N. Utsumi T. Takagi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar)) transactivated by the endogenous GR in primary-cultured human skin fibroblast. In this experiment, the expression of ANT-1 further enhanced the GR-mediated aromatase gene promoter activities (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, ANT-1 exhibited an independent additive effect on the transactivation function of cyclin E (32Yamamoto A. Hashimoto Y. Kohri K. Ogata E. Kato S. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or SRC-1α (21Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), which is reported to interact with AR-AF-1 (Fig. 5b). When either ANT-1-truncated mutant covering the N-terminal half (78–495 aa), ANT (N), or ANT (C) covering the C-terminal half (495–941 aa) including one leucine zipper motif together with two LXXLL (Fig. 1a) motifs was expressed, ANT (N) alone enhanced the AR-mediated transactivation almost fully (90%) (Fig. 5c). This suggested that the transactivation domain(s) of ANT-1 exist within 78–495-aa residues. By using a high resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal microscopic images, we previously showed that transcriptionally active AR produces 250–400 small subnuclear speckles (Fig.6a, applying a surface method (40Tomura A.

The liganded AR recruited the transcriptional cofactors such as SRC-1α, TIF-II, and p300/CBP into these subnuclear speckles (44Saito M. Takayanagi R. Goto K. Fukamizu A. Tomura A. Yanase T. Nawata H.

We were interested in the subnuclear spatial interrelation between nuclear receptor compartment, colocalizing with p160 members and p300/CBP, and splicing factor compartment. Therefore, the spatial interrelation of AR-CFP with ANT-1-YFP was explored"

Nitric oxide (NO) converts IRP-1 from a [4Fe-4S] aconitase to a trans-regulatory protein through Fe-S cluster disassembly. Here, we have focused on the fate of IRE binding IRP1 from murine macrophages when NO flux stops. We show that virtually all IRP-1 molecules from NO-producing cells dissociated from IRE and recovered aconitase activity after re-assembling a [4Fe-4S] clusterin vitro. The reverse change in IRP-1 activities also occurred in intact cells no longer exposed to NO and did not requirede novo protein synthesis. Likewise, inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase via NO-induced Fe-S cluster disassembly was also reversed independently of protein translation after NO removal. Our results provide the first evidence of Fe-S cluster repair of NO-modified aconitases in mammalian cells. Moreover, we show that reverse change in IRP-1 activities and repair of mitochondrial aconitase activity depended on energized mitochondria. Finally, we demonstrate that IRP-1 activation by NO was accompanied by both a drastic decrease in ferritin levels and an increase in transferrin receptor mRNA levels.

Kiley P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 218-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1),1 which controls intracellular iron homeostasis at a post-transcriptional level, is one of the best illustrations. Once properly activated, IRP-1 specifically binds to one or several iron-responsive element(s) (IRE) located in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of several mRNAs, including those encoding ferritin, mitochondrial aconitase, and transferrin receptor (Tf-R). The binding of IRP-1 to IRE in the 5′-UTR of ferritin or mitochondrial aconitase mRNA blocks its translation, whereas binding of IRP-1 to at least three of the five IREs in the 3′-UTR of Tf-R mRNA stabilizes it. Remarkably, IRP-1 is a bifunctional protein that in resting cells displays a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the active site and consequently exhibits an aconitase activity in the cytosol. When cellular iron becomes limiting, cytosolic aconitase activity disappears, whereas IRP-1 progressively gains the capacity to bind IREs. A second IRP, named IRP-2, also binds to IRE motifs in response to iron depletion but does not have aconitase activity because of its incapacity to assemble an Fe-S cluster (for review, see Ref.2Eisenstein R.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 627-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It is now well known that nitric oxide (NO) can also modulate IRP-1 (3Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,4Weiss G. Goossen W.D. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Moreover, several lines of evidence indicate that activation of IRP-1 by NO is followed by repression of ferritin translation and an increase in Tf-R mRNA levels (4Weiss G. Goossen W.D. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 5Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast to iron depletion, NO quickly modulates IRP-1 activity at a post-translational level (6Bouton C. Oliveira L. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9403-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,7Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NO rapidly converts IRP-1 from aconitase to itstrans-regulatory form without requiring de novoprotein synthesis (6Bouton C. Oliveira L. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9403-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Its primary target site is the Fe-S cluster, because it has no effect on IRP-1 from cytosol that had been pretreated with an excess of aconitase substrates (e.g. citrate orcis-aconitate) known to interact directly with the labile iron of the cluster (8Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Subsequently, electron paramagnetic resonance studies have definitively established that NO promotes the cluster disassembly of the protein (10Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). At this juncture, one of the challenging issues ahead was to investigate the fate of thetrans-regulatory form of IRP-1 once NO flux stops. This question addresses the still ill-defined cell machinery involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly in mammals. Recent results using yeast indicate that mitochondria are most probably the primary site of the biogenesis of both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S cluster proteins (11Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A., Ta, D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Yet in mammalian cells, components of the ISC machinery have recently been characterized in extra-mitochondrial compartments (14Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Taking these recent data into consideration and to understand better the impact of NO on proteins whose mRNAs are under the control of the IRP/IRE system, we have investigated the possible Fe-S cluster repair of NO-modified IRP-1 when NO flux stops. In parallel, we have analyzed the consequences of this regulation for ferritin and mitochondrial aconitase expression as well as Tf-R mRNA level. In addition to IRP-1, we have also explored the fate of the related mitochondrial Fe-S aconitase when cells were no longer exposed to NO and studied the participation of energized mitochondria in the recovery of their aconitase activity. Spermine NONOate (SPER/NO), DPTA NONOate (DPTA/NO), and DETA NONOate (DETA/NO) were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Cycloheximide (CHX), carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), LD-L 10 kit, and oligomycin were from Sigma. The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with different NONOates for the times indicated in the figures and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated in fresh medium alone or with medium that contained CHX or CCCP as indicated in the figure legends. At the indicated times, cell were harvested, and both cytosol and mitochondria-enriched fractions were prepared. To determine the expression of Tf-R mRNA, total RNAs were extracted in parallel experiments. RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 106/ml) were harvested and suspended in 0.25 m sucrose buffered by 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. They were then treated with 0.007% digitonin as described (16Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria-enriched pellet was treated with a lysis buffer composed of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immediately tested for mitochondrial aconitase activity and aliquots were kept at −80 °C for Western blot analysis. Cytosolic contamination of mitochondria-enriched fractions was determined by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase activity associated with the mitochondria-enriched fraction (kit LD-L 10, Sigma Diagnostics). This amount value did not exceed 5%. In control experiments, we also checked by Western blot that IRP-1 protein was not detectable in mitochondria-enriched fractions. RAW 264.7 cell monolayer (5 × 106/ml) was harvested in 250 μl of 0.25 m sucrose buffered with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cell suspension was then treated with 0.007% digitonin, and the lysate was centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cytosolic extract was tested for protein concentration (∼1 mg/ml) before measuring aconitase activity. No mitochondrial aconitase expression was detected by Western blotting in the cytosolic fraction. Samples were then kept at −80 °C for further measurements. Transcription reactions were performed in vitro with 1 or 2 μg of either linearized pSPT-TR 11 (corresponding to the 2.3-kilobase 3′-UTR of the human Tf-R) or linearized pSPT-fer (corresponding to the human ferritin H-chain IRE) (kindly provided by Dr. L. C. Kühn) in the presence of 60 μCi of [32P]CTP, 2.5 mm unlabeled NTP, 0.02 mm unlabeled CTP, 10 mm DTT, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 38 °C. Full-length transcripts from pSPT-TR11 were purified on Sephadex G50 column. RNA-protein interactions were performed as described previously (17Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were mixed with a molar excess of labeled H-chain ferritin IRE in a final volume of 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 1 μl of RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) was added. After 10 min, 2 μl of 50 mg/ml heparin were added for an equivalent additional time. IRP-IRE complexes were resolved in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. In a parallel experiment, samples were treated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) before the addition of the labeled RNA probe. This treatment allows full expression of IRP-1 IRE binding activity. The IRP-1-IRE complex was quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). RNA-protein interactions were also analyzed with a molar excess of labeled 3′-UTR of the Tf-R, which contains 5 IRE sequences (TfR 5-IREs). The above-mentioned protocol was slightly modified for the Tf-R probe; 10 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were used in a final volume of 30 μl of buffer A. Incubation time for the Tf-R 3′-UTR-IRPs interactions was 40 min. Four units of RNase T1 were then added for 20 min followed by 3 μl of 50 mg/ml heparin for 10 min. Ten micrograms of protein from cytosolic extracts or 0.1 μg of purified mouse liver ferritin were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with gentle agitation in 20 mm Tris-base, pH 7.5, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 buffer containing 5% fat-free dry milk at 37 °C for 1 h followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with a purified mouse liver ferritin antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. J. Brock, Glasgow University, Glasgow, UK). Membranes were then washed and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system Super Signal (Pierce). To analyze the expression of mitochondrial aconitase, we used an antibody raised against purified beef heart mitochondrial aconitase and kindly provided by Dr. R. B. Franklin, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD. Concerning analysis of IRP-1 expression levels, we used a chicken polyclonal antibody raised against purified human recombinant IRP-1 (Agro-Bio, La Ferté Saint-Aubin, France). Total RNA from RAW 264.7 macrophages was extracted using the TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) were electrophoresed at 61 mV for 2–3 h in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Pall Corp. Ann Arbor, MI). After cross-linking of the RNA to the membrane by UV light and prehybridization for at least 1 h with Hybrizol I solution (Intergen Co., NY), membranes were probed overnight with the 2.3-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the murine Tf-R cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. L. C. Kühn, Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Epalinges, Switzerland), which was labeled by the random hexamer priming method (Invitrogen). Blots were washed twice in 2× standard saline phosphate/EDTA (0.15 m NaCl/10 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for 15 min at room temperature and then twice in 0.1× standard saline phosphate/EDTA at 55 °C for 15 min before exposing to phosphorimaging. Blots were also re-probed with a 1.3-kilobase PstI fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as a loading control and washed as above except for the last two washes, which were performed at 65 °C. Mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 240 nm by following the disappearance of cis-aconitate, which is the intermediate substrate of aconitases, at 37 °C. Fifty micrograms of protein were used in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Units correspond to nmol of substrate consumed/min. Reconstitution of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in IRP-1 from control or IFN-γ/LPS-treated cell cytosols was carried out by the addition of 10 mm DTT, 125 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 125 μmsodium sulfide to 100 μg of protein extracts in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol. All reactions were performed under an anaerobic atmosphere for 20 min. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode from Hansatech (Norfolk, UK). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and treated with the uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation CCCP for 6 h. Control or CCCP-treated cells (10 × 106/ml) were harvested, washed twice with the respiration buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm sucrose, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2), and then centrifuged at 232 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of pre-warmed respiration buffer and homogenized with constant stirring in the respiration chamber at 37 °C during measurements. During the oxygen consumption measurement, the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (10 μm) was added to the chamber. Cells were cultivated with various concentrations of CHX (250, 500, and 1000 ng/ml) in leucine-starved Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. Then cells were pulse-labeled with 2 μCi/ml ofl-[3H]leucine for 2 h. After incorporation of leucine, cells were washed 10 times and harvested in a solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were filtered under a vacuum through a Whatman GF/B filter, and 100 μl of the filtrate were used for measuring incorporated 3H radioactivity as described previously (18Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2829-2838PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was estimated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release using the LD-L 10 kit. We chose the concentration of 1 μg/ml CHX, which completely blocked translation without cell toxicity. We first investigated the possible in vitro repair of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in IRE binding IRP-1 from RAW macrophages previously stimulated by IFN-γ/LPS to produce NO. Nitrite production was verified by nitrite accumulation in the culture medium (data not shown). Cytosols from control or NO-producing cells were extracted and incubated with a source of ferrous iron and sulfide in the presence of DTT. After 20 min under an anaerobic atmosphere, cytosols were tested for their IRP-1-IRE binding and aconitase activities. In the IRP-1-IRE binding assay, samples were routinely treated with 2% 2-ME in a parallel experiment to express full IRE binding activity (Fig.1A, lower panel). Untreated cytosols from control cells presented low IRP-1-IRE binding activity and significant aconitase activity (27.9 units/mg) (Fig.1A, lane 1, and B). The addition of iron, sulfide, and DTT further attenuated IRP-1-IRE binding activity and increased aconitase activity to 41.1 units/mg (Fig. 1A, lane 2, and B). In contrast, cytosols from NO-producing cells showed full IRP-1-IRE binding activity and no aconitase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 3, and B). Interestingly, we observed that treatment of these cytosols with iron, sulfide, and DTT almost completely abolished IRP-1 affinity toward IRE (Fig. 1A, compare lane 4 tolane 3). This drastic decrease in IRE binding was not observed if one of the components used for the Fe-S cluster reconstitution was missing (data not shown). In parallel to the loss of IRE binding by IRP-1, cytosolic aconitase activity resumed and reached up to 50% that of control cytosols (Fig. 1B, black bars). Based on recent data showing down-regulation of IRP-1 gene expression by NO (19Oliveira L. Drapier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6550-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we measured the IRP-1 expression level under our experimental conditions. In fact, the IRP-1 protein level was decreased by 57% in NO-producing cells (Fig. 1C), explaining why only half of aconitase activity was recovered. These data show that virtually every IRP-1 from NO-producing cells had their Fe-S cluster repaired. We also showed that in vitro repaired Fe-S clusters were stable for at least 2 h in air, as indicated by the constant level of aconitase activity (data not shown). To investigate the change in IRP-1 structure/activities in intact cells when NO flux stops, we used NONOates because of their predictable and various rates of NO release. To activate IRP-1, we first exposed cells to three different NONOates, SPER/NO, DPTA/NO, and DETA/NO. Under our experimental conditions, they released NO linearly at different rates, 3–4, 1.5, and 0.4 μm/min, respectively. We showed that the fast NO-releasing SPER/NO led to a rapid activation of IRP-1 within 2 h (Fig. 2A, upper row, compare lane 6 to lane 1). Aconitase activity was strongly decreased, corresponding to 38% that of the control (right panel of A). DPTA/NO triggered significant activation of IRP-1 within 4 h (Fig. 2B, compare lane 5 to lane 1) with a remaining aconitase activity of 22% of the control (right panel ofB). Finally, DETA/NO, whose rate of NO release is similar to that of inducible NO synthase (20Clementi E. Brown G.C. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7631-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), allowed strong activation of IRP-1 within 16 h (Fig. 2C, compare lane 4 tolane 1) and showed a remaining aconitase activity of 19% of the control (right panel of C). After removing NO donors by extensive washing, we measured both aconitase and IRE binding activities of IRP-1 at the indicated times. IRP-1-IRE binding activity progressively decreased (Fig. 2, left panels) while the cells were recovering cytosolic aconitase activity (Fig. 2, right panels). This reverse change in IRP-1 was apparent within the first hours after NO removal whatever the rate of NO release previously generated to activate IRP-1. NO also inhibits mitochondrial aconitase through disruption of its [4Fe-4S] cluster (10Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested the possible restoration of its activity under the same experimental conditions. Mitochondrial aconitase from NO-treated cells was quickly recovered after stopping NO flux (data not shown). To investigate whether resumption of IRP-1 and mitochondrial aconitase activities requires de novo protein synthesis, CHX was added to cell culture medium. As previously shown, a 16-h preincubation of macrophages with DETA/NO was accompanied by loss of cytosolic aconitase activity (5% of control, left panel of Fig.3A) and a concomitant increase in IRE binding capacity of IRP-1 (Fig. 3B, comparelane 2 to lane 1). The addition of CHX after washing away DETA/NO did not preclude the reappearance of cytosolic aconitase activity, which reached the same level as CHX-untreated cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). Interestingly, IRE binding capacity of IRP-1 was more strongly decreased when protein synthesis was blocked (Fig. 3B, compare lane 6 tolane 4). Similar experiments using DPTA/NO as a source of NO gave the same results (data not shown). The latter experiments demonstrate that reversion of IRP-1 activities after shutting off NO flux was not due to newly synthesized IRP-1 but was dependent on a post-translational change of the NO-modified IRP-1 itself. We also observed a rapid increase in mitochondrial aconitase activity, reaching up to 70% of the control value 6 h after DETA/NO removal even in the presence of CHX (Fig. 3, right panel ofA). Biosynthesis of extra-mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins in yeast has been found to depend on an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter located in the inner membrane of mitochondria (22Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we analyzed whether the reverse change in IRP-1 activities as well as the activity repair of the mitochondrial aconitase after DETA/NO removal required an ATP-dependent mechanism from mitochondria. As described above, DETA/NO was removed, and the cells were then treated with an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, CCCP. In a preliminary experiment, we showed that it instantaneously de-energized mitochondria. We then performed a time-course experiment to follow the activity of both IRP-1 and mitochondrial aconitase. We showed that recovery of aconitase activity was markedly delayed in the cytosol of CCCP-treated cells as compared with untreated cells (left panel of Fig. 4A, compare the white bars to the black bars). Conversely, the high IRE binding activity of IRP-1 resulting from the treatment by DETA/NO remained elevated in CCCP-treated cells at least 6 h after stopping NO flux (data not shown). Recovery of mitochondrial aconitase activity was also delayed in CCCP-treated cells but to a lesser extent (right panel of Fig. 4A, compare white bars to black bars). In parallel experiments, the uncoupler CCCP was tested for its efficiency on mitochondria de-energization (Fig. 4B). Results show that CCCP was effective during the a 6-h recovery phase, as indicated by the unchanged oxygen consumption of CCCP-treated cells after inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin. We investigated whether inactivation of IRP-1 trans-regulatory activity was followed by a change in expression of proteins whose mRNA contains an IRE sequence in their 5′-UTR. We first incubated RAW macrophages with DETA/NO for 16 h and analyzed their cytosols for aconitase activity and IRE binding by IRPs using the ferritin IRE as a probe. In parallel, we measured the ferritin expression level. We showed that both down-regulation of IRP-2-IRE binding and activation of IRP-1-IRE binding in DETA/NO-treated cells resulted in severe reduction of ferritin expression (Fig. 5). Six hours after NO donor removal, loss of IRP-1 in its capacity to bind ferritin IRE was directly correlated with resumption of ferritin translation (Fig.5C, compare lane 4 to lane 2). Noteworthy, loss of IRE binding activity of IRP-2 in response to NO was not reversed after stopping NO flux. In parallel, the level of mitochondrial aconitase, whose mRNA also has an IRE in its 5′-UTR (23Zheng L. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Zalkin H. Arch. Biochem.

A. 1996; 93: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was measured. Despite activation of IRP-1 to bind IRE, the level of this protein was not reduced in response to an overnight stimulation by NO and remained unchanged 6 h after stopping NO flux once IRP-1 was inactivated (Fig. 5C, lower panel). Tf-R mRNA contains five IRE sequences in its 3′-UTR (25Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Koeller D.M. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1988; 240: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the regulation of its expression after the change in IRP-1 activities induced by the “on/off NO flux signal” described above. It is worth noting that in this set of experiments, IRP-1 and IRP-2-IRE binding capacity was assessed using the entire 3′-UTR that contained the five IRE sequences of the Tf-R as a probe. In parallel to cytosolic extraction, total mRNAs were extracted and analyzed for Tf-R expression. We first observed that the capacity of IRP-2 to bind Tf-R IREs was not significantly modified in control and DETA/NO-exposed cells (Fig.6A, compare lane 2to lane 1). In contrast, we observed that exposure of macrophages to DETA/NO resulted in a strong increase in IRP-1 binding capacity toward Tf-R IRE sequences that was accompanied by an enhanced Tf-R mRNA expression (Fig. 6, panel A and C). After 6 additional hours without DETA/NO, IRP-1 no longer interacted with Tf-R IREs and recovered aconitase activity (Fig.6A, compare lane 4 to lane 2, and panel B), but surprisingly, this was not accompanied by a decrease in Tf-R mRNA level. Actually, Tf-R mRNA expression continued to increase even 10 h after exposure to NO was ended (data not shown). Whereas the mechanism of IRP-1 activation in response to NO has been progressively disclosed, the inactivation process of IRP-1 when cells are no longer exposed to NO has never been characterized. Investigating this pathway is crucial to understanding the real impact of NO on proteins whose mRNAs contain the IRE motif(s). In this report, we first showed that in addition to iron and DTT, sulfide was required to ensure both IRP-1-IRE dissociation and recovery of aconitase activity. As documented earlier by Kennedy et al.(26Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this observation strongly suggests that NO-modified IRP-1 from activated macrophages is an apoprotein that can be readily reactivated through repair and reinsertion of its [4Fe-4S] cluster. Interestingly, we have observed that recovery of IRP-1 aconitase activity also occurred in intact cells as soon as they were relieved of the NO burden, whatever the time course and the rate of NO formerly generated. Because recovery did not require de novo protein synthesis, we propose that IRE binding IRP-1 could be recycled into an aconitase through reassembly and reinsertion of the Fe-S cluster into the backbone of the protein upon NO removal (Fig.7). Along the same lines, we noticed that the presence of a labile protein(s) may be necessary to keep the IRP-1-IRE interaction, because the translation inhibitor cycloheximide favored the IRP-1-IRE dissociation in cells relieved of NO (Fig.3B). Taking into account this result, we are now seeking new partner proteins and/or chaperones that could participate in the IRP-1 activation/deactivation process in response to the on/off NO flux signal. We also investigated the repair activity o"

Three major subfamilies of MAPKs have been isolated to date: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as stress-activated protein kinase or SAPK), and the p38 MAP kinase (1Cobb M.H. Robbins D.J. Boulton T.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAP kinase pathways are evolutionarily conserved and respond differentially to multiple physiological and non-physiological stimuli (3Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Signals for ERK activation, including growth and differentiation factors (hormones as well as tumor promoters) (4McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), are relayed from the cell surface to the nucleus through a conserved signal transduction pathway, which includes the small G-protein Ras and a downstream kinase cascade consisting of Raf, MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), and ERK (5Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). Two components of this pathway, Ras and Raf, have initially been identified as oncogenes, stressing the role of this pathway in deregulated growth (6Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Raf → MEK → ERK cascade is essential for transformation by various classes of oncogenes (7Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 8Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv.

Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). In contrast to ERKs, SAPK/JNKs and p38 are poorly activated by mitogens but strongly stimulated in response to stress inducers like UV-light, ionizing radiation, osmotic or redox stress, heat shock, and inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1) (10Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in embryonic development, immune response, DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis (11Davis R.J.

More recently, a role for JNK/SAPK in oncogenic transformation and tumor development has been postulated (13Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and c-Jun is required for the transformation of mammalian or rodent fibroblasts by different oncogenes (17Lloyd A.

Although these data suggest that SAPK/JNK may be a universal mediator of cellular transformation, an evaluation of the contribution of SAPK/JNK signaling to this process has been prevented by the lack of constitutively active mutants of this kinase. Until now, attempts to generate structure-based, site-directed mutants of MAP kinases with constitutive activity have failed. Only recently did the direct enzyme-substrate fusion yield a constitutively active form of the MAPK ERK (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an analogous approach, we fused the MAP kinase SAPKβ in-frame with its direct upstream activator MKK7 to generate a constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7 (Ref. 21Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Kerkhoff E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and this paper). Employing this tool, we were able to show that SAPKβ-MKK7 behaves as a moderately transforming oncogene. Inducible SAPKβ-MKK7 expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in a morphologically transformed phenotype. In these cells the F(ilamentous)-actin cytoskeleton was disassembled, and cells expressing SAPKβ-MKK7 were able to grow anchorage-independent in soft agar and form small foci of transformed cells in monolayers. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Generation of the tetracycline-regulated NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line (NIH 5.15) has been described (22Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a second step, SAPKβ-MKK7 or SAPKβ-MKK7 KD, cloned into the tet-controlled vector pREV-TRE (CLONTECH), which carries a hygromycin resistance gene, were transfected into the NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line. Cells were thereafter cultivated as detailed above in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. A full-length SAPKβ cDNA (GenBankTM accession number L27128; provided by Dr. J. Woodgett, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada) was cloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3neo (Invitrogen) following PCR amplification with the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-CCG CTC GAG AGC AAA AGC AAG GTA GAT AAC CAG TTC TAC-3′ and 5′-TGC TCT AGA CCT GCA ACA ACC CAG CGG TCC CGC CGA-3′. Behind the stop codon-less SAPKβ, a PCR-generated fragment of the coding sequence of mouse MKK7 (GenBankTM accession number AF0026216; provided by Dr. J. M. Penninger, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto Canada) was cloned in-frame into the XbaI sites using the following primers: 5′-TGC TCT AGA GCT AGC GTT AAC GAC CAG AAG CTG CAG GAG ATC ATG AAG-3′ and 5′-TGC TCT AGA CTA CCT GAA GAA GGG CAG ATG GTG CTG ACT CAG GAC-3′. Between the two cDNAs, an alternating copolymer of 10 amino acids of glutamic acid and glycine was inserted in-frame into theNheI/HpaI sites. This linker was synthesized byin vitro annealing of the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-CTA GCT AGC GAA GGT GAG GGC GAA GGA GAA GGT GAG GGC GTT AAC ATC GAT GG-3′ and 5′-CCA TCG ATG TTA ACG CCC TCA CCT TCT CCT TCG CCC TCA CCT TCG CTA GCT AG-3′. At the 5′-end of the fusion construct, a sequence encoding the Myc tag epitope was inserted byBamHI/XhoI. pcDNA3-Myc-SAPKβ-MKK7 KD, a kinase-inactive mutant form of this hybrid protein, has been described previously (21Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Kerkhoff E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cDNA was released from pcDNA3 by aSphI/BamHI digest and subcloned into pREV-TRE. pcDNA3-FLAG-JIP-1 was kindly provided by Dr. R.J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). pcDNA3-HA-JBD (JIP-1; amino acids 126–281; GenBankTM accession number AF003115; provided by Dr. RJ Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) was released with EcoRI/NcoI from pACT2, blunt ended, and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3, which contains an HA (influenza hemagglutinin) tag. pCS3-MKK7 S3A was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kracht (Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, Hannover, Germany), and Dr. D. Bohmann (EMBL, Heidelberg Germany) contributed the pMT35-c-Jun construct. The EHneo-v-Raf plasmid has been described previously (23Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h before transfection by a high-efficiency liposome-mediated transfection method (LipofectAMINE; Invitrogen). Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed directly by the addition of Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) glycerine, 3% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Total protein extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8), 190 mm glycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS using a tank blot procedure. Blotting was performed at 800 mA for 1 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature on a platform shaker in PBS supplemented with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (Carnation) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T). Incubation with the primary antibody appropriately diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) milk powder was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Afterward, the blot was washed three times for 10 min with PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:3000 in PBS-T for 45 min. Following three washes, the bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Bound antibodies were removed from the membrane with stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min followed by three washing steps in PBS-T and incubation in blocking buffer. The following primary antibodies were used: Myc tag, 9E10 (mouse monoclonal; MSZ); HA tag, 12CA5 (mouse monoclonal; MSZ); phospho-JNK, G-7 (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-6254); JNK1 FL (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-571); phospho-c-Jun; KM-1 (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-822); ERK1 (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-94). SAPK/JNK control cell extracts were commercially available from New England Biolabs. Cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed at 4 °C in ICKA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 nm aprotinin; 10 nm E-64; 5 nmEDTA; 10 nm leupeptin). Following centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, 10 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) were added to the precleared lysates and agitated for 2h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the suspension was mixed again for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in ICKA lysis buffer and once with a 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmdithiothreitol buffer. For the kinase reaction, 30 μl of a mix containing kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) supplemented with bacterially expressed and purified glutathione S-transferase GST-c-Jun N-terminal protein (amino acids 1–135) (24Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was added. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C under constant agitation and terminated by adding 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer (for 1× concentration, see above) and boiling the suspension for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylation of the substrate protein was visualized by autoradiography. The amount of immunoprecipitated protein was controlled by immunoblotting. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded on glass cover slides. 36 h post-transfection the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min. After washing three times in PBS, cells were permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 3–4 min at room temperature. For immunodetection the PBS-washed cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 10 μl of anti-Myc (9E10) antibody diluted in 40 μl of PBS followed by three PBS washing steps. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with a mix of Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (1:15 dilution; Molecular Probes). After washing with PBS, cells were mounted with Mowiol and viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Leitz DMRB). 6-cm tissue culture plates were covered with 5 ml of 0.5% soft agar (SeaPlaque). Cells were suspended in 2 ml of 0.3% soft agar and added to each plate. Cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 105, 104, and 103 cells/dish and incubated for 18 days. Dishes were kept in humidified chambers. For tetracycline treatment, plates were overlaid every fourth day with 2 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Colonies that had undergone several cell divisions (approximately more than 12 cells) were counted as positive colonies. A total of 200 cells/plate within randomly selected fields of view were analyzed, and mean values and standard deviations were calculated. Either the inducible NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line or transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells were used for this assay. In the latter case, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with 0.75 μg of total DNA. 1 day post-transfection four-fifths of the transfected cells were seeded on 9-cm tissue culture plates. Cells were refed twice weekly. 15–18 days postseeding they were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa to visualize the foci of transformed cells. Data shown mean values obtained from three independent plates for each transfection. One-fifth of the transfected cells were cultivated for 2 days, and then total protein lysates were prepared to control the expression of each transfected construct. Until now, structure-based, site-directed mutagenesis failed to produce constitutively active forms of MAP kinases. As an alternative approach, the direct enzyme-substrate fusion was first successfully applied to generate a constitutively active ERK2 kinase (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and most recently also to obtain activated JNK (25Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we generated an activated version of SAPK/JNK through the fusion of SAPKβ in-frame to its specific upstream activator, MKK7. A decapeptide linker (EG)5 providing a flexible region was inserted between the two coding sequences to allow for proper folding of the domains (Fig.1A). In addition. we incorporated a Myc tag at the N-terminal end to facilitate detection of the fusion protein (21Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Kerkhoff E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells showed the expression of the expected 90-kDa SAPKβ-MKK7 fusion protein and also its kinase dead form, SAPKβ-MKK7 KD, in which the critical lysine residues in the ATP-binding sites of SAPKβ (K55A and K56A) and MKK7 (K76E) had been replaced by nonphosphorylatable amino acids (Fig. 1B, lanes 2and 3). MKK7 activates SAPK/JNK by phosphorylating a threonine-proline-tyrosine (TPY) motif in the central part of the protein. The presence of phosphorylation at these sites is indicative of the activated form of the kinase. To analyze whether SAPKβ-MKK7 is constitutively active in mammalian cells, the construct was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Before the preparation of lysates, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 0.05% serum to shut down serum growth factor signaling. As shown in Fig. 2, the inactive SAPKβ-MKK7 KD fusion protein (lane 2) was present as an unphosphorylated protein in cells, whereas SAPKβ-MKK7 was constitutively phosphorylated (lane 1). Furthermore, the expression of the constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7 fusion protein did not affect the activation status of the endogenous SAPK/JNKs. Comparable basal levels of both p54 and p46 SAPK phosphorylation were detectable in the cell lysates of SAPKβ-MKK7 and SAPKβ-MKK7KD or in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 2, and 3). An increase in phosphorylation could only be observed when cells were treated with the known JNK activators arsenite (lane 4) or anisomycin (lane 5) but not after the overexpression of SAPKβ-MKK7 (lane 1). To confirm the identity of the p46/p54 SAPK/JNK proteins, their migratory and immunoblot behavior was compared with SAPK/JNKs present in commercially available control lysates and found to be identical (data not included in Fig. 2). An analysis of MAPK signaling has revealed a high degree of cross-talk between these related signaling pathways. Using the same approach as above, we therefore tested these lysates for a potential activation of p38 or ERK1/2. Consistent with a previous report (25Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we failed to detect any effect of SAPKβ-MKK7 on the activity of these MAPKs (data not shown). To test whether the constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7 fusion protein is able to phosphorylate the SAPK/JNK substrate c-Jun in vivo, SAPKβ-MKK7 and c-Jun were co-expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. An immunoblot was performed using an antibody that recognizes unphosphorylated c-Jun as well as the slower migrating phosphorylated and transcriptionally active form of c-Jun (Fig.3). Whereas the kinase dead SAPKβ-MKK7 fusion protein caused no activation of c-Jun in vivo (Fig.3, lane 1), the expression of constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7 lead to significant phosphorylation of c-Jun as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 3, lane 2) (see also Ref. 21Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Kerkhoff E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). c-Jun transactivation activities are regulated by phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 through SAPK/JNKs. SAPKβ-MKK7 appears to be able to phosphorylate both serine residues because a third intermediate c-Jun band could be observed most likely representing the singly phosphorylated form of c-Jun. The activation of c-Jun by SAPKβ-MKK7 could be completely inhibited when the SAPK/JNK binding domain of JIP-1 is coexpressed (Fig. 3, lane 3). JIP-1 has been described as a scaffold protein that interacts with different components of its SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, and overexpression of the SAPK/JNK binding domain blocked signaling by JNK/SAPK, presumably by the cytoplasmic retention of the kinase (26Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These results are in support of our in vitro data where SAPKβ-MKK7 phosphorylated recombinant GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–135) in an immune complex kinase assay (21Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E.

Upon stimulation, SAPK/JNK kinases translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they phosphorylate a variety of transcription factors including members of the Jun family ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2) and Elk1 but also p53, c-Myc, and NFAT4 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 4) (27Gupta S.

In stimulated cells, a small fraction of activated SAPK/JNK also remains in the cytoplasm to potentially interact with or phosphorylate proteins that are present in this compartment, for instance 3pK (24Ludwig S.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To analyze the distribution of SAPKβ-MKK7, NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with SAPKβ-MKK7 or the kinase dead mutant SAPKβ-MKK7 KD were stained with an antibody directed against the Myc tag epitope (9E10) present in the fusion protein. SAPKβ-MKK7 was found predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 4). Also, in cells expressing lower amounts of the protein the majority of SAPKβ-MKK7 was always detected in the nucleus, whereas its inactive mutant form (Fig. 4) was in all cases totally excluded from the nucleus. These findings are in good agreement with the data of Zheng et al. (25Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the physiological function of SAPK/JNK kinase in mammalian cells, we generated an inducible NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line expressing SAPKβ-MKK7. For this purpose SAPKβ-MKK7 or its inactive form, SAPKβ-MKK7 KD, were cloned into the tet-off-inducible expression vector pREV-TRE and transfected into the previously established NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line NIH 5.15 (22Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following selection, we identified several clones in which the expression of SAPKβ-MKK7 or SAPKβ-MKK7 KD was induced upon the removal of tetracycline. In comparison to transiently transfected cells, all inducible NIH3T3 tet-off clones expressed SAPKβ-MKK7 at lower amounts. Over time the extent of SAPKβ-MKK7 expression gradually declined (data not shown), suggesting that cells cannot tolerate higher amounts of constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7 for longer time periods. To test whether SAPKβ-MKK7 is able to phosphorylate c-Jun in vitro, we performed an immune complex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–135) as the substrate. Three independent NIH 3T3 tet-off clones were grown in the absence of tetracycline to induce the expression of SAPKβ-MKK7. In parallel, cells from the same clones were maintained in the presence of tetracycline to shut down protein synthesis. SAPKβ-MKK7 was immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and assayed for kinase activity (Fig.5). Immunoprecipitates from all three clones were able to phosphorylate c-Jun in vitro (Fig. 5). Reprobing of the same blot with the 9E10 antibody confirmed the presence of the SAPKβ-MKK7 protein (Fig. 5). We also analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Jun under in vivoconditions. Different NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line clones harboring SAPKβ-MKK7 were transiently transfected with c-Jun and cultivated for 24 h in 0.3% serum (Fig. 6). Again, the induction of SAPKβ-MKK7 expression upon tetracycline removal induced an electrophoretic mobility shift of c-Jun. Having established that the SAPKβ-MKK7 fusion functions as an activated JNK/SAPK mutant, we used this tool to analyze the effect of constitutive JNK/SAPK signaling on cellular transformation. As early as 4 days after tetracycline removal many cells (derived from clone 3) growing under subconfluent conditions in 10% serum medium displayed a transformed phenotype (Fig. 7, clone 3). In contrast with the flat phenotype normally observed with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 7A, +tet), these cells were spindle shaped (Fig. 7A, − tet). The phenotype was reversed when cells were switched to tetracycline-containing medium (data not shown). The same results were obtained with two independently isolated NIH 3T3 tet-off cell clones (clones 5 and 33). Following up parallel dishes for a longer time period, we could detect the formation of foci (Fig. 7B, − tet 115.0 ± 21.6 ⇔ + tet 77.5 ± 13.2 foci per dish), which, in contrast to v-Raf-induced foci (Fig. 7B), remained relatively small in size. However, a transient transfection of SAPKβ-MKK7 into NIH 3T3 cells did not result in foci formation. Western blot analysis 18 days after transfection of these cells failed to detect any expression of SAPKβ-MKK7, suggesting that appropriate selection conditions would be required. To further confirm the transforming potential of constitutively active SAPKβ-MKK7, we analyzed SAPKβ-MKK7 expressing cells for their potential to grow in soft agar. In a first attempt the inducible NIH 3T3 tet-off cell line expressing SAPKβ-MKK7 was used. 1000 cells (clone 3) were plated in soft agar in the presence or absence of tetracycline (Fig. 7C, ± tet). Approximately 12 days later, the formation of small cell clusters became clearly visible (Fig. 7C, − tet). On average, ∼19.9 ± 4.6% of the cells seeded yielded colonies in the absence of tetracycline in compar"

In this study, we have analyzed the role of the serum response factor and mechanisms that regulate its activity in tumor progression utilizing a multistage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis. We demonstrate elevated SRF DNA binding activity only in the cell lines that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and have increased actin stress fiber formation. Transient transfection experiments of activated or dominant negative forms of RhoA showed that the high activity of SRF and the induced formation of actin stress fibers in cells with spindle morphology were mediated by RhoA signaling. A dominant negative form of SRF inhibited RhoA-induced actin polymerization and stress fiber formation. The DNA binding activity of SRF in mesenchymal tumor cells was also correlated with elevated expression of SRF target genes, similar to SRF itself, actin, and vinculin. These observations suggest for the first time that SRF may play an important role in tumor progression, specifically at the transition to an invasive metastatic stage of carcinogenesis.

SRF has been shown to be implicated in cell processes like immediate early and tissue-specific gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic pathways (2Schratt G. Weinhold B.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40033-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One of the SRF targets is c-fos, an immediate early gene that can be activated by a variety of growth factors and mitogens through several different signaling pathways (7Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Nature. 1984; 312: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The activation of c-fos by most of these pathways is mediated through the serum response element (SRE) where a protein complex consisting of SRF and ternary complex factors (TCFs) can be formed (8Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The TCF family of transcription factors is composed of three members, the Elk-1, Sap1a, and Sap-2·Erp·Net, that bind DNA through their Ets domain and are recruited to the SRE by direct protein-protein interaction with the SRF (9Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways have been reported to induce transcription through the SRE, being dependent either on TCFs or SRF transcription factors. TCFs are activated after phosphorylation by ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 pathways (10Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.L. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Ducret C. Maira S-M. Lutz Y. Wasylyk B.

SRF activation involves the pathway of the Rho family of GTPases (13Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Rho family members regulate diverse processes including cytoskeletal rearrangements, gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, cell transformation, and cytokinesis (14Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Rho proteins control the cytoskeletal organization by regulating the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (15Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). The formation of the focal adhesions is mediated by the association of integrins with molecules like vinculin (16Huttenlocker A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The transformation by oncogenic Ras is accompanied by dramatic alterations in actin cytoskeleton, and it is known that GTPases of the Ras subfamily can activate cascades of the Rho family members (17Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Functional RhoA is also required for serum- and lysophosphatidic acid-induced activation of SRF (18Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that changes in actin dynamics regulated by RhoA and LIM kinase-1 are critical to SRE activation (19Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Chihara K. Amano M. Nakamura N. Yano T. Shibata M. Tokui T. Ichikawa H. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25121-25127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of SRF in chemically induced multistage carcinogenesis. One of the best characterized animal models for studying the genetic and biological alterations in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression is the mouse skin system. Treatment with the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene causes H-rasgene mutations during tumor initiation. Additional changes have been detected at the H-ras locus in tumor promotion induced by further treatment of the initiated lesions with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (21Balmain A. Brown K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 25-70Google Scholar). A series of cell lines representative of different stages of mouse skin carcinogenesis has been used for our studies. It has been previously shown that the product of the c-fosgene is overexpressed in malignant tumors in the multistep mouse skin carcinogenesis model (22Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-fos-deficient mice carrying a H-ras transgene fail to undergo malignant progression (23Saez E. Rutberg S.E. Mueller E. Oppenheim H. Smoluk J. Yuspa S.H. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the main factors regulating c-fos transcription like SRF and TCFs could be important in tumor progression. In this study, we show that SRF is overexpressed and highly active only in tumor cells that have undergone the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquired a spindle phenotype. In addition, SRF target genes that encode for different cytoskeletal factors like vinculin and actin are overexpressed in the spindle tumor cells. The activation of SRF and induction of actin stress fibers observed in the mesenchymal cells are regulated by RhoA signaling. In addition, a dominant negative form of SRF blocks RhoA-mediated actin polymerization. Our data link active RhoA with actin polymerization, SRF activation, and neoplastic transformation. The mouse cell lines C50, P1, B9, A5, and CarB were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and used for nuclear protein extraction and transfections. Nuclear and total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (22Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) when cells had reached 90% confluency. The concentration of protein extracts was estimated by a kit (Bio-Rad) based on the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. SRF and Elk-1 proteins were expressed by pTL2SRF and pTL2Elk-1 plasmids, respectively (25Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For transient expression assays, cells were seeded at 30% confluency and transfected by the calcium phosphate method (26Graham F.L. van der Eb A. J. Virol. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 20 μg/plate with the use of pSG5 plasmid. 18 h after the transfection, the precipitate was removed, and the cells were further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 h. 1 or 5 μg of pEXV-Myc-RhoAV14 and pEXV-Myc-RhoAN19 (17Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and pCGN-SRFpm1 (27Poser S. Impey S. Trinh K. Xia Z. Storm D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4855-4966Crossref Google Scholar) plasmids were transfected, and total cell extracts were prepared as described above. The Rho-GTP pull-down assay was performed as described previously (28Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). GST-RBD of the effector protein Rhotekin was used to affinity precipitate cellular GTP-Rho. The bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blot using antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 15 μg of nuclear protein extracts or 30 μg of total cell extracts were reduced and then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. The processes of electrophoresis and of transfer to membrane were performed using standard protocols (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 479-504Google Scholar). The blots were blocked for 2 h in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding antisera raised against SRF, Sap1a, actin, vinculin, RhoA as well as with antisera against Elk-1 and Net (25Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were visualized using the kit of enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and quantitation was performed by densitometry of x-ray films. Annealed oligonucleotides for the c-fos serum response element were end-labeled with the T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the products were gel-purified. The following oligonucleotides used were one pair containing wild type SRE (5′-TACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACA-3′ and 5′-TGTCCTAATATGGACATCCTGTGTA-3′), one pair containing the SRE mutated at the Ets binding site (mt-wt) (5′-TACAACTGATGTCCATATTAGGACA-3′ and 5′-TGTCCTAATATGGACATCAGTTGTA-3′), and one pair containing the SRE mutated at the SRF binding site (mt-wt) (5′-TACACAGGATGTCCATCGGCTGACA-3′ and 5′-TGTCAGCCGATGGACATCCΤGTGTA-3′). Approximately, 100 cps of γ-32P-labeled DNA and 5 μg of nuclear cell extracts or 10 μg of total cell extracts or 3 μl of in vitro translated proteins were used for each reaction. The binding reactions were performed in 2× SRE binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. For composition analysis, 0.5 μg of each antibody was added in each reaction prior to the addition of the probe, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The DNA-protein complexes were then loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis (16 mA for 5 h) was carried out in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer at room temperature. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed. Cells that had been grown on glass coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were again washed as described above and were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After permeabilization, incubation with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in 1:350 concentration was carried out for 45 min at room temperature in a dark humid chamber. The cells were again washed, mounted with 80% glycerol, and visualized under fluorescent microscope. Because c-fos has been shown to be involved in mouse skin tumor progression (22Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that serum response factor, an important transcriptional regulator of c-fos, could play a role at a specific stage of progression in this system. For this purpose, we made use of a series of epidermal cell lines representing all of the important stages of skin tumor development. C50 is a nontumorigenic immortalized cell line. P1 is a papilloma cell line, B9 is a squamous cell carcinoma from a multiple 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene-treated mouse, and A5 is a spindle cell carcinoma isolated from the same tumor (30Burns P. Kemp C. Gannon G. Lane D. Bremner R. Balmain A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2363-2369PubMed Google Scholar). CarB is a highly aggressive spindle cell carcinoma. C50, P1, and B9 have a typical epithelioid morphology. A5 and CarB have a mesenchymal or fibroblastoid morphology and give rise to spindle cell carcinomas upon injection into nude mice (31Stoler A.B. Stenback F. Balmain A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1103-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cells. To test the DNA binding activity on SRE in these cell lines, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed (Fig.1A). The same nuclear extracts used for the Western blot of C50, P1, B9, A5, and CarB cell lines were incubated with 32P-labeled SRE oligonucleotide containing Ets and SRF binding sites. As a control, the samples showing DNA binding of in vitro translated SRF and Elk-1 proteins were included. Protein-DNA complexes were formed with gradually increasing binding activity from the nontumorigenic to the fully malignant cell lines. The highest activity was observed at the late stages of carcinogenesis where the SRF DNA binding activity was elevated by ∼80-fold in the A5 and 60-fold in the CarB cells compared with the C50 cells. Also, in B9 cells, the SRF DNA binding activity was increased by 10-fold compared with C50 cells. In addition, the SRF·TCF ternary complex was formed only in A5 and CarB cell lines. The contribution of SRF and Ets binding sites on the protein-DNA complex formation was further examined (Fig. 1B). For that purpose, we used an oligonucleotide with mutated Ets and intact SRF binding sites termed mut-wt as well as an oligonucleotide with intact Ets and mutated SRF binding sites termed wt-mut. These oligonucleotides were incubated with the cell nuclear extracts and thein vitro translated proteins described above. The Ets binding site was shown to be important for the ternary complex formation (lanes 1–7), whereas the SRF binding site was essential for the formation of any protein-DNA complex related to SRF (lanes 8–14). Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts showed that SRF protein expression slightly increased in the papilloma and the squamous carcinoma cell lines (P1 and B9, respectively) compared with the immortalized C50 cells. The amount of the SRF protein present in the spindle A5 and CarB cells was increased by ∼10-fold compared with C50 cells (Fig. 1C). The fact that the ternary complex was only formed in the spindle cell lines led us to investigate the expression levels of the TCF family members. Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts of the C50, P1, B9, A5, and CarB cell lines showed that the expression levels of Elk-1, Sap1a, and Net (upper bands) proteins did not change in tumor progression (Fig.2A). To investigate the contribution of each factor to the ternary complex formation, the composition analysis of the protein complex formed in A5 cells was carried out by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.2B). Incubation with anti-SRF, anti-Elk-1, anti-Sap1a, and anti-Net antibodies showed that SRF was the main component of the complex and that Elk-1, Sap1a, and mostly Net were participating in the formation of the ternary complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–5). The bottom band corresponds to an SRE-interacting polypeptide not related to SRF and TCFs. In vitro translated proteins with the corresponding antibodies were used as controls (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–9). These experiments showed that the ternary complex formation depends on the amount (Fig. 1C) and the DNA binding activity of the SRF protein rather than the expression levels of the protein members of the TCF family and that only at the late stages of carcinogenesis, target genes can potentially have maximal transcriptional induction through SRE. It has been reported that SRF is a nuclear target of an ill-defined RhoA-mediated signaling pathway. To investigate the RhoA effect, we selected B9 and A5 cells that represent the two distinct stages of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and show dramatic changes in SRF DNA binding activity. To determine the endogenous levels of RhoA in B9 and A5 cells, we performed an analysis of total cell extracts by Western blot and GST-RBD (RBD of Rhotekin fused to GST) pull-down assays. Total RhoA protein levels were determined by Western blot by utilizing a specific antibody against RhoA. The levels of active GTP-bound RhoA were determined by pull-down assays of RhoA bound to GST-RBD, and then the amount of RhoA was determined by Western blot utilizing a specific RhoA antibody. It was shown that both total and active RhoA levels were significantly higher in A5 compared with B9 cells (Fig. 3A). To explore whether the increased SRF DNA binding activity is regulated by RhoA signaling in this cell system, B9 and A5 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the activated or dominant negative forms of RhoA, respectively. Western blot analysis using total cell extracts showed no particular changes in the expression levels of SRF protein after the overexpression of the RhoA forms either in B9 or in A5 cells (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of the RhoA proteins after transfection were determined by Western blot analysis by using antiserum against their c-myc tag (Fig.3B). However, on electrophoretic mobility shift assay using total cell extracts and the oligo carrying both the intact SRF and Ets binding sites, the changes of DNA binding on SRE were clearly seen after RhoA transfections. Specifically, the SRF DNA binding activity was substantially increased in B9 cells when transfected with the activated form of RhoA and decreased in A5 cells when transfected with the dominant negative form of RhoA (Fig. 3D). These experiments showed that RhoA signaling could regulate the DNA binding activity of SRF in this multistage carcinogenesis model. Our data suggested that SRF activity was regulated by RhoA signaling in the model system under study. Although both B9 and A5 cells carry oncogenic Ras alleles, B9 cells have maintained their well differentiated epithelial phenotype, whereas A5 cells have acquired a less differentiated mesenchymal phenotype. It has been illustrated that actin dynamics by RhoA leads to SRF activation (19Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the organization of actin in these cell types. After phalloidin staining of exponentially growing B9 cells, very few and thin actin cables were seen located mainly in the cortex just beneath the plasma membrane (Fig.4A). In contrast, A5 cells were characterized by a dense actin stress fiber network, which was extended on the whole cell surface (Fig. 4D). To prove that actin polymerization was dependent on RhoA activation, we transiently expressed 1 μg of activated RhoA in B9 cells and 1 μg of a dominant negative form of RhoA in A5 cells, respectively. Phalloidin staining showed that active RhoA was sufficient for the induction of actin stress fibers in B9 cells (Fig. 4B). Transient co-expression in B9 cells of activated RhoA and pCGN-SRFpm1, which encodes for a dominant negative form of SRF, resulted in the prevention of RhoA-induced actin polymerization and stress fiber formation (Fig.4C). On the other hand, dominant negative RhoA was able to disrupt the assembly of actin stress fibers in A5 cells (Fig.4E). A co-expression of dominant negative RhoA with SRF in A5 cells did not induce actin stress fiber formation, most probably because SRF could not be activated by the nonfunctional RhoA pathway in this case (Fig. 4F). The transient transfection of dominant negative RhoA in B9 cells or activated RhoA in A5 cells, respectively, did not affect the actin polymerization state in these cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the model of SRF regulation by actin treadmilling may occur in this cell system. According to that model, active RhoA in A5 cells induces actin stress fiber formation, which in turn results in high SRF activity. The expression levels of SRF target genes like SRF itself (Fig.1C), vinculin, and actin were analyzed by Western blot assay. The expression of vinculin increased dramatically by 10-fold in mesenchymal tumor cells compared with the immortalized C50 cell line (Fig. 5A). The expression of actin also showed a slight increase in spindle tumors (Fig.5B). These data together with the previously reported increase in the expression of c-fos gene (16Huttenlocker A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) show that SRF target genes are overexpressed in A5 and CarB cell lines. SRF function is important for cellular physiology and development. However, little is known for its implication in tumorigenesis. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the SRF transcription factor in the unraveling of neoplastic process using the mouse skin multistage carcinogenesis model. Our results demonstrate for the first time that SRF is implicated in cancer progression, specifically at the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of carcinoma cells. In addition, the expression and activity of SRF are associated with the activation of RhoA and actin dynamics. The high SRF DNA binding activity at the SRE in the spindle tumor cell lines could be attributed to elevated SRF protein levels and post-translational events. High protein expression levels of SRF results in the activation of target genes, the SRF gene itself included, which is regulated by the binding sites of two SRF, a Ets, and a Sp1/Egr-1 located in its promoter sequence. The SRF binding sites are targeted by Rho-dependent pathways, and the Sp1 binding site is targeted by a Ras-dependent pathway (32Spencer J Misra R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7319-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Ras and Rho signaling pathways cross-talk during malignant cell transformation (33Sahai E. Olson M. Marshall C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is probable that the high expression levels of SRF protein observed in A5 and CarB cell lines result from the transcriptional regulation of the SRF gene by activated Ras and RhoA signaling. Remarkably, RhoA has been found to be overexpressed and more active in the mesenchymal A5 cells compared with the epithelial B9 cells. It has been shown in many studies that SRF activity depends on the interaction with factors like TCFs to regulate SRE-responsive genes. The TCF phosphorylation status might well have a role in the late stages of tumor progression in this system, because TCFs have been shown to be regulated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and ERK pathways and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (22Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as ERK signals 2K. Katsanakis, V. Gorgoulis, A. Pintzas, and V. Zoumpourlis, submitted for publication. are highly active in A5 and CarB cells. We detected the SRF·TCF complex formation only in cells with high SRF activity. It has been shown recently that differential usage of signal transduction pathways defines at least two types of SRF target genes (34Gineitis D. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24531-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) depending on the functional interaction of SRF with TCFs. SRF is an important mediator of RhoA signaling to the nucleus, and its activity on target genes is dependent on cytoskeletal changes in several cell types (18Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As described in Fig. 3, the regulation of SRF activity in mouse keratinocytes was RhoA-dependent. Alterations in actin dynamics mediated by the actin regulator LIM kinase-1 appear to be necessary and sufficient for the activation of SRF target genes. More specifically, it is the ability of both LIM kinase-1 and signals through Rho GTPases that regulate the actin treadmilling cycle, which in turn regulates SRF activity (19Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Also, in REF52 cells, active RhoA induces actin stress fibers and focal adhesions that contain vinculin and causes transcriptional activation through the SRE element (20Chihara K. Amano M. Nakamura N. Yano T. Shibata M. Tokui T. Ichikawa H. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25121-25127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). High SRF activity was detected in A5 spindle tumor cells, which are mesenchymal cells with an altered organization of actin cytoskeleton compared with squamous B9 cells. Remarkably, B9 and A5 clones were isolated from the same primary tumor, and they represent the two extreme stages of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (30Burns P. Kemp C. Gannon G. Lane D. Bremner R. Balmain A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2363-2369PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that in A5 cells, additional factors with a similar function to the recently described muscle activator striated muscle activator of Rho signaling, (35Arai A. Spencer J.A. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) might be important in activating RhoA signaling and SRF-dependent transcription. Our study has shown that actin stress fiber formation was also regulated by RhoA signaling in these cells and that this effect is mediated by SRF function. These results could be related to the finding that oncogenic Ras down-regulates Rac and up-regulates Rho activity, although sustained activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (36Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kamme R.A. Collard J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The involvement of RhoA in the induction of the spindle phenotype is important in view of the recent demonstration that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) can stimulate cell motility and actin cytoskeletal reorganization by a RhoA-dependent mechanism (37Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Enge M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). It has previously been demonstrated that some features of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition can be induced in squamous carcinoma cells by treatment with TGF-β and that this transition can be inhibited by the expression of dominant interfering TGF-β receptor mutants (38Portella G. Cumming S.A. Liddell J. Cui W. Ireland H. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of the spindle phenotype by TGF-β is compatible with earlier results showing that the overexpression of this growth factor in the epidermis of transgenic mice leads to an increase in the rate of tumor progression and a higher incidence of spindle tumors (39Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the activation of Rho A is a consequence of up-regulation of TGF-β signaling that is associated with the development of the spindle phenotype. The results presented here establish an important further step in this process by demonstrating that RhoA activation leads directly to the activation of the DNA binding capacity of SRF transcription factor complexes and to the consequent induction of their downstream target sequences. It is not clear whether the overexpression of SRF itself or the regulation of one or more of its target genes is responsible for progression to mesenchymal tumors. We have presented evidence that SRF target genes like vinculin, actin, c-fos (22Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and SRF gene itself are highly expressed in mesenchymal cells, indicating an important role for SRF in the formation of spindle tumor phenotype. It will be of interest to further investigate the regulation of SRF targets in this cell system as well as the effects of long term inhibition of SRF function, which may lead to phenotypic reversion.

Mutations in any of these nine genes result in a 50% or greater reduction in crossing over and consequently in increased levels of homolog non-disjunction and spore death. Mutations in ZIP1,ZIP2, ZIP3, and MER3 also cause a defect in meiotic progression and result in cell cycle arrest prior to meiosis I (4Agarwal S. Roeder G.S.

In addition, in cases where it has been examined (i.e. ZIP1, MSH4, andMER3), mutations in these genes also cause defects in crossover interference and hence defects in the regulation of the distribution of crossovers along a chromosome (9Nakagawa T.

Overall, these results have been taken to suggest that the proteins encoded byMSH4, MSH5, MLH1, MLH3,ZIP1, ZIP2, ZIP3, MER3, andEXO1 function in a crossover-specific meiotic recombination pathway. Exactly how these proteins function to promote crossing over is unclear, although two types of mechanisms have been suggested: in one case the proteins act early in recombination to produce the intermediates that potentially result in crossovers, and in the other case they act to modulate the resolution of Holliday junction recombination intermediates to yield crossovers (22Storlazzi A., Xu, L.

The MER3 protein is specifically expressed during meiosis where it is required for crossing over (9Nakagawa T. Ogawa H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5714-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homology with proteins known to be DNA helicases, MER3 was predicted to be a DNA helicase. The purified MER3 protein was found to bind both ssDNA2 and dsDNA and have potent ATPase activity that was stimulated either by ssDNA or dsDNA (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Nakagawa T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3281-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The MER3 protein had DNA helicase activity and unwound 50-, 100-, and 631-nt fragments annealed to M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA in a reaction that required ATP and Mg2+. Unwinding of the 100- and 631-nt fragments required high amounts of MER3, although relatively low amounts of MER3 could unwind the 100- and 631-nt fragments in the presence of ssDNA-binding proteins, eitherS. cerevisiae RPA (28Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or Escherichia coli SSB (29McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The polarity of the MER3 helicase was determined to be 3′ to 5′ relative to the single-stranded regions of the helicase substrates. On the basis of these properties, it was suggested that MER3 could function in recombination by promoting the initial unwinding of recombination substrates, by driving strand exchange promoted by RAD51 (30Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) and DMC1 (31Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study we have investigated the interaction between MER3 and defined DNA substrates including a Holliday junction with 25-bp arms with blunt ends, a 50-bp dsDNA with blunt ends, a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 5′-overhang, and a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 3′-overhang. MER3 was found to unwind these substrates with a substrate preference of 3′-overhang > Holliday junction > blunt end > 5′-overhang. Possible roles for such unwinding reactions in recombination are discussed. The MER3 protein tagged with a FLAG epitope at the C terminus that was previously shown to complement a mer3 deletion mutant (27Nakagawa T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3281-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in yeast cells and purified by binding to FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) followed by sequential chromatography on Mono Q HR5/5, HiTrap heparin, and Mono S HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) columns, as previously described (26Nakagawa T.

To prepare the Holliday junction blunt, 3′-, and 5′-overhang substrates (Fig. 1), and the Holliday junction derivative containing one mispaired base in each arm at the junction (Fig. 5 C, HJMIS), oligonucleotide T70 was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled DNA was mixed with 2× concentrations of other oligonucleotides (T71, T72, and T73 for the Holliday junction substrate; T74 for the blunt substrate; T76 for the 3′-overhang substrate; T75 for the 5′-overhang substrate; T88, T89, and T90 for the HJMIS substrate) in annealing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl), heated to 94 °C for 5 min, then cooled down to 20 °C over a 2-h period. The annealed DNAs were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (60:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). The DNA was recovered by soaking the excised band in elution buffer (0.5m NaCl, 0.6 m sodium acetate, 1 mmEDTA) overnight at 4 °C followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol. The recovered DNA pellet was dissolved in suspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl), and the concentration of the purified DNA was determined using a DNA DipStick™ (Invitrogen). The DNA substrates containing different lengths of a poly(dA) 3′-tail (Fig.4, B and C) were prepared as described above, except that oligonucleotide BOT was 5′-end-labeled and annealed to TOP, TOP2, TOP3, TOP4, TOP6, TOP8, TOP12, or TOP20.Table IOligonucleotides for the construction of DNA substratesT70(50nt) 5′-TCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTC-3′T71(50nt) 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCCA-3′T72(50nt) 5′-AACGTCATAGACGATTACATTGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′T73(50nt) 5′-TGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′T74(50nt) 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′T75(30nt) 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACA-3′T76(30nt) 5′-TGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′T88(50nt) 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTCTCTGCACTTTGCCCACGTTGACCCA-3′T89(50nt) 5′-AACGTCATAGACGATTACATACGTCTGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′T90(50nt) 5′-TGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGTGCAGCTACGTATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′BOT(30nt) 5′-GCATAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATTCG-3′TOP(30nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGC-3′TOP2A(32nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAA-3′TOP3A(33nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAA-3′TOP4A(34nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAAA-3′TOP6A(36nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAAAAA-3′TOP8A(38nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAAAAAAA-3′TOP12A(42nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAAAAAAAAAAA-3′TOP20A(50nt) 5′-CGAATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTATGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Figure 5The effect of MgCl2 concentration on MER3 helicase activity.

After incubation for 30 min on ice, 5 μl of loading buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to the binding reaction. The DNA protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels (19:1) run in low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA), and the 32P-labeled DNA-containing bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager (445 SI, Molecular Dynamics). The indicated amount of protein and 1 nm DNA substrate (concentration is in moles of molecules) were incubated in 20-μl volumes containing DNA helicase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP). The NaCl and MgCl2 concentrations and both the divalent cation and nucleotide type were varied in individual experiments as indicated. All reactions were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, started by the addition of MER3 protein, and then incubation was continued for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS) and 0.5 μl of 25 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. For time courses, 110-μl reactions were performed, and aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn at the indicated time points and mixed with 2.5 μl of stop buffer and 0.25 μl of 25 mg/ml proteinase K. The DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels run in Tris borate/EDTA (TBE). The gels were dried, and the radiolabeled DNA was visualized using a phosphorimager. The ability of MER3 to bind to different DNA substrates was analyzed using gel mobility shift assays. The DNA substrates analyzed were a model Holliday junction with 25-bp arms, each of which had a blunt end, a 50-bp dsDNA with blunt ends, a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 3′-ssDNA overhang, and a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 5′-ssDNA overhang (Fig. 1, A–D). Incubating each of these DNA substrates with increasing amounts of MER3 resulted in the production of specific, more slowly migrating protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 1, E–H). We do not know if the multiple, slow-migrating DNA species formed represent the binding of multiple MER3 molecules or different DNA conformations. However, since the relative proportion of the slowly migrating species increases as the protein concentration increases, where there are excess amounts of MER3 over DNA substrates (Fig. 1, E–H, lanes 3 and4), it seems possible that these forms require binding of multiple MER3 molecules. The relative affinity of MER3 for each of the DNA substrates appeared to be similar. To determine if MER3 could unwind the Holliday junction substrate, MER3 DNA helicase assays were performed with either the Holliday junction substrate (Fig. 1 A) or the dsDNA substrate with a 3′-overhang (Fig. 1 C). Reactions were performed with different divalent cations and different nucleotide cofactors (Fig.2). MER3 converted the Holliday junction to a mixture of partially unwound Y-junctions and completely unwound ssDNA and converted the dsDNA with a 3′-overhang to ssDNA. These unwinding reactions required a divalent cation, of which MgCl2 and MnCl2 were equally effective at the concentration tested. A small amount of unwound product was observed in the presence of CaCl2, and no unwound product was observed in the presence of ZnCl2 at the concentration tested. ATP and dATP were equally effective at supporting the unwinding reaction, whereas ATPγS and ADP did not support unwinding at the concentration tested. No difference in the requirement for divalent cations and nucleotides was observed for MER3-dependent unwinding of the Holliday junction and the 3′-overhang substrates under the reaction conditions used. These results clearly indicate that MER3 can unwind a Holliday junction in addition to unwinding a dsDNA with a 3′-overhang. To better characterize the MER3 DNA helicase activity, the ability of MER3 to unwind the Holliday junction, blunt end dsDNA and 3′- and 5′-overhang substrates (Fig. 1, A–D) was studied as a function of MER3 concentration (Fig. 3,A and B) and incubation time (Fig. 3,C and D). All four substrates were unwound by MER3, and all of the unwinding reactions showed a relatively similar time course and protein concentration dependence. Under the reaction conditions used (Fig. 3), multiple DNA substrates were unwound per MER3 monomer; note that the active species of MER3 is thought to be an oligomeric form, although the exact species is not known because MER3 appears to exist as a heterogeneous mixture of different oligomers (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,27Nakagawa T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3281-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the results, MER3 appeared to have a substrate preference of 3′-overhang > Holliday junction > blunt > 5′-overhang. The same preference was observed in the reactions containing a higher concentration of MER3 (2.5 nm) that were incubated for a longer period of time (60 min) where 100% unwinding of the Holliday junction was observed; under conditions where the Holliday junction was 100% unwound, the extent of unwinding of the blunt-end substrate observed never exceeded 50%, a finding similar to the results shown in Fig. 3 (data not shown). The observation that the 3′-overhang substrate is the preferred substrate is consistent with previously published results showing that the MER3 helicase acts by binding to ssDNA and translocating along it in the 3′ to 5′ direction displacing hybridized ssDNA fragments (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given this polarity and the fact that apparently MER3 can initiate unwinding from a blunt end, it is not surprising that the 5′-overhang substrate was the least preferred substrate; compared with the other substrates where each end could serve as an entry site, the 5′-overhang substrate likely has only one end that can serve as an entry site since binding to the 5′-overhang would result in unproductive translocation off of the substrate. The observation that MER3 could initiate unwinding from a blunt end was possibly unexpected given previous results that MER3 binds ssDNA and translocates along it. The mechanism of unwinding from blunt ends was investigated further by examining the effect of NaCl on the unwinding of each of the four substrates (Fig.4 A). Unwinding of the 3′-overhang substrate was unaffected by the addition of 150 mm NaCl. In contrast, unwinding of all of the other substrates was significantly inhibited by the addition of 150 mm NaCl. Since 150 mm NaCl does not inherently inhibit MER3 helicase activity, one explanation for this effect is that unwinding from blunt ends requires transient denaturation (i.e. breathing) of the ends, and the inhibitory effect of 150 mm NaCl is caused by stabilization of the blunt ends. Because breathing would not be expected to produce large regions of ssDNA, the size of the 3′ single-stranded overhang required for efficient unwinding of the 3′-overhang substrate was studied in the presence of 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 4, B andC). Substrates containing 2, 3, or 4 dA residues of 3′-overhang were all unwound with the same efficiency as a blunt-ended substrate, whereas substrates containing 6, 8, 12, and 20 dA residues of 3′-overhang were all unwound with significantly increased, but identical efficiency. This indicates that MER3 requires a short (not more than six nucleotides) single-stranded region to serve as an entry site to initiate unwinding. Such a small entry site size is consistent with the observation that MER3 can unwind blunt-ended substrates more efficiently at low, but not high, NaCl concentrations. However, it should be noted that high NaCl concentrations also affect the configuration of model Holliday junctions (33Murchie A.I. Clegg R.M. von Kitzing E. Duckett D.R. Diekmann S. Lilley D.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 34Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Duckett D.R.

Diekmann S. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4846-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that the affect of NaCl on unwinding of the Holliday junction could reflect effects on both the ends of the substrate and the junction itself (see “Discussion”). MER3 unwound the Holliday junction substrate 2–3× more efficiently than the dsDNA with blunt ends (Fig. 3, B and D). However, this is an underestimate of the relative efficiency of unwinding if unwinding can only initiate from the ends, because unwinding the dsDNA with blunt ends only requires initiating unwinding from one end, whereas fully unwinding a Holliday junction likely requires initiating unwinding from as many as three ends. This analysis suggests that a Holliday junction could be unwound by a different mechanism than a dsDNA with blunt ends. To investigate the mechanism of unwinding further, a titration of MgCl2 concentrationversus unwinding was performed (Fig.5, A and B). Unwinding of both the 3′-overhang and blunt substrates was essentially maximal at 0.5 mm MgCl2, and MgCl2concentrations up to 5 mm resulted in the same level of unwinding. Unwinding of the 5′-overhang substrate increased in MgCl2 concentrations of up to 2 mm, above which activity would plateau. Unwinding of the Holliday junction showed a completely different dependence on MgCl2 concentration. Unwinding steadily increased until maximal activity occurred at 1.5 mm MgCl2; this level of unwinding was 2–3× higher than observed for the blunt dsDNA substrate at the same MgCl2 concentration. Above 1.5 mmMgCl2, the extent of unwinding decreased until a plateau was reached at MgCl2 concentrations of 3 mm and above; in the plateau region, the efficiency of unwinding the Holliday junction was the same as with the blunt-end substrate. Because the MgCl2-dependent MER3 activity peak observed with the Holliday junction substrate does not correspond to an effect on MER3 helicase activity, it seems likely that the MgCl2effect reflects an effect of MgCl2 concentration on the conformation of the Holliday junction substrate. Indeed, it is well known that MgCl2 and other salts have significant effects on the conformation of the types of Holiday junctions used here as substrates (33Murchie A.I. Clegg R.M. von Kitzing E. Duckett D.R. Diekmann S. Lilley D.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 34Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To further analyze such junction effects, a Holliday junction was constructed by modifying the core sequence of oligonucleotides T88, T89, and T90 so that the junction could not branch migrate and contained one mismatched base pair (C:T) in each arm at the junction. A titration of MgCl2 concentrationversus unwinding was then performed using the modified Holliday junction substrate (HJMIS) (Fig. 5, Cand D). Unwinding of the HJMIS substrate did not show the MgCl2 optimum of the fully paired Holliday junction but, rather, the MgCl2 titration was essentially the same as seen with the 3′-overhang and blunt-end substrates. In the present study, we have extensively characterized the ability of the MER3 DNA helicase to unwind model DNA substrates constructed with oligonucleotides. The MER3 protein was able to unwind double-stranded DNA substrates, including a 30-bp dsDNA, with a 20-nt 3′-overhang, a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 5′-overhang, a 50-bp dsDNA with blunt ends, and a Holliday junction with 25-bp arms, each of which had a blunt end. The 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nt 3′-overhang was unwound with the greatest efficiency consistent with previous results showing that the MER3 helicase acts by translocating along single-stranded DNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MER3 also appeared to be able to initiate unwinding from blunt ends at reduced efficiency, possibly by binding to transient single-stranded regions produced at the ends by breathing. Consistent with this, only a short 6-nt or longer 3′ single-stranded overhang was required for maximal unwinding of 3′-overhang substrates. The 5′-overhang substrate was also a substrate for MER3, although it was the least efficient substrate. This unwinding was likely due to initiation on the blunt end, because initiation on the 5′-overhang would result in non-productive translocation off of the substrate. MER3 could unwind Holliday junction substrates with a greater efficiency than the 50-bp blunt-end dsDNA substrate. Given that it should require three separate initiation events to unwind a Holliday junction from the ends compared with one initiation event for the blunt end dsDNA substrate, the Holliday junctions were clearly preferred substrates for MER3 compared with the blunt-end dsDNA substrate. The observation that MER3 can unwind Holliday junctions places MER3 in a class of DNA helicases that function in recombination and repair including E. coli RuvAB (37Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Holliday junctions, like the ones studied here, undergo conformational changes that are modulated by cations like Mg2+ (33Murchie A.I. Clegg R.M. von Kitzing E. Duckett D.R. Diekmann S. Lilley D.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 34Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Duckett D.R.

Diekmann S. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4846-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mg2+, these junctions exist as planar-X structures. As the Mg2+ concentration is increased to 80 μm, these structures undergo a change to a stacked-X configuration (34Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which is the configuration recognized by Holliday junction resolution enzymes. As the Mg2+concentration is increased, the stability of the stacked-X configuration increases progressively because the Mg2+ ions counterbalance the negative charges of the DNA backbone allowing the DNA arms to stack more tightly on each other. Ions such as Na+ induce the same changes, albeit at a higher concentration. When mispaired bases are introduced at the base of the junction, significantly higher Mg2+ concentrations are required to induce the planar- to stacked-X conformational change (46Duckett D.R. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The titration of MgCl2 concentration versus MER3 catalyzed unwinding of the fully base paired Holliday junction showed an unusual optimum at 1.5 mm MgCl2. This does not correspond to an effect of Mg2+ on MER3 helicase activity using DNA substrates other than a Holliday junction and is thus likely to represent an effect of Mg2+ on Holliday junction structure. Because of the presence of ATP in the DNA helicase reactions, it is difficult to know the free Mg2+concentration in the Mg2+ titrations performed here. However, given the ATP concentration of 2 mm, the amount of free Mg2+ present at the 1.5 mmMg2+ activity peak is likely to be quite low and in the range where the planar- to stacked-X conformational change occurs. Likewise, the inhibition of unwinding seen at higher Mg2+concentrations likely represents stabilization of the stacked-X structure that occurs at high Mg2+ concentrations. The observation that introducing mispaired bases in each arm at the junction significantly alters the Mg2+ versusactivity titration supports this interpretation. The modified Holliday junction would be predicted to require higher Mg2+concentrations for induction of both types of structural changes. These results suggest that unwinding of a Holliday junction by MER3 is highly sensitive to the conformation at the junction. A somewhat similar inhibitory effect by an excess Mg2+ was also observed with the bacterial RecQ and RecG helicases (47Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 48Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, combined with the observation that MER3 unwound the Holliday junction substrates more efficiently than the blunt-end dsDNA substrate, the unusual effect of Mg2+ concentration on Holliday junction unwinding raises the possibility that MER3 might initiate unwinding of a Holliday junction from the junction rather than from the ends. Alternatively, unwinding could initiate at the ends, and at 1.5 mmMgCl2 the Holliday junction could assume a conformation that is much more easily unwound than the linear dsDNA substrates. Previous studies have suggested that MER3 could act during at least two stages during meiotic recombination. It could either act in the initiation of strand invasion or in extending the length of early heteroduplex recombination intermediates and thus promote the formation of a recombination intermediate required for crossing over, or it could function to promote the resolution of Holliday junctions to yield crossovers (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide more detail about how MER3 could act during recombination. The observation that MER3 can unwind dsDNA from blunt ends suggests that MER3 could be involved in unwinding the ends of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) prior to their resection. However, this is inconsistent with the observation that MER3 is not required for resection of meiotic DSBs and suggests that MER3 acts later in recombination such as in promoting strand exchange after the DSBs are resected. The observation that MER3 can unwind Holliday junctions supports the idea that MER3 could act later in recombination by branch migrating Holliday junctions to extend the regions of heteroduplex DNA formed and thus stabilize early recombination intermediates. In this regard, initiation of branch migration by binding to the Holliday junction or by binding to DNA at a distant site followed by translocation to the Holliday junction would both result in similar branch migration. In addition, the ability to unwind Holliday junctions could also reflect a role of MER3 in the resolution of such intermediates.

Natural freeze tolerance includes both seasonal and freeze-induced molecular adaptations that control ice formation, deal with long-term ischemia, regulate cell volume changes, and protect macromolecules. This report identifies and characterizes a novel freeze-inducible gene, li16, that codes for a protein of 115 amino acids. Northern blot analysis showed that li16 transcript levels rose quickly during freezing to reach levels 3.7-fold higher than control values after 24 h; immunoblotting showed a parallel 2.4-fold rise in Li16 protein. Regulatory influences on gene expression were assessed. Nuclear runoff assays confirmed that freezing initiated an increase in the rate of li16 transcription, and analysis of signal transduction pathways via in vitro incubation of liver slices implicated a cGMP-mediated pathway in li16 expression. Gene and protein expression in liver was also strongly stimulated by anoxia exposure, whereas the gene was less responsive to dehydration stress. The strong response of li16 to both freezing and anoxia, and the rapid down-regulation of the gene when oxygen was reintroduced, suggest that the Li16 protein may play a role in ischemia resistance during freezing."
https://openalex.org/W2109748820,"The importance of nerve growth factor (NGF) modulation of pancreatic beta cells is demonstrated by the fact that these cells secrete and respond to this trophic factor. Among NGF effects on beta cells is an increase in Na+ and Ca2+ current densities. This study investigates the mechanisms involved in the NGF-induced increase in Na+ current and the implications of this effect for insulin secretion. The following results were obtained in single beta cells cultured with NGF for 5-7 days: 1) A steady-state level of mRNA coding for type III sodium channel alpha subunit increased twofold compared with that for control cells. 2) The increase in Na+ current density was blocked either by cycloheximide or by actinomycin D, indicating that it is mediated by protein synthesis and mRNA transcription. 3) NGF treatment strengthened, by nearly fourfold, the beta-cell electrical activity; this effect is partially related to the increased Na+ current, because tetrodotoxin (TTX) decreased the duration of the depolarized plateau level. 4) Single beta cells secreted nearly two times more insulin in response to 5.6 or 15.6 mM glucose. This effect was inhibited by TTX, indicating that the enhanced Na+ current plays an important role. These data suggest that NGF could preserve an adequate expression of sodium channels and that impairment of NGF modulation could lead to deficient insulin secretion and diabetes mellitus."

In contrast, because SINEs, such as Alu sequences, lack a protein-coding capacity it has been suggested that they use the enzymatic machinery of LINEs in trans (1Furano A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human genome there exist from 3000 to 5000 full-length copies of LINE-1 dispersed throughout the genome, accounting for 15–17% of its mass (2Smit A.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Recent studies have involved these elements in relevant biological processes such as gene regulation (3Tomilin N.V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schmid C. Maraia R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 6: 874-882Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), modeling of the genome shape (5Kazazian H.H. Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 1152-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), or DNA-shuffling phenomena (6Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Science. 1999; 283: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that insertion of LINE in certain genes affects the outcome of some diseases and has been associated with the generation and progression of certain cancers (7Kazazian H.H., Jr. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). LINEs use a transposition mechanism in which the reverse transcription of the RNA template is primed by the release of a 3′-hydroxyl group (9Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1997: 343-437Google Scholar) after cleaving chromosomal DNA with an endonuclease activity encoded by the element (10Martı́n F. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 283-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). To synthesize the second strand DNA, the RNA template has to be removed from the RNA/cDNA hybrid by an RNase H activity, which may be supplied by the host cell (12Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Recent studies (13Malik H.S. Burke W.D Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) have described in some non-LTR retrotransposons the existence of sequences with a certain homology to proteins with RNase H activity. However, RNase H activity has still not been demonstrated to be present in the non-LTR retrotransposons. L1Tc is a highly repetitive non-LTR retrotransposon widely distributed in the genome of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (14Martin F. Marañon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Olivares M. Thomas M.C. López-Barajas A. Requena J.M. Garcı́a-Perez J.L. Angel S. Alonso C. López M.C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is actively transcribed into poly(A+) RNA. The first L1Tc-characterized copy corresponds to a cDNA containing three ORF (14Martin F. Marañon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The second and third ORF showed significant homology with the RT and cysteine motifs of the pol and gag genes, respectively, from retrovirus and LTR retrotransposons. The first ORF exhibited an endonuclease domain, and the recombinant protein encoded by this ORF showed apurinic/apyrimidine (AP) endonuclease activity (16Olivares M. Alonso C. Lopez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25224-25228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities (17Olivares M. Thomas M.C. Alonso C. Lopez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23883-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies of the genomic organization and distribution of L1Tc inT. cruzi show the existence of some L1Tc copies formed by a single ORF of 5 kb that contains the endonuclease, RT, and cysteine motifs (15Olivares M. Thomas M.C. López-Barajas A. Requena J.M. Garcı́a-Perez J.L. Angel S. Alonso C. López M.C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the sequence located downstream of the RT motif reveals a significant homology with the RNase H domain present in retroviruses and Escherichia coli. In the present study we have shown that the T. cruzi L1Tc recombinant protein encoded by this domain has RNase H activity as measured on the [3H]poly(rA)/poly(dT) hybrid as well as other homologous and heterologous RNA/DNA hybrid substrates. We have also shown the ion requirements, the temperature, and the optimal pH conditions for RNase H activity of the recombinant protein encoded by L1Tc. Two oligonucleotides, RH5′ (5′-TGTGGAGCTCCCGATAGACCAC-3′) and RH3′ (5′-TACTAGTCGACTTGTTGGTGAGCTGGG-3′) were used to amplify by PCR the homologous L1Tc region, which in the L1Tc cDNA copy (14Martin F. Marañon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) is between positions 3571 and 4182, using the pBAC14 vector (15Olivares M. Thomas M.C. López-Barajas A. Requena J.M. Garcı́a-Perez J.L. Angel S. Alonso C. López M.C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as template. SacI and SalI sites (underlined) were generated ad hoc in the amplified fragment, which was subsequently digested with those enzymes and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid, containing 603 bp of the amplified region, was called pQRHL1Tc (GenBankTMAY045718). Two copies of the amplified fragment were in-frame cloned into the pQE30 expression vector, generating the vector pQRH2L1Tc. Mutagenesis of the L1Tc RNase H domain was performed using a PCR-based technique as described (18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar), with pQRHL1Tc as template. Briefly, separate PCRs were performed using a set of site-directed mutagenic primers and pQE30 vector-specific primers. For the aspartic acid mutation at position 39 (GAT → AAT) the oligonucleotides used for the PCR were D/N-sense, 5′-GCGACGAATGGCGGTGTAGACG-3′ and D/N-antisense, 5′-CTACACCGCCATTCGTCGC-3′. Primers for the mutation of the serine at position 56 (TCG → GCG) were respectively S/A-sense, 5′-CCCTCAATTCAGCGGAGATAATAGA-3′ and S/A-antisense, 5′-TTATCTCCGCTGAATTGAGGG-3′. Mutated nucleotides are underlined. Bold faced letters indicate the modified nucleotides. The vector-specific primers were pQE-forward, 5′-GGCGTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCG-3′ and pQE-reverse, 5′-CATTACTGGATCTATCAACAGG-3′. The 0.6-kb amplified fragments containing the desired mutations were digested with SacI andSalI and subcloned into the pQE vector digested with the same restriction enzymes, generating clones pQRHD39NL1Tc and pQRHS56AL1Tc, respectively. The introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. TheE. coli M15 strain was transformed with the constructs pQRHL1Tc, pQRHD39NL1Tc, and pQRHS56AL1Tc and theE. coli TOP3 strain with pQRH2L1Tc vector. The recombinant proteins were overexpressed in cultures grown at OD600 = 0.6 with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C and were purified to homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. For this purpose, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 300 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4, incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min, sonicated for 5 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Soluble fractions were incubated with Ni2+NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the resins were washed three times with 20 ml of buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mmsodium chloride, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with 250 mmimidazole. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were diluted to 25 mm imidazole and repurified to homogeneity. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The following enzymes were used: E. coliRNase H (Roche), HIV-1 RT protein containing the RNase H domain (provided by Dr. Menendez-Arias) (20Martı́n-Hernandez A.M. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), RHL1Tc, RHD39NL1Tc, RHS56AL1Tc, and RH2L1Tc recombinant proteins encoded by the L1Tc element (see above), and the RTL1Tc recombinant protein encoded by L1Tc (nucleotides 1844–3737) containing the RT conserved motif (14Martin F. Marañon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The nonspecific [3H]poly(rA)/poly(dT) hybrid was prepared by mixing [3H]poly(rA) and poly(dT) (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Martı́n-Hernandez et al. (20Martı́n-Hernandez A.M. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The homologous substrate, L1Tc-(1203–1352) [32P]RNA/DNA hybrid, was obtained by PCR using Ospr1 (5′-GGTAACTGTAGATAGCG-3′) and L1Tc961 (5′-ATTAAGGCTTTCACGAGA-3′) primers and pSPFM55 vector as template (14Martin F. Marañon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. López M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega) under the transcriptional control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, generating the pGEMT-L1Tc-(1203–1352) vector. Correct cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For in vitrotranscription and RNA labeling, 2 μg of SalI-digested pGEMT-L1Tc-(1203–1352) recombinant plasmid were used. The reaction was carried out as described by Barroso-delJesus et al. (21Barroso-delJesus A. Tabler M. Berzal-Herranz A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using 0.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) and 10 μCi of [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences), generating a 227-nt-long RNA in which the 150-nt fragment from L1Tc is flanked at 5′- and 3′-ends by 50 and 27 nucleotides of the pGEMT vector. Labeled RNA was purified after elution from denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Specific activity was determined using a Bioscan QC.2000 counter. 10 pmol of Tcrea oligonucleotide (5′-GCCTGGGACCGTCCTTGTGCA-3′), complementary to nucleotides 109–129 of [32P]L1Tc-(1203–1352) RNA, was hybridized to 0.5 pmol of [32P]L1Tc-(1203–1352) RNA in 5 μl of hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 37.5 mm potassium chloride, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 20 units of RNasin (Promega)), by heating at 95 °C for 2 min followed by two incubations for 15 min on ice and at 37 °C, respectively. The β-galactosidase α-peptide (β-gal) [32P]RNA/DNA hybrid was used as heterologous substrate. The DNA template for RNA synthesis was obtained by PCR using CI1 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTAT-3′) and P4 (5′-TATGCATCTATGCGGCATCAGAGCA-3′) oligonucleotides. Primer CI1 contains in 5′ the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (underlined). Plasmid pASW was used as template. pASW is a derivative of the pUC19 plasmid, which contains the 14-nucleotide-long wild type target of the (−)sTRSV (negative polarity satellite RNA of the tobacco ring spot virus) hairpin rybozime cloned into the coding region of the enzyme β-galactosidase (provided by Drs. A. Berzal-Herranz and A. Barroso-delJesus). 2 μg of the amplified DNA were used for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (see above). The 414-nt-long RNA was radiolabeled and purified, and the specific activity was measured as described for L1Tc-(1203–1352) [32P]RNA. The p1 oligonucleotide 5′-TGAATTCAAACAGGACTGTCAGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGA-3′, complementary to nucleotides 119–158 in the β-galactosidase [32P]RNA, was hybridized to radiolabeled RNA as described above except that 0.25 pmol of β-galactosidase [32P]RNA and 5 pmol of p1 oligonucleotide were used. The nonspecific RNase H assay, using the [3H]poly(rA)/poly(dT) hybrid as substrate, was performed essentially as described (20Martı́n-Hernandez A.M. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) except that 1 μCi/ml hybrid in a final volume of 25 μl was added to the reaction. The master buffer reaction (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mmmagnesium chloride, 90 mm sodium chloride, 1.5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega)) was modified in order to analyze the pH effect and RHL1Tc protein metal dependence. 25 ng of each enzyme were used, except for in the E. coli RNase H (Roche) assay where 2.5 ng were used. Incubation time was 60 min at 37 °C except when otherwise indicated. The RNase H activity assay on specific homologous and heterologous radiolabeled substrates was carried out mixing, respectively, 5 μl of each mentioned [32P]RNA/DNA hybrid with 7.5 μl of RNase H buffer (83.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.033% Nonidet P-40, 116.6 mm sodium chloride, 3.3 mmdithiothreitol, 8.3 mm magnesium chloride) and 25 ng of each enzyme. Reactions (12.5 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with the addition of 2× stop solution (92% formamide, 17 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) (v/v). Finally, samples were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, and electrophoresed through a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The gel was wrapped in plastic and exposed to Kodak X-Omat autoradiographic film. Sequence analysis of different genomic L1Tc copies from aT. cruzi library constructed in pBAC vector showed that in some clones the L1Tc element is formed by a single open reading frame of 5 kb (15Olivares M. Thomas M.C. López-Barajas A. Requena J.M. Garcı́a-Perez J.L. Angel S. Alonso C. López M.C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a sequence with significant amino acid homology to enzymes with RNase H activity from E. coli and HIV-1 was found (Fig. 1 B) in these copies downstream of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain (Fig.1 A). Thus, a 139-amino acid region present in the L1Tc copy, which was contained in the pBAC14 clone (15Olivares M. Thomas M.C. López-Barajas A. Requena J.M. Garcı́a-Perez J.L. Angel S. Alonso C. López M.C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), showed 26.9 and 31.6% identity with the RNase H coding sequence from HIV-1 and E. coli (Z-score of 8 and 6, respectively). Moreover, the amino acids forming the active site (essential for catalysis of the E. coli RNase H enzyme) as well as the neighboring region of the catalytic site (21Barroso-delJesus A. Tabler M. Berzal-Herranz A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22McClure M.A. Skalka M.A. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 425-444Google Scholar) are conserved in the RNase H protein encoded by L1Tc (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the L1Tc region containing the putative RNase H domain codes for a protein with RNase H activity, a 603-bp DNA fragment from pBAC14 containing the L1Tc RNase H domain was cloned into theSacI and SalI sites of the pQE30 vector. In addition, two copies of the amplified fragment were also cloned in-frame into the pQE30 vector. The resulting vectors, pQRHL1Tc and pQRH2L1Tc, respectively, were transformed into E. coli M15 and TOP3 strains, and the recombinant proteins were overexpressed after IPTG induction. Two intensely stained bands of ∼25 and 40 kDa that corresponded, respectively, to the expected sizes of the RHL1Tc and RH2L1Tc recombinant proteins were observed in bacterial extracts following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 5). To strongly correlate the putative RNase H activity with the protein encoded by the L1Tc RNase H domain, two clones coding for mutated proteins were generated, one at the conserved aspartic acid at position 39 of the enzyme catalytic site (RHD39NL1Tc) and the other at the non-conserved serine at position 56 (RHS56AL1Tc). The mutated recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the M15 E. coli strain by IPTG induction, showing after SDS/PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining the expected size of 25 kDa. The recombinant proteins were solubilized under native conditions and purified to homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Fig. 2,lanes 2–4 and 6). The RNase H enzymatic activity of the purified proteins was first measured on a linear [3H] poly(rA)/poly(dT) hybrid using the optimal conditions described for the HIV-1 RNase H enzyme (HIV-1 RT protein) (20Martı́n-Hernandez A.M. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The measured acid-soluble radioactivity (Fig. 3) resulting from incubation with the RHL1Tc protein showed that the recombinant protein encoded by the L1Tc element has RNase H activity with an RNA/DNA hybrid substrate. The mutation at the non-conserved serine residue at position 56 did not affect the RNase H activity of the protein. However, the mutation at the aspartic acid present in the presumed RNase H catalytic site of the L1Tc RNase H protein abolished enzymatic activity. From the molar concentration of the RNase H proteins used in the assays, it was calculated that the activity of the RNase H enzyme encoded by L1Tc is 40- and 15-fold lower, respectively, than the activity of the RNase H enzymes of E. coli and HIV-1. The enzymatic activity of the protein encoded by the L1Tc RNase H domain was also analyzed by monitoring its cleavage efficiency on homologous and heterologous uniformly labeled RNA transcripts hybridized to an internal complementary oligonucleotide. Two different labeled RNA/DNA hybrids were used. One corresponded to the coding region of β-galactosidase, which does not contain significant sequence homology with L1Tc retrotransposon. The other one corresponded to an internal region of L1Tc. Thus, a 414-nt RNA fragment of β-galactosidase was annealed to a complementary 39-nt oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig.4 A1 ) and incubated with RHL1Tc, RHD39NL1Tc, RHS56AL1Tc, RH2L1Tc, and the E. coli and HIV-1 RNase H proteins. The purified recombinant protein encoded by the L1Tc RT domain (RTL1Tc) and a reaction without enzyme were used as negative controls. Analysis of the RNA cleavage products on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel showed that the RHL1Tc, RHS56AL1Tc, and RH2L1Tc proteins cut the labeled RNA strand of the RNA/DNA hybrid releasing, in a similar form to the proteins fromE. coli and HIV-1, two major RNA fragments of ∼120 and 260 nucleotides, which correspond to the oligonucleotide non-annealed ends of the RNA strand (Fig. 4 A2 ,lanes 4, 5, and 8). However, as occurs with nonspecific substrates, the RHD39NL1Tc mutant protein did not show enzymatic activity (Fig. 4 A2 ,lane 9). Slight differences were observed in the size of the fragments generated by each enzyme because of heterogeneity in the cleavage sites of RNase H proteins assayed. The RHL1Tc and RH2L1Tc proteins showed the same cleavage pattern, although RH2L1Tc hydrolyzed the substrate more efficiently than RHL1Tc. As was expected, no RNase H activity was detected in the reaction containing the RT protein encoded by the L1Tc RT domain or in the reaction to which no enzyme was added (Fig. 4 A2 , lane 3 and6). In order to test RNase H activity with a homologous substrate, an L1Tc RNA/DNA hybrid molecule was formed between a 227-nt-long transcript derived from L1Tc (see “Experimental Procedures”) and a 21-nt-long complementary oligonucleotide. The uniformly labeled RNA fragment/DNA hybrid was incubated with different RNase H proteins (Fig.4 B1 ). Analysis of the RNA cleavage products generated by the RHL1Tc, RHS56AL1Tc, and RH2L1Tc proteins showed two major fragments of ∼110 and 95 nt corresponding to the non-annealed ends of the RNA strand (Fig. 4 B2 ,lanes 4, 5, and 8). Like the β-galactosidase hybrid, the RHD39NL1Tc mutant protein did not show RNase H activity on the L1Tc-homologous substrate (Fig.4 B2 , lane 9). Moreover, the RH2L1Tc protein also cut the L1Tc-(1203–1352) RNA/DNA hybrid substrate more efficiently than the RHL1Tc protein did. The E. coli RNase H protein efficiently cleft the hybrid, releasing two major fragments (Fig. 4 B2 , lane 1) similar to those released by the RNase H encoded by L1Tc. However, the cleavage pattern of the HIV-1 RT protein from HIV-1 was different (Fig.4 B2 , lane 2), probably because of particular structure or sequence determinants present in the L1Tc-(1203–1352) RNA/DNA hybrid. To determine the ion requirements of the RHL1Tc enzyme, RNase H activity was analyzed at different Mg2+ and Mn2+ ion concentrations at pH 8. The RHL1Tc protein was determined to require Mg2+ or Mn2+ with a [3H]poly(rA)/poly(dT) hybrid substrate with an optimal concentration of 5 mmMg2+ or 1 mm Mn2+ (Fig.5, A and B). The RNase H activity level in the presence of 1 mmMn2+ ion was ∼40% lower than that detected in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5 C). To determine the RHL1Tc optimal temperature and pH conditions, RNase H activity was measured under different temperature and pH values in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+. As occurs with theE. coli and HIV-1 enzymes, the maximal RNase H activity detected in the RHL1Tc protein was observed at 37 °C and pH 8. However, and remarkably, the RNase H enzyme encoded by the L1Tc element was active in a higher range of pHs and temperatures than those observed for the HIV-1 and E. coli enzymes. Thus, the RHL1Tc protein showed significant RNase H activity at 19 °C and pH 6 (Fig.6, A and B). Under these conditions the HIV-1 and E. coli RNase H enzymes were inactive.Figure 6Optimal pH and temperature conditions.The reactions were assayed at different temperatures (A) and at different pH (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were carried out with the RNase H protein fromE. coli (224), HIV-1 (×), and L1Tc (●). The represented data are the average of three independent assays after subtraction of the background values. The values are represented as percentage of activity relative to the maximal value obtained for each enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNase H enzymes are widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes (24Crouch R.J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 771-777PubMed Google Scholar), and it is believed that they participate in DNA replication processes by removing the upstream RNA primers of Okazaki fragments (25Goulian M. Richards S.H. Heard C.J. Bigsby B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18461-18471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the retrotransposition event of retrovirus and retrovirus-like elements an RNase H activity encoded by its own elements removes the RNA template of the generated RNA/cDNA hybrid in order to allow second strand DNA synthesis. It has been suggested that in the case of LINE the RNase H activity needed for completing the retrotransposition process could be provided by the host cell (12Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). A putative RNase H domain has recently been reported (13Malik H.S. Burke W.D Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) in some non-LTR retrotransposons, in an analogous position to that described for retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons. However, it has not yet been demonstrated that the putative RNase H domain is endowed with enzymatic activity. Sequence analysis has evidenced that a 603-bp-long region from a L1Tc genomic copy has a significant degree of sequence similarity with different RNase H proteins and is conserved in similar positions to the amino acids forming the active site described for the RNase H enzyme family (22McClure M.A. Skalka M.A. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 425-444Google Scholar). This sequence has been cloned into an expression vector, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity. In this study, we report that the purified RHL1Tc recombinant protein containing the L1Tc RNase H domain has RNase H activity on various RNA/DNA hybrid substrates. Remarkably, the RHD39NL1Tc mutated protein, which presents a substitution at the conserved aspartic acid residue at position 39, is devoid of cleavage activity. This result indicates this residue is also essential for enzymatic activity of the L1Tc-encoded enzyme, as has been described for the E. coli, human, and retrovirus RNase H proteins (26Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as expected, the RHS56AL1Tc mutated protein, bearing a substitution at the non-conserved serine amino acid at position 56, is as active as the RHL1Tc wild type recombinant protein. Enzymatic activity detected for the RHL1Tc protein was similar to that described for some retroelements, such as the endogenous HERV-K retrovirus (27Berkhout B. Jebbink M. Zsiros J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and significantly lower than that observed for theE. coli RNase H and HIV-1 RT enzymes. It is worth mentioning that other isolated RNase H domains from retroviruses have been shown to present a lower enzymatic activity than the protein containing both RT and RNase H domains (28Evans D.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21741-21747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in HIV-1 (30Becerra S.P. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Kalstrom A. Stahl S.J. Wilson S.M. Wingfield P.T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but not in MuLV (31Zhan X. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22023-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the RNase H domain is not an active protein by itself. It has been suggested that the presence of a high content of basic residues in some regions of the protein could be necessary for activity. The MuLV protein contains 23% basic amino acids in the α-C, -B, and -D regions, the handle region, whereas the HIV-1 protein only has 3.6% (23Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.S. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 29Evans D.E. Fan N. Swaney S.M. Tarpley W.G. Sharma S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22023-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these basic amino acids function in substrate affinity and RNase H stability (32Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain increases activity when a polyhistidine tag is added (28Evans D.E. Brawn K. Deibel M.R., Jr. Tarpley W.G. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20583-20585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Evans D.E. Fan N. Swaney S.M. Tarpley W.G. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21741-21747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the basic amino acid content in the putative handle region of the isolated L1Tc RNase H domain is double that present in the HIV-1 RNase H protein, we cannot exclude the contribution by the hexahistidine tag to the detected enzymatic activity, which the RHL1Tc recombinant protein carries at its N-terminal end. The RNase H protein encoded by the L1Tc element is Mg2+-dependent; it is also active in the presence of the Mn2+ ion. The optimal pH and temperature conditions are pH 8 and 37 °C. These conditions are similar to those described for the E. coli RNase H and HIV-1 RT enzymes. However, it cannot be excluded that enzyme optimal conditions could be different for a protein containing both RT and RNase H domains, as has been described in retrovirus (29Evans D.E. Fan N. Swaney S.M. Tarpley W.G. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21741-21747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schultz S.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8630-8638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the RHL1Tc protein is more temperature and pH permissive than the HIV-1 RT and E. coli proteins, presenting significant enzymatic activity at 19 °C and pH 6. Similar temperature permissiveness has been reported for the endogenous RNase HI enzyme of the related parasiteTrypanosome brucei (34Kobil J.H. Campbell A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The wide temperature permissiveness of the enzyme encoded by the L1Tc element may be related to the life cycle of the parasite because it involves three different and diverse environmental conditions within the hosts. The cleavage pattern generated by the RHL1Tc protein after incubation with the 414-nt RNA fragment of the β-galactosidase/DNA hybrid as substrate was very similar to that released by RNase H enzymes fromE. coli and HIV-1. However, when the 227-nt RNA fragment of the L1Tc-(1203–1352)/DNA hybrid was used as substrate, the cleavage pattern released by RNase H enzymes from L1Tc and E. colidiffered from that released by RNase H enzyme from HIV-1. This divergent pattern obtained with the HIV-1 RT protein may be due to the presence, in the hybridized L1Tc RNA region, of a 5-nt-long purine stretch that could be acting as a polypurine tract (PPT)-like sequence. It has been reported that purine-rich sequences can act as PPT-like sequences for the RNase H enzyme from HIV-1 containing the RT domain (35Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, it has been observed that the recombinant protein RH2L1Tc containing two in-frame copies of the RNase H domain cleaves the substrates more efficiently than the RHL1Tc protein. The higher activity of the dimeric protein could be caused by a special or more active protein conformation, or perhaps the enzyme binds the substrate as a dimer as has been reported for the MuLV enzyme (36Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary for clarification of the role that the conformational structure of the L1Tc RNase protein plays in RNase H activity. Our discovery of RNase H enzymatic activity associated with the L1Tc RNase H domain should contribute to understanding the LINE retrotransposition mechanism and should reinforce the idea of the autonomy of such retroelements as they encode the enzymatic activities involved in their own transposition processes.

Thyroid hormone has been reported to regulate the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger messenger RNA in some cell types. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with 3,5′,3′-triiodothyronine results in an increased expression of Na+/H+exchanger protein. Also, compared with euthyroid animals, hypothyroid rats express decreased amounts of the Na+/H+exchanger protein. To examine the mechanisms involved in regulating expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger, we have characterized the regulation of a distal element of the NHE1 promoter by the thyroid hormone receptor. We have previously shown that a −1085/−800 nucleotide (nt) region of the promoter is a modular element with a −841/−800 nt activating element. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we show that this element interacts with thyroid hormone receptor TRα1, a nuclear hormone receptor. The addition of exogenous TRα increased transcriptional activity of the −841/−800 nt element of the Na+/H+ exchanger promoter. We show that TRα binds to a region on the −841/−800 nt element that is near, but not identical, to the previously identified chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-binding site.

By doing so, the Na+/H+exchanger raises intracellular pH and so, not surprisingly, it responds to intracellular acidification with increased activity. In addition, Na+/H+ exchange activity is stimulated by a variety of growth factors (1Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are several isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger: NHE1–NHE7. NHE1, which was the first isoform cloned (2Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, whereas the other isoforms show more restricted tissue distributions (3Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+exchanger is important in many cell types in raising intracellular pH during cell growth and differentiation (4Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Wang H. Singh D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26545-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is also involved in the damage that occurs to the myocardium during ischemia and reperfusion. As a result of this, inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger is cardioprotective, and new inhibitors are currently being developed for clinical use (6Karmazyn M. Sostaric J.V. Gan X.T. Drugs. 2001; 61: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The regulation of expression of the Na+/H+exchanger has not yet been thoroughly studied. It is known that expression of the exchanger is elevated during cellular differentiation (5Wang H. Singh D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26545-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Acidosis and ischemia have also been reported to increase the expression of NHE1 in some cell types, including the kidney, the lymphocytes, and the myocardium (9Moe O.W. Miller R.T. Horie S. Cano A.

More recently, hypertrophy has been shown to increase expression of NHE1 (12Chen L. Gan X.T. Haist J.V. Feng Q. Lu X. Chakrabarti S. Karmazyn M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar), and the Na+/H+ exchanger has been implicated in the etiology of hypertrophy and in ischemic heart disease (13Kusumoto K. Haist J.V. Karmazyn M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H738-H745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that message levels for NHE1 are increased in the hearts of hyperthyroid rats (14Wolska B.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Omachi A. Stojanovic M.O. Kallen R.G. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2653-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The promoter-transcription factor interactions that lead to transcriptional regulation of the NHE1 gene are only now beginning to be understood. Proximal elements involved in regulation of NHE1 expression include AP-1, AP-2, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (15Horie S. Moe O. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5236-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Kolyada A.Y. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1408-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dyck J.R.B. Silva N.L.C.L. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1375-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that a more distal serum-responsive element exists at −1085 to −800 nt1 from the start site (18Besson P. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Yang W. Fliegel L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C831-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this region we identified a novel enhancer element, at −841 to −800 nt, that binds chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors I and II (COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, respectively) and that regulates NHE1 expression (19Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that thyroid hormone can increase expression of the Na+/H+exchanger in the myocardium. We demonstrate that the novel enhancer element (at −841 to −800 nt), acting upstream of the proximal regulatory elements of the promoter, regulates expression of NHE1 in response to the thyroid hormone receptor. Our results suggest that thyroid hormone, acting through the thyroid hormone receptor, is an important regulator of Na+/H+ exchanger gene expression.RESULTSPrevious experiments have suggested that messenger RNA levels for the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger are increased in the hyperthyroid heart (compared with euthyroid and hypothyroid hearts) (14Wolska B.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Omachi A. Stojanovic M.O. Kallen R.G. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2653-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used two models to determine whether amounts of NHE1 protein are also elevated in the myocardium in response to thyroid hormone. In initial experiments we used primary cultures of neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1). Fig.1 A is a representative Western blot, whereas Fig.1 B summarizes the results of six distinct experiments. We found that treatment of isolated myocytes with T3 resulted in increased expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger protein relative to untreated cells. The treatment increased NHE1 expression by ∼75%.To confirm these results in another model, we assessed NHE1 levels in the myocardium of animals that were hypothyroid, euthyroid, or hyperthyroid. The results are shown in Fig.2. Fig. 2 A is a representative Western blot, whereas Fig. 2 B summarizes the results of six distinct experiments. The hyperthyroid animals showed elevated levels of NHE1 expression compared with both euthyroid and hypothyroid animals. Further, the level of NHE1 protein was decreased in hypothyroid animals compared with the euthyroid animals. These results confirm the effects of T3 in isolated myocytes (Fig. 1) and demonstrate that expression of NHE1 in the myocardium is affected by treatment with T3. As observed typically with the Na+/H+exchanger (24Murtazina BR. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we consistently observed two immunoreactive bands on our Western blots: a larger band of ∼105 kDa that represents fully glycosylated NHE1 and a smaller band that represents unprocessed or only partially glycosylated protein.Figure 2Western blot analysis of Na+/H+ exchanger expression in intact heart from hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we observed that the −841/−800 element of the mouse NHE1 promoter competes with a thyroid receptor palindrome for binding proteins in NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts. This led us to suspect that the −841/−800 nt element of the NHE1 promoter might interact with the thyroid receptor. Therefore, we examined binding of TRα expressed in reticulocyte lysates to the −841/−800 nt element. We have previously shown (19Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the −841/−800 nt element binds COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII and that mutation of the element decreases this binding. Therefore, we used these proteins as controls for assessing binding of TRα to the −841/−800 nt element. The results are shown in Fig.3. In EMSA, both COUP-TFI (Fig.3 A) and COUP-TFII (Fig. 3 B) bound to the wild type −841/−800 nt element of the NHE1 promoter. As a positive control we included a human antithrombin III promoter fragment (AT), which also bound to the two isoforms of COUP-TF. We also confirmed the effect of mutating the −841/−800 nt element on these interactions. M1, M2, and M3 are three mutants of the −841/−800 nt element at positions −838/−832, −829/−824, and −819/−815, respectively. As we found previously, both isoforms of COUP-TF bound to M3, showed reduced binding to M1, and showed no binding to M2. The binding of TRα to the −841/−800 nt element of the NHE1 promoter and the effect of the three mutations on this binding are shown in Fig. 3 (C andD). In control experiments, as expected, in vitrotranslated rat TRα bound to the proximal response element HD-PPRE (Fig. 3 C) and exhibited a supershift in the presence of anti-TRα antibodies. The in vitro translated TRα also bound directly to the −841/−800 nt element, and the mobility of the complex was similar to that of HD-PPRE, which binds TRα as monomer (25Fernandez-Rachubinski F.A. Weiner J.H. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29502-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TRα showed reduced binding to the M1 mutant, whereas it bound to the M2 mutant as both a monomer and a dimer, likely a homodimer. The mobility shifts resulting from TRα binding to M2 were affected by anti-TRα antibody. Anti-TRα antibody resulted in a reduction in both the dimer and monomer forms of M2 mutant (Fig. 3 E). The M3 mutation did not affect TRα binding to the −841/−800 nt element.Figure 3In vitro binding of COUP-TFs and TR α to control response elements ( AT and HD-PPRE ) and to wild type and mutated −841/−800 nt elements WT, M1–M3.

In the presence of M2, binding of TRα to M3 was 94% of that without competition. In contrast, in the presence of M1, binding of TRα to M3 was 53% of that without competition. These results suggest that the region of the M2 mutation is not involved in binding TRα, whereas the region of the M1 mutation is at least partially involved. These results were consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 D.Fig. 3 F illustrates the results of testing nuclear extracts of isolated myocytes with the −841/−800 nt element.Lane 1 shows the labeled probe alone. Lane 2shows that nuclear extracts of myocytes treated with T3 show significant binding to the labeled −841/−800 nt element. Competition with unlabeled −841/−800 nt element eliminated the binding completely (Lane 3). Lane 4 shows that nuclear extracts from untreated myocytes show reduced binding relative to T3-treated myocytes, although the same pattern of binding was present. Lane 6 shows the binding of in vitro translated TRα.Next, we investigated whether COUP-TF and TRα might form heterodimers on the −841/−800 nt element. The wild type −841/−800 nt element binds both proteins independently (Fig.4). As found earlier, M1 showed reduced binding of both COUP-TFI (reduced 60–70%) and TRα reduced 95%); M2 did not bind COUP-TFI but did bind TRα, as both a monomer (40%) and a dimer (60%); and binding of TRα and COUP-TF1 to M3 is unaltered compared with binding to the wild type element. Next, we looked at whether binding of either TRα or COUP-TFI to the −841/−800 nt element affects binding of the other transcription factor (Fig.4 B). COUP-TFI and TRα were prepared in reticulocyte lysates, as described above, and EMSAs were carried out with the wild type −841/−800 nt element. We found that TRα does interfere with the binding of COUP-TFI to the −841/−800 nt element. Lanes 2 and 3 of Fig. 4 B both clearly demonstrate reduced COUP-TFI binding compared with that in lane 1 (no addition of TRα). The maximal reduction in COUP-TFI binding was ∼60%. This declined to ∼15% with the lowest dose of TRα. The inhibition of COUP-TFI binding was lessened when smaller amounts of TRα were added (lanes 3–5). In contrast, using a similar assay, we found that COUP-TF1 does not significantly reduce binding of TRα (Fig. 4 B, lanes 10–15).Figure 4Examination of potential heterodimerization and competition between COUP-TFI and TR α.A, in vitro binding of COUP-TFI and TRα expressed in reticulocyte lysates to wild type and mutated −841/−800 nt elements.

B, COUP-TFII and TRα were prepared in reticulocyte lysates, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used with the −841/−800 nt element as described above. Lanes 1–5contained a constant amount of COUP-TF (1 μg of lysate). Lane 1 contained no TRα, and lanes 2–5 contained decreasing amounts of TRα (2.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 μg of lysate, respectively). Lanes 6–9 contained decreasing amounts of TRα in the absence of COUP-TFII (2.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 μg of lysate, respectively). Lanes 10–12 contained decreasing amounts of COUP-TFII in the absence of TRα (1, 0.6, and 0.3 μg of lysate, respectively). Lanes 13–15 contained decreasing amounts of COUP-TFII (1, 0.6, and 0.3 μg of lysate, respectively) and a constant amount of TRα (1.5 μg of lysate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate the effects of TRα on the Na+/H+ exchanger promoter in vivo, we carried out a co-transfection experiment using a luciferase reporter gene system. We co-transfected an expression vector for TRα with a vector containing the luciferase gene driven by a minimal NHE1 promoter and tandem upstream copies of the −841/−800 nt element (Fig.5). Co-transfection with TRα increased luciferase activity generated by the −841/−800 nt element, and this effect was slightly more noticeable in 10% serum than in 0.5%. In contrast, TRα did not affect basal luciferase activity driven by the thymidine kinase promoter or by the minimal NHE1 promoter without the −841/−800 nt element (results not shown). It was noticeable that transfection with larger amounts of TRα (2.5 μg) had no effect on NIH3T3 cells and reduced effects in CV1 cells compared with transfection with smaller amount of the plasmid (1.25 μg). In the absence of exogenous TRα, and in 10% serum, the luciferase activity generated by the four tandem copies of the −841/−800 nt element upstream of the NHE1 minimal promoter was about double that obtained in 0.5% serum. Luciferase activity, with 10% serum and 1.25 μg of plasmid, was as follows: 404 ± 11 and 226 ± 24% in CV1 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. In 0.5% serum these values were 335 ± 18 and 186 ± 26% for CV1 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. The activating effect of TRα was also seen when it was co-transfected and expressed in the pRc/RSV system (Invitrogen; data not shown).Figure 5Effect of TR α on reporter activity of the −841/−800 nt element in the presence of 0.5 or 10% fetal bovine serum. The expression vector for the TRα receptor was co-transfected in CV1 or NIH3T3 cells with the NHE1 reporter plasmid that included four tandem copies of the −841/−800 nt wild type element upstream of the NHE1 minimal promoter or a truncated version of the thymidine kinase promoter. Each plate was transfected with 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid in the presence of 0.25, 1.25, or 2.5 μg of expression vector for the TRα nuclear receptors. In all cases a constant amount of expression vector was maintained by co-transfection of the empty expression vector pSG5. The base-line values used for normalization in the absence of TRα were measured in the presence of 2.5 μg of pSG5. The activity indicated as 100% in the Fig. is the relative light unit (RLU) value given by four tandem copies of the −841/−800 nt element upstream of either the NHE1 minimal promoter. The results are the means ± S.E. of at least four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In these in vivo experiments, to confirm that TRα was acting through the −841/−800 nt element of the NHE1 promoter, we also looked at the effects of COUP-TF-1 and II and TRα on luciferase expression driven by the −1085/−842 and −1085/−800 nt elements upstream of the NHE1 minimal promoter (Fig.6). A single copy of the −1085/−800 nt element enabled increased transcription from the NHE1 minimal promoter in response to both COUP-TF and TRα. In contrast, when the −1085/−842 element was included upstream of the minimal promoter, neither COUP-TF-1 nor TRα affected rates of transcription. These results indicate that the −841/−800 nt element is critical in activation of the NHE 1 promoter by COUP-TF-1 and TRα.Figure 6Effects of COUP-TFI, COUP-TFII, and TR α on luciferase activity influenced by the −1085/−800 nt and the −1085/−842 nt elements with the minimal NHE1 promoter. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg/plate of reporter plasmid carrying single copies of the −1085/−800 nt or the −1085/−842 nt elements of the NHE1 promoter in front of the NHE1 minimal promoter (−92 to +24 nt). In addition 0.2–1.2 μg of expression vector for the COUP-TF or TRα were co-transfected. A constant amount of expression vector was maintained by co-transfected the empty pSG5 vector. The base-line values were in the presence of pSG5 alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we looked at the combined effect of COUP-TF and TRα on transcriptional activity of the −841/−800 nt element. NIH3T3 and CV1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for COUP-TF-I, for TRα, or for both, and the effect of these transfections on the NHE1 minimal promoter and on the thymidine kinase minimal promoter was measured. Table I summarizes our results. In both cell types, transfection with COUP-TFI and TRα together resulted in a greater increase in promoter activity than seen with either element alone. That is, co-expression of the two hormone receptors resulted in a slight synergism.Table IEffect of cotransfection of TRα and COUP-TF on enhancer activity of the NHE1 −841/−800 nt element in NIH3T3 and CV1 cellsCell linePromoterLuciferase activityCOUP-TFI (1.25 μg)COUP-TFI (1.25 μg) and TRα (0.2 μg)TRα (0.2 μg)CV1NHE1362837153NIH3T3NHE1281485142NIH3T3TK8441957124The cells were transfected with either TRα (0.2 μg) or COUP-TFI (1.25 μg) expression plasmids as described for Fig. 5.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe regulation of expression of the Na+/H+exchanger (NHE1 isoform) is of great importance for a variety of reasons. The Na+/H+ exchanger is involved in the growth and development of a variety of cells, and in the myocardium it has been implicated in both hypertrophy and ischemic reperfusion damage (1Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Karmazyn M. Sostaric J.V. Gan X.T. Drugs. 2001; 61: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Gan X.T. Haist J.V. Feng Q. Lu X. Chakrabarti S. Karmazyn M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). A number of preliminary observations led us to investigate the role of thyroid hormone in expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger. First, thyroid hormone is known to have diverse effects on the myocardium and other tissues. T3 (the most active form of the hormone) regulates many aspects of cellular development and homeostasis. For example, in the myocardium T3 is known to cause shifts in the type of myosin heavy chain that is expressed (26Martin A.F. Pagani E.D. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and in expression of the Ca2+-ATPase (27Rohrer D. Dillmann W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6941-6944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, several earlier studies have suggested that thyroid hormone affects levels of expression of the Na+/H+exchanger and its function. For example, in L-6 cells, T3 andl-thyroxine (T4) directly stimulate activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (28Incerpi S. Luly P. De Vito P. Farias R.N. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone has also been shown to increase Na+/H+ exchanger activity in the proximal straight tubule of neonatal rabbits (29Shah M. Quigley R. Baum M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F596-F602PubMed Google Scholar) and to increase transcription and mRNA levels for the NHE3 isoform of the protein (29Shah M. Quigley R. Baum M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F596-F602PubMed Google Scholar). Third, several studies have directly implicated thyroid hormone and the thyroid hormone receptor in regulation of NHE1 expression. For example, we previously found that thyroid hormone affects endogenous NHE1 message levels in rat hearts (14Wolska B.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Omachi A. Stojanovic M.O. Kallen R.G. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2653-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the −841/−800 nt region of the NHE1 promoter competes with the palindromic, thyroid receptor-binding DNA sequence in binding of proteins in nuclear extracts (19Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In this study, we confirmed that thyroid hormone levels are important in NHE1 expression using two separate models: isolated myocytes and hearts from hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. Previous experiments (14Wolska B.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Omachi A. Stojanovic M.O. Kallen R.G. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2653-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that T3 levels affect production of mRNA for NHE1 and that they affect resting intracellular pH. Here, we showed that T3 levels also affect amounts of NHE1 protein in cardiac tissue.To elicit its physiological effects, T3 binds to cytosolic thyroid receptors, which then bind to specific nucleotide sequences (thyroid hormone response elements) (30Munoz A. Bernal J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine how thyroid hormone affects expression of NHE1, we examined the Na+/H+ exchanger promoter. The −841/−800 nt element of this promoter is critical in basal and serum-stimulated regulation of NHE1 expression. Our current experiments with in vitro translated TRα confirm that this nuclear hormone receptor binds directly to the −841/−800 nt element of the Na+/H+ exchanger promoter. Although TRα binds to a similar region of the element as COUP-TF, significant differences in their binding patterns were observed when we looked at binding to mutant forms of the element. For example, COUP-TF did not bind to M2. In contrast, TRα did bind to M2, with an altered pattern, and it appeared also to bind as a dimer on this mutant.To better characterize COUP-TF and TR binding to the −841/−800 nt element of the Na+/H+ exchanger promoter, we investigated whether these two receptors compete for binding. Decreasing amounts of TR were tested for binding on the element alone or after co-incubation with a constant amount of COUP-TFI. This resulted in less COUP-TF binding and no variation in TR binding. Conversely, when decreasing amounts of COUP-TF were tested for binding, alone or with constant amounts of TR, we again noted that COUP-TF binding was decreased, and TR binding was unchanged. These findings suggest that TR can compete with COUP-TFI for binding to the same or to an overlapping, site. We have shown that COUP-TFs bind to nucleotides −829 to −824 of the 841/−800 nt element (Ref. 19Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Our current data suggest that"

Unless otherwise indicated, HCV RdRp activity was measured in 50 μl of standard transcription buffer, TxG(+) (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm CTP, 5 μm UTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.185 Mbq of [α-32P]UTP, 10 pmol of RNA template, 25 μg/ml actinomycin D, 5 units of human placental RNase inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), 1 mm DTT, and 10 pmol of NS5B). For the single-round transcription assay, the reaction mixture without nucleotides was preincubated with 50 or 500 μm GTP at 29 °C for 30 min. Then 0.2 mg/ml heparin (Wako Chemicals, Japan) was added to the mixture, followed by ATP, CTP, and UTP, respectively, and the reaction mixture was further incubated at 29 °C for an additional 90 min. The reaction was stopped by extraction of 150 μl of Sepasol RNA II (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and 40 μl of chloroform. [32P]UMP-labeled RNA was precipitated with the equal volume of 2-propanol. The radiolabeled RNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in formamide dye loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% PAGE containing 7 murea. The radioactivity of the transcribed RNA was measured with a BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film), and the amount of transcribed RNA was calculated from the amount of UMP in the transcripts. Each value was calculated from the average of at least three independent assays. cIRES, SL234–1D, SL234, SL34, SL4, and SL0 were transcribed in vitro in 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm DTT, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 50 mm UTP, 50 μCi of UTP (Amersham Biosciences), 10 μg of DNA template, 20 units of human placental RNase inhibitor, and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Toyobo, Japan) at 37 °C for 4 h.

For the detection of the HCV RdRp protein, the agarose gel was stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Wako Chemicals, Japan) for 1 h and destained with 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid. First of all, the concentration of heparin for the single-round transcription was determined (Fig.2 A). HCV RdRp and cIRES template (10 pmol each) were treated with 3.1, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml of heparin after preincubation with 50 μm (G(−)) or 0.5 mm GTP (G(+)) in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 25 μg/ml actinomycin D, and 5 units of human placental RNase inhibitor at 29 °C for 30 min. Then 50 μm ATP, 50 μm CTP, 5 μm UTP, and 0.185 Mbq of α-[32P]UTP were added and incubated for an additional 90 min. The RdRp activity with more than 0.2 mg/ml heparin was about 20% that without heparin and did not drop below 20% even when more heparin was added. Next, the time course with 0.2 mg/ml heparin was examined (Fig. 1 B). Under these conditions, the accumulation of transcribed RNA continued for 90 min and reached a plateau. Thus, 0.2 mg/ml heparin was used for the single-round transcription assay of HCV RdRp. First, the activity of deletion mutant templates for stem-loop structures was measured by the single-round transcription assay because the initiation activity could be accurately measured with this assay (Figs. 1 and 3). Under de novo initiation by 0.5 mm GTP, the template activity of SL234–1D, SL234, SL34, SL4, and SL0 was 74.8, 88.2, 34.2, 27.9, and 9.7% that of cIRES, respectively (Fig. 3 D). There was no significant difference among cIRES, SL234–1D, and SL234. However, there was a big decrease in activity between SL234 and SL34. Without the initiation, far less RNA was synthesized de novo, and there was little difference among them. Next, in order to analyze the effect of the stem-loop structures and sequences between SL234 and SL34 on de novo transcription more precisely, single-round transcriptions using SL34-S, SL1234–1S, SL1234–1LD, and SL34-SS were performed (Figs. 1 and 5 A). Again, the sequence UGGC was added to the 3′ terminus of each template. The amount of RNA synthesized from 10 pmol of cIRES, SL234–1D, SL234, SL34, SL4, SL0, SL34-S, SL1234–1S, SL1234–1LD, and SL34-SS was 8.06, 6.03, 7.11, 2.76, 2.25, 0.78, 3.90, 4.49, 9.22, and 5.16 fmol, respectively. Several bands smaller than the template were found among the transcripts from cIRES, SL234–1D, SL234, and SL34 (Fig. 3,A and B). Additional transcripts were also found in SL34-S, SL1234–1S, SL1234–1LD, and SL34-SS (Fig. 5 A). However, no additional bands were found in SL4 and SL0. From the pattern and size of the transcripts, we concluded that they were produced by early termination. From the size of the two major additional transcripts estimated from PAGE (Fig. 3, *1 and*2), transcription terminated in bulge *1 and*2 of cSL3, respectively (Fig. 1). Until this experiment, we only calculated the transcripts of template size, excluding those derived from early termination. To compare the effect of cSL1 and cSL2, we designed templates without early termination as follows: SL12, SL2, SL12–1S, SL12–1LD, and SL0+SL1 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, B and C). From these templates few additional transcripts were obtained. The transcripts of SL2, SL12–1S, and SL12–1LD were 165.5, 258.4, and 91.7% the level of SL12 (Fig. 5 B). When cSL1 was added to SL0 (SL0+SL1), the transcripts were 69.0% the level without cSL1 (SL0) (Fig. 1 C). The same deletion mutant templates were examined for binding to HCV RdRp by gel shift assay (Fig. 4). The relative binding ratio was calculated after correcting for the number of UMP in the probes. The relative binding ratio with 0.5 mm GTP was 100, 74, 83, 46, 58, and 60% whereas that without GTP was 178, 89, 79, 89, 58, and 60%, for cIRES, SL-234–1D, SL234, SL34, SL4, and SL0, respectively. For the competition assay, HCV RdRp and radiolabeled cIRES were incubated with 1, 10, 100, and 1000 pmol of unlabeled cIRES, SL234, SL34, SL34-S, SL4, SL0, 3NTR, and XREG, respectively. One pmol of cIRES and SL234–1D inhibited the binding of cIRES with HCV RdRp. One pmol of 3NTR almost inhibited the binding as well. Ten pmol of SL234, SL34, SL34-S, and XREG inhibited the gel shift with cIRES. From these results, cSL2 is concluded important for binding with HCV RdRp especially in 0.5 mm GTP. The HCV RNA genome contains conserved 5′- and 3′-UTRs (8Fukushi S. Katayama K. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Ando T. Oya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

As in the case of Flaviviridae family viruses, the 3′-terminal X-region is expected to play an important role in the synthesis of the minus strand, and the complementary strand of IRES is expected to serve as the origin for plus strand synthesis in genome replication (4Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howly P.M. Flaviviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, NY2001: 991-1042Google Scholar). The complementary strand of IRES may also work as a promoter of transcription. Mutations in IRES also affected the replication of genomic RNA (35Friebe P. Lohnmann V. Krieger N. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2000; 75: 12047-12057Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The reason for this may be that the mutation in the 3′ terminus of the complementary strand (cIRES) affected the replication and transcription. Both termini of the viral genomic RNA have stem-loop secondary structures. The 3′ termini of both the plus and minus strands of genomic RNA are able to serve as templates for RdRp in vitro (16Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The complementary sequences of IRES had the highest template activity for de novo RNA synthesisin vitro (26Kashiwagi T.

Castroviejo M. Litvak S. Astier-Gin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5857-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, activity for the de novo synthesis of RNA in vitro by RdRp in the X region was very weak (26Kashiwagi T. Hara K. Kohara M. Kohara K. Iwahashi J. Hamada N. Honda H. Toyoda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 250: 1188-1194Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the promoter/origin structure of the complementary strand of IRES. In the multiround transcription system, the products from short templates were sometimes larger than those from long ones. To compare the initiation activity, we established a de novosingle-round transcription system using 0.2 mg/ml heparin to treat HCV RdRp and templates followed by preincubation with 0.5 mmGTP (Fig. 2). Because HCV RdRp prefers a cytidine at the 3′ terminus and interacts with GTP (28Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y.N. Zhong W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), all the templates are designed to have UGGC at the 3′ terminus (Figs. 1 and5). We have temporally used the secondary structure of cIRES as a mirror image of that of IRES in Fig. 1until it is determined experimentally (36Honda M. Beard M.R. Ping L.H. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lukavsky P.J. Otto G.A. Lancaster A.M. Sarnow P. Puglisi J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because the transcription activity following the treatment with 0.5 mm GTP decreased markedly when cSL2 was deleted, cSL2 was important for de novo initiation (Fig. 3 D). However, the activity of SL1234–1S was also half of that of cIRES. Because the T m of the UA stem was 12 °C, a stem structure might not form in the reaction at 29 °C. A comparison of the activity of cIRES, SL1234–1D, SL1234–1S, and SL1234–1LD indicated the complicated secondary structure of the template, although cSL2 and the stem of cSL1 may affect the structure of the promoter/origin. The sequence between cSL2 and cSL3 could also affect the activity. The seven Gs, which exist between cSL2 and cSL3, did not affect the activity. From a comparison of the activity of SL32-S, SL34-SS, and SL34, the length of the single stranded sequence at the 3′ terminus was confirmed important as reported previously (26Kashiwagi T. Hara K. Kohara M. Kohara K. Iwahashi J. Hamada N. Honda H. Toyoda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 250: 1188-1194Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this series of experiments, we calculated the product amount from only the template-sized bands. Additional products were transcribed from the templates containing cSL3 (Figs. 2 and 5). We measured the size of the products of template size and smaller (Fig. 3, *1 and *2). By comparing their size with that of the templates, the products *1 and *2 were identified as early termination products from the templates. The positions of possible termination sites are mapped in the bulges of cSL3 (Fig. 1). There is a triple helical structure in IRES corresponding to bulge *1, and a complex stem-loop in the stem structure of stem-loop 3 corresponding to bulge *2. We predict a strong secondary structure for these sequences in cIRES. The results and the prediction of secondary structure by mFold (bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/∼zukerm/) (38Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 39Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Google Scholar), which predicted too many to be shown here, suggest a complicated secondary structure of cIRES. The results obtained with deletion mutants of stem-loop structures of cIRES were difficult to interpret. The cIRES sequence may make complicated stem-loop structures which interact with each other. Therefore, we decided to design a simpler template. Because we could not predict the secondary structure of cIRES but wanted to elucidate the role of cSL1 and cSL2 in the template activity, we constructed templates carrying only cSL1 and cSL2 (SL2) to exclude early termination (Fig. 5 B). In this experiment, the activity of SL12–1S was more than twice that of SL12 but that of SL12–1LD was similar to the activity of SL2. Because theT m of the UA stem in Fig. 1 D was 12 °C, a stem structure might not form in the reaction at 29 °C. The stem structure of cSL1 could inhibit the activity. The sequence of the cSL1 loop did not affect the activity. Because the results from the templates carrying mutant sequences of cSL1 were not conclusive, we made additional templates carrying simple structures. When cSL1 was added to SL0 (SL0+SL1), the amount of product decreased, confirming that cSL1 was a negative element (Fig. 5 C). cSL1 was always identified as shown in Fig. 1 when the secondary structure of the templates was predicted by mFold (data not shown). When cSL1 exists, the length of the 3′ single-stranded RNA is only four nucleotides, too short to initiate the reaction because at least a five-nucleotide single-stranded RNA is required for initiation (31Zhong W.

We demonstrated that HCV RdRp bound to the 3′ terminus of the complementary strand RNA as well as that of the positive strand RNA (14Cheng J.-C. Chang M.-F. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7044-7049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assay indicates that cSL2 is also important for the binding of HCV RdRp especially with 0.5 mm GTP (Fig.4 A). Without 0.5 mm GTP, the template-RdRp interaction was enhanced, and SL34 also bound to RdRp effectively. The RdRp binding activity of cSL2 was similar to that of the poly(U/C) tract in the 3′ terminus of HCV genome RNA (Fig. 4 B). RdRp could also bind to other stems or sequences although the binding was weaker than that of cIRES, SL234–1D, and SL234. Considering the results of transcription and RdRp binding, cSL2 would be a positive element of the promoter/origin structure because it binds specifically to RdRp with 0.5 mm GTP. 0.5 mm GTP may give specificity to the binding of RdRp to cSL2. Although we did not show the results, copy-back products became apparent without 0.5 mm GTP preincubation even in single-round transcription. The mechanism of switching from de novo initiation with 0.5 mm GTP preincubation to copy-back initiation remains to be resolved. Fig. 6 shows the proposed scheme of initiation from the 3′ terminus of the complementary strand of IRES. HCV RdRp binds to cSL2. HCV RdRp can start with single-stranded 3′ termini (17Oh J.W.

However, the 3′ single-stranded sequences of cIRES are only four nucleotides long and are too short to reach the active site of RdRp because of the β-hairpin structure (30Hong Z. Cameron C.E.

NS3 interacts with RdRp (45Ishido S. Fujita T. Hotta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In both cases, NS3 and HCV RdRp are expected to form a transcription and replication initiation complex. Recently, HS5A was found to bind RdRp and modulate its activity (46Shirota Y. Luo H. Quin W.

The first committed step catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I converts GTP into dihydroneopterin triphosphate (1, Fig. 1).

The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1m hydrochloric acid containing 1% (w/v) iodine and 2% (w/v) potassium iodide. 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate was determined by reversed phase HPLC using a column of Nucleosil C18. The eluent contained 7% methanol and 30 mm formic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored fluorimetrically (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 450 nm). The retention time of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate was 3.2 min. Assay mixtures containing 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 100 μm 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin hydrochloride, 10 mm 4-aminobenzoate, 10 μm6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase, and protein in a total volume of 0.3 ml were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (100 μl) were analyzed by HPLC using a reversed phase column of Nucleosil C18 (4 × 250 mm) and an eluent containing 5 mmtetra-n-butylammonium phosphate, pH 6.8, 25 mmsodium chloride, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 10% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored spectrophotometrically using a TIDAS diode array photometer (J & M Analytische Mess und Regeltechnik GmbH, Aalen, Germany). The retention volume of 7,8-dihydropteroic acid was 9 ml. Assay mixtures containing 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm NADPH, 0.12 mm 7,8-dihydropteroate, and protein (19Schalhorn A. Wilmanns W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis Vol. 3. 3rd Ed. Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, FL1983: 251-258Google Scholar) were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The conversion of di-hydropteroate to tetrahydropteroate was analyzed by HPLC. Experiments were performed using a reversed phase column of Nucleosil C18 (4 × 250 mm) that was developed with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol, triethylamine, 85% phosphoric acid, water (3:10:3:984, v/v) (20Blau N. Niederwieser A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1.5 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored photometrically using a TIDAS diode array photometer (retention times: GTP, 14 min; 7,8-dihydroneopterin, 3.5 min; and 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, 8.9 min). Experiments were performed using a column of Nucleosil C18 (4 × 250 mm) and an eluent containing 5 mm tetra-n-butylammonium phosphate, pH 6.8, 25 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 10% acetonitrile (21Selhub J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored spectrophotometrically using a TIDAS diode array photometer (retention volumes: 7,8-dihydropteroic acid, 9 ml; tetrahydropteroic acid, 6.7 ml; and 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroic acid, 11.5 ml). To a reaction mixture containing 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 1 mm dihydropteroic acid in a total volume of 1 ml, sodium borohydride was added to a final concentration of 10 mm under a stream of nitrogen (22Blair J.A. Saunders K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After 20 min, the excess of sodium borohydride was destroyed by the addition of 20 μl of 17 m acetic acid, and the solution was adjusted to pH 7.1 with 10 n NaOH. Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and [13C]formaldehyde was added to a concentration of 3 mm. The formation of 6-(R,S)-[11-13C1]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate was monitored by HPLC and by NMR spectrometry. All enzymes used were dialyzed against 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6. For experiments to be performed in D2O, enzyme solutions were lyophilized and subsequently dissolved in D2O. Reactions were performed in a sealed vial under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Reagents were injected through a rubber septum. A mixture containing 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10 mm [1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C5]GTP, and 20 mg of GTP cyclohydrolase I of E. coli in a total volume of 1 ml was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. A solution (161 μl) made up from 100 μl of 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10 μl of 100 mm magnesium chloride, 1 μl of 100 mm zinc chloride, and 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase solution (50 units) was added, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for 2 h. The solution was passed through an ultrafilter (Nanosep 30K Omega) by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The ultrafiltrate was collected under a stream of nitrogen. To a solution of [1′,2′,3′,6,7-13C5]7,8-dihydroneopterin (800 μl), a mixture made up of 40 μl of 250 mm ATP, 50 μl of 100 mm magnesium chloride, 100 μl of 100 mm 4-aminobenzoate, 4 μl of 1.4 mmercaptoethanol, 40 μl of 0.25 mm dihydroneopterin aldolase, 20 μl of 1 mm 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase, and 16 μl of 0.15 mm dihydropteroate synthase was added, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. A solution (152 μl) made up of 10 mg of NADPH, 2 μl of 1.4 m mercaptoethanol, and 150 μl of 0.25 mm dihydrofolate reductase was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. [13C]Formaldehyde was added at a molar ratio of 2:1 based on the amount of tetrahydropteroic acid present in the reaction mixture (23Appling D.R. West M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The mixture was kept at room temperature and was then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy without further treatment. NMR measurements were performed at 27 °C using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 500.13 and 125.7 MHz for 1H and 13C NMR experiments, respectively. The spectrometer was equipped with a lock-switch unit for2H-decoupling experiments using the lock channel. One-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR experiments and two-dimensional COSY, NOESY, ROESY, HMQC, and HMQC-TOCSY experiments were performed with standard Bruker software (XWIN-NMR 3.0).13C spectra were obtained using a dual13C/1H probe head, and proton detection experiments were performed using a1H/13C/15N inverse triple resonance probe head. The mixing time was 500 ms for NOESY, 300 ms for ROESY, and 60 ms for TOCSY transfer. Dihydroneopterine aldolase had been proposed to cleave 7,8-dihydro-d-neopterin (2, Fig.2) by a retroaldol-type mechanism, although no experimental evidence has been reported (24Mathis J.B. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3015-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothetical reaction sequence requires the protonation of carbon 6α of the postulated intermediate (8). The proton for that reaction step could be supplied by an acidic group of the protein, by the solvent, or by internal return of a proton abstracted from the substrate in an earlier reaction step. In order to determine the stereochemical features of the protonation, we decided to study the incorporation of deuterium from solvent D2O into the heterocyclic reaction product by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. For the purpose of NMR analysis, we designed a reaction sequence in order to convert the enzyme product, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (3), into 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (11, Fig.3). In that tricyclic compound, carbon atom 9 which is equivalent to the 6α carbinol group of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (3) is embedded into a five-membered, relatively rigid ring system, which was expected to enable the stereospecific assignment of the diastereotopic protons of the position 7 and 9 methylene groups of 11 by NMR spectroscopy using carbon 6 as a chiral reference center. The reaction steps designated A, C,D, and E in Fig. 1 are catalyzed by enzymes of the tetrahydrofolate pathway and all were documented in the literature (4Mathis J.B. Brown G.M.

The details of removal of the triphosphate motif under physiological conditions in the biosynthetic pathway (Fig.1, reaction B) are still not known with certainty; however, alkaline phosphatase could be used for the dephosphorylation of1. The enzymatic reduction of dihydropteroate (5) affording 6-(S)-tetra-hydropteroate (6-S-10) (Fig. 3) has not been described to the best of our knowledge, but we could show that the non-physiological reaction can be catalyzed at an appreciable rate by dihydrofolate reductase of E. coli. The conversion of 6-(S)-tetrahydropteroate into 6-(R)-5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (6-R-11) could be performed by treatment with formaldehyde following a suggestion of R. Matthews. 2R. Matthews, personal communication. It should be noted that the experimental strategy required the recombinant expression of the folK, folP, and folA genes in order to prepare 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase, dihydropteroate synthase, and dihydrofolate reductase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In order to check the feasibility of the planned NMR analysis, we prepared racemic 6-(R,S)-5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (11) by sodium borohydride reduction of a commercial sample of 7,8-dihydropteroate (5) followed by condensation with formaldehyde (Fig. 3). In order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of product analysis, we used 13C-labeled formaldehyde in the condensation reaction. 1H and13C NMR signals of the resulting 6-(R,S)-[11-13C1]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate were assigned by two-dimensional COSY, NOESY, ROESY, and HMQC spectroscopy (Tables III and IV).Table IIINMR data of 6-(RS)-[11-13C]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroatePosition3-aFor atom numbers, see Fig. 3.Chemical shifts, ppmCoupling constants, Hz,J HHCoupling patternsδ1Hδ13CHMQCHMQC-TOCSYCOSYNOESY/ROESY3-bFor a quantitative analysis, see Table IV.9a3.16 (d)48.79.6 (9)9a, 9b9, 6, 7 (w)9b13, 9b, 7d9b3.56 (dd)9.4 (9), 6.6 (6)9a, 613, 9a, 7e, 663.26 (m)52.866, 9, 7, NH (w)9a, 7d9b7d2.84 (dd)38.912.3 (7), 10.3 (6)7d, 7e7, NH, 6, 9 (w)7e, 67e, 9a7e3.20 (dt)12.3 (7), 4 (6), 4 (NH)7d, NH(8)7d, NH(8) (w), 9bNH(8)6.29 (d)4 (7)7e (w)11f3.67 (d)67.84.811f, 11gnd11g13, 7d11g4.71 (d)4.811f13136.40 (d)111.48.5 (14)13nd1411g, 11f, 9a, 9b147.58 (d)131.48.5 (13)14nd133-a For atom numbers, see Fig. 3.3-b For a quantitative analysis, see Table IV.

Open table in a new tab The 1H NMR signals for the diastereotopic protons at C-11, C-9, and C-7 of 6-(R,S)-[11-13C]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate were found to be well separated from each other (Table III and Fig.4). More specifically, the resonances for H-11 protons and the C-11 carbon atom in 6-(R,S)-[11-13C]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate were assigned by their enhanced intensities in two-dimensional1H13C HMQC experiments. The expected1H13C couplings of the H-11 protons with the attached 13C-11 were also observed in the one-dimensional1H NMR spectra of 6-(R,S)-[11-13C]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (cf. Fig. 5 A). The doublet of triplets centered at 3.20 ppm showed coupling to the NH-8 proton in the two-dimensional COSY experiment. Moreover, the coupling signature of the well resolved signal in the one-dimensional1H NMR experiment (Table III and Fig. 4) indicated coupling to NH-8 (coupling constant, 4 Hz). Consequently, the signal at 3.20 ppm was assigned as one of the H-7 protons (H-7e). The signal for the second H-atom (H-7d) attached to C-7 was assigned by HMQC spectroscopy where the signals for H-7e and H-7d were both correlated to the same13C NMR signal at 38.9 ppm. The signals for H-9 methylene protons could then be assigned via the 1H1H correlation pattern gleaned from the COSY experiment as well as from1H13C correlations in the HMQC experiment (Table III). Stereo-specific assignments were obtained from ROESY and NOESY experiments (Fig. 5 and Table IV). Thus, negative cross-peaks between resonances for H-9b, H-6, and H-7e (Fig. 5 C), respectively H-9a and H-7d (Fig.5 B) indicated syn orientation of H-6, H-9b, and H-7e.Figure 5Nuclear Overhauser analysis of 6-(RS)-[11-13C1]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate.

We therefore decided to perform the reaction steps in Fig. 3 as a one-pot reaction with direct NMR analysis. As a substitute for product purification, we made use of13C labeling (Fig. 6) in order to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the NMR analysis. As described below, this approach enabled the acquisition of13C-filtered 1H NMR data, thus virtually eliminating the 1H signals of unlabeled reagents. The [1′,2′,3′,6,7-13C5]7,8-dihydro-d-neopterin (2) designed to serve as aldolase substrate was prepared by a complex sequence of enzyme-assisted reactions. Briefly, [1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C5]GTP was prepared by enzymatic multistep transformation of [U-13C6]glucose (12) as described earlier (11Bracher A. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Ritz H. Götze E. Herrmann A. Gütlich M. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28132-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and was then converted to [1′,2′,3′,6,7-13C5]7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate by treatment with GTP cyclohydrolase I (11Bracher A.

The triphosphate was dephosphorylated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase from calf intestine. Enzymes were removed from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration, and the resulting solution of [1′,2′,3′,6,7-13C5]7,8-dihydroneopterin (2) was treated with recombinant dihydroneopterin aldolase from E. coli to afford [6α,6,7-13C3]6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin (3) which was converted to [6,7,9-13C3]7,8-dihydropteroate by treatment with 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase and dihydropteroate synthase. The product was then converted to 6-(S)-[6,7,9-13C3]tetrahydropteroate by catalytic action of dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment of the reaction mixture with [13C]formaldehyde afforded 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (11). These procedures could be all performed as a one-pot reaction, and the reaction mixture was immediately analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” all solutions were made up in D2O when required. The 13C NMR spectrum of 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (11) showed intense 13C-coupled signals at 38.9 ppm (doublet, 35 Hz, C-7), 48.7 ppm (doublet, 36 Hz, C-9), and 52.8 ppm (triplet, 36 Hz, C-6) (see projection in Fig.7 A). The 13C NMR triplet at 52.8 ppm signaled two adjacent 13C atoms, thus confirming its assignment as C-6 (Table III). The protons connected to the 13C-enriched carbon atom resonating at 48.7 ppm showed NOESY cross-peaks with the aromatic protons of the phenyl ring; hence, the carbon resonating at 48.7 ppm is C-9. The 13C-enriched carbon atom resonating at 67.8 ppm does not show13C13C coupling and is therefore assigned as the solitary C-11. Hence, the 13C-enriched C-atom resonating at 38.9 ppm can be assigned as C-7 confirming the assignments obtained with racemic [11-13C1]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (Table III). 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-Methylenetetrahydropteroate obtained in D2O solution was characterized by broadened13C signals for C-7 and C-9 signaling incorporation of deuterium (see projection in Fig. 7 B). It is well established that dihydrofolate reductase affordsS-configuration at the chiral center of C-6 in tetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1) (31Rees L. Suckling C.J. Valente E. Wood H.C.S. Blair J.A. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1983: 533-537Google Scholar). Under the assumption (which is addressed in more detail under “Discussion”) that the reaction of dihydrofolate reductase with dihydropteroate follows the same stereochemical course, 6-(S)-tetrahydropteroate (6-S-10, Fig. 3) is the expected reaction product. Reaction of 6-(S)-tetrahydropteroate with formaldehyde leads to 6-(R)-5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (6-R-11) (the configuration at C-6 is not affected by the reaction with formaldehyde; the introduction of C-11 does, however, change the stereodescriptor from S toR). The 1H NMR signals for the methylene protons at C-7, C-9, and C-11 of 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate can all be assigned using C-6 as a chiral reference center. Notably, the methylene protons at C-7 and C-9 with syn orientation to H-6 (i.e. H-7e and H-9b, respectively; see assignments for the enantiomeric 6-(R,S)-mixture) can then be assigned as H-7pro-S and H-9pro-R, respectively (Fig. 3). Two-dimensional HMQC spectra of 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate obtained in water resp. in D2O are shown in Fig. 7. In the experiment with deuterium-enriched buffer, the intensities of the signals assigned as H-9pro-S and H-9pro-R are reduced to relative values of 14 and 34% as compared with product formed in experiments without deuterium enrichment (Table V). Thus, H-9pro-R contained 66% deuterium, and H-9pro-S contained 86% deuterium. These data are discussed in more detail below. In line with earlier work (11Bracher A. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Ritz H.

Open table in a new tab In an earlier study (11Bracher A. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Ritz H. Götze E. Herrmann A. Gütlich M. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28132-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we showed that the action of GTP cyclohydrolase in D2O afforded [7-2H1]dihydroneopterin triphosphate with2H located at the 7-pro-R position (Fig.8). In that study, the stereochemistry of deuterium incorporation was determined by transformation of the product into tetrahydrobiopterin by the catalytic action of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. The stereochemical assignments of the protons at the position 7 methylene group could then be determined using C-6 of tetrahydrobiopterin as a chiral reference. In the present study, the deuterium found at C-7 of 6-(R)-[6,7,9,11-13C4]5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroate (11) has been incorporated from solvent by GTP cyclohydrolase I. Hence, the deuterium at C-7 of compound 11must be located in the pro-R position (i.e. H-7d in Fig. 3). Because we could show that H-7d and H-6 in 11have anti orientation (Table III), the findings confirm that dihydrofolate reductase converts dihydropteroate into 6-(S)-tetrahydropteroate. Thus, our working hypothesis that the reduction of dihydropteroate and dihydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase affords products with the same stereochemical features (see above) is now confirmed by direct evidence. The residual 1H in the H-7pro-Rposition (23%) of 11 indicates that the solvent had not been completely deuterated. This finding was not unexpected because H2O/D2O exchange had been performed by lyophilization of the multienzyme mixture. The impact of incomplete deuteration of the solvent may have been enhanced by a deuterium isotope effect because release of a proton from bulk water or from an acidic group in exchange with the bulk solvent would occur preferentially by comparison with the release of a deuteron. Whereas the hypothetical reaction mechanism in Fig. 2 suggests the incorporation of precisely one deuterium equivalent at C-9 of11 by protonation of the hypothetical intermediate8 (Fig. 2), the data in TableV show a considerable excess of2H. Specifically, 86% deuterium was found in the pro-S position and 66% in the pro-R position at C-9 of 11. This could be due to stereospecific protonation of the enol 8 in the pro-S position in conjunction with wash-in of additional deuterium by spontaneous or enzyme-mediated exchange processes. The 6α hydrogen atoms of compound 3 have increased CH acidity due to activation by the aminal motif in the dihydropyrazine ring. This activation should also extend to the adjacent ring atom, C-7, but the acidity of the C-6α and C-7 protons may well differ quantitatively, and this could explain the absence of excess deuterium in the position 7 methylene group of compound 11. The data leave no doubt that the protonation of the intermediate8 by dihydroneopterin aldolase occurs preferentially in the pro-S position (Fig. 8). However, due to the excess deuterium at the position 6α carbon of compound 3, the degree of stereospecificity of the protonation of the intermediate8 cannot be determined unequivocally. The present data do not answer the question whether the donor for proton transfer to the 6α carbon of the enol 8 is an acidic group of the protein or a solvent water. However, it is clear that the protonation of the enol does not occur by return of the proton that has been abstracted from the substrate. Thus, if the protonation of 8 occurs by an amino acid residue involved in the formation of an anion from the substrate, 2, that residue would have to be water-accessible, and the abstracted proton would have to be exchanged with bulk solvent.

The more than 40 million Americans without health insurance would pose a serious national security threat in the event of a bioterror attack with a transmissible agent. Even if all Americans cannot obtain full health insurance, significant barriers to seeking evaluation for suspected infectious illnesses should be reduced. Any threats of deportation or financial loss due to testing for and reporting infectious illnesses should be removed, and the cost for these evaluations should be borne by the government as a necessary national security expense."
https://openalex.org/W2155412142,"This joint Special Issue by Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment (STKE) and Science presents important developments in the sprawling field of signal transduction. (Signal transduction refers to the processes by which cells perceive their environment or internal status and react to such stimuli with appropriate physiological responses.) The Viewpoints in this issue of Science provide authoritative syntheses that are accessible to the nonspecialist, explaining what a signaling pathway does and why it does it. Furthermore, this issue highlights new ways in which Science's STKE is working with authors to efficiently convey complex information. At Science's STKE , readers can delve deeper into the topic and take advantage of special electronic features, particularly the “Connections Map” database in which the details of the signaling pathway are dynamically displayed and annotated. (STKE is the first of a series of Knowledge Environments published by AAAS. These electronic publications gather a comprehensive set of resources to enhance access to information in a fast-moving field like cell signaling.)

![Figure][1] 

Advances in information technology are required in the biological sciences to cope with the amount and complexity of information that must be handled in the postgenome era. Thus, Science's STKE has explored a new way of organizing, storing, and communicating the essence of our current understanding of signaling mechanisms. The Connections Maps are an interface to a database of authoritative information on signaling molecules and their relations with one another.[*][2] The reader accesses information through a Web interface that displays dynamically generated maps of the pathways (created in real time from the database, so there is no lag while an artist works on updating a drawing). Symbols in the maps represent signaling components or the relations between them, and users can access more information just by clicking on these symbols.

The Connections Maps are identified as either “canonical” or “specific.” The canonical maps show the generic pathway module—a sort of consensus view. This type of pathway is useful for understanding the general signaling principles of the pathway and how modules are adapted to distinct functions, but are not intended to represent the situation in a real cell at a particular point in time. The specific pathways, on the other hand, depict real molecules and only those relations that are experimentally supported for a particular species, tissue, and cell type. Thus, components in the specific pathways can be linked to a defined entry in existing databases that catalog sequence information on individual genes or proteins.

The information in the database and maps is highly reliable. This quality is derived from the efforts of leading authorities recruited from many areas of signaling, who frequently update the database. These contributing authorites also provide an evaluation of the quality of the evidence for any given relation in the maps. We wanted to bring the diversity, importance, and—as one author says—the “beauty” of these signaling mechanisms that underlie so many aspects of biology to all of the readers of Science. Therefore, we invited the pathway authorities who author and curate the Connections Maps to write short Viewpoints that capture the essence of their pathway in this issue of Science . (Both the Viewpoints and the pathways at STKE were critically evaluated by peer review.)

We take a broad view of signaling at STKE and, therefore, have represented many sorts of pathways. Some paths can be deadly, like those emanating from members of the tumor-necrosis factor receptor family (Chen and Goeddel, p. 1634 and Wajant, p. [1635][3]), but only when the balance is tipped away from growth-promoting or survival signals sent from the same receptors. The T and B cell antigen receptors are at the heart of the body's defenses, and unraveling their signaling mechanisms has revealed much about immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders, as well as the function of the healthy immune system (Singer and Koretzky, p. [1639][4], and Gauld et al., p. 1641). Estrogen, a steroid hormone, doesn't bother much with signaling intermediates and makes its way right to the nucleus. But how does it interact with one receptor to produce so many different effects (McDonnell and Norris, p. [1642][5])? Many pathways have important roles in cellular transformation, like the Wnt/_-catenin pathway that also has critical roles in development (Moon et al., p. 1644), or the JAK-STAT pathway, better known for mediating signals from interferons and other cytokines (Aaronson and Horvath, p. [1653][6]). The signal from transforming growth factor receptors seem simple enough—just modify a SMAD protein and send it off to regulate transcription in the nucleus. But nature has found room for plenty of interaction with other pathways and other modulation along the way (Attisano and Wrana, p. [1646][7]).

The Connections Maps are not limited to the animal kingdom, but include plant signaling as well. Unlike vertebrate hormone receptors, plant receptors for cytokinins are histidine kinases that control many aspects of growth and development (Sheen, p. [1650][8]). The lipid jasmonate is a key regulator in plants impacting processes like reproduction and stress responses. Although the biochemical pathway to synthesize these bioactive lipids is well delineated, many genetic components are waiting to be discovered (Liechti and Farmer, p. [1649][9]).

Vaudry et al. explore how the same signal can be used to promote proliferation in one instance and differentiation in another. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway uses changes in lipids at the cell membrane to recruit appropriate signaling molecules that ultimately control growth, survival, migration, and other responses (Cantley, p. 1655). G protein pathways are targets of the majority of therapeutic drugs currently available, and Neves et al. (p. [1636][10]) highlight several such pathways that regulate fundamental processes from metabolism to learning and memory. Martin et al. (p. 1652) take us to “infinity and beyond,” seeking understanding of how signals are generated by integrins, proteins that are literally so important that cells cannot live without them.

Please explore the beauty and complexity of these pathways and augment your reading of Science with the innovative tools available online at Science 's STKE . Think of Science 's STKE as a “GPS” enhancement to Science 's Compass. You'll never lose your way.
