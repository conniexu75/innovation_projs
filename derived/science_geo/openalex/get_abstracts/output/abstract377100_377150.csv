V3D streamlines the online analysis, measurement and proofreading of complicated image patterns by combining ergonomic functions for selecting a location in an image directly in 3D space and for displaying biological measurements, such as from fluorescent probes, using the overlaid surface objects. V3D runs on all major computer platforms and can be enhanced by software plug-ins to address specific biological problems. To demonstrate this extensibility, we built a V3D-based application, V3D-Neuron, to reconstruct complex 3D neuronal structures from high-resolution brain images. V3D-Neuron can precisely digitize the morphology of a single neuron in a fruitfly brain in minutes, with about a 17-fold improvement in reliability and tenfold savings in time compared with other neuron reconstruction tools. Using V3D-Neuron, we demonstrate the feasibility of building a 3D digital atlas of neurite tracts in the fruitfly brain."

In Drosophila melanogaster flies, several pheromones perceived either by contact/at a short distance (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHs), or at a longer distance (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA), affect courtship and mating behaviours. However, it has not previously been possible to precisely identify all potential pheromonal compounds and simultaneously monitor their variation on a time scale. To overcome this limitation, we combined Solid Phase Micro-Extraction with gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. This allowed us (i) to identify 59 cuticular compounds, including 17 new CHs; (ii) to precisely quantify the amount of each compound that could be detected by another fly, and (iii) to measure the variation of these substances as a function of aging and mating. Sex-specific variation appeared with age, while mating affected cuticular compounds in both sexes with three possible patterns: variation was (i) reciprocal in the two sexes, suggesting a passive mechanical transfer during mating, (ii) parallel in both sexes, such as for cVA which strikingly appeared during mating, or (iii) unilateral, presumably as a result of sexual interaction. We provide a complete reassessment of all Drosophila CHs and suggest that the chemical conversation between male and female flies is far more complex than is generally accepted. We conclude that focusing on individual compounds will not provide a satisfactory understanding of the evolution and function of chemical communication in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2069224417,"The success of the ""war on cancer"" initiated in 1971 continues to be debated, with trends in cancer mortality variably presented as evidence of progress or failure. We examined temporal trends in death rates from all-cancer and the 19 most common cancers in the United States from 1970-2006.We analyzed trends in age-standardized death rates (per 100,000) for all cancers combined, the four most common cancers, and 15 other sites from 1970-2006 in the United States using joinpoint regression model. The age-standardized death rate for all-cancers combined in men increased from 249.3 in 1970 to 279.8 in 1990, and then decreased to 221.1 in 2006, yielding a net decline of 21% and 11% from the 1990 and 1970 rates, respectively. Similarly, the all-cancer death rate in women increased from 163.0 in 1970 to 175.3 in 1991 and then decreased to 153.7 in 2006, a net decline of 12% and 6% from the 1991 and 1970 rates, respectively. These decreases since 1990/91 translate to preventing of 561,400 cancer deaths in men and 205,700 deaths in women. The decrease in death rates from all-cancers involved all ages and racial/ethnic groups. Death rates decreased for 15 of the 19 cancer sites, including the four major cancers, with lung, colorectum and prostate cancers in men and breast and colorectum cancers in women.Progress in reducing cancer death rates is evident whether measured against baseline rates in 1970 or in 1990. The downturn in cancer death rates since 1990 result mostly from reductions in tobacco use, increased screening allowing early detection of several cancers, and modest to large improvements in treatment for specific cancers. Continued and increased investment in cancer prevention and control, access to high quality health care, and research could accelerate this progress."

It was recently shown that certain TRPA1 properties are modulated by TRPV1. However, direct interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 as well as regulation of TRPA1 intrinsic characteristics by the TRPV1 channel have not been examined. To address these questions, we have studied a complex formation between TRPA1 and TRPV1 and characterized the influence of TRPV1 on single channel TRPA1-mediated currents. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct interactions between TRPA1 and TRPV1 in an expression system as well as in sensory neurons. Data generated with total internal reflection fluorescence-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicate that a TRPA1-TRPV1 complex can be formed on the plasma membrane. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels is as effective as for TRPV1 or TRPA1 homomers. Single channel analysis in a heterologous expression system and in sensory neurons of wild type and TRPV1 knock-out mice demonstrated that co-expression of TRPV1 with TRPA1 results in outward rectification of single channel mustard oil (IMO) current-voltage relationships (I-V) and substantial modulation of the open probability at negative holding potentials. TRPV1 also does not influence the characteristics of single channel IMO in Ca2+-free extracellular solution. However, association of TRPA1 with TRPV1 was not affected in Ca2+-free media. To assess a role of intracellular Ca2+ in TRPV1-dependent modulation of TRPA1 modulation, the TRPA1-mediated single channel WIN55,212-2-gated current (IWIN) was recorded in inside-out configuration. Our data indicate that single channel properties of TRPA1 are regulated by TRPV1 independently of intracellular Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W2060932265,"Glucagon is released from α-cells present in intact pancreatic islets at glucose concentrations below 4 mm, whereas higher glucose levels inhibit its secretion. The mechanisms underlying the suppression of α-cell secretory activity are poorly understood, but two general types of models have been proposed as follows: direct inhibition by glucose or paracrine inhibition from non-α-cells within the islet of Langerhans. To identify α-cells for analysis, we utilized transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins targeted specifically to these cells. Measurements of glucagon secretion from pure populations of flow-sorted α-cells show that contrary to its effect on intact islets, glucose does stimulate glucagon secretion from isolated α-cells. This observation argues against a direct inhibition of glucagon secretion by glucose and supports the paracrine inhibition model. Imaging of cellular metabolism by two-photon excitation of NAD(P)H autofluorescence indicates that glucose is metabolized in α-cells and that glucokinase is the likely rate-limiting step in this process. Imaging calcium dynamics of α-cells in intact islets reveals that inhibiting concentrations of glucose increase the intracellular calcium concentration and the frequency of α-cell calcium oscillations.

Endocrine function of the islet of Langerhans is critical for the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis. Mouse islets are “micro-organs” composed of insulin-secreting β-cells (70–85% of the cells), glucagon-secreting α-cells (10–15%), along with other cell types (1Unger R.H. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Wierup N. Svensson H. Mulder H. Sundler F. Regul. Pept. 2002; 107: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Insulin and glucagon constitute a bi-hormonal system integral for maintaining normal blood glucose levels. Insulin lowers blood glucose by allowing tissues to absorb, metabolize, and store glucose. Glucagon, on the other hand, plays a protective role when blood glucose levels fall by stimulating hepatic glucose output via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (3Jiang G. Zhang B.B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E671-E678Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Type 1 and late type 2 diabetes have been associated with elevated levels of glucagon that exacerbate the chronic hyperglycemia caused by insulin deficiency (4Matsuda M. Defronzo R.A. Glass L. Consoli A. Giordano M. Bressler P. Delprato S. Metabolism. 2002; 51: 1111-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also, patients under treatment with insulin or insulin secretagogues often fail to secrete a sufficient amount of glucagon during hypoglycemic episodes (5Cryer P.E. Davis S.N. Shamoon H. Diabetes Care. 2003; 26: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). This reduced glucagon response increases the risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia. In normal physiology, glucagon secretion is maximal at low blood glucose levels (<4 mm), whereas higher glucose concentrations stimulate insulin release and reduce glucagon secretion. The cellular mechanisms leading to insulin secretion are fairly well understood. β-Cell glucose transporter (i.e. GLUT-2) and glucokinase ensure that glucose enters the glycolytic pathway (6Hughes S.D.

Similar to β-cells, α-cells contain the same secretory machinery as follows: glucose transporter (in this case GLUT-1), glucokinase, KATP channels, voltage-gated calcium channels (L-, T-, N-, and R-types) and secretory granules (14Heimberg H.

Because of this similarity, one would naively expect increased glucagon release at elevated glucose concentrations. How glucose instead causes a suppression of glucagon secretion remains poorly understood. Proposed models for this suppression fall into two categories as follows: direct inhibition by glucose (17Göpel S.O. Kanno T. Barg S. Weng X.G. Gromada J. Rorsman P. J.

Research on α-cell function has been hindered by the lack of reliable methods to identify α-cells within intact pancreatic islets. Transgenic mice that specifically express fluorescent proteins in α-cells make it possible to distinguish them in situ (31Herrera P.L. Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Quoix N. Cheng-Xue R. Guiot Y. Herrera P.L. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4235-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using islets from these animals, we were able to unequivocally investigate α-cell physiology within intact islets and from pure populations of flow-sorted α-cells. We found that α-cells retrieved from their intra-islet environment exhibit a greater basal glucagon secretion than α-cells in islets. Also, elevated concentrations of glucose (>12 mm) stimulate glucagon secretion from isolated α-cells, contrary to its effect on the islet. This opposite behavior supports a paracrine inhibition model where α-cell secretory activity would be dampened by other cell types within the islet. Fluorescence-based identification of α-cells is particularly well suited for laser-scanning microscopic approaches, which allows quantitative assessments of glucose metabolism and intracellular calcium signals. We used two-photon excitation of the combined redox signal (33Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) from NADH and NADPH (referred to as NAD(P)H) to confirm that glucose is metabolized in α-cells. The NAD(P)H glucose dose-response curve indicates that glucokinase is the likely rate-limiting step in α-cell glucose metabolism. This metabolism is followed by an increase in islet α-cell intracellular calcium concentration and in the frequency of calcium oscillations, as measured by confocal fluorescence microscopy. These observations suggest that glucagon inhibition by glucose is not mediated by a decrease in calcium activity. Instead, glucagon suppression could involve a mechanism downstream from [Ca2+]i signaling, presumably associated with the exocytotic machinery or granule trafficking. Fluo4-AM, FuraRed-AM, propidium iodine, Accutase, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Unless specified, all other products were purchased from Sigma. All work with animals was conducted in compliance with the Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Transgenic mice (C57BL/6 genetic background) that specifically express enhanced yellow fluorescent proteins (EYFP) in α-cells have been designed and described by Quoix et al. (32Quoix N. Cheng-Xue R. Guiot Y. Herrera P.L. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4235-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice are identified by PCR on mouse tail DNA (Puregene mouse tail kit, Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). EYFP-specific oligonucleotide primers are as follows: 5′-TGA CCC TGA AGT TCA TCT GCA CCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGT GGC GGA TCT TGA AGT TCA CCT-3′ (reverse), expected fragment size of 384 bp. Cre-specific primers are as follows: 5′-TGC CAC GAC CAA GTG ACA GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA GGT TAC GGA TAT AGT TCA TG-3′ (reverse), expected size of 675 bp. The emission spectra of EYFP and Fluo4 overlap. We therefore use ROSA26 tandem dimer-red fluorescent protein (ROSA26-tdRFP) mice (34Luche H. Weber O. Nageswara Rao T. Blum C. Fehling H.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) obtained from the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA, Munich, Germany) to perform Fluo4 imaging. GFP-labeled β-cells from transgenic MIP-GFP (Mouse Insulin Promoter-Green Fluorescent Protein) mice (35Hara M. Wang X. Kawamura T. Bindokas V.P. Dizon R.F. Alcoser S.Y. Magnuson M.A. Bell G.I. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E177-E183Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) were used for our NAD(P)H and FuraRed measurements on isolated β-cells. Male mice (2–6-month-old) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.05 ml ketamine/xylazine (VedCo, St. Joseph, MO) at 80 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. We used a modified version of the collagenase digestion method described elsewhere (36Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Islets were maintained in islet medium composed of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glucose (11 mm) at 37 °C under 5% humidified CO2. For imaging purposes, isolated islets were attached on gelatin (0.1%)-coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). ∼200 islets were extracted per pancreas and cultured overnight in suspension in islet medium. They were washed in PBS at pH 7.4 without calcium and magnesium chloride. Then they were digested in Accutase for 15 min at 37 °C (gentle shaking) and resuspended in imaging solution (i.e. filtered aqueous solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 11 mm glucose. One to 2 h after Accutase dispersion, fluorescent cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For this purpose, we used the BD FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) in the Vanderbilt Flow Sorting Core. EYFP, GFP, and propidium iodine (1 μg/ml) were excited at 488 nm; fluorescence was collected using a 500–560 bandpass filter for EYFP and GFP, and a 593–639 nm filter for propidium iodine. Doublet cells were discriminated by pulse geometry gating, looking at the area, height, and width of the voltage pulses. We were able to sort ∼500 viable α-cells per pancreas. Purified β-cell populations were also prepared in a similar manner using islets from MIP-GFP mice (35Hara M. Wang X. Kawamura T. Bindokas V.P. Dizon R.F. Alcoser S.Y. Magnuson M.A. Bell G.I. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E177-E183Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Overnight cultured islets were preincubated for 1 h in basal imaging solution containing 1 mm glucose at 37 °C. Islets were placed into tubes (10 islets per tube) and exposed to different conditions at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples containing secreted hormones were analyzed by radioimmunoassays in the Vanderbilt Hormone Assay Core. Islet hormone content was measured after overnight freezing of the islets in 1% Triton X-100. Each measurement was duplicated. Hormone secretion was expressed as fractional release, i.e. the percentage of total hormone content released over a 1-h incubation period. α-Cells collected after flow sorting were resuspended and preincubated in imaging solution (1 mm glucose) for 1 h at 37 °C. α-Cells were then placed into tubes (50 α-cells per tube) and exposed to different conditions at 37 °C during 1 h. Islets were fixed in PBS containing 2% of paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium azide, 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum (from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Islets were incubated in permeabilization solution supplemented with primary guinea pig anti-glucagon antibodies (1:500) for 24–48 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS three times, incubated with secondary anti-guinea pig antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (1:250 from a stock of 2 mg/ml) for another 24–48 h, and washed three times before imaging. Alexa 488 and 555 were excited at 488 and 543 nm, and their emission was collected through a short (520–560 nm) and a long pass filter (>560 nm), respectively. Islets were equilibrated in imaging buffer (as described above for flow sorting) at 1 mm glucose for 1 h. Islets were kept at 37 °C under 5% CO2 using a temperature-controlled stage and objective warmer (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). We used a two-photon excitation LSM710 laser-scanning microscope with a Fluar 40x/1.3NA oil immersion lens (Zeiss) to measure cellular redox state (33Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), using a Coherent Chameleon laser tuned to 710 nm (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The laser power was kept below 3.5 milliwatts at the sample; at this laser power, no observable damage is caused to the islet (37Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H fluorescence was collected by nondescanned detectors through a custom 380–500-nm filter (Chroma Inc., Rockingham, VT). Glucose concentrations were adjusted by addition of a preheated 100 mm stock solution at different locations on the edge of the imaging dish and mixed by gentle pipetting. Two-photon imaging was sequentially used with single-photon confocal imaging to localize the EYFP-expressing α-cells (pinhole diameter = 1.89 airy units). EYFP was excited at 514 nm, and the emission was collected through a 520–560 nm bandpass filter. For the dose-response curve at steady-state concentrations of glucose, a z-stack of an islet was acquired at 1 mm glucose, and another z-stack was collected 10 min after glucose stimulation, when NAD(P)H signal reaches a plateau. For a given α-cell, optical sections with the greatest EYFP fluorescence (i.e. the middle of the cell) were used as references for comparing NAD(P)H signals before and after glucose application. This strategy was used to overcome any cell movement. Non-EYFP cells were considered to represent β-cells. Islets were labeled with 10 μm FuraRed-AM or 5 μm Fluo4-AM for 1 h in imaging solution containing 1 mm glucose, at 37 °C. After washing, islets were allowed to equilibrate on the microscope stage for 15 min. FuraRed was used for measuring the calcium dose-response curve at steady-state concentrations of glucose. Sequential z-stack acquisitions of EYFP and FuraRed were performed as described previously. FuraRed was excited at 488 nm, and its fluorescence collected through a 620–680-nm bandpass filter. Controls for photobleaching and dye leakage out of the cells were performed on separate islets (n = 7) and showed no statistically significant decrease in FuraRed fluorescence (−0.8 ± 2% for 19 α-cells and 0.06 ± 3.69% for β-cells). Time series Fluo4 imaging was used for recording calcium oscillations within RFP islets. Fluo4 was excited at 488 nm; its emission was recorded between 490 and 575 nm, and tdRFP was excited at 561 nm, and its fluorescence was collected between 538 and 735 nm (LSM710, Zeiss). Calcium concentration values can be approximated from single wavelength excitation of calcium dyes knowing the dissociation constant (KD) of the probe and the basal calcium concentration (39Grynkiewicz G.

J. 1994; 67: 1942-1956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The KD values used for FuraRed and Fluo4 imaging were 1.1 and 0.35 μm, respectively (41Kurebayashi N. Harkins A.B.

Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and the basal calcium concentration was 80 nm in both α- and β-cells as estimated previously (43Berts A. Ball A. Gylfe E.

Data were analyzed with Metamorph 7.6.1 (MDS Analytical Technologies, Downingtown, PA) and Excel 2007 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). For analysis of single cells within islets, regions of interest were chosen to exclude cell edges to best ensure that none of the neighboring cell fluorescence was collected. Background signal was subtracted from all images analyzed. Statistical analyses and curve fittings were performed by Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins in α-cells were obtained by breeding mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the rat glucagon promoter (31Herrera P.L.

Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4143) Google Scholar) and a fluorescent protein (EYFP or tdRFP) gene (32Quoix N. Cheng-Xue R. Guiot Y. Herrera P.L. Henquin J.C. Gilon P.

Immunol. 2007; 37: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry shows that the expression of fluorescent proteins is specific to α-cells (Fig. 1). We found that ∼63% of α-cells (132 of 210 cells), as determined by anti-glucagon antibodies, were labeled with fluorescent proteins (anti-GFP antibodies). All of the fluorescent protein-expressing cells are glucagon-positive, although 35–40% of the α-cells are not genetically labeled. The glucose-dependent insulin and glucagon responses from EYFP-expressing islets are shown in Fig. 2A. As described by Quoix et al. (32Quoix N. Cheng-Xue R. Guiot Y. Herrera P.L. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4235-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), insulin and glucagon secretory responses to glucose are similar between wild-type and transgenic islets (data not shown). The results confirm that glucagon is mostly released at low glucose concentrations (<4 mm) when the release of insulin is minimal. Higher glucose levels (>7 mm) stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release (Fig. 2A) (46Unger R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 47Vieira E. Salehi A. Gylfe E. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 48Shiota C.

Even at higher glucose levels, however, α-cells retain an active secretory activity representing ∼40% of the maximal response observed at low glucose. Application of arginine (10 mm), a potent glucagon secretagogue (50Pipeleers D.G. Schuit F.C. Van Schravendijk C.F. Van de Winkel M. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), leads to an ∼1.8-fold enhancement over basal glucagon release (from 0.74 ± 0.15%, n = 7, to 1.35 ± 0.26% of total cellular glucagon content, n = 5, p < 0.05, Student's t test, unpaired samples). Although we were primarily interested in the behavior of α-cells in their native islet environment, the specific expression of EYFP within α-cells allows for efficient cell sorting by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Cells were sorted in the presence of propidium iodine, a viability dye, and cells positive for propidium iodine signal were excluded from the sorting. Post-sorting measurements of cell viability show that over 95% of sorted cells were viable, and these cells retain their ability to attach to gelatin-coated dishes for imaging purposes. Purity was determined to be >90% both by re-sorting samples of isolated cells and by counting the number of EYFP cells attached on the dishes after being cultured for 1 day. We also measured the insulin content in each assay and found no detectable traces of insulin. Glucagon secretion assays performed on these pure populations of α-cells show that glucagon secretion is 2-fold greater than that from intact islets at low glucose levels (1 mm) (Fig. 2B). Importantly, glucose does not inhibit glucagon secretion from isolated α-cells. Actually, glucose does stimulate glucagon release; application of 12 mm glucose increases basal secretion by 38.0 ± 3.8% (n = 25, p < 0.05, ANOVA). As it does in intact islets, arginine strongly stimulates glucagon secretion from sorted cells. Glucagon secretion at 1 mm glucose increases 2.8-fold after application of 10 mm arginine (from 1.66 ± 0.20%, n = 30, to 4.71 ± 0.9% of total cellular glucagon content, n = 10, p < 0.001). Insulin, zinc ions, and GABA are released by β-cells (22Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat.

We confirmed their inhibitory effects on glucagon secretion from intact islets incubated at 1 mm glucose (Fig. 2C). Application of 100 nm insulin, 30 μm zinc ions, 100 nm GABA, and 100 nm somatostatin reduces basal glucagon secretion by more than 75%. In comparison, an increase in glucose concentration to 12 mm inhibits the α-cell secretory activity by 56.8 ± 11.4%. We next investigated the effect of these inhibitors on flow-sorted α-cells. The same concentrations of insulin, GABA, and somatostatin had no significant effect on glucagon secretion (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, only zinc retained its inhib"

Weiss S.B. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 915-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies during the last quarter of the 20th century implicated PA phosphatase as an important enzyme in lipid metabolism and signaling (2Brindley D.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Nanjundan M. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

The DAG generated in the PA phosphatase reaction may be used by a DAG acyltransferase enzyme to synthesize triacylglycerol and by ethanolaminephosphotransferase or cholinephosphotransferase enzymes to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine, respectively (Fig. 1) (2Brindley D.N.

The enzyme substrate PA is also used for phospholipid (e.g. phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol) synthesis via CDP-DAG (Fig. 1) (2Brindley D.N. Prog.

With respect to lipid signaling, PA phosphatase may generate a pool of DAG used for protein kinase C activation, and by the nature of its reaction, it may attenuate the signaling functions of PA (7Exton J.H.

Thus, it is expected that the regulation of PA phosphatase activity not only governs the pathways by which lipids are synthesized but also influences lipid signaling.Studies to establish the roles of PA phosphatase in lipid metabolism and signaling had been hampered by the lack of genetic and molecular information on the enzyme. However, this changed when yeast PAH1 was identified as the gene encoding PA phosphatase, which functions in lipid synthesis, PA signaling, and nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane growth (6Carman G.M.

The enzyme is distinguished from the family of lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes (previously known as PA phosphatase 2) that dephosphorylate a broad spectrum of substrates (e.g. PA, lyso-PA, DAG pyrophosphate, sphingoid base phosphates, and isoprenoid phosphates) by a distinct catalytic mechanism that does not require divalent cations (5Brindley D.N.

Thus, the molecular function of lipin 1 as a PA phosphatase enzyme provides a mechanistic basis for why the absence or overexpression of lipin 1 in mice has a major effect on lipid metabolism (12Han G.S.

The translocation of lipin 1 from the cytosol to the membrane is essential to its function as a PA phosphatase enzyme. The association of lipin 1 with the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional coactivator, is facilitated by the sumoylation of the protein (43Liu G.H. Gerace L. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear localization of lipin 1 is blocked by its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins in the cytosol (44Péterfy M. Harris T.E. Fujita N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3857-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Understanding the biochemical properties of the PA phosphatase activities of the lipin proteins is fundamental to elucidating the mode of action and control of these activities in vivo. Up to now, however, attempts to purify mammalian forms of PA phosphatase for defined biochemical studies have been unsuccessful (3Nanjundan M. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

In this work, we purified human lipin 1 isoforms (α, β, and γ) and characterized their PA phosphatase activities with respect to their enzymological and kinetic properties. These studies revealed that although the enzymological properties of the lipin 1 isoforms were generally similar, they differed significantly with respect to their kinetic properties. In addition, this work showed that the purified LPIN1-encoded PA phosphatase activities were potently inhibited by sphingoid bases, indicating a connection between human PA phosphatase and sphingolipid metabolism.DISCUSSIONPA phosphatase has emerged as a crucial enzyme in lipid metabolism that has a significant impact on obesity, lipodystrophy, and the metabolic syndrome (29Reue K.

Previous attempts to purify PA phosphatase from mammalian tissues have been unsuccessful because the enzyme is thermally unstable and highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation (5Brindley D.N.

The association of PA phosphatase with other proteins also complicates its purification (59Siess E.A. Hofstetter M.M. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In addition, prior to the studies of Jamal et al. (60Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Muñoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

Moreover, posttranslational modification may lead to enzyme degradation and/or inactivation and specific interactions with other proteins (15O'Hara L. Han G.S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M.

Although phosphorylation is known to decrease the electrophoretic mobility of lipin 1 in mammalian cells (41Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the data derived from this work are difficult to interpret in a definitive way because they have been derived from studies using impure enzymes. The work reported here on the LPIN1-encoded PA phosphatase isoforms did not contain competing and/or modifying enzymes or molecules that inhibit or stimulate activity. Accordingly, the concentration of Mg2+ needed to stimulate the PA phosphatase activities and the concentrations of other effector molecules needed to inhibit the activities were found to be lower than those previously reported. Moreover, for assays with impure enzyme, EDTA is commonly added to inhibit endogenous protease activities, resulting in an increase in the amount of divalent cations needed to affect activity. This work also uncovered the fact that Mn2+ could partially substitute for the Mg2+ dependences of the isoform activities. However, Mg2+ and especially Mn2+ were inhibitory to the PA phosphatase activities at concentrations higher than their optimum levels. In addition, the purified isoforms were potently inhibited by Ca2+ and Zn2+. The inhibition of the activities by Ca2+ has been attributed to its association with the substrate PA to prevent the dephosphorylation reaction (2Brindley D.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Nanjundan M. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Moreover, the PA phosphatase assays have been performed with PA-containing phospholipid vesicles along with the detergent Tween 20 (2Brindley D.N. Prog.

The availability of the purified LPIN1-encoded isoforms permitted defined kinetic studies on human PA phosphatase using Triton X-100/PA-mixed micelles. Although previous studies have indicated that Triton X-100 inhibits PA phosphatase activity (2Brindley D.N. Prog.

https://openalex.org/W2102791444,"Background In the last decade, the inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has emerged from both academic and private research as a new way to modulate the activity of proteins. Inhibitors of these original interactions are certainly the next generation of highly innovative drugs that will reach the market in the next decade. However, in silico design of such compounds still remains challenging. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe this particular PPI chemical space through the presentation of 2P2IDB, a hand-curated database dedicated to the structure of PPIs with known inhibitors. We have analyzed protein/protein and protein/inhibitor interfaces in terms of geometrical parameters, atom and residue properties, buried accessible surface area and other biophysical parameters. The interfaces found in 2P2IDB were then compared to those of representative datasets of heterodimeric complexes. We propose a new classification of PPIs with known inhibitors into two classes depending on the number of segments present at the interface and corresponding to either a single secondary structure element or to a more globular interacting domain. 2P2IDB complexes share global shape properties with standard transient heterodimer complexes, but their accessible surface areas are significantly smaller. No major conformational changes are seen between the different states of the proteins. The interfaces are more hydrophobic than general PPI's interfaces, with less charged residues and more non-polar atoms. Finally, fifty percent of the complexes in the 2P2IDB dataset possess more hydrogen bonds than typical protein-protein complexes. Potential areas of study for the future are proposed, which include a new classification system consisting of specific families and the identification of PPI targets with high druggability potential based on key descriptors of the interaction. Conclusions 2P2I database stores structural information about PPIs with known inhibitors and provides a useful tool for biologists to assess the potential druggability of their interfaces. The database can be accessed at http://2p2idb.cnrs-mrs.fr."
https://openalex.org/W2051764534,"Currently, a limited range of biochemical tests for hypoxia are in clinical use. Early diagnostic and functional biomarkers that mirror cellular metabolism and recovery during resuscitation are lacking. We hypothesized that the quantification of metabolites after hypoxia and resuscitation would enable the detection of markers of hypoxia as well as markers enabling the monitoring and evaluation of resuscitation strategies.Hypoxemia of different durations was induced in newborn piglets before randomization for resuscitation with 21% or 100% oxygen for 15 min or prolonged hyperoxia. Metabolites were measured in plasma taken before and after hypoxia as well as after resuscitation. Lactate, pH and base deficit did not correlate with the duration of hypoxia. In contrast to these, we detected the ratios of alanine to branched chained amino acids (Ala/BCAA; R(2).adj = 0.58, q-value<0.001) and of glycine to BCAA (Gly/BCAA; R(2).adj = 0.45, q-value<0.005), which were highly correlated with the duration of hypoxia. Combinations of metabolites and ratios increased the correlation to R(2)adjust = 0.92. Reoxygenation with 100% oxygen delayed cellular metabolic recovery. Reoxygenation with different concentrations of oxygen reduced lactate levels to a similar extent. In contrast, metabolites of the Krebs cycle (which is directly linked to mitochondrial function) including alpha keto-glutarate, succinate and fumarate were significantly reduced at different rates depending on the resuscitation, showing a delay in recovery in the 100% reoxygenation groups. Additional metabolites showing different responses to reoxygenation include oxysterols and acylcarnitines (n = 8-11, q<0.001).This study provides a novel strategy and set of biomarkers. It provides biochemical in vivo data that resuscitation with 100% oxygen delays cellular recovery. In addition, the oxysterol increase raises concerns about the safety of 100% O(2) resuscitation. Our biomarkers can be used in a broad clinical setting for evaluation or the prediction of damage in conditions associated with low tissue oxygenation in both infancy and adulthood. These findings have to be validated in human trials."

At synapses in the brain, AKAP79/150 incorporates PKA and other regulatory enzymes into signal transduction networks that include β-adrenergic receptors, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA), and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors. We previously showed that AKAP79/150 clusters PKA with type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) to assemble a negative feedback loop in which the anchored kinase phosphorylates AC5 to dynamically suppress cAMP synthesis. We now show that AKAP79 can associate with multiple AC isoforms. The N-terminal regions of AC5, -6, and -9 mediate this protein-protein interaction. Mapping studies located a reciprocal binding surface between residues 77–108 of AKAP79.

https://openalex.org/W2117325943,"Background Zipf's law states that the relationship between the frequency of a word in a text and its rank (the most frequent word has rank , the 2nd most frequent word has rank ,…) is approximately linear when plotted on a double logarithmic scale. It has been argued that the law is not a relevant or useful property of language because simple random texts - constructed by concatenating random characters including blanks behaving as word delimiters - exhibit a Zipf's law-like word rank distribution. Methodology/Principal Findings In this article, we examine the flaws of such putative good fits of random texts. We demonstrate - by means of three different statistical tests - that ranks derived from random texts and ranks derived from real texts are statistically inconsistent with the parameters employed to argue for such a good fit, even when the parameters are inferred from the target real text. Our findings are valid for both the simplest random texts composed of equally likely characters as well as more elaborate and realistic versions where character probabilities are borrowed from a real text. Conclusions/Significance The good fit of random texts to real Zipf's law-like rank distributions has not yet been established. Therefore, we suggest that Zipf's law might in fact be a fundamental law in natural languages."
https://openalex.org/W2044471023,"The ideas of continental philosopher Martin Heidegger have been influential in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, despite the fact that there has been no effort to analyze these ideas empirically. The experiments reported here are designed to lend empirical support to Heidegger's phenomenology and more specifically his description of the transition between ready-to-hand and unready-to-hand modes in interactions with tools. In experiment 1, we found that a smoothly coping cognitive system exhibits type positively correlated noise and that its correlated character is reduced when the system is perturbed. This indicates that the participant and tool constitute a self-assembled, extended device during smooth coping and this device is disrupted by the perturbation. In experiment 2, we examine the re-organization of awareness that occurs when a smoothly coping, self-assembled, extended cognitive system is perturbed. We found that the disruption is accompanied by a change in attention which interferes with participants' performance on a simultaneous cognitive task. Together these experiments show that a smoothly coping participant-tool system can be temporarily disrupted and that this disruption causes a change in the participant's awareness. Since these two events follow as predictions from Heidegger's work, our study offers evidence for the hypothesized transition from readiness-to-hand to unreadiness-to-hand."
https://openalex.org/W2052864542,"Increased expression of specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is known to mediate the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells. Therefore, establishing how ABC transporter genes are controlled at their transcription level may help provide insight into the role of these multifaceted transporters in the malignant phenotype. We have investigated ABC transporter gene expression in a large neuroblastoma data set of 251 tumor samples. Clustering analysis demonstrated a strong association between differential ABC gene expression patterns in tumor samples and amplification of the MYCN oncogene, suggesting a correlation with MYCN function. Using expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we show that MYCN oncoprotein coordinately regulates transcription of specific ABC transporter genes, by acting as either an activator or a repressor. Finally, we extend these notions to c-MYC showing that it can also regulate the same set of ABC transporter genes in other tumor cells through similar dynamics. Overall our findings provide insight into MYC-driven molecular mechanisms that contribute to coordinate transcriptional regulation of a large set of ABC transporter genes, thus affecting global drug efflux. Increased expression of specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is known to mediate the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells. Therefore, establishing how ABC transporter genes are controlled at their transcription level may help provide insight into the role of these multifaceted transporters in the malignant phenotype. We have investigated ABC transporter gene expression in a large neuroblastoma data set of 251 tumor samples. Clustering analysis demonstrated a strong association between differential ABC gene expression patterns in tumor samples and amplification of the MYCN oncogene, suggesting a correlation with MYCN function. Using expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we show that MYCN oncoprotein coordinately regulates transcription of specific ABC transporter genes, by acting as either an activator or a repressor.

There are 48 functional ABC genes in Homo sapiens classified into seven subfamilies from A to G (3Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R.

ABCB1, also named MDR1, is the prototype of this gene superfamily, and its deregulation has been linked to a drug resistance phenotype in several types of cancers (4Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4496) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma is the most common solid cancer in childhood accounting for ∼10% of all pediatric cancers (5Westermann F. Schwab M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 184: 127-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical behavior that ranges from spontaneous regression in a small proportion of cases to rapid progression and resistance to pharmacological treatment with fatal outcome. Patients affected by this tumor often show a multiple drug-resistant phenotype, and although many high risk neuroblastoma tumors initially respond to the first cycles of intensive chemotherapy, they frequently become refractory to treatment as the disease progresses. At present, patient risk classification includes MYCN gene amplification, deletions of chromosomal material on 1p and 11q23 (6Attiyeh E.F. London W.B. Mossé Y.P. Wang Q. Winter C. Khazi D.

Amplification leading to overexpression of the MYCN oncogene is present in ∼25–30% of primary untreated neuroblastoma and is associated with advanced stage disease, rapid progression, and unfavorable prognosis (10Schwab M.

Recent studies have shown that ABC transporters other than ABCB1 may be important for the chemoresistance phenotype of neuroblastoma. We have previously shown, both retrospectively and prospectively, that ABCC1 is a powerful independent prognostic marker in neuroblastoma (12Haber M. Smith J. Bordow S.B. Flemming C. Cohn S.L.

Med. 1996; 334: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), with high levels of ABCC1 expression being strongly associated with reduced survival and event-free survival. ABCC4, another member of the ABCC subfamily, was also shown to be overexpressed in primary neuroblastoma tumors, and its overexpression has been significantly correlated with MYCN amplification and ABCC1 expression. Like ABCC1, high ABCC4 expression also correlated with poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma (14Norris M.D. Smith J. Tanabe K. Tobin P. Flemming C. Scheffer G.L. Wielinga P. Cohn S.L. London W.B. Marshall G.M. Allen J.D. Haber M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consequently, the dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcription regulation of ABC genes should enhance the understanding and prediction of drug response as also recently proposed by Gottesman and co-workers (15Szakács G. Annereau J.P. Lababidi S. Shankavaram U. Arciello A. Bussey K.J. Reinhold W. Guo Y. Kruh G.D. Reimers M. Weinstein J.N. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, most such mechanistic studies have focused on the ABCB1/MDR1 gene (16Scotto K.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7496-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and very few data have been collected on the transcriptional regulation of other ABC genes in normal and tumor tissues.In this study we have investigated the role and mechanism of action of MYCN in transcriptional control of the entire set of human ABC transporter genes. Our findings show that MYCN can coordinate transcription of a large set of ABC genes. Moreover, coordinate regulation of ABC genes by MYCN also extends to an overlapping pattern of regulation of ABC family genes by c-MYC in a variety of c-MYC-driven tumor cell types. An increased level of MYC oncogene expression in tumor cells may trigger altered ABC transporter expression, hence contributing to the control of drug and physiological substrate efflux in cancer cells. Overall, in this study we identified a specific transcription signature of ABC transporter genes dictated by MYC oncoproteins that may provide additional value to the understanding of how a chemoresistance phenotype is established during cancer progression.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that MYCN can coordinate transcription of a large set of ABC transporter genes, whose level of expression is strongly associated with clinical outcome in an aggressive childhood malignancy. The contribution of MYCN to the global transcription profile of the ABC gene family is quite complex in that it exerts its role as an activator on certain ABC genes and as a repressor on others. Regarding the activation of ABC genes, the association of MYCN with these promoters generally occurs close to the transcription start site, often binding E-box sites located after this site, a finding that is consistent with previously published work by Gallant and co-workers (30Hulf T. Bellosta P. Furrer M. Steiger D. Svensson D. Barbour A. Gallant P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3401-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in Drosophila. MYCN also associates with the core promoter region of ABCC3 to repress its transcription. Interestingly, ChIP data showed that MAX also co-occupies the same ABCC3 DNA region, indicating that not just MYCN alone but the heterodimer MYCN-MAX may be required for repression. In the context of transcription repression, MYCN does not recognize any detectable E-box sequence within the ABCC3 promoter but rather targets one region containing several Sp1 binding sites. These sites appear to be critical for MYCN-mediated function in that their deletion abolishes MYCN-mediated repression. Given that Sp1 has been shown to mediate c-MYC repression of p21CIP/WAF and p15Ink4b genes (31Wu S. Cetinkaya C. Munoz-Alonso M.J. von der Lehr N. Bahram F. Beuger V. Eilers M. Leon J. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Möröy T. Bartek J. Massagué J. Hänel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), our data suggest functional equivalence of MYCN and c-MYC in repressing as well as in activating transcription. This idea is also fostered by our results showing that, in other tumor cell lines, c-MYC regulates the same set of ABC genes as that described for MYCN, apparently through similar dynamics.Another important aspect of our study regards the fact that ABC gene transcription levels correlate well with MYC intracellular dosage. Because MYC expression is found to be dysregulated in more than 50% of human cancers, this suggests that knowing MYC expression levels in cancer may be important for prediction of ABC transporter gene transcription profiles and possibly for the choice of appropriate therapeutic protocols to treat affected patients. In addition, altered levels of expression of ABC genes are often detected at diagnosis prior to any medical treatment, suggesting that specific ABC genes may be relevant to tumor biology (33Fletcher J.I. Haber M. Henderson M.J. Norris M.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Several recent studies support the idea that many transporters that we found to be regulated by MYCN may also play a more direct role in oncogenesis. For example, ABCE1 is an inhibitor of Ribonuclease L, an inherited susceptibility gene for familial prostate cancer (34Carpten J. Nupponen N. Isaacs S. Sood R. Robbins C. Xu J. Faruque M. Moses T. Ewing C. Gillanders E. Hu P. Bujnovszky P. Makalowska I. Baffoe-Bonnie A. Faith D. Smith J. Stephan D. Wiley K. Brownstein M. Gildea D. Kelly B. Jenkins R. Hostetter G. Matikainen M. Schleutker J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and silencing of ABCE1 suppresses protein translation and tumor cell growth (36Chen Z.Q. Dong J. Ishimura A. Daar I. Hinnebusch A.G. Dean M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7452-7457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A recent study identified ABCC4 as an androgen receptor-regulated gene and suggested that high levels of ABCC4 may also have a role to play in prostate cancer malignancy (37Cai C. Omwancha J. Hsieh C.L. Shemshedini L. Prostate Cancer Prostatic. Dis. 2007; 10: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, ABCC4 is involved in human dendritic cell migration (38van de Ven R. Scheffer G.L. Reurs A.W. Lindenberg J.J. Oerlemans R. Jansen G. Gillet J.P. Glasgow J.N. Pereboev A. Curiel D.T. Scheper R.J. de Gruijl T.D. Blood. 2008; 112: 2353-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and its expression is affected during hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (39Oevermann L. Scheitz J. Starke K. Köck K. Kiefer T. Dölken G. Niessen J. Greinacher A. Siegmund W. Zygmunt M. Kroemer H.K. Jedlitschky G. Ritter C.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 124: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ABCA2 transporter has been associated not only with drug resistance but also with disease severity at diagnosis in acute myeloid leukemia (40Mack J.T. Beljanski V. Tew K.D. Townsend D.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2006; 60: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that it may be an important molecular marker of oligodendroglioma (41Soichi O. Masanori N. Hideo T. Kazunori A. Nobuya I. Jun-ichi K. Neurosurgery. 2007; 60: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Likewise, ABCF2, which has been reported to be a candidate marker for clear cell adenocarcinomas of the ovary, may also have a direct role in tumor development (42Nishimura S. Tsuda H. Ito K. Jobo T. Yaegashi N. Inoue T. Sudo T. Berkowitz R.S. Mok S.C. Hum. Pathol. 2007; 38: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Tsuda H. Ito Y.M. Ohashi Y. Wong K.K. Hashiguchi Y. Welch W.R. Berkowitz R.S. Birrer M.J. Mok S.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 6880-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when comparing the expression profile of ABC genes between melanocytes and melanoma cells, Schmitz and co-workers (44Heimerl S. Bosserhoff A.K. Langmann T. Ecker J. Schmitz G. Melanoma Res. 2007; 17: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that the mRNA levels of ABCC4, ABCE1, and ABCF2 were significantly increased in melanoma, whereas ABCA7 and ABCD1 were down-regulated, raising the possibility of as yet unrevealed functions for these genes in melanoma tumorigenesis and progression. With respect to ABCC3, although a number of studies associated ABCC3 expression with outcome in different tumors, there is no clear evidence about its role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. However, interestingly, ABCC3 is one of the most expressed genes in the differentiated adrenal medulla, the tissue of origin for neuroblastoma (45Borst P. de Wolf C. van de Wetering K. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 453: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCA12, ABCE1, and ABCF1–3 were found to be highly expressed in retinoblastoma cells relative to normal tissues (46Hendig D. Langmann T. Zarbock R. Schmitz G. Kleesiek K. Götting C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and ABCG2/BCRP transporter expression is associated with the persistence of stem cells in normal and cancer tissues (47Bhattacharya S. Das A. Mallya K. Ahmad I. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 48Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I.

Cell Res. 2006; 16: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our findings provide strong support to a mechanistic model in which MYCN, and by analogy c-MYC, can contribute to the chemoresistance phenotype of cancer cells through the coordinate regulation of a specific set of ABC transporter genes. Furthermore expression analysis of ABC gene expression in primary neuroblastomas suggests that MYCN may drive the transcription of many ABC genes to influence outcome of patients with this disease. Indeed, combined expression of MYCN and ABC transporter genes identified a subset of neuroblastoma patients with particularly poor outcome, revealing how ABC gene transcriptional profiles may represent a novel risk estimation tool to improve outcome prediction and to adjust cancer treatment strategies.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, most such mechanistic studies have focused on the ABCB1/MDR1 gene (16Scotto K.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7496-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and very few data have been collected on the transcriptional regulation of other ABC genes in normal and tumor tissues. ATP-binding cassette real time quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. In this study we have investigated the role and mechanism of action of MYCN in transcriptional control of the entire set of human ABC transporter genes. Our findings show that MYCN can coordinate transcription of a large set of ABC genes. Moreover, coordinate regulation of ABC genes by MYCN also extends to an overlapping pattern of regulation of ABC family genes by c-MYC in a variety of c-MYC-driven tumor cell types. An increased level of MYC oncogene expression in tumor cells may trigger altered ABC transporter expression, hence contributing to the control of drug and physiological substrate efflux in cancer cells. Overall, in this study we identified a specific transcription signature of ABC transporter genes dictated by MYC oncoproteins that may provide additional value to the understanding of how a chemoresistance phenotype is established during cancer progression. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that MYCN can coordinate transcription of a large set of ABC transporter genes, whose level of expression is strongly associated with clinical outcome in an aggressive childhood malignancy. The contribution of MYCN to the global transcription profile of the ABC gene family is quite complex in that it exerts its role as an activator on certain ABC genes and as a repressor on others. Regarding the activation of ABC genes, the association of MYCN with these promoters generally occurs close to the transcription start site, often binding E-box sites located after this site, a finding that is consistent with previously published work by Gallant and co-workers (30Hulf T. Bellosta P. Furrer M. Steiger D. Svensson D. Barbour A. Gallant P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3401-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in Drosophila. MYCN also associates with the core promoter region of ABCC3 to repress its transcription. Interestingly, ChIP data showed that MAX also co-occupies the same ABCC3 DNA region, indicating that not just MYCN alone but the heterodimer MYCN-MAX may be required for repression. In the context of transcription repression, MYCN does not recognize any detectable E-box sequence within the ABCC3 promoter but rather targets one region containing several Sp1 binding sites. These sites appear to be critical for MYCN-mediated function in that their deletion abolishes MYCN-mediated repression. Given that Sp1 has been shown to mediate c-MYC repression of p21CIP/WAF and p15Ink4b genes (31Wu S. Cetinkaya C. Munoz-Alonso M.J. von der Lehr N. Bahram F. Beuger V. Eilers M. Leon J. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Möröy T. Bartek J. Massagué J. Hänel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), our data suggest functional equivalence of MYCN and c-MYC in repressing as well as in activating transcription. This idea is also fostered by our results showing that, in other tumor cell lines, c-MYC regulates the same set of ABC genes as that described for MYCN, apparently through similar dynamics.Another important aspect of our study regards the fact that ABC gene transcription levels correlate well with MYC intracellular dosage. Because MYC expression is found to be dysregulated in more than 50% of human cancers, this suggests that knowing MYC expression levels in cancer may be important for prediction of ABC transporter gene transcription profiles and possibly for the choice of appropriate therapeutic protocols to treat affected patients. In addition, altered levels of expression of ABC genes are often detected at diagnosis prior to any medical treatment, suggesting that specific ABC genes may be relevant to tumor biology (33Fletcher J.I. Haber M. Henderson M.J. Norris M.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Several recent studies support the idea that many transporters that we found to be regulated by MYCN may also play a more direct role in oncogenesis. For example, ABCE1 is an inhibitor of Ribonuclease L, an inherited susceptibility gene for familial prostate cancer (34Carpten J. Nupponen N. Isaacs S. Sood R. Robbins C. Xu J. Faruque M. Moses T. Ewing C. Gillanders E. Hu P. Bujnovszky P. Makalowska I. Baffoe-Bonnie A. Faith D. Smith J. Stephan D. Wiley K. Brownstein M. Gildea D. Kelly B. Jenkins R. Hostetter G. Matikainen M. Schleutker J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and silencing of ABCE1 suppresses protein translation and tumor cell growth (36Chen Z.Q. Dong J. Ishimura A. Daar I. Hinnebusch A.G. Dean M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7452-7457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A recent study identified ABCC4 as an androgen receptor-regulated gene and suggested that high levels of ABCC4 may also have a role to play in prostate cancer malignancy (37Cai C. Omwancha J. Hsieh C.L. Shemshedini L. Prostate Cancer Prostatic. Dis. 2007; 10: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, ABCC4 is involved in human dendritic cell migration (38van de Ven R. Scheffer G.L. Reurs A.W. Lindenberg J.J. Oerlemans R. Jansen G. Gillet J.P. Glasgow J.N. Pereboev A. Curiel D.T. Scheper R.J. de Gruijl T.D.

The ABCA2 transporter has been associated not only with drug resistance but also with disease severity at diagnosis in acute myeloid leukemia (40Mack J.T. Beljanski V. Tew K.D. Townsend D.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2006; 60: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that it may be an important molecular marker of oligodendroglioma (41Soichi O. Masanori N. Hideo T. Kazunori A. Nobuya I. Jun-ichi K. Neurosurgery. 2007; 60: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Likewise, ABCF2, which has been reported to be a candidate marker for clear cell adenocarcinomas of the ovary, may also have a direct role in tumor development (42Nishimura S. Tsuda H. Ito K. Jobo T. Yaegashi N. Inoue T. Sudo T. Berkowitz R.S. Mok S.C. Hum. Pathol. 2007; 38: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Tsuda H. Ito Y.M. Ohashi Y. Wong K.K. Hashiguchi Y. Welch W.R. Berkowitz R.S. Birrer M.J. Mok S.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 6880-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when comparing the expression profile of ABC genes between melanocytes and melanoma cells, Schmitz and co-workers (44Heimerl S. Bosserhoff A.K. Langmann T. Ecker J. Schmitz G. Melanoma Res. 2007; 17: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that the mRNA levels of ABCC4, ABCE1, and ABCF2 were significantly increased in melanoma, whereas ABCA7 and ABCD1 were down-regulated, raising the possibility of as yet unrevealed functions for these genes in melanoma tumorigenesis and progression. With respect to ABCC3, although a number of studies associated ABCC3 expression with outcome in different tumors, there is no clear evidence about its role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. However, interestingly, ABCC3 is one of the most expressed genes in the differentiated adrenal medulla, the tissue of origin for neuroblastoma (45Borst P. de Wolf C. van de Wetering K. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 453: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCA12, ABCE1, and ABCF1–3 were found to be highly expressed in retinoblastoma cells relative to normal tissues (46Hendig D. Langmann T. Zarbock R. Schmitz G. Kleesiek K. Götting C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and ABCG2/BCRP transporter expression is associated with the persistence of stem cells in normal and cancer tissues (47Bhattacharya S. Das A. Mallya K. Ahmad I. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 48Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I.

Cell Res. 2006; 16: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our findings provide strong support to a mechanistic model in which MYCN, and by analogy c-MYC, can contribute to the chemoresistance phenotype of cancer cells through the coordinate regulation of a specific set of ABC transporter genes. Furthermore expression analysis of ABC gene expression in primary neuroblastomas suggests that MYCN may drive the transcription of many ABC genes to influence outcome of patients with this disease. Indeed, combined expression of MYCN and ABC transporter genes identified a subset of neuroblastoma patients with particularly poor outcome, revealing how ABC gene transcriptional profiles may represent a novel risk estimation tool to improve outcome prediction and to adjust cancer treatment strategies. In this study we have shown that MYCN can coordinate transcription of a large set of ABC transporter genes, whose level of expression is strongly associated with clinical outcome in an aggressive childhood malignancy.

The PI3K pathway is activated by phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss in most prostate cancers (PCa), but the contribution of upstream RTKs that may be targeted therapeutically has not been assessed. Immunoblotting of p85-associated proteins in serum-starved PTEN-deficient LNCaP and C4-2 PCa cells showed a small set of discrete tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but these proteins were not recognized by an anti-pYXXM motif antibody and were not found in PTEN-deficient PC3 PCa cells. LC/MS/MS using label-free proteomics and immunoblotting showed that p85 was associated primarily with p110β and p110δ. An interaction with ErbB3 was also detected but was independent of ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation and was not required for basal PI3K activity. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of p110β and p110δ could be blocked by c-Src inhibitors, but this did not suppress PI3K activity, which was similarly independent of Ras. Basal PI3K activity was mediated by p110β in PC3 cells and by both p110β and p110δ in LNCaP cells, whereas p110α was required for PI3K activation in response to RTK stimulation by heregulin-β1. These findings show that basal PI3K activity in PTEN-deficient PCa cells is RTK-independent and can be mediated by p110β and p110δ. Increased p110β expression in PCa may be required for RTK-independent PI3K pathway activation in adult prostate epithelium with genetic or epigenetic PTEN down-regulation."

However, GIP also promotes lipogenesis, thus potentially restricting its therapeutic use. The current studies evaluated the effects of a truncated GIP analog, D-Ala2-GIP1–30 (D-GIP1–30), on glucose homeostasis and β-cell mass in rat models of diabetes. Materials and Methods The insulinotropic and pro-survival potency of D-GIP1–30 was evaluated in perfused pancreas preparations and cultured INS-1 β-cells, respectively, and receptor selectivity evaluated using wild type and GIP receptor knockout mice. Effects of D-GIP1–30 on β-cell function and glucose homeostasis, in vivo, were determined using Lean Zucker rats, obese Vancouver diabetic fatty rats, streptozotocin treated rats, and obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats, with effects on β-cell mass determined in histological studies of pancreatic tissue. Lipogenic effects of D-GIP1–30 were evaluated on cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Results Acutely, D-GIP1–30 improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Chronic treatment with D-GIP1–30 reduced levels of islet pro-apoptotic proteins in Vancouver diabetic fatty rats and preserved β-cell mass in streptozotocin treated rats and Zucker diabetic fatty rats, resulting in improved insulin responses and glycemic control in each animal model, with no change in body weight. In in vitro studies, D-GIP1–30 exhibited equivalent potency to GIP1–42 on β-cell function and survival, but greatly reduced action on lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that truncated forms of GIP exhibit potent anti-diabetic actions, without pro-obesity effects, and that the C-terminus contributes to the lipogenic actions of GIP."

However, the precise mechanisms in this critical signal event are largely unknown.

This signaling event was initiated by hyperexpressed p38γ that led to increased c-Jun synthesis, MMP9 transcription, and MMP9-dependent invasion through p38γ interacting with c-Jun. p38γ requires phosphorylation and its C terminus to bind c-Jun, whereas both c-Jun and p38γ are required for the trans-activation of MMP9. The active p38γ/c-Jun/MMP9 pathway also exists in human colon cancer, and there is a coupling of increased p38γ and MMP9 expression in the primary tissues.

MAPKs are believed to do so by phosphorylating and activating a group of transcription factors, which through binding regulatory DNA elements lead to altered gene transcription. c-Jun is a major component of the AP-1 transcription factor downstream of MAPKs, whereas AP-1 is composed of homodimers of the Jun family or its heterodimers with another transcription factor such as c-Fos to bind the consensus DNA elements TGAg/cTCA (2Shaulian E.

In contrast to p38α, our recent studies showed that p38γ is induced by Ras and required for Ras transformation and invasion (11Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23910-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7540-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating its oncogenic activity. The underlying mechanisms for p38γ involvement in Ras tumorigenesis, however, have not been established. In this report, we show that p38γ acts both as an activator and a cofactor for c-Jun in trans-activating MMP9, a critical matrix metalloproteinase involved in cancer invasion and metastasis (13Ozanne B.W. Spence H.J. McGarry L.C. Hennigan R.F. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Lubbe W. Zhou Z.Y. Fu W. Zuzga D. Schulz S. Fridman R. Muschel R. Waldman S.A. Pitari G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results reveal a novel paradigm by which p38γ increases c-Jun synthesis and activated c-Jun then recruits p38γ as a cofactor onto a target gene promoter through AP-1 recognition leading to an increased gene expression and invasion. Cell culture materials were supplied by Invitrogen and chemicals by Sigma. p38 isoform-specific antibodies were purchased from RD Systems. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, c-Jun, MMP9, and MMP2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and p-c-Jun (Ser-63/73) antibodies were from Cell Signaling.

All cell cultures were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. An AP-1 luciferase reporter (AP-1 Luc, 3 AP-1 repeats fused to a lucifease reporter gene containing a minimal Fos promoter) was described previously (4Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol.

The Tet-on inducible expression system (T-Rex) was purchased from Invitrogen. A full-length human p38γ, its AGF mutant (p38γ/AGF), and the c-Jun luciferase promoter (c-Jun Luc, containing −225 to +150 of the promoter) were provided by J. Han (19Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To generate a Tet-on system, a full-length human p38γ or p38γ/AGF cDNA was cloned into pcDNA4 vector, which was then cotransfected with pcDNA6/TR into IEC-6 cells and selected/maintained as we described previously (12Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7540-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of p38γ or p38γ/AGF was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml of tetracycline that alone has been shown to have no effects on cell invasion or endogenous p38γ protein expression (data not shown). The C-terminal truncated p38γ mutants (p38γΔ4 and p38γΔ13) were generated by PCR and cloned into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 vector as described (22Hou S.W. Zhi H. Pohl N. Loesch M. Qi X. Li R. Basir Z. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2901-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Invasion assays were carried out using the BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) by using 20% fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant according to the manufacturer's instruction, as we described previously (12Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7540-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Invaded cells on the low surface of membrane were then fixed, stained, and counted. On the other hand, wound assays were used to assess the ability of the cell to migrate into a scratched area in serum-free medium. Immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board approval from the Medical College of Wisconsin and were performed as described previously (22Hou S.W. Zhi H. Pohl N. Loesch M. Qi X. Li R. Basir Z. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2901-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Zhi H. Yang X.J. Kuhnmuench J. Berg T. Thill R. Yang H. See W.A. Becker C.G. Williams C.L. Li R. J. Pathol. 2009; 217: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A rabbit anti-p38γ (1:1200; R&D catalog no. AF1644) and a goat anti-MMP9 (1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies. Staining results were scored by two observers (22Hou S.W. Zhi H. Pohl N. Loesch M. Qi X. Li R. Basir Z. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2901-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a consensus score was assigned to each case, which were then analyzed for the relationship between p38γ and MMP9 by a double-blind procedure. The ChIP assay was performed essentially as described previously (16Li Q.-P. Qi X. Pramanik R. Pohl N.M. Loesch M. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1544-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde solution to cross-link DNA with associated proteins, which were then sonicated and incubated with a specific antibody or IgG. For ChIP-re-ChIP assays, the first precipitates were washed and incubated with second antibody as described (24Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Precipitated DNA was then extracted and used as a template for PCR. DNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and used as a template for PCR with primers that cover the AP-1 site of the rat MMP-9 promoter within nucleotides −547 to −327 (5′-ATCCTGCTTCAAAGAGCCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCTGAAGGCCCTGAGTGGT-3′ (antisense). Total chromatin also was prepared in parallel and subjected to PCR as an input control. Total RNA was prepared using a TRIzol extraction kit, and the qRT-PCR was performed using the Express One-Step Syber GreenER qPCR kit (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed by ΔΔCt method for fold changes in expression and the ratio of MMP9 or c-Jun over β-actin (rat and human cells) or 18 S (mouse cells) was used for comparison. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Some of qRT-PCR products were also visualized on agarose gels. All primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, and their sequences are as follows: rat β-actin, 5′-ATCTGCCACCACACCTTCTACAATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAGGTC-3′ (antisense); rat MMP2, 5′-CATCGCTGCACCATCGCCCATCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCAGGGTCCACAGCTCATCATCATCAAAG-3′ (antisense); rat MMP9, 5′-GAAGACTTGCCGCGAGACCTGATCGATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACCAGCGATAACCATCCGAGCGAC-3′ (antisense); human β-actin, 5′-GATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC-3′ (antisense); human MMP9, 5′-TGGGCTACGTGACCTATGACAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCAGCCCACCTCCACTCCTC-3′ (antisense); rat c-Jun, 5′-GACCTTCTACGACGATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGCGCCAGCTACTGAGGC-3′ (antisense); mouse 18 S RNA, 5′-AGGAATTCCCAGTAAGTGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAA-3′ (antisense); mouse c-Jun, 5′-AGAGCGGTGCCTACGGCTACAGTAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGACGTGAGAAGGTCCGAGTTCTTG-3′ (antisense); mouse MMP9, 5′-CCAAGGGTACAGCCTGTTCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACGCTGGAATGATCTAAGC-3′ (antisense). To determine the level of MMP9 activity, Tet-on p38γ IEC-6 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density to allow them to reach about 80% confluence within 24 h with and without Tet addition. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with 4 ml of fresh serum-free medium. To determine the effects on MMP9 activity by its inhibitors, Tet cells were treated with 10 nm ilomastat (Chemicon International) or 1 μm SB-3CT (Calbiochem) or a solvent control. After additional 24 h, the media were collected and concentrated by centrifugation using the Amicon Ultra-4 Ultracel-50k filters (Millipore). Concentrated samples were measured for the protein concentration by BCA protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Gelatin zymography was used to assess MMP9 activity (25Hu L. Roth J.M. Brooks P. Luty J. Karpatkin S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of protein from each sample was mixed with SDS sample buffer in the absence of reducing reagents, which were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. The gels were incubated with 2.5% Triton X-100 buffer for 1 h and then incubated in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C). Following staining with 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the gelatinolytic activities were detected as clear bands against a blue background. Endogenous p38γ was depleted by lentiviral-mediated shRNA delivery (with two separate target sequences by including a sequence from luciferase gene as a control) as described previously (22Hou S.W. Zhi H. Pohl N. Loesch M. Qi X. Li R. Basir Z. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2901-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The target sequences for individual genes are as follows: luciferase (shLuc), GTGCGTTGCTAGTACCAAC; #1shp38γ, CTCATGAAACATGAGAAGCTA; #2#1shp38γ, GAAGGAGATCATGAAGGTGAC. To produce virus, lentiviral constructs were transfected into packaging cells, and supernatants were collected and filtered 48 h later. To deplete p38γ protein expression, human colon cancer cells were double-infected with the viruses at a 2-h interval, which were processed for invasion assays and qRT-PCR/Western blot (WB) analyses 48 and 72 h later, respectively. For reporter and promoter assays, AP-1 Luc, c-Jun-Luc, or MMP9-Luc was transiently coexpressed with various constructs, and lysates were prepared for the luciferase activity assays 48 h later using a dual luciferase kit from Promega (12Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7540-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The procedures for immunoprecipitation and WB have been described previously (11Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23910-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Results of multiple variables were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-test. Two variables were analyzed by Student's t test. The immunohistochemistry results were analyzed by a χ2 test, and the linear regression analysis was used for assessing the relationship between the normalized p38γ content with the c-Jun or MMP9. A statistically significant difference is reached when a p value is less than 0.05. To investigate signaling mechanisms for p38γ oncogenic activity, we focused on how forced p38γ expression leads to an increased invasion. Because normal cells express little p38γ (11Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23910-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a tetracycline-inducible (Tet-on) system was used to express WT p38γ and its nonphosphorable mutant p38γ/AGF (by changing the dual phosphorylation motif TGY to AGF) in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells. Following an overnight incubation with and without Tet, cells were seeded in Matrigel-coated invasion chambers and analyzed for invasion (12Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S. Chen G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7540-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1, A and B, show that Tet-induced p38γ stimulates invasion whereas its AGF mutant is without effect, which couples with its activity to increase c-Jun but not c-Fos protein expression. The invasion-stimulatory activity of p38γ is further confirmed by an increased migration in wound assays (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that p38γ stimulates cell invasion and/or migration by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that the C-terminal PDZ motif is required for the invasive activity of c-Src (26Baumgartner M. Radziwill G. Lorger M. Weiss A. Moelling K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 642-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and TAZ (tafazzin) proteins (27Chan S.W. Lim C.J. Guo K. Ng C.P. Lee I. Hunziker W. Zeng Q. Hong W. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and we then explored whether the C-terminal PDZ sequence of p38γ plays a similar role. To remove the PDZ motif (-ETPL), FLAG-tagged C-terminal truncated p38γΔ4 and p38γΔ13 that lack the last four and 13 amino acids, respectively, were generated by PCR and stably expressed in IEC-6 cells by including FLAG-p38γ and FLAG-p38γ/AGF for comparison. To explore their potential roles in Ras tumorigenesis, resistant clones were pooled and infected with retrovirus expressing K-Ras and their invasive activity then compared. Consistent with the results in Tet-on cells, stable expression of p38γ significantly increases invasion over the vector control, whereas its AGF mutant has much less effect (Fig. 1, D and E). Interestingly, the invasive activity also was decreased in cells expressing both p38γΔ4 and p38γΔ13 (Fig. 1, D and E). These results together indicate that p38γ requires both phosphorylation and its C terminus to stimulate invasion. MMPs consist of at least 23 family members and have long been associated with cancer invasion and metastases because of their role in breaking down the extracellular matrix (28Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 2: 161-174Google Scholar). Among these family proteins, MMP9 is one of the best characterized AP-1 target genes involved in cancer invasion (13Ozanne B.W. Spence H.J. McGarry L.C. Hennigan R.F. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because p38 MAPKs were previously shown to regulate the AP-1 target gene expression (29Qi X. Pramanik R. Wang J.

Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), an AP-1 reporter (4Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and a 670-bp human MMP9 promoter (18Behren A. Simon C. Schwab R.M. Loetzsch E. Brodbeck S. Huber E. Stubenrauch F. Zenner H.P. Iftner T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11613-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were transiently expressed in IEC-6 cells to assess whether p38γ increases their luciferase activity compared with p38α. Results in Fig. 2, A and B, show that both p38γ and p38α increase AP-1, but only p38γ stimulates the MMP9 promoter activity. These results are different from those previously published (31Simon C. Simon M. Vucelic G. Hicks M.J. Plinkert P.K. Koitschev A. Zenner H.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), most likely as a result of the different cell line used. To determine whether p38γ stimulates MMP9 via AP-1, Tet-on cells were expressed with a WT or AP-1 or NF-κB site-mutated MMP9 promoter construct (18Behren A. Simon C. Schwab R.M. Loetzsch E. Brodbeck S. Huber E. Stubenrauch F. Zenner H.P. Iftner T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11613-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was determined. Fig. 2C results show that Tet-p38γ has a similar MMP9 stimulatory activity toward the WT and NF-κB mutated promoter, which, however, was abolished by the mutations on two AP-1 sites, indicating a required role of the AP-1 in p38γ trans-activating MMP9. To demonstrate the MMP9 stimulatory effects further, RNA was prepared and analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR for MMP9 mRNA expression compared with MMP2. Results in Fig. 2D demonstrate that p38γ significantly increases MMP9 but not MMP2 expression; this is likely as a result of the lack of AP-1 site in the MMP2 promoter. Importantly, analyses of medium collected from cultured Tet-on p38γ cells revealed that there is an increased secreted MMP9 protein expression by WB and an elevated MMP9 gelatin activity by zymography (Fig. 2E), indicating the transcribed protein being functionally active. Consistent with these results, analysis of IEC-6/K-Ras cells stably transfected with p38γs also show that p38γ increases MMP9 RNA expression whereas all of its mutants have much less effects (Fig. 2F), which more or less correlates with their regulatory effects on AP-1 and/ or MMP9 transcriptional activity (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, respectively). These results together indicate that p38γ requires both phosphorylation and the C terminus to stimulate AP-1-dependent MMP9 transcription. Both human (18Behren A. Simon C. Schwab R.M. Loetzsch E. Brodbeck S. Huber E. Stubenrauch F. Zenner H.P. Iftner T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11613-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and rat (32Eberhardt W. Schulze M. Engels C. Klasmeier E. Pfeilschifter J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1752-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) MMP9 promoters contain two AP-1 sites, and ChIP assays were next performed to explore whether p38γ binds the endogenous MMP9 promoter around this region using primers that span the functional distal AP-1 site (see Fig. 6C). Following formaldehyde-induced DNA cross-linking with associated proteins, stably transfected p38γ in IEC-6/K-Ras cells was isolated with a FLAG antibody, and the precipitates were subjected to PCR analysis, as described previously (16Li Q.-P. Qi X. Pramanik R. Pohl N.M. Loesch M. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1544-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a control, a set of plates were processed for FLAG immunoprecipitation and WB analyses to explore whether p38γ may be recruited into the MMP9 promoter through interaction with c-Jun and/or c-Fos proteins. Results in Fig. 3A (top) show that among these sublines, only precipitates from WT p38γ-expressed cells contain the MMP9 promoter. Of interest, the immunoprecipitation/WB analyses (Fig. 3A, bottom) revealed that p38γ, but not its mutants, increases c-Jun protein expression that couples with its c-Jun binding activity, whereas c-Fos remains undetectable. Because the MMP9 promoter binding couples with the p38γ activity to increase c-Jun expression and bind c-Jun protein, these results suggest a scenario in which p38γ first activates c-Jun by increasing its expression, and activated c-Jun then recruits p38γ onto the MMP9 promoter via a complex formation.FIGURE 3p38γ is recruited into the MMP9 promoter through interaction with c-Jun. A, p38γ depends on its phosphorylation and C terminus to bind c-Jun protein and MMP9 promoter. Stably transfected p38γs from IEC-6/K-Ras cells were isolated and precipitates subjected to PCR analyses for their activity in binding MMP9 promoter (top) with a set of cells in parallel analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blotting for p38γ interacting with c-Jun proteins (bottom). B and C, p38γ and c-Jun bind the MMP9 promoter through a complex formation. Tet-on p38γ IEC-6 cells were incubated with and without Tet and p38γ/c-Jun proteins isolated by their specific antibodies, and precipitates subjected to PCR (B, top), Western blotting (B, bottom) or a second IP/PCR for ChIP-re-ChIP (C). D, p38γ does not induce c-Jun/ATF2 phosphorylation or vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in IEC-6 cells. Cells were incubated with and without a p38 inhibitor SB203580 (SB) for 24 h and then pulse-treated with a p38 activator arsenite (ARS) for 2 h, and analyzed by Western blotting (see supplemental Fig. S2A for the relationship between c-Jun expression and c-Jun phosphorylation in response to Tet addition). E, endogenous p38γ forms a complex with c-Jun on the MMP9 promoter in K-Ras-transformed IEC-6 cells. Cells were treated with SB or solvent control (Co) as previously described in these cells (33Qi X. Pohl N.M. Loesch M. Hou S. Li R. Qin J.Z. Cuenda A. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31398-31408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and p38γ and c-Jun proteins were isolated and assessed for their MMP9 promoter binding activity by ChIP and their complex formation by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate the c-Jun-mediated p38γ-MMP9 promoter binding further, Tet-on IEC-6 cells were next analyzed by ChIP and WB in which endogenous c-Jun was also purified and included as a positive control. Results in Fig. 3B show that in response to Tet addition, both p38γ and c-Jun precipitates contain the MMP9 promoter by ChIP and its partner by WB, and there is an increased c-Jun protein expression, further indicating that p38γ occupies the MMP9 promoter through interacting with c-Jun. Comparative analyses of c-Jun precipitates by ChIP and WB reveal another interesting phenomenon. Although c-Jun precipitates contain more c-Jun proteins in the absence of Tet, c-Jun alone, in the absence of Tet-induced p38γ expression, fails to bind the MMP9 promoter (Fig. 3B, top, lanes 6 and 7 versus bottom, lanes 1 and 2). In response to Tet, however, c-Jun binds both the p38γ protein and the MMP9 promoter, indicating a required role of p38γ in c-Jun binding to the MMP9 promoter. Moreover, the interdependent role of p38γ and c-Jun in the MMP9 promoter binding was further demonstrated by the ChIP-re-ChIP assay, and Tet-p38γ only activates MMP9 without increasing another AP-1 target gene vitamin D receptor expression (29Qi X.

Our previous studies have demonstrated an increased p38γ protein expression by a p38α/p38β inhibitor SB203580 (SB) in K-Ras"
https://openalex.org/W2142756718,"Dually targeted mitochondrial proteins usually possess an unconventional mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), which makes them difficult to predict by current bioinformatics approaches. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) plays a central role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. It is a dually targeted protein preferentially residing in the nucleus with conditional distribution in the mitochondria. However, the mitochondrial translocation mechanism of APE1 is not well characterized because it harbors an unconventional MTS that is difficult to predict by bioinformatics analysis. Two experimental approaches were combined in this study to identify the MTS of APE1. First, the interactions between the peptides from APE1 and the three purified translocase receptors of the outer mitochondrial membrane (Tom) were evaluated using a peptide array screen. Consequently, the intracellular distribution of green fluorescent protein-tagged, truncated, or mutated APE1 proteins was traced by tag detection. The results demonstrated that the only MTS of APE1 is harbored within residues 289–318 in the C terminus, which is normally masked by the intact N-terminal structure. As a dually targeted mitochondrial protein, APE1 possesses a special distribution pattern of different subcellular targeting signals, the identification of which sheds light on future prediction of MTSs.

The results demonstrated that the only MTS of APE1 is harbored within residues 289–318 in the C terminus, which is normally masked by the intact N-terminal structure. As a dually targeted mitochondrial protein, APE1 possesses a special distribution pattern of different subcellular targeting signals, the identification of which sheds light on future prediction of MTSs."

This transcriptional response is determined by receptor interactions with transcriptional regulators and chromatin modifying proteins. We compared transcriptional responses of three RA target genes (Hoxa1, Cyp26a1, RARβ2) in primary embryo fibroblasts (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), immortalized fibroblasts (Balb/c3T3), and F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. Hoxa1 and Cyp26a1 transcripts are not expressed, but RARβ2 transcripts are induced by RA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Balb/c3T3 cells. Retinoid receptors (RARγ, RXRα), coactivators (pCIP (NCOA3, SRC3)), and p300 and RNA polymerase II are recruited only to the RARβ2 RA response element (RARE) in Balb/c3T3, whereas these proteins are recruited to RAREs of all three genes by RA in F9 cells. In F9, RA reduces polycomb (PcG) protein Suz12 and the associated H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic modification at the RAREs of all three genes. In contrast, in Balb/c3T3 cells cultured in the +/−RA, Suz12 is not associated with the Hoxa1, RARβ2, and Cyp26a1 RAREs, whereas slow levels of the H3K27me3 mark are seen at these RAREs. Thus, Suz12 is not required for gene repression in the absence of RA. Even though the Hoxa1 RARE and proximal promoter show high levels of H3K9,K14 acetylation in Balb/c3T3, the Hoxa1 gene is not transcriptionally activated by RA. In Balb/c3T3, CpG islands are methylated in the Cyp26a1 promoter region but not in the Hoxa1 promoter or in these promoters in F9 cells.

We report here that constitutively active Smad1 induced osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in cooperation with Smad4 or Runx2. In floxed Smad4 mice-derived cells, Smad4 ablation partially suppressed BMP-4-induced osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, the BMP-4-induced inhibition of myogenesis was lost by Smad4 ablation and restored by Smad4 overexpression. A nuclear zinc finger protein, E4F1, was identified as a possible component of the Smad4 complex that suppresses myogenic differentiation in response to BMP signaling. In the presence of Smad4, E4F1 stimulated the expression of Ids.

BMPs were originally found in bone matrix as factors responsible for the induction of ectopic bone formation, in which implantation of demineralized bone matrix into muscle tissue induced new bone tissue containing bone marrow (2Urist M.R.

Implantation of individual recombinant BMPs, such as BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7, into muscle tissue induces ectopic bone formation in vivo as well (4Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1998; 346: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This ectopic bone-inducing activity is highly specific to BMPs, because other hormones and cytokines, including TGF-β1 itself, failed to induce ectopic bone formation in muscle tissue in vivo (5Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although many factors, such as BMPs, TGF-βs, fibroblast growth factors, and epidermal growth factor, inhibit myogenic maturation of myoblasts in vitro, only BMPs convert them so that they differentiate to osteoblastic cells, the bone-forming cells in vertebrates (6Salminen A.

The BMP-bound type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor kinase, and the activated BMP type I receptor in turn phosphorylates downstream substrates such as receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Phosphorylated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcription of various target genes, including Id1, which encodes a dominant-negative inhibitor of myogenesis (13Katagiri T.

Our findings indicate that this mutant ALK2 is a constitutively activated and hyper-reactive form of the BMP type I receptor and suggest that downstream signaling of activated receptors play an important role in heterotopic bone formation in muscle tissue under certain pathological conditions (17Fukuda T.

Here, we show that a protein in which the carboxyl-terminal serine residues of Smad1 were substituted with aspartic acids, termed Smad1(DVD), functioned as a constitutively activated Smad1. Overexpression of Smad1(DVD) induced osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, although the inhibition of myogenic differentiation depended principally on nuclear Smad4 rather than R-Smads. E4F1 was identified as a possible component of the Smad4 complex in the suppression of myogenic differentiation by BMP signaling. R-Smads and Smad4 play important roles in the conversion of myogenic cells to osteoblastic cells by BMPs, data were confirmed with the deletion of Smad4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Expression vectors for wild-type mouse Smad1, Smad4, and Smad7 were described previously (13Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All of the mutations were introduced by a standard PCR technique using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and their sequences were confirmed in each expression vector. Smad1 mutants were obtained by substitution of Ser-463 and/or Ser-465 of mouse Smad1 with aspartic acid or alanine residues. A nuclear localization signal derived from an SV40 large T antigen, PPKKKRKV, was inserted between an amino-terminal epitope tag and Smad1 or Smad4. NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1) and NLS-Smad4(ΔMH2) were obtained by deleting amino acids 2–138 and 316–552, respectively, from full-length NLS-Smad4.

MEFs prepared from Smad4floxed/floxed mouse embryos at 11.5 days postcoitum were infected with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (pAxCANCre) or a human histone 2B-GFP unit (pAxH2BGFP) under control of the CAG promoter (22Yang X.

Cells were lysed in ChIP buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and sonicated. The chromatin solution was subjected to immunoprecipitation using a OneDay ChIP Kit (Diagenode, Sparta, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The Myogenin promoter was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-TAATTGAAAGGAGCAGATGAGACGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCATCAGGTCGGAAAAGGCTTGTTC-3′.

First, we determined the minimal culture periods of C2C12 cells with BMP-4 required for the inhibition of myogenic differentiation and induction of osteoblastic differentiation (Fig. 1A). Treatment of C2C12 cells with 100 ng/ml of BMP-4 for the first 30 min of a 3-day culture markedly suppressed myogenic differentiation on day 3 but did not induce ALP activity (Fig. 1, B–E). ALP-positive cells were detected in cultures treated with BMP-4 for longer than 9 h (Fig. 1, B and E). The BMP-4-induced inhibition of myogenic differentiation and induction of osteoblastic differentiation were blocked by Dorsomorphin, a BMP-Smad specific inhibitor, but not by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that the Smad-dependent pathway regulates conversion to differentiation (Fig. 1, F–H, and supplemental Fig. S1). We generated a series of Smad1 mutants, in which one or two serine residues at the carboxyl termini were substituted with aspartic acid or alanine residues (Fig. 2A). Among these Smad1 mutants, Smad1(DVD) exhibited transcriptional activity in a luciferase assay using the ID1 reporter without the addition of BMPs, and this activity was further enhanced by co-transfection with Smad4 (Fig. 2B). NLS-Smad1, in which a nuclear localization signal (NLS) was added to the amino terminus of Smad1, failed to induce luciferase activity. Smad1(DVD) was recognized by the α-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody, even in the absence of a constitutively active BMP receptor, BMPR-IA(Q233D), without affecting endogenous phospho-Smad1/5/8 levels (Fig. 2, C and D). Smad1(DVD) did not exhibit changes in cellular localization or interaction with Smad4 that were distinguishable from wild-type or other Smad1 mutants (Fig. 2, D and E). Injection of synthetic Smad1(DVD) mRNA into the dorsal sides of Xenopus embryos induced ventralization, although Smad1(AVA) did not exhibit this activity (Fig. 2F). The average dorso-anterior index values induced by Smad1(DVD) and Smad1(AVA) were 1.79 and 5.00, respectively, indicating that Smad1(DVD) is a constitutively activated Smad1 in Xenopus embryos as well (Fig. 2G). Transient transfection of Smad1(DVD) in C2C12 cells induced expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers such as ALP, Osteocalcin, Runx2, and Osterix; this was further enhanced by the presence of Smad4 for every marker except Osterix, which might be peaked within 3 days before sample preparation (Fig. 3, A and B). BMPR-IA(Q233D) stimulated ALP activity in cooperation with wild-type Smad1, confirming that Smad1 is a critical substrate of the type I receptor for induction of osteoblastic differentiation (Fig. 3C). However, no synergism was observed between BMPR-IA(Q233D) and any Smad1 mutants, including Smad1(DVD), suggesting that Smad1 mutants are not recognized as substrates by the receptor (Figs. 2C and 3C). Transfection of siRNA against Smad1, Smad4, or a combination of the two reduced the ALP activity induced by BMP-4 or BMPR-IA(Q233D) (Fig. 3, D and E). Similar results were obtained using siRNA against Smad5 (data not shown). The role of Smad proteins in osteoblastic differentiation was further examined using MEFs prepared from Smad4floxed/floxed mice. The MEFs had been infected with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase or EGFP in vitro before being treated with BMP-4. Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in response to BMP-4 was independent of Smad4 (Fig. 4A). In these MEF cultures, the ALP activity induced by BMP-4 was reduced but not eliminated in the Cre-expressing MEFs (Fig. 4B). We further examined the role of Smad4 in osteoblastic differentiation using bone marrow stromal/osteoblastic cells prepared from Smad4floxed/floxed mice. Again, Smad4 was deleted in vitro by infection with an adenovirus expressing Cre, but expression of ALP was not eliminated in these cells; in fact, ALP expression was still induced by BMP-4 in a dose-dependent fashion in Smad4-deleted cultures (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggested that Smad4 is not essential for BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation but that it may enhance BMP signaling. Runx2 is essential for osteoblast differentiation and also interacts with R-Smads (30Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J.

Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad1(DVD) or Runx2 alone induced ALP activity in C2C12 cells, and co-expression of Smad1(DVD) and Runx2 further increased ALP activity (Fig. 5A). In contrast, a dominant-negative form of Runx2 blocked ALP induction by Smad1(DVD) (Fig. 5A). RNAi knockdown of Runx2 reduced numbers of ALP-positive cells in C2C12 cultures induced by BMPR-IA(Q233D) (Fig. 5, B and C). Taken together, these findings suggest that phosphorylated R-Smads and Runx2 may cooperatively induce osteoblast differentiation in response to BMPs. We next examined the roles that the Smad signaling pathway plays in the inhibition of myogenic differentiation by BMPs. Overexpression of Smad1 mutants, including Smad1(DVD), did not inhibit the myogenic differentiation induced by MyoD. Co-transfection of Smad4 with Smad1(DVD) was required to reduce the number of MHC-positive cells (Fig. 6, A and B). This role of Smad4 in myogenic differentiation was confirmed in Smad4floxed/floxed MEFs. The transcriptional activity of MyoD was suppressed by BMP-4 in MEF cultures infected with a control virus (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the basal transcriptional activity of MyoD was increased ∼1.4-fold in MEFs infected with the Cre-expressing adenovirus. This increase was not suppressed by BMP-4, suggesting that Smad4 is essential for the suppression of myogenic differentiation by BMPs (Fig. 6C). This hypothesis was further confirmed using the floxed Smad4 MEF cell line, clone 16. Transient transfection of MyoD in clone 16 induced a small number of MHC-positive cells, which were reduced in number by BMP-4 (Fig. 6, D and E). Infection by Cre-expressing adenovirus not only increased the number of MHC-positive cells, but also maintained this increase in the presence of BMP-4 (Fig. 6, D and E). Transient transfection of Smad4 in Cre-adenovirus-infected cultures restored the suppression of myogenic differentiation in response to BMP-4 (Fig. 6, D and E). Moreover, RNAi knockdown of Smad4 increased the number of MHC-positive cells in C2C12 cell cultures treated with BMP-4 (Fig. 6F). In contrast, knockdown of Smad1 had minimal effects on these cultures (Fig. 6F). Because Smad4 may translocate into the nucleus as a complex with Smad1/5/8 in response to BMP stimulation, we generated NLS-Smad4 and deletion mutants lacking amino-terminal MH1 (NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1)) and carboxyl-terminal MH2 (NLS-Smad4(ΔMH2)) domains, respectively (Fig. 7A). Nuclear localization of these NLS-Smad4 mutants was confirmed, although wild-type Smad4 was mainly detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). Overexpression of full-length NLS-Smad4 suppressed the myogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by MyoD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, C and D, and data not shown). Unexpectedly, NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1), but not NLS-Smad4(ΔMH2), stimulated myogenic differentiation, suggesting that NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1) behaved in a dominant-negative fashion (Fig. 7, C and D). The Smad4 MH2 domain may thus interact with other molecules essential for inhibition of myogenic differentiation. We searched a protein-protein interaction data base that was constructed based on the mammalian two-hybrid method established by the RIKEN group (33Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and found several proteins that formed complexes with Smad4. Among these proteins, we focused on E4F1, which contains six zinc fingers and a ubiquitin E3 ligase domain (Fig. 9A), because it appeared to be one of the transcription factors principally responsible for inhibition of myogenic differentiation by Smad4. FLAG-tagged E4F1 was expressed in nuclei, co-localized with NLS-Smad4, and bound to larger amounts of NLS-Smad4 than wild-type Smad4 (Fig. 8, A and B). Interaction between endogenous Smad4 and FLAG-E4F1 was also detected in C2C12 cells (Fig. 8C). NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1), but not NLS-Smad4(ΔMH2), bound to E4F1, confirming that the complex is formed via the MH2 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 8D). Both wild-type E4F1 and E4F1(ΔE3), but not zinc finger mutants, suppressed myogenic differentiation, suggesting that E4F1 may inhibit myogenesis as a transcription factor rather than as a ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 9B). Although Myogenin is one of the targets of MyoD and is markedly suppressed by BMP signaling, we could not detect Smad4 or E4F1 binding to the Myogenin promoter in response to BMP-4 (supplemental Fig. S2). RNAi knockdown of E4F1 increased the number of MHC-positive C2C12 cells in the presence of BMP signaling (Fig. 9, D and E). Similar results were obtained using a plasmid-based microRNA expression vector for E4F1 (supplemental Fig. S3). We further examined the role of E4F1 in myogenesis in cell line clone 16 established from Smad4floxed/floxed MEFs. Again, deletion of Smad4 by Cre-adenovirus infection increased the number of MyoD-induced MHC- and myogenin-positive myogenic cells (Fig. 9, F and G). Co-transfection of Smad4 and E4F1 markedly reduced the number of myogenic cells, suggesting that E4F1 acts cooperatively with Smad4 (Fig. 9F). Id1–3 suppress myogenesis and are targets of BMP signaling. Transfection of E4f1 increased Id1-, Id2-, and Id3-luc activities in C2C12 cells treated with and without BMP-4 (Fig. 9G, and data not shown). This stimulation by E4F1 seemed to be Smad4 dependent because the activity was lost by Smad4 ablation and restored by Smad4 overexpression in MEF clone 16 (Fig. 9G). In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion of myoblasts by BMPs, allowing their differentiation into osteoblastic cells. It has been suggested that a unique type of intracellular BMP signaling is involved in this conversion, because other inhibitors of myogenic differentiation, such as TGF-β and fibroblast growth factors, do not induce ectopic bone formation in vivo or osteoblastic differentiation in vitro (12Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We found that the inhibition of myogenic differentiation by BMP-4 required treatment for less than 1 h, although induction of osteoblastic differentiation required treatment for more than 9 h. Both activities of BMPs were dependent on the Smad pathway, suggesting that related but distinct mechanisms regulate the conversion of myoblasts into osteoblastic cells. Because we failed to detect cells positive for both MHC and ALP in C2C12 cell cultures treated with BMPs (9Massagué J. Cheifetz S. Endo T. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 8206-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), it appeared that osteoblastic differentiation is activated only in immature myoblasts that have not yet initiated myogenic differentiation (34Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed by our preliminary observation that BMPs did not induce ALP activity in mature multinucleated myotubes. 3J. Nojima, T. Takada, and T. Katagiri, unpublished data. BMP treatment can convert the differentiation pathway of myoblasts into osteoblastic cells and overexpression of constitutively activated BMP type I receptors such as BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and ALK2 can have the same effect without requiring the addition of BMPs (35Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Yamaji N. Yamamoto N. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Wozney J.M. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Fujii M. Takeda K.

However, we found that levels of endogenous Smad1 and Smad5 were low in C2C12 cells and that overexpression of wild-type Smad1 was required for induction of osteoblastic differentiation by BMPR-IA(Q233D). These findings suggested that downstream signaling of BMP type I receptors, rather than BMP type II and co-receptors, plays an important role in the conversion of myoblast differentiation. We established a constitutively activated Smad1, Smad1(DVD), to directly examine the role of the Smad pathway without activation of other signaling pathways induced by BMP receptors, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Serine residues were substituted with aspartic residues in Smad1(DVD) to introduce negative charges in the SVS motif at the carboxyl terminus, the site of phosphorylation by type I BMP receptors. These substitutions may induce conformational changes and stimulate interaction with coactivators such as p300, OAZ, and Runx2 (11Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Indeed, Smad1(DVD) was directly recognized by the α-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody, suggesting that its three-dimensional structure is similar to that of native Smad1 phosphorylated by the receptors. We found that co-transfection of Smad1(DVD) with Smad4 was capable of inducing osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, and this induction was not inhibited by co-expression with Smad7, suggesting that Smad1(DVD) induces activation downstream of BMP type I receptors without activating endogenous BMPs or receptors. However, the ALP activity induced by Smad1(DVD) and Smad4 was lower than that induced by cotransfection of a constitutively activated BMPR-IA receptor and wild-type Smad1, although it was higher than that induced by BMPR-IA(Q233D) alone or Smad1(EVE), in which serine residues had been substituted with glutamic acids instead of aspartic acids. 3J. Nojima, T. Takada, and T. Katagiri, unpublished data. These findings suggested that native phosphorylated Smad1 may have higher affinity for the coactivators required for osteoblastic differentiation than Smad1(DVD) or Smad1(EVE). This hypothesis will require further testing. The Smad signaling pathway was also involved in the inhibition of myogenic differentiation. In contrast to osteoblast differentiation, however, this inhibitory activity of the Smad pathway appeared to be mainly dependent on Smad4 rather than R-Smads. In particular, the nuclear-targeted Smad4 markedly suppressed myogenic differentiation, although overexpression of NLS-Smad4 did not induce osteoblastic differentiation,3 suggesting that Smad4 in complex with R-Smads inhibits myogenic differentiation after translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to BMP stimulation. Because Smad4 is a common Smad among the TGF-β superfamily members, it may also be involved in mediating the effects of other myogenic inhibitors, such as TGF-βs, myostatin, and activin (37McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3168) Google Scholar, 38He L. Vichev K. Macharia R. Huang R. Christ B. Patel K. Amthor H. Anat. Embryol. 2005; 209: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The MH1 and MH2 domains of Smads have been shown to be involved in DNA binding and interaction with other proteins, respectively (39Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our deletion analysis suggested that nuclear Smad4 may interact with other transcriptional factor(s) and recruit them to the target DNA sequences via the MH2 and MH1 domains, respectively, to suppress myogenesis. This hypothesis was further supported by the finding of stimulation of myogenic differentiation by NLS-Smad4(ΔMH1); this mutant Smad4 lacking DNA-binding activity may quench the transcriptional activity of the complex via the MH2 domain. It also appeared that a component of the Smad4 complex, interacting through the MH2 domain, is critical for inhibition of myogenic differentiation in response to BMPs. In the present study, we identified E4F1 as one of the components of the Smad4 complex in the nucleus, interacting through the MH2 domain. E4F1 is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein, identified as a cellular target of viral oncoproteins and shown to regulate the cell cycle (40Le Cam L. Lacroix M. Ciemerych M.A. Sardet C. Sicinski P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6467-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Rooney R.J. Rothammer K. Fernandes E.R.

Our findings indicated that overexpression of E4F1 inhibited myogenic differentiation cooperatively with Smad4. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of E4F1 prevented the inhibition of myogenic differentiation by BMP signaling. Although E4F1 was recently shown to act as a ubiquitin E3 ligase of p53 (43Le Cam L. Linares L.K. Paul C. Julien E. Lacroix M. Hatchi E. Triboulet R. Bossis G. Shmueli A. Rodriguez M.S. Coux O. Sardet C. Cell. 2006; 127: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), our findings indicated that deletion of the ubiquitin E3 ligase domain from E4F1 still allowed inhibition of myogenic differentiation. However, all of the zinc finger structures of E4F1 seemed to be important for this inhibitory activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that Smad4, which undergoes nuclear translocation in response to BMP stimulation, may interact with E4F1 in the nucleus to suppress myogenic differentiation as a transcription factor, independent of its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Recently, it was reported that Smad4 regulates the processing of pri-microRNA into mature microRNA in response to BMP-2 treatment (44Sato M.M. Nashimoto M. Katagiri T. Yawaka Y. Tamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The direct target gene(s) of the complex still needs to be identified. It is interesting to note that loss-of-function mutations of p53 and Smad4 were identified in some tumors, suggesting that mutations in the Smad4-E4F1-p53 axis might play a role in tumorigenesis (45Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3653) Google Scholar, 46Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). We found that E4F1 stimulated the expression of Id1–3 in the presence of Smad4. Id proteins inhibit myogenesis and are targets of BMP signaling. Recently, insufficient skeletal muscle repair was reported in Id1+/−Id3−/− mice after muscle injury (47Clever J.L. Sakai Y. Wang R.A. Schneider D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; (10.1152/ajpcell.00388.2009)PubMed Google Scholar). BMP signaling may also up-regulate Id expression in healing muscle tissue (47Clever J.L. Sakai Y. Wang R.A. Schneider D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; (10.1152/ajpcell.00388.2009)PubMed Google Scholar). Because expression of Ids leads to cell cycle progression, the E4F1-induced Ids may suppress myogenic differentiation and maintain myoblast proliferation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the physiological roles of Smads and E4F1 in muscle development and regeneration in vivo. In the present study, we obtained an unexpected finding related to Smads. BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation was not completely blocked in the Smad4-deleted MEFs. There are some possible explanations for this finding: 1) undetectable levels of Smad4 still remained in the MEFs expressing Cre recombinase, 2) an alternative pathway, including a novel Co-Smad, transduced BMP signaling, or 3) Smad4 is not essential for the osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMPs. Recently, evidence has been presented that bone and cartilage tissues were formed during development in the absence of functional Smad4 in mice, although such mice exhibited abnormalities (48Tan X. Weng T. Zhang J. Wang J. Li W. Wan H. Lan Y. Cheng X. Hou N. Liu H. Ding J. Lin F. Yang R. Gao X. Chen D. Yang X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Deletion of Smad4 in mouse mature osteoblasts using a Cre-loxP system significantly reduced bone volume and osteoblast function in vivo, but they still had bone tissues and osteoblasts (48Tan X. Weng T. Zhang J. Wang J. Li W. Wan H. Lan Y. Cheng X. Hou N. Liu H. Ding J. Lin F. Yang R. Gao X. Chen D. Yang X. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Further study will be required to elucidate the roles of Smad4 in bone metabolism. In conclusion, we found that the Smad-dependent pathway regulates both the inhibition of myogenic differentiation and the induction of osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMPs. The introduction of negative charges at the carboxyl terminus of Smad1 may play an important role in the induction of osteoblast differentiation in response to BMPs. In contrast, nuclear Smad4, rather than R-Smad, and E4F1, a novel partner of nuclear Smad4, are responsible for the inhibition of myogenic differentiation by BMPs. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1981170856,"Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a zoonotic disease that persists throughout much of the world in livestock, wildlife, and secondarily infects humans. This is true across much of Central Asia, and particularly the Steppe region, including Kazakhstan. This study employed the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the current and future geographic distribution of Bacillus anthracis in Kazakhstan based on the A2 and B2 IPCC SRES climate change scenarios using a 5-variable data set at 55 km(2) and 8 km(2) and a 6-variable BioClim data set at 8 km(2). Future models suggest large areas predicted under current conditions may be reduced by 2050 with the A2 model predicting approximately 14-16% loss across the three spatial resolutions. There was greater variability in the B2 models across scenarios predicting approximately 15% loss at 55 km(2), approximately 34% loss at 8 km(2), and approximately 30% loss with the BioClim variables. Only very small areas of habitat expansion into new areas were predicted by either A2 or B2 in any models. Greater areas of habitat loss are predicted in the southern regions of Kazakhstan by A2 and B2 models, while moderate habitat loss is also predicted in the northern regions by either B2 model at 8 km(2). Anthrax disease control relies mainly on livestock vaccination and proper carcass disposal, both of which require adequate surveillance. In many situations, including that of Kazakhstan, vaccine resources are limited, and understanding the geographic distribution of the organism, in tandem with current data on livestock population dynamics, can aid in properly allocating doses. While speculative, contemplating future changes in livestock distributions and B. anthracis spore promoting environments can be useful for establishing future surveillance priorities. This study may also have broader applications to global public health surveillance relating to other diseases in addition to B. anthracis."

https://openalex.org/W2039223209,"Background Developing effective conservation plans for multi-functional landscapes requires an accurate knowledge of the relative conservation value of different land-uses. A growing number of tropical ecologists have evaluated conservation value using the number (or proportion) of species that are unique to primary or old-growth forests. However, estimates of the conservation value of modified land-uses may be inflated by the presence of occasional species (e.g. singletons and doubletons) that may be unable to exist as viable populations in isolation. Methodology/Principal Findings We use a unique 15-taxa dataset from a mixed-use forest landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the hypothesis that the removal of occasional species from sample data can increase estimates of the value of primary forest for biodiversity conservation. Conclusions/Significance Estimates of conservation value that are based on the proportion of species that are unique to tropical primary or old-growth forests are highly sensitive to decisions researchers make regarding the inclusion or exclusion of occasional species. By removing singletons from modified forest samples, and considering only those species known to occur in primary forest, we almost double estimates of the conservation value of tropical primary forests."
https://openalex.org/W1981069211,"Given the importance of Jak2 in cell signaling, a critical role for Jak2 in immune cells especially dendritic cells (DCs) has long been proposed. The exact function for Jak2 in DCs, however, remained poorly understood as Jak2 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality. Here we established Jak2 deficiency in adult Cre+/+Jak2fl/fl mice by tamoxifen induction. Loss of Jak2 significantly impaired DC development as manifested by reduced BMDC yield, smaller spleen size and reduced percentage of DCs in total splenocytes. Jak2 was also crucial for the capacity of DCs to mediate innate immune response. Jak2−/− DCs were less potent in response to inflammatory stimuli and showed reduced capacity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-12. As a result, Jak2−/− mice were defective for the early clearance of Listeria after infection. However, their potency to mediate adaptive immune response was not affected. Unlike DCs, Jak2−/− macrophages showed similar capacity secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that Jak2 selectively modulates innate immune response in a DC-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, Jak2−/− mice were remarkably resistant to lethal dose of LPS-induced septic shock, a deadly sepsis characterized by the excessive innate immune response, and adoptive transfer of normal DCs restored their susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock. Mechanistic studies revealed that Jak2/SATA5 signaling is pivotal for DC development and maturation, while the capacity for DCs secretion of proinflammatory cytokines is regulated by both Jak2/STAT5 and Jak2/STAT6 signaling."

We have recently demonstrated that this pore-forming toxin provokes distinct shrinkage and crenation before it finally leads to swelling and lysis of erythrocytes. The present study documents the underlying mechanism for this severe volume reduction. We show that HlyA-induced shrinkage and crenation of human erythrocytes occur subsequent to a significant rise in [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 (or Gardos channel) is essential for the initial shrinkage, because both clotrimazole and TRAM-34 prevent the shrinkage and potentiate hemolysis produced by HlyA. Notably, the recently described Ca2+-activated Cl− channel TMEM16A contributes substantially to HlyA-induced cell volume reduction. Erythrocytes isolated from TMEM16A−/− mice showed significantly attenuated crenation and increased lysis compared with controls. Additionally, we found that HlyA leads to acute exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This exposure was considerably reduced by KCa3.1 antagonists. In conclusion, this study shows that HlyA triggers acute erythrocyte shrinkage, which depends on Ca2+-activated efflux of K+ via KCa3.1 and Cl− via TMEM16A, with subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This sequential shrinkage and swelling was observed in single cells as an initial crenation, followed by swelling/spherocyte formation before the final lysis (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The initial volume decrease induced by HlyA is surprising because it implies that insertion of the pore results in a net ion efflux rather than an influx. Because K+ quantitatively is the most important intracellular cation, this effectively means that the K+ efflux during the shrinkage is larger than the Na+ influx. This notion is supported by the large K+ efflux, which can be observed within 1–2 min after HlyA addition (2Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jorgensen S.E. Mulcahy P.F. Wu G.K. Louis C.F. Toxicon. 1983; 21: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because HlyA is a nonselective pore, permeable to both mono- and divalent cations (6Menestrina G. Pederzolli C. Dalla Serra M. Bregante M. Gambale F. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is unlikely to show a preference for K+ over Na+. Human erythrocytes have a resting membrane potential of approximately −5 to −10 mV (7Hoffman J.F. Laris P.C. J. Physiol. 1974; 239: 519-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which is close to the reversal potential of any nonselective cation channel. Thus, it is very hard to imagine that insertion of a nonselective pore per se would result in a selective K+ conductance. This would require either a selectivity of the pore and/or a favorable driving force for K+ over Na+. Therefore, we speculated that insertion of HlyA pores activates K+ and possibly Cl− selective ion channels natively present in the erythrocytes. This activation could be responsible for the observed HlyA-induced volume reduction, a process that potentially will protect the erythrocytes against immediate lysis.We here investigate the underlying mechanism for the marked HlyA-induced volume reduction of red blood cells. We were able to show that HlyA-induced shrinkage is a consequence of a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which triggers activation of K+ channels (KCa3.1/Gardos channel) and Cl− channels (TMEM16A), with a subsequent exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the membrane. Because macrophages recognize and phagocytose PS exposing erythrocytes, the early volume regulations may be important for removal of HlyA-damaged erythrocytes from the bloodstream.DISCUSSIONE. coli HlyA is well known to lyse erythrocytes by creating ∼2-nm pores in the plasma membrane that allow influx of cations and water (1Cavalieri S.J. Bohach G.A. Snyder I.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 326-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Menestrina G. Gray L. Hugo F. Seeger W. Holland I.B. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1988; 4: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that HlyA-induced lysis requires ATP release and P2 receptor activation (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and thus, the effect of HlyA pore insertion is amplified through purinergic signaling. We also observed that HlyA-induced lysis is a sequential process of initial shrinkage and crenation of human and murine erythrocytes, followed by swelling and lysis. In the present study, we investigated and defined the mechanism of HlyA-induced erythrocyte shrinkage.By DIC imaging, we confirmed our previous finding that HlyA initially induces pronounced crenation of human red blood cells (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We were able to substantiate that these HlyA-induced erythrocyte shape changes corresponded to cellular volume reductions by flow cytometry. HlyA triggered a marked decrease in FSC, reflecting a reduction of cell size and a simultaneous rise in SSC. Side scatter normally reports about the number of refraction surfaces of the cell as it passes through the laser beam and thus conveys information about the morphological complexity of the given cell. It has been established that cell volume reduction is proportional to an increased wide angle light scatter (10McManus M. Fischbarg J. Sun A. Hebert S. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C562-C570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is equivalent to the SSC in the flow cytometer. The combination of a reduction in FSC and a rise in SSC has previously been used to identify volume reduction in erythrocytes after exposure to Ca2+ ionophores (14Bratosin D. Estaquier J. Petit F. Arnoult D. Quatannens B. Tissier J.P. Slomianny C. Sartiaux C. Alonso C. Huart J.J. Montreuil J. Ameisen J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 16Lang K.S. Duranton C. Poehlmann H. Myssina S. Bauer C. Lang F. Wieder T. Huber S.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The changes we observed in FSC and SSC occur simultaneously with cell shape changes observed on the microscope. Thus, we take these combined changes in SSC and FSC as an indication of erythrocyte shrinkage and crenation.Because Ca2+ ionophores are known to trigger comparable changes in light scattering (14Bratosin D. Estaquier J. Petit F. Arnoult D. Quatannens B. Tissier J.P. Slomianny C. Sartiaux C. Alonso C. Huart J.J. Montreuil J. Ameisen J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and crenation (17Sarkadi B. Szász I. Gárdos G. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 26: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Borgers M. Thone F.J. Xhonneux B.J. De Clerck F.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we investigated whether HlyA caused a rise in [Ca2+]i. Flow cytometry of fluo 4-loaded human erythrocytes clearly showed that HlyA was able to produce an increase in [Ca2+]i, supporting earlier studies showing that HlyA produces an influx of Ca2+ (3Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Menestrina G. Gray L. Hugo F. Seeger W. Holland I.B. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1988; 4: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Menestrina G. Pederzolli C. Dalla Serra M. Bregante M. Gambale F. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, there was a clear correlation between erythrocytes with elevated [Ca2+]i and reduced cell volume. By studying fluo 4-loaded single erythrocytes with [Ca2+]i imaging, the [Ca2+]i evidently rose prior to the cell shrinkage. To our knowledge, this is the first report of [Ca2+]i changes preceding shrinkage of erythrocytes. In addition, the single cell [Ca2+]i measurements indicate that HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i increase is an all-or-none response. Either the cells showed a marked rise in [Ca2+]i, or the cells seemed completely unaffected by HlyA. Only on rare occasions were fluctuating [Ca2+]i levels observed in single cells. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that only one or very few toxin molecules are necessary to trigger the cell damaging effects, supporting earlier studies (19Short E.C. Kurtz H.J. Infect. Immun. 1971; 3: 678-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jorgensen S.E. Hammer R.F. Wu G.K. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 988-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The precise Ca2+ entry mechanism for HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i changes has not been settled. It is, however, very likely that Ca2+ enters the cell through HlyA itself because it has a significant Ca2+ conductance (5Jorgensen S.E. Mulcahy P.F. Wu G.K. Louis C.F. Toxicon. 1983; 21: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Jorgensen S.E. Hammer R.F. Wu G.K. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 988-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ could also potentially enter through nonselective cation channels such as TRPC6 (21Foller M. Kasinathan R.S. Koka S. Lang C. Shumilina E. Birnbaumer L. Lang F. Huber S.M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2008; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), P2X receptors (22Sluyter R. Shemon A.N. Wiley J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), or via pannexin 1 channels (23Locovei S. Bao L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7655-7659Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), where the latter two are known to be activated upon HlyA exposure (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).HlyA inflicts a substantial loss of K+, which starts shortly after the erythrocytes have been subjected to the toxin (2Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jorgensen S.E. Mulcahy P.F. Wu G.K. Louis C.F. Toxicon. 1983; 21: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Part of the total cellular K+ loss results from lysis. However, the initial K+ efflux, which occurs before there is substantial cell lysis, is likely to cause the extensive volume reduction seen in the early phases of HlyA-induced hemolysis. This resembles what has been observed with Ca2+ ionophores (17Sarkadi B. Szász I. Gárdos G. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 26: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24White J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1974; 77: 507-518PubMed Google Scholar). A good candidate for an activated K+ efflux pathway is the KCa3.1 channel (SK4 or Gardos channel); the only Ca2+-activated K+ channel known to be present in erythrocytes (25Hoffman J.F. Joiner W. Nehrke K. Potapova O. Foye K. Wickrema A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7366-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Begenisich T. Nakamoto T. Ovitt C.E. Nehrke K. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47681-47687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Activation of this channel causes erythrocyte dehydration, a mechanism crucial for sickle formation in sickle cell anemia (27Lew V.L. Tiffert T. Etzion Z. Perdomo D. Daw N. Macdonald L. Bookchin R.M. Blood. 2005; 105: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In line with this, we found that inhibitors of KCa3.1, clotrimazole, and TRAM-34 blocked the HlyA-induced shrinkage. This is consistent with reduced Ca2+ ionophore-induced erythrocyte shrinkage in KCa3.1-deficient mice (28Grgic I. Kaistha B.P. Paschen S. Kaistha A. Busch C. Si H. Köhler K. Elsässer H.P. Hoyer J. Köhler R. Pflugers Arch. 2009; 458: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to conclude that the HlyA-induced shrinkage is caused by Ca2+-activated K+ efflux through KCa3.1 channels. Preventing the cell volume reduction inflicted by KCa3.1 channels by either clotrimazole or TRAM-34 clearly potentiated the hemolysis induced by HlyA. This supports previous data showing that KCa3.1−/− mice are more susceptible to osmotically (28Grgic I. Kaistha B.P. Paschen S. Kaistha A. Busch C. Si H. Köhler K. Elsässer H.P. Hoyer J. Köhler R. Pflugers Arch. 2009; 458: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and α-toxin-induced hemolysis (29Huber S.M. Foller M. Koka S. Boini K.M. Shumilina E. Mahmud H. Ruth P. Sausbier M. Lang F. Acta Physiol. 2008; 192 (abstr.): 54Google Scholar). Thus, our data support that cell shrinkage is a protective mechanism to avoid acute lysis. Cellular K+ efflux occurs concomitantly with anion efflux, and erythrocytes do have a significant resting Cl− conductance (11Hunter M.J. J. Physiol. 1977; 268: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Knauf P.A. Fuhrmann G.F. Rothstein S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 363-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that a substantial increase in K+ efflux might require activation of additional Cl− channels, which could implicate the function of a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel in erythrocytes.The poor selectivity of Cl− channel antagonist makes it difficult to dissect eventual activation of an additional Cl− conductive pathway during HlyA-induced erythrocyte shrinkage. Nonselective Cl− channel blockers such as NPPB and niflumic acid have been shown to counteract the Ca2+ ionophore-induced cell shrinkage in human erythrocytes (30Myssina S. Lang P.A. Kempe D.S. Kaiser S. Huber S.M. Wieder T. Lang F. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 14: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, the protein TMEM16A (or ANO1) has been substantiated as a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel and has been shown to play a role in volume regulation of colonic epithelial and salivary acinar cells (13Almaça J. Tian Y. Aldehni F. Ousingsawat J. Kongsuphol P. Rock J.R. Harfe B.D. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28571-28578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared TMEM16A−/− versus TMEM16A+/+ murine erythrocytes from newborn littermates. Erythrocytes from TMEM16A−/− mice showed a significantly lower level of HlyA-induced shrinkage compared with TMEM16A+/+. As a consequence, lysis of TMEM16A−/− erythrocytes occurs much faster than TMEM16A+/+ controls. The TMEM16A−/− cells were still able to shrink and thus, not surprisingly other anion channels contribute overall volume reduction. Our data do, however, point to a significant role of TMEM16A for HlyA-induced volume regulation and lysis in murine erythrocytes. In further support of these data, we found that niflumic acid potentiated HlyA-induced hemolysis of murine erythrocytes. Because CFTR has been proposed to be implicated in Gd3+-induced hemolysis (31Stumpf A. Wenners-Epping K. Wälte M. Lange T. Koch H.G. Häberle J. Dübbers A. Falk S. Kiesel L. Nikova D. Bruns R. Bertram H. Oberleithner H. Schillers H. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2006; 17: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we tested whether this is also the case for HlyA-induced hemolysis but found no difference in response to HlyA in CFTR−/− and CFTR+/+ erythrocytes.Studies have shown that bacterial toxins such as listeriolysin from Listeria monocytogenes and the hemolysin from Vibrio parahemolyticus provoke shrinkage of erythrocytes and/or PS exposure (32Föller M. Shumilina E. Lam R. Mohamed W. Kasinathan R. Huber S. Chakraborty T. Lang F. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Lang P.A. Kaiser S. Myssina S. Birka C. Weinstock C. Northoff H. Wieder T. Lang F. Huber S.M. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In agreement, we found that HlyA triggers significant annexin V binding (which indicates PS exposure) in erythrocytes. The HlyA-induced PS exposure was considerably diminished, when the erythrocyte shrinkage was prevented by inhibition of the Ca2+ activated K+ channel, KCa3.1. This means that KCa3.1 channel-activation is likely to precede the increase in PS exposure. This finding is supported by an earlier study that showed reduced ionomycin-induced PS exposure in human erythrocytes exposed to KCa3.1 antagonists (15Lang P.A. Kaiser S. Myssina S. Wieder T. Lang F. Huber S.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1553-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be mentioned that P2X7 receptor activation alone is enough to trigger PS exposure in human erythrocytes (22Sluyter R. Shemon A.N. Wiley J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our previous study established that P2X7 receptors are activated by HlyA insertion in the erythrocyte membrane and that P2X7 receptor activation is required for lysis of human erythrocytes induced by this toxin (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Jorgensen et al. (20Jorgensen S.E. Hammer R.F. Wu G.K. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 988-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed small surface projections within 5 min of HlyA exposure similar to the membrane blebbing seen after P2X7 receptor activation in lymphocytes (34Taylor S.R. Gonzalez-Begne M. Dewhurst S. Chimini G. Higgins C.F. Melvin J.E. Elliott J.I. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings could imply a role for P2 receptor signaling in HlyA-induced volume regulation, but this requires further investigation.The KCa3.1- and TMEM16A-mediated volume reduction and the associated PS exposure are interesting in the context of erythrocyte recognition by macrophages and elimination from the circulation. Through the clear correlation between PS exposure, cell size, and cell age, it has been shown that macrophages use specific detection of PS exposure to eliminate senescent erythrocytes from the circulation (35Connor J. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Schroit A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 3184-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Connor J. Pak C.C. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2399-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acute damage to the erythrocytes by Ca2+ ionophores, energy depletion, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, and malaria infections provoke shrinkage of erythrocytes and/or PS exposure (16Lang K.S. Duranton C. Poehlmann H. Myssina S. Bauer C. Lang F. Wieder T. Huber S.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 32Föller M. Shumilina E. Lam R. Mohamed W.

Thus, it seems that both senescent and acutely damaged red blood cells are eliminated through the same pathway, and we speculate that KCa3.1 and TMEM16A activation allow early recognition and removal of erythrocytes attacked by HlyA. Previous studies have shown that erythrocytes from septic patients show severe signs of volume reduction and crenation (40Piagnerelli M. Zouaoui Boudjeltia K. Brohee D. Vereerstraeten A. Piro P.

Med. 2007; 9: 143-149Crossref Google Scholar) and PS exposure (42Kempe D.S. Akel A. Lang P.A. Hermle T. Biswas R. Muresanu J. Friedrich B. Dreischer P. Wolz C. Schumacher U. Peschel A. Gotz F. Doring G. Wieder T. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Patients that survive fulminate sepsis usually present with some degree of anemia, which is partially a consequence of intravascular hemolysis and partially the result of selective removal of damaged red blood cells (42Kempe D.S. Akel A. Lang P.A. Hermle T. Biswas R. Muresanu J. Friedrich B. Dreischer P. Wolz C. Schumacher U. Peschel A. Gotz F. Doring G. Wieder T. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).Taken together, the present study implies that the process of hemolysis induced by HlyA from E. coli is biphasic. Initially, HlyA triggers extensive cellular shape changes and volume reduction. These changes are the consequence of increments in [Ca2+]i, which result in KCa3.1 and TMEM16A activation and are accompanied by increased PS exposure. This mechanism might be essential for the recognition and removal of HlyA-inserted erythrocytes from the circulation, thereby avoiding intravascular hemolysis during Gram-negative sepsis. Introductionα-Hemolysin (HlyA) 2The abbreviations used are: HlyAα-hemolysinPSphosphatidylserineDICdifferential interference contrastFSCforward scatterSSCside scatter. produced by Escherichia coli is one of the key virulence factors released by invading E. coli strains. HlyA inserts into the plasma membrane and makes the cells permeable to cations and water (1Cavalieri S.J. Bohach G.A. Snyder I.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 326-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Menestrina G. Gray L. Hugo F. Seeger W. Holland I.B. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1988; 4: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In erythrocytes, this increase in ion permeability has been established to result in swelling and ultimately lysis. We have recently discovered that the full hemolytic process requires purinergic signaling, because extracellular ATP scavenging and P2 receptor blockage completely abolished HlyA-induced hemolysis. Additionally, the HlyA-induced swelling and lysis is preceded by a substantial volume reduction in human and murine erythrocytes (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This sequential shrinkage and swelling was observed in single cells as an initial crenation, followed by swelling/spherocyte formation before the final lysis (4Skals M. Jorgensen N.R. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The initial volume decrease induced by HlyA is surprising because it implies that insertion of the pore results in a net ion efflux rather than an influx. Because K+ quantitatively is the most important intracellular cation, this effectively means that the K+ efflux during the shrinkage is larger than the Na+ influx. This notion is supported by the large K+ efflux, which can be observed within 1–2 min after HlyA addition (2Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jorgensen S.E. Mulcahy P.F. Wu G.K. Louis C.F. Toxicon. 1983; 21: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because HlyA is a nonselective pore, permeable to both mono- and divalent cations (6Menestrina G. Pederzolli C. Dalla Serra M. Bregante M. Gambale F. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is unlikely to show a preference for K+ over Na+. Human erythrocytes have a resting membrane potential of approximately −5 to −10 mV (7Hoffman J.F. Laris P.C. J. Physiol. 1974; 239: 519-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which is close to the reversal potential of any nonselective cation channel. Thus, it is very hard to imagine that insertion of a nonselective pore per se would result in a selective K+ conductance. This would require either a selectivity of the pore and/or a favorable driving force for K+ over Na+. Therefore, we speculated that insertion of HlyA pores activates K+ and possibly Cl− selective ion channels natively present in the erythrocytes. This activation could be responsible for the observed HlyA-induced volume reduction, a process that potentially will protect the erythrocytes against immediate lysis.We here investigate the underlying mechanism for the marked HlyA-induced volume reduction of red blood cells. We were able to show that HlyA-induced shrinkage is a consequence of a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which triggers activation of K+ channels (KCa3.1/Gardos channel) and Cl− channels (TMEM16A), with a subsequent exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the membrane. Because macrophages recognize and phagocytose PS exposing erythrocytes, the early volume regulations may be important for removal of HlyA-damaged erythrocytes from the bloodstream."
https://openalex.org/W2042003147,"The discovery of copy number variations (CNV) in the human genome opened new perspectives on the study of the genetic causes of inherited disorders and the aetiology of common diseases. Here, a single-cell-level investigation of CNV in different human tissues led us to uncover the phenomenon of mitotically derived genomic mosaicism, which is stable in different cell types of one individual. The CNV mosaic ratios were different between the 10 individuals studied. However, they were stable in the T lymphocytes, immortalized B lymphoblastoid cells, and skin fibroblasts analyzed in each individual. Because these cell types have a common origin in the connective tissues, we suggest that mitotic changes in CNV regions may happen early during embryonic development and occur only once, after which the stable mosaic ratio is maintained throughout the differentiated tissues. This concept is further supported by a unique study of immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained with 20 year difference from two subjects. We provide the first evidence of somatic mosaicism for CNV, with stable variation ratios in different cell types of one individual leading to the hypothesis of early embryonic chromosome instability resulting in stable mosaic pattern in human tissues. This concept has the potential to open new perspectives in personalized genetic diagnostics and can explain genetic phenomena like diminished penetrance in autosomal dominant diseases.

The identification of selective inhibitors of c-KIT, such as imatinib, has provided a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of this chemotherapy refractory tumor. However, despite the clinical importance of these findings and the potential it provides as a model system for understanding targeted therapy, this approach has not yielded curative outcomes in most patients, and the biochemical pathways connecting c-KIT inhibition to cell death are not completely understood. Here, we show that inhibition of c-KIT with imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) triggered the up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein BIM via both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. The inhibition of c-KIT by imatinib increased levels of the dephosphorylated and deubiquitinated form of BIM as well as triggered the accumulation of the transcription factor FOXO3a on the BIM promoter to activate transcription of BIM mRNA. Furthermore, using RNA interference directed against BIM, we demonstrated that BIM knockdown attenuated the effects of imatinib, suggesting that BIM functionally contributes to imatinib-induced apoptosis in GIST. The identification and characterization of the pathways that mediate imatinib-induced cell death in GIST provide for a better understanding of targeted therapy and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to further exploit these pathways.

Therapies that selectively target essential molecular pathways of cancer cells possess the potential to increase the effectiveness of therapy while decreasing the side effects associated with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. One example that has evoked considerable interest in both the laboratory and clinic is the identification in GI stromal tumors of activating mutations in the c-KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) receptor tyrosine kinase gene coupled with the development of targeted c-KIT inhibitors such as imatinib (1Tuveson D.A.

While surgical resection of localized disease can be curative, GISTs are poorly responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and for metastatic disease, there were few therapeutic options prior to the advent of targeted c-KIT therapies (2Quek R.

However, although ∼80% of patients with metastatic GIST respond to imatinib therapy, responses are rarely complete, and patients eventually progress on therapy, often due to the development of secondary, imatinib-resistant c-KIT mutations (3Verweij J.

Accordingly, the key downstream mediators of imatinib-induced cell death in GISTs remain incompletely understood. While imatinib inhibition of c-KIT has been shown to down-regulate survival pathways downstream from c-KIT, such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK (5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), other effects of imatinib have also been identified such as soluble histone H2AX up-regulation (6Liu Y. Tseng M.

Identifying and characterizing the pathways that mediate imatinib-induced cell death may facilitate the development of synergistic therapies to increase the effectiveness of imatinib as well as salvage therapies to overcome imatinib resistance. Although there are undoubtedly a number of different biochemical mediators of imatinib-induced cell death, a wide variety of cellular stress or damage signals can converge on the programmed cell death or apoptotic pathway. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is controlled by the interactions of pro- and antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins and culminates with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases (9Brunelle J.K. Letai A. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that modulating this balance between the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway may also be important for the mechanism of action of imatinib in GIST therapy. UO126 was purchased from Calbiochem, and imatinib was purchased from LC Laboratories. The pCMV6.BIM-FLAG vector was obtained from Origene. The GIST 882 and 48 cell lines (kindly provided by J. A. Fletcher, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), were cultured as described previously (1Tuveson D.A. Willis N.A. Jacks T. Griffin J.D. Singer S. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Demetri G.D.

BIM, Bad, and control (nontargeting) siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon. Subconfluent GIST 882 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 5 nm siRNA in RPMI 1640 medium with Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 4 h of incubation, the medium was changed back to the complete culture medium but with only 5% fetal bovine serum. Imatinib or DMSO was added 24 h after transfection, and after the prescribed incubation period, either whole-cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis, or cell viability was assessed with the CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay (Promega). GIST 882 and 48 cells were transfected with pCMV6.BIM-FLAG vector using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, cell viability was assessed with the CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay (Promega). Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 100 ng total RNA, Quantiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen), and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system. The primers used were 5′-TTGTGGCTCTGTCTGTAGGGAGGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCTGAGTGTGACCGAGAAGGTA-3′ (antisense) for BIM and 5′-CTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGAAAGACACCCACCTTGATCT-3′ (antisense) for β-actin. All reactions were run in triplicate, and the relative expression of BIM was calculated by normalizing BIM mRNA expression to β-actin mRNA expression. GIST 882 cells, transfected with BIM or control siRNA as described above, were grown in 96-well plates. After incubation with imatinib or DMSO for the prescribed amount of time, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess apoptosis, GIST 882 cells were treated with imatinib or DMSO for the prescribed period of time. Cells were then trypsinized and subsequently stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and analyzed on a FACSCalibur machine. Viable cells were annexin V- and propidium iodide-negative. Whole-cell lysis was performed at 4 °C for 15 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies were used to detect the following proteins: BIM (BD Pharmingen), PUMA (Cell Signaling), NOXA (Cell Signaling), BID (Cell Signaling), Bad (Cell Signaling), MCL-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), BCL-2 (Cell Signaling), BCL-xL (Cell Signaling), BAX (Cell Signaling), tubulin (Sigma), cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signaling), FKHRL1/FOXO3a (Millipore), phospho-FKHRL1/FOXO3a (Ser253; Millipore), phospho-FKHRL1/FOXO3a (Ser32; Millipore), phospho-BIM (Ser69; Cell Signaling), p44/42 MAPK (Erk 1/2; Cell Signaling), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling), ubiquitin (Cell Signaling), and FLAG (Sigma).

Chem. 2006; 281: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, whole-cell lysates (∼1000 μg) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of either anti-BIM antibody (BD Pharmingen) or normal rabbit IgG in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) containing Protein A/G-agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. Western blots were performed as described above, with an antibody directed against ubiquitin (Cell Signaling). GIST 882 cells were grown in 10-cm plates until they were ∼95% confluent and then either treated with 1 μm imatinib for 48 h or left untreated. Cells were fixed with formalin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with an antibody directed against FOXO3a as described (11Essafi A. Fernández de Mattos S. Hassen Y.A. Soeiro I. Mufti G.J. Thomas N.S. Medema R.H. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2317-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Subsequent PCR with primers for either BIM promoter or downstream BIM coding sequence, as a control for DNA fragmentation size, was also performed as described (11Essafi A. Fernández de Mattos S. Hassen Y.A. Soeiro I. Mufti G.J. Thomas N.S. Medema R.H. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2317-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (1Tuveson D.A. Willis N.A. Jacks T. Griffin J.D. Singer S. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Demetri G.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5054-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), inhibition of c-KIT with imatinib induced apoptosis in a time-dependent fashion in the GIST 882 cell line, which harbors a homozygous, imatinib-sensitive K642E c-KIT mutation (Fig. 1A). To investigate the role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in this response to imatinib, we examined the expression of a number of different pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member proteins following treatment with imatinib or DMSO control (Fig. 1B). Notably, the proapoptotic factor BIM showed a rapid and sustained up-regulation following imatinib treatment. In addition to increased expression, the relative electrophoretic migration of BIM also increased, with a striking change already observed at the earliest time point analyzed (8 h; Fig. 1B). No other apoptotic factor that we probed exhibited as significant a perturbation following imatinib treatment (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Similar up-regulation of BIM was observed following treatment of the GIST 48 cell line with imatinib (supplemental Fig. S1A). The GIST 48 cell line exhibits moderate sensitivity to imatinib as it contains a homozygous, imatinib-sensitive, exon 11 mutation and a heterozygous, imatinib-resistant, exon 17 mutation (5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of BIM knockdown on imatinib-induced cell death. Knockdown of another BCL-2 family member, Bad, was also performed as a control as it is another proapoptotic factor but did not show up-regulation by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The siRNAs directed against both BIM and Bad gave efficient knockdown of their respective targets, although despite optimization, slight up-regulation of BIM still occurred following imatinib treatment. After siRNA transfection, the GIST 882 cells were treated with imatinib and assessed for apoptosis by immunoblotting for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 2A) and for viability by an ATP-based proliferation assay (Fig. 2B). Imatinib-induced effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation were both attenuated by BIM knockdown (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that BIM up-regulation is measurably contributing to imatinib-induced apoptosis in GIST 882. Similar results were obtained with the GIST 48 cell line (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). The lack of complete abrogation of imatinib-induced effects may, in part, be due to the slight imatinib-induced up-regulation of BIM despite efficient knockdown but also indicates that other mechanisms besides BIM may be important for imatinib-induced cell death. To further strengthen the role of BIM in imatinib-induced cell death, either BIM or green fluorescent protein, as a control, were overexpressed in GIST 882 and 48 cells and viability assessed after 36 h (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). For both cell lines, BIM overexpression resulted in significant cell death relative to green fluorescent protein control (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1, D and E) and provides further evidence that BIM can cause apoptosis in GIST cell lines. The MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways can regulate BIM mRNA expression and protein stability, respectively (11Essafi A. Fernández de Mattos S. Hassen Y.A. Soeiro I. Mufti G.J. Thomas N.S. Medema R.H. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2317-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 12Hübner A. Barrett T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It seemed likely that either pathway may be participating in imatinib-induced BIM up-regulation in GIST 882 as it has been previously shown that imatinib inhibition of c-KIT causes down-regulation of both the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways (5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Erk1/2, of the MAPK pathway, can phosphorylate BIM and target it for rapid proteasomal degradation (12Hübner A. Barrett T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Luciano F. Jacquel A. Colosetti P. Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the amount of phospho-BIM relative to total BIM significantly decreased following imatinib treatment of GIST 882 cells (Fig. 3A). Also consistent with the dephosphorylation of BIM, the relative electrophoretic migration of BIM increased following either imatinib treatment or treatment of whole-cell lysates with λ-phosphatase (Figs. 1B and 3A). Furthermore, treatment of GIST 882 with the MAPK pathway inhibitor UO126 caused a similar shift in the electrophoretic migration of BIM (Fig. 3B). Finally, BIM co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with ubiquitin antibody demonstrated that the amount of monoubiquitinated BIM decreases after 24 h of imatinib treatment, despite an overall increase in BIM levels (Fig. 3C). Proteosome inhibitors altered the level of c-KIT and, accordingly, were not used in this experiment (data not shown) (14Bauer S. Parry J.A. Muhlenberg T. Brown M.F. Seneviratne D. Chatterjee P. Chin A. Rubin B.P. Kuan S.F. Fletcher J.A. Duensing S. Duensing A. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in GIST 882, the inhibition of c-KIT and subsequent down-regulation of the MAPK pathway increased levels of the dephosphorylated, deubiquitinated, and proteasome-resistant form of BIM. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that BIM up-regulation following imatinib treatment also occurred at the mRNA level (Fig. 4A). It has been previously shown that when the transcription factor FOXO3a is phosphorylated, it is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in the down-regulation of the transcription of target genes including BIM (15Fu Z. Tindall D.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2312-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As imatinib inhibition of c-KIT in GIST causes down-regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway (5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which, in turn, can phosphorylate FOXO3a, we evaluated whether the FOXO3a transcription factor could be involved in the induction of BIM. Treatment of GIST 882 with imatinib significantly decreased levels of the inactive, phosphorylated form of FOXO3a (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the unchanged levels of total FOXO3a suggest an increase in the dephosphorylated, active form of FOXO3a. To confirm this increase in active FOXO3a, we next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FOXO3a antibody both before and after treatment with imatinib. As shown in Fig. 4C, treatment of GIST 882 with imatinib greatly enhanced the efficiency with which the anti-FOXO3a antibody, but not the IgG control, selectively precipitated the region of the BIM promoter containing the FOXO-binding site. These data suggest that imatinib causes the accumulation of FOXO3a on the BIM promoter to activate transcription. c-KIT, a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family, is important for hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis as well as the development of the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are believed to be the nonmalignant precursor cells of GIST (16Duensing A. Heinrich M.C. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Cancer Invest. 2004; 22: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, c-KIT dimerizes, undergoes autophosphorylation, and activates a variety of downstream signaling pathways and molecules, including MAPK, PI3K-AKT, Src, and JAK/STAT (17Lennartsson J. Rönnstrand L. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dysregulated signaling by c-KIT has been implicated in a number of cancers including GISTs, mastocytosis, germ cell tumors, a subset of melanomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia (17Lennartsson J. Rönnstrand L. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Targeted inhibition of c-KIT by imatinib has provided a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of metastatic GIST. However, despite the importance of c-KIT in a variety of cancers and the potential it provides as a model system for understanding targeted therapy, the biochemical pathways connecting c-KIT inhibition to cell death are incompletely understood. In this study, we have demonstrated that inhibition of constitutively activated c-KIT by imatinib in GIST triggers the up-regulation of the proapoptotic, BCL-2 protein family member BIM. Furthermore, the attenuation of imatinib-induced apoptosis following knockdown of BIM by siRNA supports a functional role for BIM in cell death. The lack of complete rescue following BIM knockdown is consistent with data demonstrating the importance of other pathways, such as soluble H2AX2 up-regulation (6Liu Y. Tseng M. Perdreau S.A.

However, it seems likely that alternative therapies that abrogate c-KIT signaling by mechanisms unique from imatinib, for example, flavopiridol, which inhibits c-KIT transcription (18Sambol E.B. Ambrosini G. Geha R.C. Kennealey P.T. Decarolis P. O'connor R. Wu Y.V. Motwani M. Chen J.H. Schwartz G.K. Singer S.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9153-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), may also utilize BIM up-regulation to trigger apoptosis. BIM exhibits multifaceted regulation at the levels of transcription, mRNA stability, post-translational modification, proteasomal degradation, and cellular localization (12Hübner A. Barrett T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Abrams M.T. Robertson N.M. Yoon K. Wickstrom E. J. Biol.

In this study, we have also demonstrated that after c-KIT inhibition, BIM induction occurs secondary to both transcriptional and post-translational regulation (Fig. 5). Erk1/2 kinases have been shown to phosphorylate BIM and target it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In agreement, we found that imatinib inhibition increased the dephosphorylated and deubiquitinated form of BIM. In addition to the increase in BIM protein stability, we also found that imatinib induced BIM transcription through the PI3K-AKT-FOXO3a pathway. Upon c-KIT inhibition, the transcription factor FOXO3a is dephosphorylated, which facilitates its entry into the nucleus and localization to the BIM promoter. These modes of BIM regulation are in agreement with data previously showing that c-KIT inhibition caused down-regulation of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways in GIST (5Bauer S. Duensing A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher J.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7560-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the mast cell lineage, both mutant and wild-type c-KIT promoted cell survival by BIM suppression (24Möller C. Alfredsson J. Engström M. Wootz H. Xiang Z. Lennartsson J. Jönsson J.I.

The discovery that dysregulated, constitutively activated tyrosine kinases in cancers can be specifically inhibited has lead to significant advances in the field of cancer therapeutics (26Sawyers C.L. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results presented here complement and expand the current data on the mechanisms by which oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibition triggers apoptosis. It has been previously shown that BIM also contributes to apoptosis following EGFR inhibition in nonsmall cell lung cancers (27Costa D.B. Halmos B. Kumar A. Schumer S.T. Huberman M.S. Boggon T.J.

Similarly, in BCR/Abl leukemia cells, both BIM and Bad, another proapoptotic BCL-2 family member protein, are required for imatinib-induced cell death (34Kuroda J. Puthalakath H. Cragg M.S.

As c-KIT in GIST is now another oncogenic tyrosine kinase whose effects of targeted inhibition are mediated significantly by BIM up-regulation, it would suggest that this may be a common mechanism for oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis, although lineage-specific distinctions may also exist. Understanding the common mechanisms of cell death utilized by targeted inhibitors such as imatinib is important for designing new inhibitors for other oncogenic kinases as well as for developing new therapies in the setting of secondary resistance to kinase inhibitors. Despite initial high response rates to imatinib in GIST, complete responses are rare, and disease in the majority of patients will eventually progress. The failure of imatinib can involve a number of different mechanisms, including the development of secondary, imatinib-resistant c-KIT mutations, c-KIT amplification, or the dependence on alternative pathways (35Corless C.L. Fletcher J.A. Heinrich M.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 3813-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 36Liegl B. Kepten I. Le C. Zhu M. Demetri G.D. Heinrich M.C. Fletcher C.D. Corless C.L.

Similar acquired resistance has also been encountered in the targeted therapy of BCR/Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia and EGFR in nonsmall cell lung cancer (26Sawyers C.L. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Identification of novel factors that modulate NF-κB function is therefore of significant importance. The Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) transcriptional co-activator regulates transcriptional activity in the Notch pathway and is emerging as a co-activator of other pathways. In this study, we found that MAML1 regulates NF-κB signaling via two mechanisms. First, MAML1 co-activates the NF-κB subunit RelA (p65) in NF-κB-dependent transcription. Second, MAML1 causes degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα). Maml1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed impaired tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced NF-κB responses. Moreover, MAML1 expression level directly influences cellular sensitivity to TNFα-induced cytotoxicity. In vivo, mice deficient in the Maml1 gene exhibited spontaneous cell death in the liver, with a large increase in the number of apoptotic hepatic cells. These findings indicate that MAML1 is a novel modulator for NF-κB signaling and regulates cellular survival."

The data, combined with results from a previous study, provide strong evidence that the polypeptide backbones of the head domains form a symmetric dimer of closely apposed backbones that fold back onto the rod domain, imparting an asymmetry to the dimer. By following the behavior of spin labels during the process of in vitro assembly, we show that head domain structure is dynamic, changing as a result of filament assembly. Finally, because the vimentin head domain is the major site of the phosphorylation that induces disassembly at mitosis, we studied the effects of phosphorylation on head domain structure and demonstrate that phosphorylation drives specific head domain regions apart.

https://openalex.org/W2109367588,"Nuclear DBF-2-related (NDR) kinases are essential regulators of cell cycle progression, growth, and development in many organisms and are activated by the binding of an Mps One Binder (MOB) protein partner, autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation by an upstream STE20 family kinase. In the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, the NDR kinase, PK50, is expressed in proliferative life cycle stages and was shown to complement a yeast NDR kinase mutant cell line. However, the function of PK50 and a second NDR kinase, PK53, in T. brucei has not been determined to date, although trypanosome MOB1 is known to be essential for cytokinesis, suggesting the NDR kinases may also be involved in this process. Here, we show that specific depletion of PK50 or PK53 from bloodstream stage trypanosomes resulted in the rapid accumulation of cells with two nuclei and two kinetoplasts, indicating that cytokinesis was specifically inhibited. This led to a deregulation of the cell cycle and cell death and provides genetic validation of these kinases as potential novel drug targets for human African trypanosomiasis. Recombinant active PK50 and PK53 were produced and biochemically characterized. Both enzymes autophosphorylated, were able to trans-phosphorylate generic kinase substrates in vitro, and were active in the absence of phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. Additionally, both enzymes were active in the absence of MOB1 binding, which was also demonstrated to likely be a feature of the kinases in vivo. Biochemical characterization of recombinant PK50 and PK53 has revealed key kinetic differences between them, and the identification of in vitro peptide substrates in this study paves the way for high throughput inhibitor screening of these kinases."

Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), the clinical needs are still unmet, and the field is facing many challenges (2Carmeliet P. De Smet F. Loges S. Mazzone M. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 6: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One problem in antiangiogenic therapy is that, while one angiogenic factor is targeted, other angiogenic factors are selectively up-regulated, therefore bypassing the therapeutic effect of the antiangiogenic reagents, which allows the pathological neovascularization to proceed (3Dorrell M.I. Aguilar E. Scheppke L. Barnett F.H. Friedlander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, mature blood vessels covered by pericytes or smooth muscle cells are more resistant to antiangiogenic therapy and difficult to prune (4Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar, 5Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 6Benjamin L.E. Hemo I. Keshet E. Development. 1998; 125: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, novel antiangiogenic strategies targeting not only vascular endothelial cells, but also pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and other non-vascular cells involved in angiogenesis are highly desired. Furthermore, emerging drug resistance (7Shojaei F. Wu X. Malik A.K. Zhong C. Baldwin M.E. Schanz S. Fuh G. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and adverse side effects (8Maharaj A.S. Walshe T.E. Saint-Geniez M. Venkatesha S. Maldonado A.E. Himes N.C. Matharu K.S. Karumanchi S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) constitute challenging problems to overcome. Finding new target genes with pleiotropic effects on multiple cell types important for pathological angiogenesis has become an important goal in antiangiogenic therapy.Ocular neovascular disorders are the major causes of vision impairment or loss. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is a major reason for blindness in the aged population in the Western society due to outgrowth of new blood vessels from the choroid (9Ambati J.

Despite many angiogenesis inhibitors tested, the progression of this pathology cannot be halted in all the patients, implicating the existence of yet uncovered angiogenic factors involved.

Currently, there is no satisfying treatment for ROP. Thus, new and effective anti-neovascularization therapies to inhibit pathological angiogenesis are still needed.PDGF-DD is the fourth member of the PDGF family that binds to and activates its cognate receptor PDGFR-β (10Bergsten E.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The biological function of PDGF-DD remains largely to be explored. PDGF-DD protein is produced as a secreted homodimer and needs to be proteolytically processed for receptor binding (10Bergsten E. Uutela M. Li X. Pietras K. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD is expressed in many different tissues (10Bergsten E. Uutela M. Li X. Pietras K. Ostman A.

PDGF-DD expression can also be found in the neointima of arteries in chronic allograft nephropathy (14Liu G. Changsirikulchai S. Hudkins K.L. Banas M.C. Kowalewska J. Yang X. Wietecha T.A. Volpone J. Gilbertson D.G. Alpers C.E. Hum. Pathol. 2008; 39: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD plays an important role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (15Kong D. Wang Z.

PDGF-DD overexpression induced blood vessel maturation during angiogenesis in the skin and skeletal muscles (16Uutela M. Wirzenius M. Paavonen K. Rajantie I. He Y. Karpanen T. Lohela M. Wiig H. Salven P. Pajusola K. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD has also been shown to play an important role in inflammation, because PDGF-DD overexpression induced macrophage recruitment into the skin and skeletal muscles (16Uutela M. Wirzenius M. Paavonen K. Rajantie I. He Y. Karpanen T. Lohela M. Wiig H. Salven P. Pajusola K. Eriksson U. Alitalo K.

Indeed, PDGF-DD is expressed in macrophages and promoted monocyte migration in a dose-dependent manner (18Wågsäter D. Zhu C. Björck H.M. Eriksson P. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, PDGF-DD contributes to tumor growth (19Li H. Fredriksson L. Li X. Eriksson U. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Xu L. Tong R. Cochran D.M. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5711-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z.

Chem. 2005; 280: 8494-8502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD is produced by human adult retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and induces their proliferation and migration (24Li R. Maminishkis A. Wang F.E. Miller S.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 5722-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, PDGF-DD is a potent growth factor with versatile functions in many different biological processes.In the present work, we utilized different animal models to study the function of PDGF-DD in pathological angiogenesis and the potential of PDGF-DD inhibition in suppressing pathological neovascularization. We found that PDGF-DD expression was up-regulated during pathological angiogenesis. Importantly, PDGF-DD inhibition decreased both choroidal and retinal neovascularization. We further uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the function of PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD regulated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylation and expression in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased cell survival. Thus, PDGF-DD is a critical player in pathological angiogenesis, and PDGF-DD inhibition may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat neovascular diseases.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we showed that PDGF-DD expression was up-regulated during pathological angiogenesis, and PDGF-DD inhibition suppressed both choroidal and retinal neovascularization in different animal models. We further provided mechanistic insights underlying the effect of PDGF-DD. In particular, PDGF-DD induced GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation and Tyr216 dephosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, resulting in increased cell survival. Indeed, GSK3β activity was required for the antiangiogenic effect of PDGF-DD inhibition. In addition, PDGF-DD acted as a potent regulator of the expression of GSK3β and many other proangiogenic and proapoptotic genes. In summary, our data showed that PDGF-DD targeting may have therapeutic values in treating neovascular diseases.VEGF has been considered to be the key angiogenic factor and the first target gene in antiangiogenic therapy (62Ferrara N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and anti-VEGF therapies have shown efficacies in treating neovascular diseases (63Andreoli C.M. Miller J.W. Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 2007; 18: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, not all patients with neovascular disorders respond to anti-VEGF therapy (64Rodrigues E.B.

Ophthalmol. 2006; 142: 683-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), indicating that other angiogenic molecules or non-VEGF-driven pathways play important roles in the pathogenesis of neovascular diseases. Indeed, it has been shown that VEGF is responsible for ∼50% of the angiogenic provocations in pathological angiogenesis (66Aiello L.P. Pierce E.A. Foley E.D. Takagi H. Chen H. Riddle L. Ferrara N. King G.L. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10457-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tolerance to anti-VEGF reagents has been observed in the clinic (64Rodrigues E.B. Farah M.E. Maia M. Penha F.M. Regatieri C. Melo G.B. Pinheiro M.M. Zanetti C.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2009; 28: 117-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). VEGF inhibition may result in different side effects in patients responsive to anti-VEGF therapy (67Hernandez-Pastor L.J.

Retina. 2006; 26: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, the costs of the current clinically available anti-VEGF reagents are daunting. Thus, new antiangiogenic reagents are still needed. In this study, we found that PDGF-DD expression was up-regulated in both neovascular choroids and retinae, and PDGF-DD knockdown by shRNA suppressed choroidal and retinal neovascularization, demonstrating that PDGF-DD may be a new target molecule in antiangiogenic therapy.Several mechanisms underlie the antiangiogenic effect of PDGF-DD targeting. First, PDGF-DD is expressed by macrophages (13Karvinen H. Rutanen J. Leppänen O. Lach R. Levonen A.L. Eriksson U. Ylä-Herttuala S. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 39: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is a potent chemoattractant for them (18Wågsäter D. Zhu C. Björck H.M. Eriksson P. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is known that macrophages play an important role in pathological angiogenesis (75Kvanta A. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because PDGF-DD inhibition reduced macrophage infiltration during CNV formation, the antiangiogenic effect of PDGF-DD targeting may thus be achieved, at least in part, by suppressing inflammation. Second, PDGF-DD promoted migration, proliferation, and survival of multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, vascular pericytes, and endothelial cells, which play important roles in pathological angiogenesis (75Kvanta A. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 76Motiejūnaite R. Kazlauskas A. Exp. Eye Res. 2008; 86: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD inhibition thus attenuated the availability of multiple cellular components needed for pathological angiogenesis. In addition, PDGF-DD is a potent regulator of the expression of numerous proangiogenic and proapoptotic genes involved in pathological angiogenesis, such as VEGF, FGF2, PlGF, and VEGF-B, important players in CNV (25Zhang F.

Induction of apoptosis in the neovasculature has been considered as a promising antiangiogenic approach to inhibit pathological neovascularization (79Semkova I. Fauser S. Lappas A. Smyth N. Kociok N.

Thus, by modulating the expression of many other genes important for angiogenesis, PDGF-DD targeting may result in a broad amplification of an antiangiogenic effect.The signaling pathways induced by PDGF-DD are poorly understood thus far. We first identified PDGFR-β as the receptor mediating the PDGF-DD-induced Erk and Akt activation, because treatment with PDGFR-β neutralizing antibody abolished the PDGF-DD-induced effects. We further uncovered that GSK3β is an important downstream effector of PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD induced GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation and GSK3β Tyr216 dephosphorylation in choroidal fibroblasts in vitro and in the retina in vivo. It is known that inhibition of GSK3β activity by Akt-dependant Ser9 phosphorylation or through GSK3β Tyr216 dephosphorylation promotes vascular cell survival (52Allard D. Figg N. Bennett M.R. Littlewood T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19739-19747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 53Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Moreover, the involvement of GSK3β in PDGF-DD-induced angiogenesis was confirmed by the aortic ring assay in vitro, and by the laser-induced CNV model in vivo. When the GSK3β activator, DIF3, was added together with PDGF-DD to the aortic rings, the PDGF-DD-induced microvessel formation was impaired. When LiCl, a GSK3β inhibitor, was administered together with PDGF-D shRNA into the mouse vitreous, the antiangiogenic effect of PDGF-D shRNA on CNV formation was abolished. It is noteworthy that, thus far, little is known about the role of GSK3β in pathological angiogenesis, and whether GSK3β is involved in neovessel formation induced by other angiogenic factors. Future studies are needed to verify these roles and to explore further whether activation of GSK3β could be utilized to inhibit pathological angiogenesis.In summary, using different animal models, we showed that PDGF-DD plays an important role in pathological angiogenesis by affecting multiple cell types, and PDGF-DD inhibition repressed both choroidal and retinal angiogenesis. Mechanistically, we revealed that the effect of PDGF-DD was mediated by regulating GSK3β phosphorylation and expression. Due to its multiple roles in pathological angiogenesis, PDGF-DD inhibition may provide new therapeutic possibilities to treat neovascular diseases. IntroductionAlthough antiangiogenic therapy has shown some therapeutic efficacy (1Folkman J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), the clinical needs are still unmet, and the field is facing many challenges (2Carmeliet P. De Smet F. Loges S. Mazzone M. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 6: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One problem in antiangiogenic therapy is that, while one angiogenic factor is targeted, other angiogenic factors are selectively up-regulated, therefore bypassing the therapeutic effect of the antiangiogenic reagents, which allows the pathological neovascularization to proceed (3Dorrell M.I. Aguilar E. Scheppke L. Barnett F.H. Friedlander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, mature blood vessels covered by pericytes or smooth muscle cells are more resistant to antiangiogenic therapy and difficult to prune (4Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar, 5Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 6Benjamin L.E. Hemo I. Keshet E. Development. 1998; 125: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, novel antiangiogenic strategies targeting not only vascular endothelial cells, but also pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and other non-vascular cells involved in angiogenesis are highly desired. Furthermore, emerging drug resistance (7Shojaei F. Wu X. Malik A.K. Zhong C. Baldwin M.E. Schanz S. Fuh G. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and adverse side effects (8Maharaj A.S. Walshe T.E. Saint-Geniez M. Venkatesha S. Maldonado A.E. Himes N.C. Matharu K.S. Karumanchi S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) constitute challenging problems to overcome. Finding new target genes with pleiotropic effects on multiple cell types important for pathological angiogenesis has become an important goal in antiangiogenic therapy.Ocular neovascular disorders are the major causes of vision impairment or loss. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is a major reason for blindness in the aged population in the Western society due to outgrowth of new blood vessels from the choroid (9Ambati J. Ambati B.K. Yoo S.H. Ianchulev S. Adamis A.P. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2003; 48: 257-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Despite many angiogenesis inhibitors tested, the progression of this pathology cannot be halted in all the patients, implicating the existence of yet uncovered angiogenic factors involved.

Currently, there is no satisfying treatment for ROP. Thus, new and effective anti-neovascularization therapies to inhibit pathological angiogenesis are still needed.PDGF-DD is the fourth member of the PDGF family that binds to and activates its cognate receptor PDGFR-β (10Bergsten E.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The biological function of PDGF-DD remains largely to be explored. PDGF-DD protein is produced as a secreted homodimer and needs to be proteolytically processed for receptor binding (10Bergsten E. Uutela M. Li X. Pietras K. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K.

PDGF-DD expression can also be found in the neointima of arteries in chronic allograft nephropathy (14Liu G. Changsirikulchai S. Hudkins K.L. Banas M.C. Kowalewska J. Yang X. Wietecha T.A. Volpone J. Gilbertson D.G. Alpers C.E. Hum. Pathol. 2008; 39: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD plays an important role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (15Kong D. Wang Z.

PDGF-DD overexpression induced blood vessel maturation during angiogenesis in the skin and skeletal muscles (16Uutela M. Wirzenius M. Paavonen K. Rajantie I. He Y. Karpanen T. Lohela M. Wiig H. Salven P. Pajusola K. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Blood. 2004; 104: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD has also been shown to play an important role in inflammation, because PDGF-DD overexpression induced macrophage recruitment into the skin and skeletal muscles (16Uutela M. Wirzenius M. Paavonen K. Rajantie I. He Y. Karpanen T. Lohela M. Wiig H. Salven P. Pajusola K. Eriksson U. Alitalo K.

Indeed, PDGF-DD is expressed in macrophages and promoted monocyte migration in a dose-dependent manner (18Wågsäter D. Zhu C. Björck H.M. Eriksson P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 8494-8502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PDGF-DD is produced by human adult retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and induces their proliferation and migration (24Li R. Maminishkis A. Wang F.E. Miller S.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 5722-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, PDGF-DD is a potent growth factor with versatile functions in many different biological processes.In the present work, we utilized different animal models to study the function of PDGF-DD in pathological angiogenesis and the potential of PDGF-DD inhibition in suppressing pathological neovascularization. We found that PDGF-DD expression was up-regulated during pathological angiogenesis. Importantly, PDGF-DD inhibition decreased both choroidal and retinal neovascularization. We further uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the function of PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD regulated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylation and expression in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased cell survival. Thus, PDGF-DD is a critical player in pathological angiogenesis, and PDGF-DD inhibition may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat neovascular diseases."

During the study analyzing the effects of PTX on Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) function in cardiac fibroblasts, we found that PTX increases the number of AT1Rs and enhances AT1R-mediated response. Microarray analysis revealed that PTX increases the induction of interleukin (IL)-1β among cytokines. Inhibition of IL-1β suppressed the enhancement of AT1R-mediated response by PTX. PTX increased the expression of IL-1β and AT1R through NF-κB, and a small GTP-binding protein, Rac, mediated PTX-induced NF-κB activation through NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species. PTX induced biphasic increases in Rac activity, and the Rac activation in a late but not an early phase was suppressed by IL-1β siRNA, suggesting that IL-1β-induced Rac activation contributes to the amplification of Rac-dependent signaling induced by PTX. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) abolished PTX-induced Rac activation and enhancement of AT1R function. However, ADP-ribosylation of Gi/Go by PTX was not affected by inhibition of TLR4. Thus, PTX binds to two receptors; one is TLR4, which activates Rac, and another is the binding site that is required for ADP-ribosylation of Gi/Go.

https://openalex.org/W1544366392,"The trimeric Cdk7·cyclin H·Mat1 complex functions in cell cycle regulation, as the Cdk-activating kinase, and in transcription, as a module of the general transcription factor TFIIH. As a component of TFIIH, Cdk7 phosphorylates serines 5 and 7 of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and can also directly phosphorylate transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Here we have investigated the function of the Cdk7·cyclin H·Mat1 complex in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and preimplantation embryos to determine whether it regulates the unique cell cycle structure and transcriptional network of pluripotent cells. We demonstrate that depletion of cyclin H leads to differentiation of ES cells independent of changes in cell cycle progression. In contrast, we observed that developmental genes are acutely up-regulated after cyclin H down-regulation, likely perturbing normal ES self-renewal pathways. We further demonstrate that Spt5, a known phosphorylation target of Cdk7, similarly regulates ES pluripotency and gene expression. Consistent with its function in ES cells, cyclin H depletion from mouse embryos also leads to defects in the expansion of the inner cell mass of blastocysts, a transient pluripotent stem cell population in vivo. Our findings indicate that cyclin H has an essential function in promoting the self-renewal of the pluripotent stem cells of blastocyst stage embryos. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a critical and novel role for cyclin H in maintaining ES cell identity and suggest that cyclin H has important functions in early embryonic development.

Initial in vitro studies provided conflicting results on the extent to which TFIIH-associated Cdk7 kinase activity is necessary for mRNA transcription (28Akoulitchev S. Mäkelä T.P. Weinberg R.A.

Recent reports from both yeast and human cells using an analog-sensitive kinase indicate that Cdk7 is only required for the expression of a subset of genes (21Glover-Cutter K. Larochelle S.

The Cdk7 complex can also regulate gene expression by directly phosphorylating transcription factors, including the retinoic acid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, to either enhance or repress their activity (31Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 32Compe E. Drané P. Laurent C. Diderich K. Braun C.

Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the repertoire of Cdk7-responsive genes and functional requirements for the Cdk7·cyclin H·Mat1 complex are likely to vary in a cell type-dependent fashion. Limited functional analysis of the subunits of the CAK complex has been performed in mammalian cells. Mat1 is the only component of the complex that has been mutated in mice. Mat1-deficient mice exhibit peri-implantation lethality, with homozygous mutant blastocysts failing to maintain/expand the inner cell mass (ICM) in culture (34Rossi D.J. Londesborough A. Korsisaari N. Pihlak A. Lehtonen E. Henkemeyer M. Mäkelä T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2844-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Notably, cyclin H and Cdk7 protein levels were also reduced in Mat1 mutant blastocyst explants. Given this early embryonic lethality, conditional alleles have helped to reveal cell type-specific functions of Mat1. Postnatal deletion in the testis results in the loss of spermatagonial stem cells, whereas cardiac-specific Mat1 mutants develop heart failure secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction (35Sano M. Izumi Y. Helenius K. Asakura M. Rossi D.J. Xie M. Taffet G. Hu L. Pautler R.G. Wilson C.R. Boudina S. Abel E.D. Taegtmeyer H. Scaglia F. Graham B.H. Kralli A. Shimizu N. Tanaka H. Mäkelä T.P.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4275-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of Mat1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts promotes adipogenesis by decreasing inhibitory phosphorylation of proliferator-activated receptor γ (33Helenius K. Yang Y. Alasaari J. Mäkelä T.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These varying phenotypes suggest that Mat1 is not globally required for cell survival or transcription, but rather that it can modulate select target genes in a cell type-specific manner. This is a particularly interesting possibility given the early embryonic lethality of Mat1-null embryos and the requirement for Mat1 in spermatagonial stem cell maintenance, which suggests that Mat1 modulates transcriptional programs that are required for stem cell maintenance. Mat1 was also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with octamer family transcription factors, including the pluripotency factor Oct-4 (37Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts and represent a unique stem cell population that can self-renew indefinitely while retaining the plasticity to differentiate into all cell types of an adult organism. A network of transcription factors that are uniquely expressed in pluripotent cells and critical for self-renewal, such as Oct-4 and Nanog, have been identified in recent studies (38Chambers I. Tomlinson S.R. Development. 2009; 136: 2311-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Chromatin binding profiles suggest that these factors work in concert to regulate gene expression (39Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y.

However, genes that are more broadly expressed can also have unique functions in ES cells. For example, the polycomb group proteins interface with the pluripotency network to repress developmental genes in ES cells (41Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar, 42Endoh M. Endo T.A.

Here we investigate the function of Mat1 and cyclin H in mouse ES cells to understand the mechanism for early embryonic lethality of Mat1-deficient embryos. Surprisingly, we observed that Mat1 down-regulation does not significantly impact ES cell viability or pluripotency. In contrast, depletion of cyclin H, which was also decreased in Mat1-deficient embryos, leads to differentiation of ES cells and defects in expansion of the ICM of explanted blastocysts. This suggests that decreased cyclin H protein levels could contribute to the early embryonic lethality of Mat1 mutant embryos. Cyclin H depletion did not alter Cdk phosphorylation but lead to the up-regulation of differentiation-associated genes in ES cells. Of note, down-regulation of the negative elongation factor Spt5, which is phosphorylated by Cdk7 in vitro, also leads to differentiation of ES cells and up-regulation of many of the same developmental genes as regulated by cyclin H. Thus, Spt5 is likely to be an important target for cyclin H-mediated gene repression. The unique phenotypes of Mat1 and cyclin H down-regulation in ES cells underscores how these two subunits have distinct effects on Cdk7 activity and substrate specificity. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first loss-of-function analysis of cyclin H in a mammalian system. E14TG2a (ATCC) and R1 mouse ES cells were cultured on mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% Hyclone serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and leukemia inhibitory factor. For experiments, ES cells were passaged onto 0.1% gelatin-coated plates. Low passage (<10) gelatin-adapted ES cells were transduced twice with lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20 in ES medium with polybrene (8 μg/ml) and selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) 24 h after transduction. For proteosome inhibition experiments, the cells were treated with MG-132 (25 μm) or Me2SO for 4 h. Lentiviral stocks were generated by calcium phosphate-based transfection of 293T cells with pLKO vectors (Open Biosystems) and packaging plasmids (Addgene, VSV-G 8454, psPax2 12260). Viral supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 h, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or KSOM + AA (Millipore), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Virus used for embryo transductions was purified a second time by ultracentrifugation over a 20% sucrose cushion. The puromycin resistance cassette of pLKO vectors was also replaced with enhanced GFP for mouse embryo experiments. A scramble shRNA expressing vector was obtained from Addgene (vector 1864). RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified on RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). The Picopure RNA isolation kit (Fisher) was used to isolate RNA from embryos and blastocyst explants. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of equivalent quantities of RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. QRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT using either SYBR green or TaqMan probes. β-Actin was used as an endogenous control for ES experiments, whereas Hist2h2aa1 (Mm00501974_s1) and Ubtf (Mm00456972_m1) were used for embryo analysis. A list of SYBR green primers designed for QRT-PCR can be provided upon request. Three biological replicates were averaged for all QRT-PCR experiments, with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. Microarrays were performed by the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Core facility using Mouse Gene ST 1.0 arrays (Affymetrix) with two biological replicates/sample. The data were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm (Partek). Genes that changed greater than 1.3-fold with both cyclin H-targeting shRNAs and were significant (p < 0.05) with either cyclin H shRNA relative to a scramble control were selected for further analysis. A heat map was generated using the HeatMapImage module in Gene Pattern (43Reich M. Liefeld T. Gould J. Lerner J. Tamayo P. Mesirov J.P. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), sodium vanadate, sodium fluoride, and β-glycerophosphate. Nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation was performed using the Active Motif kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against cyclin H (C-18), Cdk7 (C-4), Mat1 (F-6), and RNA polymerase II (N-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Xpd, Hsp90, and total Cdk1 were from Abcam, whereas p-Cdk1 (Thr161), p-Cdk2 (Thr160), total Cdk2, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and β-tubulin were from Cell Signaling. The Ser2 (H5) and Ser5 (H14) phosphorylation-specific RNA polymerase antibodies were obtained from Covance. For immunoprecipitations, 50–100 μg of lysate was incubated with 1–2 μg of antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose was added for 1 h, immunoprecipitations were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, washed once in kinase buffer, and assayed for kinase activity toward recombinant GST-CTD or histone H1 as previously described (44Pines J.

Fisher R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To label proliferating cells, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to ES cultures for 10 min. The cells were fixed and permeabilized with ethanol, labeled with anti-BrdUrd (Alexa Fluor-488 conjugate; Invitrogen) antibody and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Female CF-1 mice (4–6 weeks old; Charles River) were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (5 IU; Sigma) followed 48 h later by human chorionic gonadotropin (5 IU; Calbiochem). The mice were then naturally mated with B6D2F1/J (Jackson Labs) males. One-cell embryos were isolated at 0.5 days post coitus and cultured in microdrops of KSOM + AA in a humidified chamber under 5% O2, 6% CO2, 89% air. To infect one-cell embryos, the zona pellucida was removed by acid Tyrode's solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and individual embryos were placed in 10-μl drops of lentivirus diluted to 2 × 106 particles/ml in KSOM + AA medium as previously described (46Singer O. Tiscornia G. Ikawa M. Verma I.M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Blastocyst explant assays were performed on gelatin coated 96-well plates or 8-well chamber slides as previously described (47Dobles M. Liberal V. Scott M.L. Benezra R. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Given the early embryonic lethality of Mat1-null embryos, we chose to employ ES cells as a model to further elucidate the function of Mat1 in stem cells. To deplete Mat1, we transduced gelatin-adapted E14TG2a ES cells with lentiviruses expressing Mat1-specific shRNAs and selected for virus integration with puromycin. Two shRNAs targeting independent regions of Mat1 transcripts were utilized for all of the experiments. Both shRNAs significantly decreased Mat1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Mat1 down-regulation did not affect the viability of ES cells or decrease staining for alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of undifferentiated ES cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the levels of Oct-4 and Sox-2 protein and the expression of a number of well characterized Oct-4 target genes were not significantly altered by decreased Mat1 (Fig. 1, C and E). These results were surprising considering the dramatic defect in expansion of the inner cell mass from Mat1-null embryos. One explanation for these observations is that there is a unique requirement for Mat1 in early embryonic development, which does not manifest in an established ES cell line. Alternatively, because Rossi et al. (34Rossi D.J. Londesborough A. Korsisaari N. Pihlak A. Lehtonen E. Henkemeyer M. Mäkelä T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2844-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated that the levels of Cdk7 and cyclin H were significantly decreased in Mat1 mutant embryo explants, we considered the possibility that decreases in other components of the CAK complex may contribute to the phenotype of these embryos. Because Rossi et al. (34Rossi D.J. Londesborough A. Korsisaari N. Pihlak A. Lehtonen E. Henkemeyer M. Mäkelä T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2844-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cyclin H appeared most dramatically reduced in Mat1-null embryo outgrowths, we first analyzed the functional consequences of cyclin H depletion from ES cells using lentiviral shRNAs. Using two independent cyclin H shRNAs, we significantly reduced the levels of cyclin H mRNA in ES cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a time course of protein abundance shows that cyclin H was reduced at 2 days after transduction and significantly depleted by 3 days (Fig. 2B). The loss of cyclin H in ES cells lead to a dramatic change in cell morphology and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity, both consistent with differentiation (Fig. 2C). To more extensively characterize the differentiation phenotype, we performed QRT-PCR analysis for several pluripotency-associated genes and found that Zfp42 (Rex-1) and Tcl1 were considerably reduced, whereas Oct-4 was modestly decreased after 5 days of cyclin H depletion (Fig. 2D). Because Zfp42 rapidly and dramatically decreases upon the loss of pluripotency, these results further suggested that cyclin H down-regulation leads to ES cell differentiation. Moreover, endoderm (FoxA1 and Gata4), ectoderm (Fgf5), mesoderm (Msx1), and trophectoderm (Cdx2 and Hand1) markers were up-regulated in cyclin H shRNA-treated ES cells (Fig. 2E). This increase in multiple lineage-specific genes suggests that the cells were differentiating along several different pathways. Given these effects on cell fate, we next determined whether changes in either the levels or localization of components of the CAK complex occur during ES differentiation. We analyzed the subcellular localization of the CAK complex because it has been shown to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during Drosophila development (48Aguilar-Fuentes J. Valadez-Graham V. Reynaud E. Zurita M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3866-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ES cells were differentiated by withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor combined with retinoic acid treatment, which leads to rapid loss of Oct-4 expression (Fig. 3). Fractionation of differentiating cells collected over an 8-day time course revealed that neither the levels nor subcellular localization of the CAK complex is altered by differentiation. Thus, we conclude that although cyclin H is not uniquely or more highly expressed in ES cells, it is critical to prevent precocious differentiation. Although Cdk7 was thought to be predominantly nuclear, we observed a significant fraction of the Cdk7 complex in the cytoplasm of ES cells and their differentiated progeny. Cytoplasmic functions for this complex have not been described; therefore the significance of this localization is unclear. Decreased levels of cyclin H and Cdk7 have been observed in both tissue-specific and global Mat1-deficient mice (34Rossi D.J. Londesborough A. Korsisaari N. Pihlak A. Lehtonen E. Henkemeyer M. Mäkelä T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2844-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Sano M. Izumi Y. Helenius K. Asakura M. Rossi D.J. Xie M. Taffet G. Hu L. Pautler R.G. Wilson C.R. Boudina S.

Schneider M.D. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 129-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, after 5 days of Mat1 down-regulation in ES cells, we did not observe changes in the levels of either cyclin H or Cdk7 protein (Fig. 4A). If decreased levels of cyclin H contribute to the early embryonic lethality of Mat1 knockout embryos, this difference may explain why Mat1 depletion in ES cells does not significantly influence viability or pluripotency. In contrast, when cyclin H was down-regulated, the levels of Mat1 protein also decreased dramatically within 3 days, and the abundance of Cdk7 was significantly reduced by 5 days after lentiviral transduction (Fig. 4B). These changes in Mat1 and Cdk7 protein are post-transcriptional, because the levels of Mat1 and Cdk7 transcripts were not significantly decreased after cyclin H depletion (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the decrease in Mat1 and Cdk7 protein was proteosome-dependent, scramble and cyclin H shRNA-infected cells were treated with a proteosome inhibitor (MG-132, 4 h) or vehicle control (Me2SO). Treatment with MG-132 did not increase the levels of Mat1 or Cdk7 protein in cyclin H-depleted cells; however, we were able to detect stabilization of HIF1α, indicating that the inhibitor treatment was effective (Fig. 4D). This suggests that proteosomal degradation does not contribute significantly to the decreased levels of Mat1 and Cdk7 protein in cyclin H-depleted cells. Of note, we did not observe changes in the levels of the TFIIH subunit Xpd after cyclin H down-regulation, indicating that core TFIIH stability was not disrupted. (Fig. 4E). To confirm that cyclin H down-regulation does indeed reduce Cdk7 kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated Cdk7 from cyclin H-depleted cells and measured kinase activity toward a GST fusion with the CTD of RNA polymerase II (GST-CTD). At the 3-day time point, before the total cellular levels of Cdk7 had decreased, kinase activity was reduced with both cyclin H shRNAs, confirming that cyclin H is required for maximal Cdk7 activity and that other cellular cyclins cannot compensate for the loss of cyclin H (Fig. 4F). Because ES cells have a unique cell cycle structure, characterized by rapid proliferation and constitutively high Cdk2 activity, we next wanted to determine how this decrease in Cdk7 activity affects cell cycle progression (49Stead E.

Iron deficiency anemia is also a significant health burden resulting from both nutritional deficit as well as parasitic infection in these countries. In this study we investigated the relationships between the disease outcomes of Schistosoma japonicum infection and iron homeostasis. We aimed to determine if host iron status has an effect on schistosome maturation or egg production, and to investigate the response of iron regulatory genes to chronic schistosomiasis infection. Wild-type C57BL/6 and Transferrin Receptor 2 null mice were infected with S. japonicum, and sacrificed at the onset of chronic disease. Transferrin Receptor 2 null mice are a model of type 3 hereditary hemochromatosis and develop significant iron overload providing increased iron stores at the onset of infection. The infectivity of schistosomes and egg production was assessed along with the subsequent development of granulomas and fibrosis. The response of the iron regulatory gene Hepcidin to infection and the changes in iron status were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Our results show that Hepcidin levels responded to the changing iron status of the animals, but were not significantly influenced by the inflammatory response. We also show that with increased iron availability at the time of infection there was greater development of fibrosis around granulomas. In conclusion, our studies indicate that chronic inflammation may not be the primary cause of the anemia seen in schistosomiasis, and suggest that increased availability of iron, such as through iron supplementation, may actually lead to increased disease severity."

We have examined acute sugar transport regulation in the murine brain microvasculature endothelial cell line bEnd.3. Acute cellular metabolic stress was induced by glucose depletion, by potassium cyanide, or by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, which reduce or deplete intracellular ATP within 15 min. This results in a 1.7–7-fold increase in Vmax for zero-trans 3-O-methylglucose uptake (sugar uptake into sugar-free cells) and a 3–10-fold increase in Vmax for equilibrium exchange transport (intracellular [sugar] = extracellular [sugar]). GLUT1, GLUT8, and GLUT9 mRNAs are detected in bEnd.3 cells where GLUT1 mRNA levels are 33-fold greater than levels of GLUT8 or GLUT9 mRNA. Neither GLUT1 mRNA nor total protein levels are affected by acute metabolic stress. Cell surface biotinylation reveals that plasma membrane GLUT1 levels are increased 2–3-fold by metabolic depletion, although cell surface Na+,K+-ATPase levels remain unaffected by ATP depletion. Treatment with the AMP-activated kinase agonist, AICAR, increases Vmax for net 3-O-methylglucose uptake by 2-fold. Glucose depletion and treatment with potassium cyanide, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and AICAR also increase AMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation in bEnd.3 cells.

IntroductionThe cells of the mammalian brain do not contain large stores of glycogen. It is therefore essential that glucose uptake by the brain exceeds glucose utilization to maintain proper brain function. To enter the brain, serum glucose must cross the blood-brain barrier, an epithelium comprising endothelial cells connected by tight junctions that prevent paracellular diffusion of glucose and other nutrients. Thus, glucose transport into the brain requires trans-endothelial cell transport. This process is catalyzed by the glucose transport protein GLUT1, which is expressed at both luminal and abluminal membranes of the endothelium (1Flier J.S. Mueckler M. McCall A.L. Lodish H.F. J.

Cornford M.E. Brown W.J. Ann. Neurol. 1977; 1: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). 2) Brain capillary walls (comprising bEND cells) are 40% thinner than capillary walls of the peripheral circulation (7Coomber B.L. Stewart P.A. Microvasc. Res. 1985; 30: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 3) pEND cells present significantly fewer tight junctions than bEND cells (8Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). 4) bEND cell tight junction complexes result in polarized cell surface protein expression that is less marked or absent in pEND cells (8Dejana E.

The resulting bEND cell architecture may give rise to behaviors that differ from those of pEND cells but that resemble those of other metabolically active cells and thereby optimally support blood-brain barrier physiology (e.g. transport sensitivity to loss of cellular oxidative metabolic capacity).Although a simple equilibrative process, GLUT1-mediated trans-endothelial cell sugar transport appears to be tightly regulated. Sugar transport into the brain only narrowly exceeds brain glucose utilization under normal conditions (9Simpson I.A. Carruthers A. Vannucci S.J. J. Cereb.

There are three possible explanations for increased Vmax for transport as follows: 1) increased GLUT1 at the plasma membrane, either through increased protein expression or recruitment of intracellular stores; 2) enhanced intrinsic activity of GLUT1, which catalyzes faster translocation of substrate through the carrier, as seen in the ATP modulation of GLUT1 in erythrocytes (16Carruthers A.

Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in vivo (22Boado R.J. Wu D. Windisch M. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 34: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although increased protein expression could account for acute stimulation of sugar transport, immunogold staining of cells during seizures has not conclusively demonstrated altered cellular GLUT1 content (23Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 841-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Between 30 and 50% of total cellular GLUT1 resides in cytosolic vesicles in endothelial cells (24Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). GLUT1 recruitment to the plasma membrane occurs in response to acute metabolic stress in rat liver epithelial cells in vitro (25Barros L.F. Barnes K. Ingram J.C. Castro J. Porras O.H. Baldwin S.A. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in response to growth factor stimulation in bovine retinal endothelial cells (26Sone H. Deo B.K. Kumagai A.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1876-1884PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore set out to examine whether cultured brain microvessel endothelial cells respond to acute metabolic stress with increased sugar transport capacity and, if so, to test the hypothesis that increased Vmax for sugar uptake results from recruitment of intracellular GLUT1 to the plasma membrane. Using the mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line bEnd.3 (27Omidi Y. Campbell L. Barar J. Connell D. Akhtar S. Gumbleton M. Brain Res. 2003; 990: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we have determined the steady-state kinetics of GLUT1-mediated sugar transport in the absence and presence of glucose or the metabolic poisons potassium cyanide (KCN) and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). We established conditions for bEnd.3 cell ATP depletion, measured total GLUT1 mRNA and protein levels, and measured changes in plasma membrane levels of GLUT1. We show that ATP depletion of bEnd.3 cells increases Vmax for sugar transport and increases plasma membrane GLUT1 levels without changing endothelial cell GLUT1 mRNA or total GLUT1 protein levels. We also show that glucose depletion and treatment with KCN and FCCP increase the phosphorylation of the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Treatment of bEnd.3 cells with the AMPK agonist AICAR increases both the Vmax for sugar transport and the phosphorylation of AMPK. Taken together, these data suggest a potential role for AMPK in regulating the acute endothelial cell response to metabolic stress.DISCUSSIONThis study examines the hypothesis that brain microvasculature endothelial cells respond acutely to cellular metabolic stress with increased sugar transport capacity resulting from recruitment of intracellular GLUT1 stores to the plasma membrane.Previous studies have used the metabolic poisons KCN and FCCP to induce acute metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, and nucleated erythrocytes (33Haworth R.A. Berkoff H.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Hayashi T. Wojtaszewski J.F. Goodyear L.J. Am. J.

Metabolic depletion rapidly stimulates sugar transport in these tissues (33Haworth R.A. Berkoff H.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Hayashi T. Wojtaszewski J.F. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1039-E1051PubMed Google Scholar, 35Simons T.J. J. Physiol. 1983; 338: 477-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate rapid depletion of ATP in bEnd.3 cells using metabolic poisons. ATP levels recover within 60 min of removal of KCN; however, the effect of FCCP treatment is irreversible. We also show that KCN or FCCP treatment induces a 3.2–7.2-fold increase in Vmax for zero-trans and equilibrium exchange sugar uptake in bEnd.3 cells.Acute glucose depletion (15 min at 37 °C) also rapidly reduces bEnd.3 cell ATP content but only by 50%. This treatment increases Vmax for sugar uptake suggesting that sugar transport in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells is, like transport in cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle, acutely sensitive to cellular metabolic status (31Marsin A.S. Bouzin C. Bertrand L. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30778-30783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 36Coven D.L. Hu X. Cong L. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Hardie D.G. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E629-E636Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). AMPK is a key regulator of cellular metabolism. Upon elevation of cytoplasmic AMP levels, AMPK is phosphorylated and acts as a metabolic master switch, stimulating important metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis (37Hardie D.G. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Activated AMPK stimulates glycolysis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and monocytes by activating 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (30Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 31Marsin A.S. Bouzin C. Bertrand L. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30778-30783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Activated AMPK further supports increased anaerobic metabolism in heart and skeletal muscle by promoting recruitment of GLUT4 and GLUT1 to the cell membrane (39Barnes K. Ingram J.C. Porras O.H. Barros L.F. Hudson E.R. Fryer L.G. Foufelle F. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Baldwin S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), thereby increasing sugar uptake and metabolism. This mechanism may also be active in brain microvasculature endothelial cells because bEnd.3 cells acutely respond to metabolic poison, glucose depletion, and to the AMPK agonist AICAR with increased AMPK phosphorylation as well as increased sugar transport rates.Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates show no significant changes in either GLUT1 mRNA levels or total protein expression in ATP-depleted cells. PCR data also indicate that GLUT1 appears to be the only GLUT isoform expressed at significant levels in bEnd.3 cells. Plasma membrane protein biotinylation studies show that GLUT1 levels are increased at the plasma membrane by 2–2.5-fold within 10 min of treatment with either KCN or FCCP. These findings suggest that metabolic depletion of brain microvasculature endothelial cells results in AMPK activation, which in turn may induce net GLUT1 translocation to the cell membrane.Immunoblot analysis of the GLUT1 content of bEnd.3 cell total lysates and streptavidin pulldowns of biotinylated membrane proteins indicate that two GLUT1 C-terminal antibody-reactive species are present as follows: a minor 48-kDa protein and a more broadly mobile 55-kDa species. Both species collapse into a 42-kDa species upon treatment with the glycosidase peptide:N-glycosidase F suggesting that each corresponds to a differentially glycosylated form of GLUT1. Similar behavior is observed for human red cell GLUT1 (41Gorga F.R. Baldwin S.A. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (43Kumagai A.K. Dwyer K.J. Pardridge W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cell surface levels of the 48-kDa species are unaffected by metabolic depletion, whereas surface levels of the 55-kDa species are significantly increased giving rise to an approximate 2–3-fold increase in total cell surface GLUT1.It is interesting to compare our findings using cultured bEnd.3 cells with transport studies in polarized endothelial cells. Rat blood-brain barrier glucose transport is acutely stimulated during seizure, and immunohistochemical analysis suggests that this results from recruitment of intracellular GLUT1 to both luminal and abluminal endothelial cell membranes (44Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Cornford M.E. Landaw E.M. Delgado-Escueta A.V. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This being the case, our demonstration of GLUT1 recruitment in an unpolarized endothelial cell is not only representative of recruitment in a polarized bEND cell in vivo but may also uniquely provide the tools for detailed biochemical analysis of this phenomenon.Earlier immunohistochemical analyses of GLUT1 expression in rat bEND cells in situ suggesting an asymmetric (1:4) distribution of GLUT1 between luminal and abluminal membranes (45Simpson I.A. Vannucci S.J. DeJoseph M.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12725-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) appear to be incorrect. Rather, GLUT1 is equally distributed between luminal and abluminal membranes (8Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). If stimulation of trans-capillary transport involves GLUT1 recruitment to luminal and abluminal endothelial membranes, polarized GLUT1 expression in bEND cells would significantly impact net transport stimulation.Our analysis (9Simpson I.A. Carruthers A. Vannucci S.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 1766-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 46Mangia S. Simpson I.A. Vannucci S.J. Carruthers A. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) indicates that starting from an equal distribution of carriers in luminal and abluminal membranes, increasing abluminal or luminal [GLUT1] in the absence of a commensurate increase at the trans-membrane would be without impact on net trans-endothelial cell sugar transport because the transport capacity of the membrane containing the fewest numbers of transporters remains rate-limiting. Polarized GLUT1 expression in the blood-brain barrier endothelium only makes sense if one membrane (e.g. the luminal membrane) contains many more transporters than the abluminal membrane and regulation involves up-regulation at the abluminal membrane. The available evidence argues against this (8Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar).In summary, acute metabolic depletion of murine bEnd.3 cells results in AMPK phosphorylation, GLUT1 recruitment to the cell membrane, and increased sugar transport. This may allow endothelial cells to respond rapidly with increased blood-brain barrier sugar transport in locally hypoxic or metabolically stressed regions of the brain. The exact nature of the involvement of AMPK in GLUT1 regulation in bEnd.3 cells requires further investigation. IntroductionThe cells of the mammalian brain do not contain large stores of glycogen. It is therefore essential that glucose uptake by the brain exceeds glucose utilization to maintain proper brain function. To enter the brain, serum glucose must cross the blood-brain barrier, an epithelium comprising endothelial cells connected by tight junctions that prevent paracellular diffusion of glucose and other nutrients. Thus, glucose transport into the brain requires trans-endothelial cell transport. This process is catalyzed by the glucose transport protein GLUT1, which is expressed at both luminal and abluminal membranes of the endothelium (1Flier J.S. Mueckler M. McCall A.L. Lodish H.F. J.

https://openalex.org/W2076200106,"Cell surface carbohydrates play an important role in virus entry and intracellular trafficking. Bovine Adeno-Associated Virus (BAAV) uses plasma membrane gangliosides for transduction and infection. In addition, independent of the infectious pathway, BAAV also has the ability to pass through barrier epithelia and endothelia using a transcytosis pathway dependent upon the presence of cell surface carbohydrates. Thus, in order to better define the carbohydrate interactions that are necessary for BAAV infection or transcytosis, a glycan microarray composed of both natural and synthetic carbohydrates was probed with HA-tagged BAAV particles. This identified chitotriose, a trimer of beta-1-4-linked N-acetyl glucosamine, as having an interaction with BAAV. Competition experiments showed that the BAAV interaction with this carbohydrate is not necessary for infection but is instead important in the transcytosis pathway. The beta-1-4-linked N-acetyl glucosamine modification has been reported on gp96, a glycoprotein involved in the transcytosis of bacteria and toxins. Significantly, immunoprecipitation and competition experiments with an anti-gp96 antibody and a soluble form of gp96, respectively, showed this glycoprotein can also interact with BAAV to serve as a receptor for its transcytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2087338676,"Background The objective of this study was to enhance removal of fishing gear from right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) at sea that evade disentanglement boat approaches. Titrated intra muscular injections to achieve sedation were undertaken on two free swimming right whales. Methodology/Principal Findings Following initial trials with beached whales, a sedation protocol was developed for right whales. Mass was estimated from sighting and necropsy data from comparable right whales. Midazolam (0.01 to 0.025 mg/kg) was first given alone or with meperidine (0.17 to 0.25 mg/kg) either once or four times over two hours to whale #1102 by cantilevered pole syringe. In the last attempt on whale #1102 there appeared to be a mild effect in 20–30 minutes, with duration of less than 2 hours that included exhalation before the blowhole fully cleared the water. Boat avoidance, used as a measure of sedation depth, was not reduced. A second severely entangled animal in 2009, whale #3311, received midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) followed by butorphanol (0.03 mg/kg) an hour later, delivered ballistically. Two months later it was then given midazolam (0.07 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.07 mg/kg) simultaneously. The next day both drugs at 0.1 mg/kg were given as a mixture in two darts 10 minutes apart. The first attempt on whale #3311 showed increased swimming speed and boat avoidance was observed after a further 20 minutes. The second attempt on whale #3311 showed respiration increasing mildly in frequency and decreasing in strength. The third attempt on whale #3311 gave a statistically significant increase in respiratory frequency an hour after injection, with increased swimming speed and marked reduction of boat evasion that enabled decisive cuts to entangling gear. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that butorphanol and midazolam delivered ballistically in appropriate dosages and combinations may have merit in future refractory free swimming entangled right whale cases until other entanglement solutions are developed."
https://openalex.org/W1985362216,"Glucose homeostasis is maintained by a balance between hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose utilization. In skeletal muscle cells, glucose utilization is primarily regulated by glucose uptake. Deprivation of cellular energy induces the activation of regulatory proteins and thus glucose uptake. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to play a significant role in the regulation of energy balances. However, the mechanisms related to the AMPK-mediated control of glucose uptake have yet to be elucidated.Here, we found that AMPK-induced phospholipase D1 (PLD1) activation is required for (14)C-glucose uptake in muscle cells under glucose deprivation conditions. PLD1 activity rather than PLD2 activity is significantly enhanced by glucose deprivation. AMPK-wild type (WT) stimulates PLD activity, while AMPK-dominant negative (DN) inhibits it. AMPK regulates PLD1 activity through phosphorylation of the Ser-505 and this phosphorylation is increased by the presence of AMP. Furthermore, PLD1-S505Q, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant, shows no changes in activity in response to glucose deprivation and does not show a significant increase in (14)C-glucose uptake when compared to PLD1-WT. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of PLD1 is important for the regulation of (14)C-glucose uptake. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is stimulated by AMPK-induced PLD1 activation through the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), which is a product of PLD. An ERK pharmacological inhibitor, PD98059, and the PLD inhibitor, 1-BtOH, both attenuate (14)C-glucose uptake in muscle cells. Finally, the extracellular stresses caused by glucose deprivation or aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR; AMPK activator) regulate (14)C-glucose uptake and cell surface glucose transport (GLUT) 4 through ERK stimulation by AMPK-mediated PLD1 activation.These results suggest that AMPK-mediated PLD1 activation is required for (14)C-glucose uptake through ERK stimulation. We propose that the AMPK-mediated PLD1 pathway may provide crucial clues to understanding the mechanisms involved in glucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2016983155,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the endolysosomal system is a novel intracellular Ca(2+) pool mobilized by the second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). Although lysosomes in neurons are known to proliferate in numerous neurodegenerative diseases and during the normal course of aging, little is known concerning the effect of lysosomal proliferation on Ca(2+) homeostasis. Here, we induce proliferation of lysosomes in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells through chronic treatment with the cathepsin inhibitor, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone. We demonstrate that lysosome proliferation increases the size of the lysosomal Ca(2+) pool and enhances Ca(2+) signals in response to direct cellular delivery of NAADP and glutamate, an identified NAADP-producing agonist. Our data suggest that deregulated lysosomal Ca(2+) signaling through NAADP may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and highlight the usefulness of lysosomal hydrolase inhibition in probing NAADP action."
https://openalex.org/W2092462864,"Female animals often prefer males with conspicuous traits because these males provide direct or indirect benefits. Conspicuous male traits, however, can attract predators. This not only increases the risk of predation for conspicuous males but also for the females that prefer them. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, males that produce preferred song types provide females with greater material benefits, but they are also more likely to attract lethal parasitoid flies. First, we conducted a field experiment that tested the hypothesis that females have a greater risk of fly parasitism when in association with preferred high chirp rate males. Females were nearly twice as likely to be parasitized when caged with high chirp rate song than when caged with low chirp rate song. Females may thus be forced to trade off the quality of the benefits they receive from mating with preferred males and the risk of being killed by a predator when near these males. Second, we assessed female parasitism rates in a natural population. Up to 6% of the females were parasitized in field samples. Because the females we collected could have become parasitized had they not been collected, this provides a minimum estimate of the female parasitism rate in the field. In a laboratory study, we found no difference in the proportion of time parasitized and unparasitized females spent hiding under shelters; thus, differences in activity patterns do not appear to have biased our estimate of female parasitism rates. Overall, our results suggest that female association costs have the potential to shape the evolution of female mating preferences."

The heme cofactor of α1β1 sGC has a high affinity for NO but has never been observed to form a complex with oxygen. Introduction of a key tyrosine residue in the sGC heme binding domain β1(1–385) is sufficient to produce an oxygen-binding protein, but this mutation in the full-length enzyme did not alter oxygen affinity. To evaluate ligand binding specificity in full-length sGC we mutated several conserved distal heme pocket residues (β1 Val-5, Phe-74, Ile-145, and Ile-149) to introduce a hydrogen bond donor in proximity to the heme ligand. We found that the NO coordination state, NO dissociation, and enzyme activation were significantly affected by the presence of a tyrosine in the distal heme pocket; however, the stability of the reduced porphyrin and the proteins affinity for oxygen were unaltered. Recently, an atypical sGC from Drosophila, Gyc-88E, was shown to form a stable complex with oxygen. Sequence analysis of this protein identified two residues in the predicted heme pocket (tyrosine and glutamine) that may function to stabilize oxygen binding in the atypical cyclase. The introduction of these residues into the rat β1 distal heme pocket (Ile-145 → Tyr and Ile-149 → Gln) resulted in an sGC construct that oxidized via an intermediate with an absorbance maximum at 417 nm. This absorbance maximum is consistent with globin FeII-O2 complexes and is likely the first observation of a FeII-O2 complex in the full-length α1β1 protein.

NO induced activation of sGC is critical to several physiological processes, including neurotransmission, vasodilation, and platelet aggregation (1Münzel T. Feil R. Mülsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F.

The α1β1 heterodimer is the most prevalent and commonly studied protein. Despite the same histidine ligated heme and iron oxidation state as found in the globins, sGC shows no measurable affinity for O2 and therefore can selectively bind NO in the presence of O2 (reviewed in Refs. 6Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not only does sGC discriminate against O2 binding to the heme, but both the FeII-unligated and FeII-NO species are stable in an aerobic environment (8Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast to other hemoproteins that readily bind and ultimately react with O2 (9Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Pub.

The mechanism by which sGC discriminates against O2 binding as well as the molecular events that lead to activation remain to be elucidated. There have been several proposals on the mechanism of ligand discrimination in sGC (7Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Boon E.M.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and most recently a model was developed based on the crystal structure of a sGC heme domain homologue from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Tt) (see Fig. 1) (15Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. P. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This protein is part of the heme-nitric oxide and oxygen (H-NOX) binding family, the members of which all share sequence homology with the heme domain (residues 1–190 of the rat β1 subunit) of sGC. The crystal structure revealed that Tt H-NOX stabilizes O2 binding via a hydrogen bonding network primarily involving a tyrosine and a tryptophan (Tyr-145 and Trp-9 as defined by the rat numbering system, see alignment (Fig. 1)). An asparagine residue (Asn74) is also involved in this hydrogen bonding network, but site-directed mutagenesis has shown that Asn-74 is less critical than Tyr-145 and Trp-9 for O2 stabilization (13Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on multiple sequence alignments, α1β1 sGC lacks these hydrogen bonding residues, and therefore it was proposed that the lack of these amino acids contributes to the ability of sGC to discriminate against O2 binding (13Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This proposal was called into question in recent reports that showed that the introduction of a tyrosine in the β1 subunit at a position that aligns with Tt H-NOX Tyr-145 in full-length sGC does not yield an O2-binding protein (17Martin E. Berka V. Bogatenkova E. Murad F. Tsai A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27836-27845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Rothkegel C. Schmidt P.M. Stoll F. Schröder H. Schmidt H.H. Stasch J.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) despite the fact that this point mutant in the sGC heme-binding construct β1(1–385) was able to bind O2 (13Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To further evaluate O2 binding in sGC we examined several predicted sGCs by multiple sequence alignments and homology modeling (Fig. 1). Several sGCs that do contain a tyrosine that aligns with the Tt H-NOX Tyr-145 are found in organisms ranging from insects like Drosophila melanogaster (19Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50651-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to vertebrate fish such as Oncorhynchus mykiss. Based on the presence of this tyrosine it is predicted that these sGCs have the potential to bind O2, and indeed one such protein, Gyc-88E from D. melanogaster, has been isolated and shown to bind O2 (20Huang S.H. Rio D.C. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15115-15122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like some GAF domain-containing proteins (DevS (21Ioanoviciu A. Meharenna Y.T. Poulos T.L.

Although these atypical O2-binding sGCs, like Gyc-88E, lack the tryptophan and asparagine known to be important for O2 binding in Tt H-NOX, multiple sequence alignments suggest another possible hydrogen bond donor is present in the heme distal pocket: glutamine. A homology model of Gyc-88E suggests that this glutamine is in proximity to both the distal pocket tyrosine and O2 bound to the heme. Additionally, this residue is conserved in sGCs that contain a tyrosine in the predicted heme distal pocket. Based on the presence of both a tyrosine and a glutamine in the predicted heme distal pocket of Gyc-88E, and the precedence of tyrosine/glutamine hydrogen bonding networks in other heme-binding proteins (26Martí M.A. Capece L.

Significantly, we found that the reactivity of α1β1 sGC with O2 was altered with the introduction of the proposed Gyc-88E hydrogen bonding network (tyrosine/glutamine), but not the Tt H-NOX hydrogen bonding network (tyrosine/tryptophan). These data support the hypothesis that the lack of a hydrogen bonding network in the sGC distal heme pocket is critical to the mechanism of ligand discrimination in non O2-binding sGCs. Additionally, this report evaluates sGC activation after mutagenesis of conserved heme pocket residues that are proposed to play an important role in maintaining the proteins heme conformation (16Pellicena P.

Sf9 cells were obtained from the Dept. of Molecular and Cell Biology Tissue Culture Facility, University of California, Berkeley. Rat sGC α1β1 was purified as described previously (29Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 3-(5′-Hydroxymethyl-3′-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) and the NO donor diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA/NO) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. CO gas was from Praxair. Mutants of full-length rat β1 were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The accuracy of each substitution was verified by sequencing (University of California, Berkeley DNA Sequencing Facility). The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to generate recombinant baculovirus according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf9 cells were cultured, and recombinant sGC mutants were purified according to a previously published protocol (29Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The protein purity of all sGC mutants was assessed by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and was routinely greater than 95%. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Microassay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The sGC purification was slightly modified for sGC α1β1 I145Y/I149Q due to the instability of the construct under standard purification conditions. The cell pellet from 5 liters of Sf9 expression cultures was lysed, and the supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) as described previously. The fractions containing sGC were pooled and exchanged into buffer A (25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) before loading onto a prepacked POROS HQ2 anion-exchange column (Applied Biosystems). A gradient was developed from 150 mm to 500 mm NaCl, and purified sGC was collected and pooled. sGC α1β1 F74Y and I145Y/I149Q were isolated with a sub-stoichiometric amount of heme. To reconstitute these proteins 1.5 equivalents of hemin was added to the protein and the sample was left on ice for 12 h to allow the solution to equilibrate. Excess hemin was then removed by applying the sample to a PD-10 column equilibrated with buffer A for sGC α1β1 I145Y/I149Q or buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) for sGC α1β1 F74Y. Heme stoichiometry was determined as described previously (30Woodward J.J. Martin N.I. Marletta M.A. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These proteins were characterized both as isolated and after heme reconstitution to ensure the procedure did not affect protein activity or ligand binding characteristics. Absorption spectra were collected on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer with a Neslab RTE-100 temperature controller set at 20 °C. Spectra were collected over the range of 250–700 nm at 600 nm/min with a 1 nm data point interval. Reduced (ferrous, FeII) sGC and the FeII-CO and FeII-NO complexes were examined. As purified, most constructs were in the FeII-unligated state. If the protein as isolated was oxidized (ferric, FeIII), it was reduced by adding 1 mm dithionite in an anaerobic chamber (Coy), and then excess dithionite was removed by three cycles of dilution/concentration using a 10K Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) into 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. The sGC FeII-CO complex was formed by flushing CO(g) over sGC in the FeII-unligated state in a sealed anaerobic cuvette. The FeII-NO complex was formed by adding 100 μm DEA/NO to FeII-sGC. After forming the FeII-NO complex, the effect of temperature on the coordination state was examined. In these experiments the temperature was varied between 5 and 50 °C in the presence and absence of the substrate GTP (1 mm) or the allosteric sGC activator YC-1 (150 μm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2. Duplicate end-point assays were performed at 37 °C as previously described (31Derbyshire E.R. Tran R. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16257-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A 10 mm DEA/NO solution was prepared in 10 mm NaOH and a 15 mm YC-1 solution was prepared in DMSO. NO (100 μm DEA/NO) or CO(g) was added to sGC (233 nm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl in an anaerobic cuvette. After complex formation was confirmed by electronic absorption spectroscopy the protein was added to an assay mixture to initiate the enzyme reaction. The final assay contained 0.2 μg of enzyme in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm GTP, and 150 μm YC-1 where indicated. All assays were in a final volume of 100 μl and had a concentration of 2% DMSO, which was shown not to affect enzyme activity. Reactions were quenched after 3 min by the addition of 400 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. cGMP quantification was carried out using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit, Format B (Biomol), per the manufacturer's instructions. Each experiment was repeated 2–4 times to ensure reproducibility. Dissociation of NO from the heme of sGC was measured at 25 °C using the CO/dithionite trapping method described previously (29Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The final concentration of Na2S2O4 in the reaction mixture was 30 mm, and the final sGC concentration was 1.3 μm. The reaction was monitored by electronic absorption spectroscopy using a Cary 3E spectrophotometer equipped with a Neslab RTE-100 temperature controller. Data were collected over the range of 380–450 nm at 909 nm/min with a 1.5 nm data point interval. Spectra were recorded every 18 s for 5 min, every 1 min for 10 min, and every 2 min thereafter for a total of 3 h, or until the reaction was complete. A buffer baseline was subtracted from each spectrum, and spectra were corrected for baseline drift by normalization to an isosbestic point at ∼410 nm. Values for the change in absorbance at 424 nm were extracted from the difference spectra and plotted versus time to obtain dissociation time courses for each experiment. Data were fit to single and double exponential equations. ∆At=∆AT(1-e-k1t)(Eq. 1) ∆At=∆A1(1-e-k1t)+∆A2(1-e-k2t)(Eq. 2) The stability of FeII α1β1 I145Y/I149Q in the presence of O2 was examined with electronic absorption spectroscopy. sGC was reduced as described above and buffer-exchanged into 25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. Protein (600 nm in 75 μl) in an anaerobic cuvette was monitored over time after the addition of 20 μl of O2-saturated buffer at 10 °C. The change in the absorbance maximum versus time was plotted, and the data were fit to a single exponential (Equation 1). The inability of sGC α1β1 to bind O2 enables the protein to function as a selective NO sensor. Despite predictions based on H-NOX proteins, the reactivity of the α1β1 heterodimer toward O2 was not affected by mutation of β1 isoleucine 145 to tyrosine (17Martin E. Berka V. Bogatenkova E. Murad F. Tsai A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27836-27845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of ligand discrimination in sGC several sGC mutants were examined to test the importance of a single tyrosine and a hydrogen bonding network in the heme distal pocket. To first probe the effects of a single distal pocket tyrosine on the ligand-binding properties of full-length sGC, the β1 mutants V5Y, F74Y, I145Y, and I149Y were purified as heterodimers and characterized. Like the wild-type protein, all of these constructs were isolated in the FeII-unligated state, and they did not oxidize in air or form a complex with O2. The ratio of apo- to heme-bound protein (RZ value) was estimated from the ratio of the absorbance of the reduced protein at ∼431 nm to 280 nm and was used as a measure of heme affinity (Table 1). Assuming the changes in the extinction coefficients of the mutants are small, the ratio of apo- to heme-bound protein can be compared among the constructs to evaluate relative heme affinity. Most of the single distal pocket tyrosine mutants had RZ values that were slightly lower than the wild-type protein (Table 1). However, α1β1 F74Y had a very low RZ value (RZ ∼ 0.15) indicating the protein was isolated with significantly less heme. The mutant was reconstituted with heme to yield a protein that bound ∼1 equivalent of heme (RZ = 0.70). α1β1 F74Y exhibited similar ligand-binding properties pre- and post-reconstitution and was enzymatically active (see below), which suggests that the procedure did not disrupt the heme binding pocket. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutants formed stable complexes with both NO and CO. Generally, 6-coordinate CO complexes were characterized by Soret absorbance maxima at 420 or 423 nm, but significant variability was observed in the α/β bands (Table 1). This indicates that the α and β bands of sGC FeII-CO complexes are sensitive to substitutions made within the distal heme pocket.TABLE 1Electronic absorption peak positions for various α1β1 sGC heme pocket mutants at 20 °CMutationsGC stateCoordination stateSoretα/βaThese bands were estimated based on positions in two to three spectra collected with 800 nm protein.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the electronic absorption maxima for the FeII-NO complexes showed significant variation (Table 1). Both α1β1 V5Y and α1β1 I149Y formed a 5-coordinate NO complex, like the wild-type protein, while α1β1 F74Y and α1β1 I145Y formed a mixture of a 5- and 6-coordinate NO complexes. The sGC homologues L2 H-NOX and Tt H-NOX bind NO as a mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate complexes. Extensive characterization of these proteins revealed that the equilibrium between the 5- and 6-coordinate states could be thermally shifted (32Boon E.M. Davis J.H. Tran R. Karow D.S. Huang S.H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21892-21902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); increasing temperature led to the breaking of the Fe-His bond thus increasing the population of 5-coordinate FeII-NO. The temperature dependence of the NO coordination state in both α1β1 F74Y and α1β1 I145Y (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1) was examined. In agreement with results obtained with L2 H-NOX and Tt H-NOX, the population of 5-coordinate FeII-NO increased in a temperature-dependent manner. This thermal equilibrium provided a new method to test the proposal that both substrate (GTP) and a sGC activator (YC-1) weaken the sGC Fe-His bond (33Li Z.Q. Pal B. Takenaka S. Tsuyama S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol.

If GTP and YC-1 weaken the Fe-His bond, we would expect an increase in the population of 5-coordinate FeII-NO after addition of the compounds. Fig. 3 shows that 1 mm GTP and 150 μm YC-1 led to an increase in the 5-coordinate FeII-NO complex that is characterized by a Soret absorbance maximum at 399 nm in both α1β1 F74Y and α1β1 I145Y at all temperatures examined (5–50 °C). This result is in agreement with observations based on resonance Raman spectroscopy (33Li Z.Q. Pal B. Takenaka S. Tsuyama S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Makino R. Obayashi E. Homma N. Shiro Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The precise location of the allosteric substrate and YC-1 binding site remains to be determined, although there is evidence that YC-1 binds to the N terminus of the α1 subunit (35Stasch J.P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schröder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M. Nature. 2001; 410: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the sGC allosteric GTP site is contained on the C terminus, within a proposed pseudosymmetric site (36Chang F.J. Lemme S. Sun Q. Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. J. Biol.

Although additional work is necessary to confirm these binding sites, it is clear that these compounds induce a conformational change within the heme pocket. Furthermore, the results reported here confirm that both GTP and YC-1 weaken the Fe-His bond when NO is bound to the heme. The effect of a distal pocket hydrogen bond donor on the dissociation of NO from the α1β1 heme was also examined. Previously, NO dissociation from sGC was found to be complex and required two exponentials to fit the data in both the rat (29Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

To account for this observation it was proposed that the sGC FeII-NO complex is a mixture of two different 5-coordinate species (Scheme 1). One species has a higher activity with a faster NO dissociation rate (heme-NO5C), and the other species has a lower activity and slowly releases NO (heme-NO*5C). Further discussion of this model for NO dissociation from sGC can be found in a previous report (29Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, analogous models have been proposed to explain multiple exponentials observed for ligand binding to hexacoordinate globins (40Trent 3rd, J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S.

A CO/dithionite trap was used to measure NO dissociation from wild-type sGC and the β1 mutants V5Y, F74Y, I145Y, and I149Y at 25 °C. Plots of NO dissociation time courses for these constructs are shown in Fig. 4. The data for wild-type sGC and the β1 mutants V5Y, F74Y, and I145Y were fit to a two-exponential equation (Table 2), but the dissociation of NO from α1β1 I149Y was too slow to accurately measure. This indicates that sGC α1β1 I149Y forms a very stable complex with NO, and there was no significant dissociation even"

https://openalex.org/W1995646041,"Background CD56+ T cells are abundant in liver and play an important role in host innate immunity against viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a common infection among heroin abusers. We thus investigated the in vivo impact of heroin use or heroin use plus HCV infection on the CD56+ T cell frequency and function. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 37 heroin users with (17) or without (20) HCV infection and 17 healthy subjects were included in the study. Although there was no significant difference in CD56+ T cell frequency in PBMCs among three study groups, CD56+ T cells isolated from the heroin users had significantly lower levels of constitutive interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) expression than those from the normal subjects. In addition, when stimulated by interleukin (IL)-12, CD56+ natural T cells from HCV-infected heroin users produced significantly lower levels of IFN-γ than those from the normal subjects. This diminished ability to produce IFN-γ by CD56+ T cells was associated with the increased plasma HCV viral loads in the HCV-infected heroin users. Investigation of the mechanisms showed that although heroin use or heroin use plus HCV infection had little impact on the expression of the key positive regulators (IL-12 receptors, STAT-1, 3, 4, 5, JAK-2, and TYK-2) in IL-12 pathway, heroin use or heroin use plus HCV infection induced the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling protein-3 (SOCS-3) and protein inhibitors of activated STAT-3 (PIAS-3), two key inhibitors of IL-12 pathway. Conclusion/Significance These findings provide compelling in vivo evidence that heroin use or heroin use plus HCV infection impairs CD56+ T cell-mediated innate immune function, which may account for HCV infection and persistence in liver."

Despite pulmonary microvascular dysfunction being implicated in the pathogenesis of several pulmonary vascular conditions, there are currently no techniques for the specific assessment of pulmonary microvascular integrity in humans. Peak hyperemic flow assessment using thermodilution-derived mean transit-time (T(mn)) facilitate accurate coronary microcirculatory evaluation, but remain unvalidated in the lung circulation. Using a high primate model, we aimed to explore the use of T(mn) as a surrogate of pulmonary blood flow for the purpose of measuring the novel indices Pulmonary Flow Reserve [PFR = (maximum hyperemic)/(basal flow)] and Pulmonary Index of Microcirculatory Resistance [PIMR = (maximum hyperemic distal pulmonary artery pressure)x(maximum hyperemic T(mn))]. Ultimately, we aimed to investigate the effect of progressive pulmonary microvascular obstruction on PFR and PIMR.Temperature- and pressure-sensor guidewires (TPSG) were placed in segmental pulmonary arteries (SPA) of 13 baboons and intravascular temperature measured. T(mn) and hemodynamics were recorded at rest and following intra-SPA administration of the vasodilator agents adenosine (10-400 microg/kg/min) and papaverine (3-24 mg). Temperature did not vary with intra-SPA sensor position (0.010+/-0.009 v 0.010+/-0.009 degrees C; distal v proximal; p = 0.1), supporting T(mn) use in lung for the purpose of hemodynamic indices derivation. Adenosine (to 200 microg/kg/min) & papaverine (to 24 mg) induced dose-dependent flow augmentations (40+/-7% & 35+/-13% T(mn) reductions v baseline, respectively; p<0.0001). PFR and PIMR were then calculated before and after progressive administration of ceramic microspheres into the SPA. Cumulative microsphere doses progressively reduced PFR (1.41+/-0.06, 1.26+/-0.19, 1.17+/-0.07 & 1.01+/-0.03; for 0, 10(4), 10(5) & 10(6) microspheres; p = 0.009) and increased PIMR (5.7+/-0.6, 6.3+/-1.0, 6.8+/-0.6 & 7.6+/-0.6 mmHg.sec; p = 0.0048).Thermodilution-derived mean transit time can be accurately and reproducibly measured in the pulmonary circulation using TPSG. Mean transit time-derived PFR and PIMR can be assessed using a TPSG and adenosine or papaverine as hyperemic agents. These novel indices detect progressive pulmonary microvascular obstruction and thus have with a potential role for pulmonary microcirculatory assessment in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2043618419,"In many microbes rapid mutation of highly mutable contingency genes continually replenishes a pool of variant alleles from which the most suitable are selected, assisting in rapid adaptation and evasion of the immune response. In some contingency genes mutability is achieved through DNA repeats within the coding region. The fungal human pathogen Candida albicans has 2600 repeat-containing ORFs. For those investigated (ALS genes, HYR1, HYR2, CEK1, RLM1) many protein variants with differing amino acid repeat regions exist, as expected for contingency genes. However, specific alleles dominate in different clades, which is unexpected if allele variation is used for short-term adaptation. Generation of new alleles of repeat-containing C. albicans ORFs has never been observed directly. Here we present evidence for restrictions on the emergence of new alleles in a highly mutable C. albicans repeat-containing ORF, PNG2, encoding a putative secreted or cell surface glycoamidase. In laboratory cultures new PNG2 alleles arose at a rate of 2.8x10(-5) (confidence interval 3.3x10(-6)-9. 9x10(-5)) per cell per division, comparable to rates measured for contingency genes. Among 80 clinical isolates 17 alleles of different length and 23 allele combinations were distinguishable; sequence differences between repeat regions of identical size suggest the existence of 36 protein variants. Specific allele combinations predominated in different genetic backgrounds, as defined by DNA fingerprinting and multilocus sequence typing. Given the PNG2 mutation rate, this is unexpected, unless in different genetic backgrounds selection favors different alleles. Specific alleles or allele combinations were not preferentially associated with C. albicans isolates from particular body sites or geographical regions. Our results suggest that the mutability of PNG2 is not used for short-term adaptation or evasion of the immune system. Nevertheless the large number of alleles observed indicates that mutability of PNG2 may assist C. albicans strains from different genetic backgrounds optimize their interaction with the host in the long term."

So far the corresponding role of S. pombe Dss1p in DNA recombination-repair has not been studied. S. pombe Rad24p belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins that play a significant role as checkpoint factors in monitoring DNA damage in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (15Bruckmann A. Steensma H.Y. Teixeira De Mattos M.J. Van Heusden G.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Hermeking H. Benzinger A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17van Heusden G.P. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18van Heusden G.P. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2006; 23: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Their role in the cell cycle was first demonstrated in S. pombe, where the products of the rad24 and rad25 genes were shown to possess a DNA damage checkpoint function (19Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Neither the rad24 nor the rad25 gene is essential for growth, but simultaneous loss of both genes is lethal (19Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The loss of rad24, but not rad25, leads to premature entry of cells into mitosis, resulting in small, round cells. In addition, the loss of rad24 renders cells highly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, whereas a rad25 null strain is only modestly sensitive (19Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage in the G2 stage, activated Chk1p kinase phosphorylates Cdc25p. Recently Mek1p was shown to phosphorylate Cdc25p independent of Chk1p (20Pérez-Hidalgo L. Moreno S. San-Segundo P.A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Rad24p binds phosphorylated Cdc25p and apparently blocks a nuclear localization signal within Cdc25p. The Rad24p-Cdc25p complex exits the nucleus by using a dedicated nuclear export pathway. It was originally suggested that the “nuclear exclusion” of Cdc25p prevents the dephosphorylation and activation of the target of Cdc25p, Cdc2p, at tyrosine 15 (21Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the exclusion of Cdc25p from the nucleus is not essential for inhibiting cell cycle progression (22Lopez-Girona A. Kanoh J. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 50-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). S. pombe Rae1p is essential for the nuclear export of mRNA and functions in cell cycle progression from G2 to M (23Brown J.A. Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W. Fitzgerald E. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Thakurta A.G. Selvanathan S.P. Patterson A.D. Gopal G. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17507-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the role of Rae1p in the G2/M transition was shown to be independent of its role in mRNA export (25Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Danielewicz D. Dhar R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus far, no role for Rae1p has been implicated in DNA damage. A human homolog of Rae1p was found to be required in metaphase in mitotic spindle assembly. Through its interaction with the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, human Rae1p is thought to be involved in bipolar spindle pole body formation (26Blower M.D. Nachury M. Heald R. Weis K. Cell. 2005; 121: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27Jeganathan K.B. Malureanu L. van Deursen J.M.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19783-19787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whether S. pombe Rae1p plays a similar role remains to be investigated. In this study, by using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method, we found that Rad24p-TAP co-purified Dss1p and Rae1p. Several DNA repair proteins (for example, 19 S proteasomal subunits and Rhp51p) known to interact with Dss1p homologs also co-purified with the Rad24p-TAP fusion. By using an S. pombe strain carrying the S. cerevisiae homothallic switching (HO)endonuclease cleavage site and a plasmid expressing inducible HO-endonuclease (29Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Moser B.A. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to develop evidence that upon DNA damage, Dss1p mediates recruitment of DNA recombination/repair, cell cycle, and checkpoint control proteins to the DNA DSB sites. Finally, we found that Dss1p and Rae1p have a DNA checkpoint function, with Δdss1 cells timing of entry into mitosis indistinguishable from Δrad24 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Dss1p plays a critical role in linking DNA repair and checkpoint factors to damaged sites by recruiting Rad24p and Cdc25p to the DNA DSB sites. We suggest that the recruitment of Cdc25p to the DSB site could lead to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M boundary in S. pombe cells in response to DNA damage. Basic genetic and cell culture techniques have been described previously (30Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast.

As a control for these experiments, pNTAP41 was used. Purification of TAP-tagged proteins was performed by published methods using IgG-Sepharose beads (34Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). The complexes were cleaved from the beads by using TEV-protease. The cleaved fraction was next bound to calmodulin beads, and the bound proteins were eluted by calmodulin elution buffer and precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (34Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Purified samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and associated proteins were identified using tandem mass spectrometry and/or Western blot analysis using specific antibodies (35Ilani T. Khanna C. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Simkus C. Bhattacharyya A. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Jones J.M. Immunology. 2009; 128: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The tandem mass spectrometry data were searched against the S. pombe data base from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute using BioWorks 3.3.1. Polyclonal antibodies to S. pombe mRNA export factors were made by expressing the proteins in Escherichia coli and injecting them into rabbits as previously described (5Thakurta A.G. Gopal G.

Antibodies to S. pombe Rad24p and Rhp51p were made by expressing the full-length rad24 and rhp51 genes in pET14b. Polyclonal antibodies to S. pombe Mts2p were bought from Biomol Research La. Standard chemiluminescent methods (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to detect the purified proteins. ChIP analysis was performed using published protocols (39Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I.

Following cross-linking of proteins to DNA and precipitation by different antibodies, specific primer pairs were used to amplify segments of DNA fragments precipitated by the specific antibodies (Table 2). As a control for amplification, PCR primers (Table 2) that did not amplify the precipitated products were used with each experiment as an internal control. [α-32P]dCTP was added to the PCR. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% Tris/borate/EDTA gel and quantified using phosphorimaging.TABLE 2Primers used in the ChIP experimentsPrimerSequenceChIP 1 (forward)5′-TTTCATTGAGATAGACCACCT-3′ChIP 1 (reverse)5′-CTCTTTCTGTAGCTCGTAAAG-3′ChIP 2 (forward)5′-CCACCAACCTTGATAATAGCG-3′ChIP 2 (reverse)5′-GGCAATGCTTATTGAATTGCA-3′ChIP 3 (forward)5′-TGGCTGAAAATTACATCGGAAACC-3′ChIP 3 (reverse)5′-GAGAAGGGCTTCTTGCCAAAT-3′ChIP 4 (forward)5′-CATCCCTTTTCATTAGTTCTA-3′ChIP 4 (reverse)5′-GTCGACTACAAGGAACCCACA-3′ChIP 5 (forward)5′-CGCAGCTCAGGGGCATGATGT-3′ChIP 5 (reverse)5′-CTGATTGCCCGACATTATCGC-3′ChIP 6 (forward)5′-CTCTTCCGACCATCAAGCATT-3′ChIP 6 (reverse)5′-AATCACCATGAGTGACGACTG-3′ChIP 7 (forward)5′-AACTGCCTCGGTGAGTTTTCT-3′ChIP 7 (reverse)5′-CACATACGATTGACGCATGAT-3′ChIP 8 (forward)5′-CCTCTTAACTAGATATTTCAAGG-3′ChIP 8 (reverse)5′-AAGGAATTGGCGGAAGACAAG-3′ChIP 9 (forward)5′-GTAACCACAAAGGTAGTTTCT-3′ChIP 9 (reverse)5′-AGGGGCTCTAGAACTAATGAG-3′Internal control (forward)5′-CAACAGGAGCGCTATAATAA-3′Internal control (reverse)5′-CAGATAGCTTGGATAGATATG-3′ Open table in a new tab The extracts were prepared from spheroplasts and nuclei according to published protocols (30Alfa C.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3703-3712PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatin-associated fraction was separated from nuclear supernatant by layering the nuclear extract onto 30% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min (41Lygerou Z. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3703-3712PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatin-associated proteins were released by incubation with 277 units of DNase 1 for 10 min at 25 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm Nacl, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (42Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Chromatin-associated protein was identified by Western blot analysis. The rad24 gene was isolated from a genomic library. For expression in bacteria, the rad24 gene was amplified and introduced into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET14b (Novagen) to produce GST and His-tagged Rad24p, respectively. Similarly His-Rhp51p also made with pET14b. Construction of His-tagged fusions of Rae1p and Dss1p were described previously (5Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to UV light was determined by plating 750–1000 cells and irradiating with a Stratagene UV-Stratalinker 2400 at fixed energy levels. The cells were then incubated at 21 °C, and the number of colonies was scored after 5 days. Sensitivity of cells to other DNA-damaging agents was determined by incubating liquid cultures cells in 3 milliunits/ml bleomycin or 0.03% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or 15 mm hydroxyurea (HU) (43Enoch T. Carr A.M. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 44Morishita T. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell.

In parallel, control cells were incubated similarly without the addition of any DNA-damaging agent. Following incubation of 500–700 cells on YES plates, the surviving colonies were counted after 5 days. The cells were synchronized by sedimentation through 7–30% lactose gradient and plated on YES medium (46Barbet N.C. Carr A.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The G2 cells were irradiated with 0, 50, 100, and 150 J/m2 UV light in a Stratagene Stratalinker 2400. The control cells were plated on YES medium without exposure to UV radiation. The cells were then resuspended and incubated at 21 °C or at 27 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated times, fixed in methanol at −20 °C, mounted, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and calcofluor, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The cells were judged to have passed mitosis if either nuclear division or septum formation occurred. An S. pombe strain was constructed in which rad24 gene was replaced by a rad24-tap gene fusion. As a negative control, TAP was expressed in wild type cells from a plasmid (pNTAP41) under the control of the nmt1 promoter. Fig. 1A shows a typical TAP-purification experiment using genomic Rad24p-Tap fusion. Compared with the Tap control (left lane), several distinct bands were visible when Rad24-TAP fusion was used to pull down interacting proteins whose identities were established by tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Elongation factors (eIF4G, eIF3a, and eIF3b), cell cycle factors (Cdc15p, Cdc22p, Cdc25p, and Rad25p), and 19 S proteasomal subunits (Mts4p, Rpn5p, Mts2p, and Rpn6p) were pulled down by Rad24p-Tap. DNA repair protein Rhp51p, Dss1p, and mRNA export factor Rae1p also co-purified with Rad24p-Tap fusion. Additional proteins identified using mass spectrometry (not shown in the gel in Fig. 1A) are presented in the supplemental Table 1S. It is notable that only two known mRNA export factors (Rae1p and Dss1p) co-purified with Rad24p-Tap fusion protein. Western blot analysis was used to confirm these results. Fig. 1B shows the Western blot confirming that Rae1p and Dss1p co-purified with Rad24p-TAP but not with TAP alone (compare lane 4 versus lane 3). However, no other known mRNA export factor such as Uap56p, Mlo3p, Nup98p, Nup159p, and Sac3p co-purified with Rad24p-TAP. The absence of interaction with any other known mRNA export factor by Rad24p suggests that its interaction with Rae1p and Dss1p may represent a new complex, distinct from an mRNA export-related protein complex of these two proteins we previously described (5Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By Western analysis we also confirmed interaction between Rad24p and Mts2p and Rhp51p. These results suggest that Rad24p physically interacts with at least some components of the proteasomes and the DNA recombination-repair pathway. We wanted to test whether in S. pombe Dss1p was recruited to DSB sites similar to Sem1p/human Dss1p. For this purpose, we used an S. pombe strain carrying the S. cerevisiae HO-endonuclease site integrated within the arg3 locus (obtained from Paul Russell) (29Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Moser B.A. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6150-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A schematic of the 5.4-kb genomic region surrounding the HO-endonuclease cleavage site (∼2.1 kb upstream to ∼3.2 kb downstream) and specific regions/fragments 1–9 that were amplified by PCR are shown in Fig. 2A (for details see Fig. 2 legend and Table 2). The strain was transformed with a plasmid expressing HO-endonuclease in pJR1–41XH vector under the control of a thiamine repressible nmt1 promoter. By ChIP, DNA-bound proteins were precipitated using anti-Dss1p, anti-Rhp51p, or anti-Mts2p antibody from S. pombe cells in the presence or absence of HO-endonuclease expression. Quantitative PCR was performed to amplify specific fragments (bars 1–9 in Fig. 2A) corresponding to both sides of the HO-endonuclease site as well as from a nontranscribed internal control region (at a different chromosomal locus (24Thakurta A.G. Selvanathan S.P. Patterson A.D. Gopal G. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17507-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) from the immunoprecipitated DNA obtained by antibodies or prebleed sera. Relative fold enrichment of DNA was calculated by using established procedures following the formula shown in Fig. 2B. Based on this calculation, a protein was considered enriched at a region when the DNA fold increase value was above 1 (see details in Fig. 2B legend) (39Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Dss1p recruits to actively transcribed genes in wild type S. pombe cells (5Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the absence of HO-endonuclease (control), in the S. pombe strain carrying the HO site, Dss1p showed a relative fold enrichment above 1 throughout the tested region (that also carried a functional kanamycin gene) (Fig. 2C, panel a data and gray bars in graph). In the cells expressing HO-endonuclease, Dss1p showed a clear pattern of enrichment around the break site. Enrichment was highest near the break site (peak relative enrichment ∼5-fold proximal to the HO site; fragments 4–7) and gradually decreased away from the break site (fragments 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9). Rad51p is known to recruit to DSB site in S. cerevisiae. We therefore tested whether Rhp51p similarly enriched at or around DNA break sites in S. pombe. Following a similar experimental procedure, we found that Rhp51p did not enrich within the test region in the control experiment (Fig. 2C, panel b, gray bars in graph). However, in the cells expressing the HO-endonuclease, there was significant increase in relative fold enrichment of the protein throughout the region (relative enrichment between 3–5-fold; fragments 1–9). Thus, in contrast to Dss1p, the pattern of enrichment shown by Rhp51p was different; it had an elevated level of enrichment both near and away from the break site, perhaps reflecting its nature of interaction with DNA. Proteasomal components are known to recruit to DSB sites. We tested for the recruitment of Mts2p, a component of the proteasomes, to the DSB site. Mts2p was not significantly enriched in cells that did not express the HO-endonuclease (Fig. 2C, panel c, gray bars in graph). Relative fold enrichment of Mts2p was observed in the vicinity of the DSB site (highest enrichment, ∼4.5-fold; Fig. 2C, panel c, black bars in graph, fragments 3–7) similar to the recruitment pattern observed for Dss1p in the strain expressing the HO-endonuclease. These results demonstrate that Dss1p, Rhp51p, and Mts2p are recruited preferentially surrounding the region of a DSB site introduced into the S. pombe cells, consistent with observations made with their homologs (12Krogan N.J. Lam M.H. Fillingham J. Keogh M.C. Gebbia M. Li J. Datta N. Cagney G. Buratowski S. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2094397762,"Activation of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) by transducin is the central event of visual signal transduction. How the PDE6 inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ) interacts with the catalytic subunits (Pαβ) and the transducin α-subunit (αt) in this process is not entirely clear. Here we have investigated this issue, taking advantage of site-specific label transfer from throughout the full-length Pγ molecule to both αt and Pαβ. The interaction profiling and pull-down experiments revealed that the Pγ C- terminal domain accounted for the major interaction with αt bound with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (αtGTPγS) in comparison with the central region, whereas an opposite pattern was observed for the Pγ-Pαβ interaction. This complementary feature was further exhibited when both αtGTPγS and Pαβ were present and competing for Pγ interaction, with the Pγ C-terminal domain favoring αt, whereas the central region demonstrated a preference for Pαβ. Furthermore, αtGTPγS co-immunoprecipitated with PDE6 and vice versa in a Pγ-dependent manner. Either Pαβ or αtGTPγS could be pulled down by the Btn-Pγ molecules on streptavidin beads that were saturated by the other partner, indicating simultaneous binding of these two partners to Pγ. These data together indicate that complementary Pγ interactions with its two targets facilitate the αt·PDE6 “transducisome” formation. Thus, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PDE6 activation. Activation of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) by transducin is the central event of visual signal transduction. How the PDE6 inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ) interacts with the catalytic subunits (Pαβ) and the transducin α-subunit (αt) in this process is not entirely clear. Here we have investigated this issue, taking advantage of site-specific label transfer from throughout the full-length Pγ molecule to both αt and Pαβ. The interaction profiling and pull-down experiments revealed that the Pγ C- terminal domain accounted for the major interaction with αt bound with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (αtGTPγS) in comparison with the central region, whereas an opposite pattern was observed for the Pγ-Pαβ interaction. This complementary feature was further exhibited when both αtGTPγS and Pαβ were present and competing for Pγ interaction, with the Pγ C-terminal domain favoring αt, whereas the central region demonstrated a preference for Pαβ. Furthermore, αtGTPγS co-immunoprecipitated with PDE6 and vice versa in a Pγ-dependent manner. Either Pαβ or αtGTPγS could be pulled down by the Btn-Pγ molecules on streptavidin beads that were saturated by the other partner, indicating simultaneous binding of these two partners to Pγ. These data together indicate that complementary Pγ interactions with its two targets facilitate the αt·PDE6 “transducisome” formation. Thus, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PDE6 activation. IntroductionThe intricate visual transduction in rod photoreceptor cells provides a paradigm for G protein-coupled signaling. The outstanding visual sensitivity of the rod is largely due to the great signal amplification achieved by the cGMP 2The abbreviations used are: cGMPcyclic GMPαttransducin α-subunitPαβPDE6 catalytic heterodimerGAFa domain derived from cGMP phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, and the Escherichia coli protein Fh1APγPDE6 inhibitory subunitGAPGTPase-activating proteinACTPN-[3-iodo-4-azidophenylpropioamido-S-(2-thiopyridyl)]cysteinemBP4-(N-maleimido)benzophenoneHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyROSrod outer segmentDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. phosphodiesterase PDE6 (rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase), the central effector enzyme (1Cote R.H. Photoreceptor Phosphodiesterase (PDE6): A G-protein-activated PDE Regulating Visual Excitation in Rod and Cone Photoreceptor Cells. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2006: 165-193Google Scholar). Upon absorption of a single photon, light-excited rhodopsin stimulates an exchange of GTP for GDP bound in the transducin α subunit (αt) (2Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), which in turn relieves PDE6 from the inhibitory constraint exerted by its γ-subunit (Pγ). PDE6 activation causes rapid cGMP breakdown, which closes the cGMP-coupled ion channels, thus relaying visual signals to the brain in a form of electrical pulses (3Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PDE6 in the rod is uniquely composed of a large catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ, ∼100 kDa each subunit) to which bind two small identical Pγ subunits (∼10 kDa) keeping the enzyme inactive in the dark (1Cote R.H. Photoreceptor Phosphodiesterase (PDE6): A G-protein-activated PDE Regulating Visual Excitation in Rod and Cone Photoreceptor Cells. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2006: 165-193Google Scholar, 4Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PDE6 structure is less well understood compared with the other key players in phototransduction. This is primarily due to the fact that solving the atomic structure of PDE6 has been hindered by the lack of an expression system to produce active Pαβ heterodimers in large amounts (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A low resolution electron microscopy image of Pαβ has revealed a linear alignment of three distinct domains of each subunit: the tandem GAFa and GAFb domains on the N-terminal side that host non-catalytic cGMP binding and the C-terminal catalytic domain that performs cGMP hydrolysis (6Kameni Tcheudji J.F. Lebeau L. Virmaux N. Maftei C.G. Cote R.H. Lugnier C. Schultz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Direct allosteric communication between GAF domains and the catalytic domain has been recently reported (7Zhang X.J. Cahill K.B. Elfenbein A. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29699-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The inhibitory Pγ subunit is an intrinsically disordered protein, yet structural elements important for its function are encoded in the free Pγ molecule (8Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. Markley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Pγ sequence of 87 amino acids features a polycationic central domain (Gly19–Gly49) and a negatively charged C-terminal half that contains a linker region (Phe50–Gly61) and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain (Thr62–Ile87) (1Cote R.H.

The last C-terminal dozen or so residues (herein termed the inhibitory region) are involved in the interaction with the Pαβ catalytic domain (8Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E.

The very recently reported crystal structure of the chimeric PDE5/6 catalytic domain complexed with the Pγ(70–87) inhibitory peptide (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has confirmed the previous suggestion that the highly hydrophobic C terminus (Y84GII87) directly blocks the cGMP entry into the catalytic pocket (12Artemyev N.O.

The other important Pαβ-interacting site on Pγ is the central domain, which has been shown to provide most of the binding strength for Pαβ (14Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The central domain of Pγ binds to the Pαβ GAF domain (15Muradov K.G. Granovsky A.E. Schey K.L.

Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the C-terminal domain and the central domain also constitute αt-interacting sites (17Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1998; 28: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).An overlap of the Pγ C-terminal αt-binding region (Thr62–Ile87) and the inhibitory region (Asn74–Ile87) forms the structural basis for transducin-mediated PDE6 activation (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. Markley J.L.

Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Various lines of evidence suggest that GTP-bound αt activates PDE6 by physically displacing the inhibitory region of Pγ from the Pαβ catalytic pocket, thus initiating the signaling state of phototransduction (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. Markley J.L.

Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the ensuing transition state, αtGTP is converted back to the GDP-bound inactive structure, which has lowered affinity with Pγ, thus releasing it to reinhibit PDE6 and terminate signaling (3Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Fast visual recovery is ensured by great acceleration of the αt GTPase activity, which is achieved by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex composed of αt, Pγ, RGS9-1 (the ninth member of the regulators of G-protein signaling in photoreceptors), and its constitutive partner Gβ5 as well as the membrane anchoring protein R9AP (3Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Much of the molecular details of the Pγ-αtGTP interaction in the signaling state have been learned from the crystal structure of the partial transition state complex, which includes the GDP-AlF4−-bound αt/i1 chimera, the half-Pγ (Gly46–Ile87), and the catalytic core of RGS9-1 (20Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As visualized by this structure, a stretch of Pγ residues around Trp70 forms a tight interaction with αt that is further reinforced by additional contacts provided by some residues in the Pγ inhibitory region. Recent NMR (8Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. Markley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and crystallography (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) studies indicated that when the Pγ inhibitory region was associated with the chimeric PDE5/6 catalytic domain, the critical αt-binding residues Trp70 and Leu76, however, were not involved. These studies lend further support to a model of PDE6 activation (5Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13209-13215Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); i.e. an engagement of αtGTP with the Pγ residues Trp70 and Leu76 triggers a conformational change involving a hingelike rigid body movement of Pγ(78–87) away from the PDE6 catalytic pocket.Thus, Pγ plays a pivotal role, not only for turning on but also for turning off phototransduction and keeping the signaling system inactive in the dark (9Guo L.W. Ruoho A.E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Despite a wealth of information regarding phototransduction mechanisms, dynamic interactions of Pγ with αt and Pαβ, as well as RGS9-1, are not well understood. There has been controversy as to whether Pγ completely dissociates from Pαβ in the process of PDE6 activation. It is possible that whereas αt sequesters the Pγ C-terminal region from the Pαβ catalytic domain, the central domain of Pγ stays bound to the Pαβ GAF domain until the binding is allosterically reduced by the dissociation of cGMP from the GAF domain (1Cote R.H. Photoreceptor Phosphodiesterase (PDE6): A G-protein-activated PDE Regulating Visual Excitation in Rod and Cone Photoreceptor Cells. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2006: 165-193Google Scholar). This scenario of simultaneous Pγ interactions with both αt and Pαβ is consistent with the proposition of an intermediate αt·PDE6 complex during PDE6 activation (17Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S.

Earlier studies suggested that direct αt-Pαβ contacts may be a driving force in forming the intermediate complex in the presence of disc membranes (24Clerc A. Bennett N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6620-6627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clerc A. Catty P. Bennett N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19948-19953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether the Pγ interactions with αt and Pαβ contribute important elements to the intermediate PDE6 activation complex.As presented in this study, the label transfer approach, which has proven to be powerful for systematically detecting interactions of full-length molecules (16Guo L.W.

The data obtained through label transfer, immunoprecipitation, and pull-down suggest that complementary interactions, in which the Pγ C-terminal domain forms a strong interaction with αt while the central region binds tightly with Pαβ, assist the transducin·PDE6 complex formation, which elicits PDE6 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe chemicals and reagents used in this study were from the sources described previously (16Guo L.W.

The C-terminal Pγ peptide (Pγ(62–87)) was custom-synthesized at the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Biotechnology Center, University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI).Transducin PreparationUsing frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas (J. A. & W. L. Lawson Co.), rod outer segment (ROS) membranes were isolated, from which holotransducin was prepared as described previously (29Grant J.E. Guo L.W. Vestling M.M. Martemyanov K.A.

To prepare αtGTPγS, GTPγS was added to ROS membranes, and αtGTPγS was thus released and purified on the blue Sepharose CL-6B column. The purity of αt was determined to be >95% by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The purified proteins were stored at −80 °C.Preparation of PDE6The samples of bovine PDE6 were kindly provided by Dr. Nikolai O. Artemyev at the University of Iowa and prepared according to established methods (4Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, holo-PDE6 was extracted from bleached ROS membranes, and Pαβ was then obtained by removing Pγ through mild tryptic proteolysis of holo-PDE6. More vigorous tryptic treatment generated the Pαβ heterodimer with a nick at Lys146/Lys147 on Pβ. It has been reported that nicked Pαβ has unaltered functional properties (12Artemyev N.O. Natochin M.

The Pαβ preparations were purified to >95% by a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences), as judged from Coomassie-stained SDS gels.Preparation of Pγ PhotoprobesThe constructs for expressing the full-length wild type Pγ with the single cysteine at position 68 (29Grant J.E.

Full-length Pγ (>95% pure) was used for preparation of Pγ photoprobes. The radioactive [125I]ACTP-Pγ and non-radioactive [127I]ACTP-Pγ photoprobes were prepared as described earlier (28Guo L.W.

Briefly, Pγ was derivatized with mBP in 10–20-fold molar excess, and mBP-Pγ was then separated from unreacted Pγ and free mBP through reversed phase HPLC. Correct molecular masses of the [127I]ACTP-Pγ and mBP-Pγ photoprobes have been confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry conducted at the Chemistry Department Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI).Functional Assay of the Pγ PhotoprobesThe transducin GTPase activity assay was kindly conducted by Dr. Kirill A. Martemyanov (now at the University of Minnesota) and Dr. Vadim Y. Arshavsky (now at Duke University), using a single turnover technique as described previously (32Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32843-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The assay was conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2. The urea-treated ROS membranes, lacking endogenous activity of RGS9-1, were used as a source for the photoexcited rhodopsin required for transducin activation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 0.6 μm [32P]GTP (∼105 dpm/sample) to 20 μl of urea-treated ROS membranes (20 μm final rhodopsin concentration) reconstituted with transducin heterotrimer (1 μm) and recombinant RGS9-1·Gβ5 complex (0.5 μm). The reactions were performed in either the absence or presence of Pγ derivatives (1 μm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. The 32P formation was measured with activated charcoal. All assays were conducted in the absence of reducing agent due to the presence of the disulfide linkage between the photoreactive group and Pγ.Photocross-linking/Label Transfer Using Pγ PhotoprobesA scheme is presented in supplemental Fig. S1A to explain the label transfer strategy. Unless otherwise described, photocross-linking reactions were performed in the HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Samples were contained in ultraclear polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Axygen). The reactions using [125I]ACTP-Pγ photoprobes were exposed to the UV light generated by an AH-6 water-jacketed 1000-watt high pressure mercury lamp for 5 s at a distance of 10 cm (28Guo L.W.

The reactions with mBP-Pγ were photolyzed at 5–10 °C for 2 × 15 min with a 5-min dark interval on ice in an RPR-100 Rayonet photochemical reactor equipped with 18 bulbs of 350 nm (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company). Immediately after photolysis, sample buffer was added to the reactions to final concentrations of 1% SDS and 50 mm DTT.

To prepare Btn-Pγ(46–87), the Pγ 87C mutant was first derivatized with maleimide-PEO2-biotin and then trypsinized, and Btn-Pγ(46–87) was purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C4 column (31Guo L.W.

Purif. 2007; 51: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).For each pull-down reaction, 0.4 μl of Ultra-Link Plus immobilized streptavidin gel (Pierce) was first equilibrated with the pull-down buffer, which contains 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% n-dodecanoylsucrose (Calbiochem), and 50 μg/ml BSA, and then incubated with 4 μm Btn-Pγ by rotating the microcentrifuge tube for 10 min at room temperature. A high concentration (1 μg/μl) of BSA or soybean trypsin inhibitor was added at this step to block possible nonspecific protein-bead interactions. After this incubation, Btn-Pγ was found completely bound to the streptavidin beads (data not shown). To test if the Pγ peptides disrupt the Pγ-αtGTPγS or Pγ-Pαβ interaction, Pγ(62–87) or Pγ(1–61) in excess over Btn-Pγ was first incubated with αtGTPγS or Pαβ in the pull-down buffer for 1 h on ice and then added to the Btn-Pγ-streptavidin beads. After rotating the reactions at 4 °C for 1–2 h, the beads were washed twice with 400 μl of ice-cold pull-down buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads with SDS/DTT-containing sample buffer, run on a low cross-link 15% acrylamide gel (33Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol.

For each reaction, 0.5 μl of His-Select High-Flow nickel beads (Sigma) were first washed with 500 μl of H2O and then with 300 μl of pull-down buffer. HisPγ(1–61) of 5 μm was immobilized to the beads by incubation in the pull-down buffer (supplemented with 1 μg/μl trypsin inhibitor at this step) at room temperature for 10 min on rotating. Twenty mm imidazole was included in the pull-down buffer throughout the experimental procedures to prevent possible nonspecific binding of proteins to nickel beads. After the beads were washed with 2 × 500 μl of pull-down buffer to remove unbound HisPγ(1–61), Pαβ or/and αtGTPγS were added and incubated with the beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with 200 μl of pull-down buffer. The proteins on the beads were eluted with the sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE using a low cross-link 15% gel (33Baehr W.

https://openalex.org/W2067301975,"Chemotaxis is defined as a behavior involving organisms sensing attractants or repellents and leading towards or away from them. Therefore, it is possible to reengineer chemotaxis network to control the movement of bacteria to our advantage. Understanding the design principles of chemotaxis pathway is a prerequisite and an important topic in synthetic biology. Here, we provide guidelines for chemotaxis pathway design by employing control theory and reverse engineering concept on pathway dynamic design. We first analyzed the mathematical models for two most important kinds of E. coli chemotaxis pathway—adaptive and non-adaptive pathways, and concluded that the control units of the pathway de facto function as a band-pass filter and a low-pass filter, respectively, by abstracting the frequency response properties of the pathways. The advantage of the band-pass filter is established, and we demonstrate how to tune the three key parameters of it—A (max amplification), ω1 (down cut-off frequency) and ω2 (up cut-off frequency) to optimize the chemotactic effect. Finally, we hypothesized a similar but simpler version of the dynamic pathway model based on the principles discovered and show that it leads to similar properties with native E. coli chemotactic behaviors. Our study provides an example of simulating and designing biological dynamics in silico and indicates how to make use of the native pathway's features in this process. Furthermore, the characteristics we discovered and tested through reverse engineering may help to understand the design principles of the pathway and promote the design of artificial chemotaxis pathways."

We report here a novel enhancer activity in 5′HS1 that appears to be potent in transfected K562 cells. Deletion analyses identified a core activating element that bound to GATA-1, and a two-nucleotide mutation that disrupted GATA-1 binding in vitro abrogated 5′HS1 enhancer activity in transfection experiments. To determine the in vivo role of this GATA site, we generated multiple lines of human β-globin YAC transgenic mice bearing the same two-nucleotide mutation. In the mutant mice, ϵ-, but not γ-globin, gene expression in primitive erythroid cells was severely attenuated, while adult β-globin gene expression in definitive erythroid cells was unaffected. Interestingly, DNaseI hypersensitivity near the 5′HS1 mutant sequence was eliminated in definitive erythroid cells, whereas it was only mildly affected in primitive erythroid cells. We therefore conclude that, although the GATA site in 5′HS1 is critical for efficient ϵ-globin gene expression, hypersensitive site formation per se is independent of 5′HS1 function, if any, in definitive erythroid cells.

The mechanism leading to the highly reproducible pattern of globin gene switching has been intensively studied by introducing mutations into the endogenous mouse locus or into the human locus followed by subsequent analysis in transgenic mice (TgM). In the latter cases, the whole human locus has been introduced into the mouse genome via cosmid or yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors, in which gene switching was reasonably faithfully recapitulated (5Strouboulis J.

Because the mouse exhibits a single switch, however, the human ϵ and γ (high level) genes are expressed in the yolk sac (in primitive erythroid cells), whereas the γ (low level), δ, and β genes are expressed in the fetal liver and spleen/bone marrow (definitive erythroid cells) of TgM. Transient cell transfection assays in K562 and MEL cells have reproduced partial LCR enhancer activity in 5′HS2, but not in 5′HS3 or 5′HS4 (8Tuan D.Y. Solomon W.B. London I.M. Lee D.P. Proc. Natl.

It is not fully understood whether individual HSs independently or cooperatively contribute to gene switching in the β-globin locus. In the mouse locus, individual HSs appeared to be structurally and functionally independent and each additively contributes to LCR enhancer activity (12Bender M.A. Mehaffey M.G. Telling A. Hug B.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7033-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although 5′HS1 is erythroid-specific and stable throughout development (2Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), it has not been established whether or not 5′HS1 is a component of the holocomplex. 5′HS1 was capable of activating a γ-globin promoter by severalfold in stable, but not in transient, transfection assays in K562 cells (representing primitive erythrocytes) (9Moon A.M. Ley T.J. Blood. 1991; 77: 2272-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that 5′HS1 requires integration into chromatin for its enhancing activity to be detected. In stably transfected MEL cells (definitive erythrocytes), however, 5′HS1 was barely capable of activating the adult β-globin promoter (10Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Emery D.W. Chen H. Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 322-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In TgM, 5′HS1 activated the γ- and β-globin genes (the ϵ gene was not examined) to quite low levels at all developmental stages (14Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In accord with these results, an intact 5′HS1 in a patient bearing the Hispanic thalassemia deletion, in which 5′HS2 through HS5 as well as additional upstream sequences are removed, is unable to significantly activate the adult β-globin gene (22Driscoll M.C. Dobkin C.S. Alter B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a small deletion including 5′HS1 in an Italian thalassemia patient, which was in trans to the thalassemic allele, does not cause reduced adult β-globin gene expression in cis (23Kulozik A.E. Bail S. Bellan-Koch A. Bartram C.R. Kohne E. Kleihauer E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2142-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results therefore suggest that 5′HS1 may not play an important role, at least in adult β-globin gene activation, in the context of the entire locus. However, it is not known whether embryonic ϵ-globin gene expression may be activated in the Hispanic deletion allele and/or attenuated in the 5′HS1 deletion allele at an earlier developmental stage. In our previous work (24Shimotsuma M. Matsuzaki H. Tanabe O. Campbell A.D. Engel J.D. Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5664-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we were able to identify an enhancer activity lying within a 1 kb fragment around human 5′HS1, unexpectedly in transiently transfected K562 cells. We termed this activity an HS1–3′ enhancer, because it contained the 3′ portion of 5′HS1 and further downstream region (Fig. 1A). In this current work, we further explored this observation and identified the core enhancer sequences to which transcription factor GATA-1 bound in vitro and in vivo. Because core enhancer activity was eventually localized within the 5′HS1 portion, we renamed and called this activity a “5′HS1” enhancer, hereafter (Fig. 1A). A two-nucleotide mutation, which disrupted in vitro GATA-1 binding, completely abolished the enhancer activity of 5′HS1 in the transfection assay. To determine the in vivo role of this GATA site, we generated five lines of intact, single copy human β-globin YAC TgM bearing the same two-nucleotide mutation in 5′HS1. Analysis of the mutant TgM revealed that GATA site in the 5′HS1 was crucial for ϵ-, but not γ-globin gene expression in the yolk sac, while it was unnecessary for β-globin gene expression in the adult spleen. ChIP analysis revealed significantly reduced occupancy of GATA-1 at the mutant 5′HS1 site, and consequently, DNaseI hypersensitivity at 5′HS1 disappeared in definitive erythroid cells. In contrast, 5′HS1 formation was only marginally affected in primitive erythroid cells, in which ϵ-globin gene expression was severely attenuated. Thus, although the lone GATA binding site in 5′HS1 of the LCR is indispensable for efficient ϵ-globin gene expression, the 5′HS1 structure anticorrelates with its transcriptional enhancing ability on target β-like globin genes. To generate pβ-luc, human β-globin promoter fragment (HpaI-NcoI, from nucleotides (nt) 61320 to 62190; GenBankTM, HUMHBB) was subcloned into SmaI/NcoI-digested pGV-B2 (TOYO INK). The 5′HS1 (formerly termed HS1–3′) fragment was excised as a KpnI-XbaI fragment from the pHS1–3′/ϵ-luc (24Shimotsuma M. Matsuzaki H. Tanabe O. Campbell A.D. Engel J.D. Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5664-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and subcloned into KpnI/NheI-digested pβ-luc and pGV-P2 (TOYO INK) to generate p5′HS1/β-luc and p5′HS1/GV-P2, respectively. The 5′HS1(R) fragment was excised as a BamHI-SacII fragment (from nt 13769 to 14240) from the plasmid pHS1–3′/ϵ-luc and subcloned into BglII/SacII-digested pϵ-luc (24Shimotsuma M. Matsuzaki H. Tanabe O. Campbell A.D. Engel J.D. Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5664-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to generate p5′HS1(R)/ϵ-luc. The 5′HS1(L) fragment (from nt 13305 to 13765) was PCR-amplified with the primers HS1–5S and HS1–3A2, digested with XhoI enzyme and subcloned into XhoI-digested pϵ-luc in sense or antisense orientations to generate p5′HS1(L)/ϵ-luc and p5′HS1(l-)/ϵ-luc, respectively. The truncated 5′HS1(L) fragments, 5′HS1/A-E, G, J-O, V, L(m2), and V(m1, m2), were PCR-amplified with their respective primers, digested with XhoI and SacII enzymes, and subcloned into the XhoI/SacII-digested pϵ-luc. To generate p5′HS1/T/ϵ-luc, the oligonucleotides, HS1–5S/d9 and HS1–3A/d8 were annealed (from nt 13481 to 13504) and subcloned into the XhoI/SacII-digested pϵ-luc. To generate p5′HS1/Z/ϵ-luc, the oligonucleotides, HS1–5S/d10 and HS1–3A/d9 were annealed (from nt 13443 to 13467) and subcloned into the SmaI-digested pϵ-luc. Oligo sequences are listed in the supplemental Tables S1 and S2. To generate fragments with the GATA site mutation (5′HS1(L)(m4′) and N(m4′)), artificially introduced SnaBI restriction enzyme site around the m4′ sequences was utilized. Briefly, PCR-amplified 5′ and 3′ part of the fragments were digested with an XhoI/SnaBI and SnaBI/SacII, respectively. These and XhoI/SacII-digested reporter plasmids (pϵ-luc or pGV-B2) were subjected to three-fragment ligation. Primer sequences are listed in the supplemental Tables S1 and S2. All the vector sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. For DNA transfection into human erythroleukemia K562 cells, 950 ng of test constructs and 50 ng of pCMV-β-gal in 10 μl of H2O were mixed with 25 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), then with 4 μl of PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Separately, 2 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 25 μl of Opti-MEM reagents were mixed. Two mixtures were combined, vortexed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells (4 × 105/200 μl of Opti-MEM/24-well dish) were exposed to the DNA/reagent mix for 4h at 37 °C. RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (1 ml) was added to each dish and incubated for another 48 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity in the cell extracts was measured by an ARVOTMSX (Wallac Berthold) and normalized by β-galactosidase activity in the same sample. Assays were performed at least in triplicate, and average values with S.D. were calculated. Double-stranded L DNA fragment was end-labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (TOYOBO) and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (3–7 μg), prepared by using Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif), were preincubated for 4 h at 4 °C in the reaction mixture (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 1% Ficoll) in the presence or absence of 10–100-fold molar excess of specific double-stranded competitor DNA or 2 μg of antibody. 0.5 ng (10,000 cpm) of a radiolabeled DNA probe was added, and the incubation was continued for 15–30 min at 4 °C. The incubation mixture was loaded on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer, and electrophoresed at 4 °C with buffer circulation. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The competitor oligonucleotides used are listed in the supplemental Table S3. Anti-GATA1 (sc-1233) and anti-GATA2 (sc-9008) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Definitive erythroid cells were collected from phenylhydrazine-treated anemic adult spleen and made single cell suspension. K562 or adult spleen cells were fixed in PBS(-) with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of glycine to 0.125 m for 5 min at room temperature. Nuclei (from 1.5 × 107 cells) were prepared and digested with 0.01 units/μl of MNase at 37 °C for 10 min. DNA was prepared from a chromatin and used as the “input” sample. Chromatin was incubated with anti-GATA-1, anti-GATA-2 antibodies (above-described), or normal goat (sc-2028) or rabbit (sc-2027) IgGs overnight at 4 °C and precipitated with pre-blocked Dynabeads protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitated materials were then washed extensively and reverse cross-linked. DNA from input and bound samples was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Primer sequences used in the qPCR are listed in supplemental Table S4 (25Hou C. Zhao H. Tanimoto K. Dean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The qPCR was performed in the Thermal Cycler Dice (TAKARA) with cycling as follows: an initial cycle for 10 s at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The XhoI-SacII fragment from the p5′HS1(L)(m4′)/ϵ-luc was subcloned into XhoI/SacII-digested pRS306 to generate pRS306/5′HS1(L)mGATA. This plasmid DNA was linearized with SpeI and used for mutagenizing the human β-globin YAC (A201F4.3) (26Gaensler K.M. Burmeister M. Brownstein B.H. Taillon-Miller P. Myers R.M.

Successful homologous recombination in yeast was confirmed by Southern blot analyses with several combinations of restriction enzymes and probes. The SnaBI restriction enzyme site, which was artificially introduced by the 2-bp GATA site mutation, was utilized to distinguish mutated from wild-type YAC. The vector and YAC sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation and structural analysis of human β-globin YAC TgM has been described elsewhere (28Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Grosveld F. Bungert J.

Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Regulation of Animal Experiments of the University of Tsukuba and the Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan. To generate acute anemia and obtain abundant nucleated erythroid progenitor cells, adult mice were injected with N-acetyl-phenylhydrazine. Total RNA was extracted from yolk sacs (9.5 days postcoitum), fetal livers (14.5 days postcoitum), or anemic adult spleens (1–2 month old) by using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of RNA with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo). A twentieth of the reaction was used for PCR amplification using the following parameters: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Cycle numbers used for PCR analyses were as follows: 16 for δ and 12 for both the β and α cDNAs in spleen; 18 and 12 for the γ and β/α cDNAs, respectively, in the fetal liver; and 18 and 12 for the ϵ and γ/α cDNAs, respectively, in the yolk sac. An aliquot of each PCR reaction was electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and subjected to x-ray autoradiography and quantitative analysis with PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software. The PCR primers for amplifying the δ-globin cDNA were: 5′-CTCATGGCAAGAAGGTGCTA-3′ and 5′-TTCTGATAGGCAGCCTGCAT-3′. The sequences of other primers used have been described elsewhere (28Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Grosveld F. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2778-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DNaseI HS site mapping was essentially carried out as described elsewhere with minor modifications (27Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3130-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Blood cells were collected from embryos and yolk sacs (10.5 days postcoitum) or phenylhydrazine-induced anemic adult spleens (1–2-month-old). Nuclei were prepared and digested with increasing concentrations of DNaseI (either 0, 2.5, 10, 20, 40, 80 units/ml final concentration) at 37 °C for 5 min. Purified DNA was cut to completion with restriction enzymes and subjected to gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. For mapping DNaseI HS sites 2–4 and 1–2, probes corresponding to the 3′ region of HS4 (XbaI-HindIII, nt 2352–3266) and the 3′ region of HS1 (HindIII-XbaI, nt 13769–14235) were used, respectively. We have previously reported an enhancer activity corresponding to the human β-globin LCR-5′HS1 (formerly termed HS1–3′ enhancer), which is located between −6.2 and −5.2 kb 5′ to the ϵ-globin gene transcriptional start site (Fig. 1A) (24Shimotsuma M. Matsuzaki H. Tanabe O. Campbell A.D. Engel J.D. Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5664-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test for promoter specificity of this enhancer, we linked the 5′HS1 fragment to the ϵ-globin, β-globin, and SV40 promoters and measured its activity by transient transfection into K562 cells (representing primitive erythroid cells; Fig. 1B). The fragment activated all of the promoters to a similar extent, suggesting that the 5′HS1 enhancer does not possess intrinsic promoter preferences. Curiously, however, the fragment failed to activate the same three promoters in MEL (definitive erythrocytes), HepG2, or HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that the 5′HS1 enhancer possesses cell type and developmental stage specificity. This activity was not caused by any theoretical cryptic promoter activity in 5′HS1 because the inverted fragment also exhibited significant enhancer activity (p5′HS1(L-)/ϵ-luc; Fig. 1C). To identify the core sequences of the enhancer, we generated 3′- and 5′-deletions of the 5′HS1 enhancer fragment and tested their activities after transfection into K562 cells (Fig. 1C). Although the 5′HS1 fragment appeared to bear both activator and repressor activities, a single fragment “G” exhibited the strongest enhancer activity and was functional in both orientations (supplemental Fig. S1). We then divided the G fragment into four pieces (J-M) and tested their individual activities (Fig. 1D). Among these, only one of the fragments, L, exhibited any enhancer activity above background, while combining the K and L fragments (corresponding to fragment “N”) restored full enhancer activity as in fragment G. We next searched for putative transcription factor binding motifs in the N fragment (Fig. 2A). Although putative Evi-I, GATA, and EKLF binding motifs could be identified in the human sequence, only the GATA sites were conserved between rabbit, goat, and mouse. Based on this sequence information, we introduced smaller deletion and/or point mutations into the “N” fragment and tested their activities by transfection of the mutants into K562 cells (Fig. 2B). Whereas deletion of the 5′-part of the fragment significantly attenuated the enhancer activity (“L”), a point mutation in the 5′ Evi-I binding motif (“V(m1)”) had no effect, suggesting that other transcription factors were responsible for the enhancer activity. Deletion of part of the 3′-end of the fragment (“O”) or introduction of a point mutation into the 3′ EKLF binding motif (“V(m2)”) severely attenuated enhancer activity. Therefore, both ends of the “V” fragment appear to play significant quantitative roles in 5′HS1 enhancer activity. However, the 5′ (“Z”), 3′ (“T”), or middle (“L(m2)”) fragments individually displayed no enhancer activity, suggesting either that these elements are functionally interdependent or that one large enhancer element spans multiple segments of the V region of the 5′HS1 fragment. Because we failed to detect factor binding to either fragments Z or T in initial gel-shift assays (data not shown), we focused on identifying factor binding to L (Fig. 3A), which displays moderate enhancer activity alone (Figs. 1D and 2B). In the gel-shift assays employing K562 nuclear extracts, four shifted bands were observed with probe L, all of which were competed efficiently with only the middle part of the unlabeled L fragment, “L2” (Fig. 3B). We then introduced clustered two or three nucleotide mutations into the L2 fragment (m1′-m6′) and used them as competitors (Fig. 3, A and C), and found that mutations in the GATA motif (m3′ and m4′) disrupted its function as a competitor. In addition, the mouse α-globin promoter GATA site (MaP), but not its mutant version (mMaP), competed with the factor binding (Fig. 3C). We next conducted a super-shift assay with K562 nuclear extract and found that an anti-GATA-1, but not anti-GATA-2, antibody supershifted all the bands, demonstrating that these complexes with the L fragment include GATA-1 (Fig. 3D). We finally examined the in vivo binding of GATA factors to the human 5′HS1 region by ChIP assay and found that both GATA-1 and GATA-2 were recruited in this vicinity in K562 cells (Fig. 3E). However, because there is more than a single GATA motif in the 5′HS1 region that was amplified for the ChIP experiment, it is not known which site is in fact occupied by which GATA factors. Based on the gel-shift result in Fig. 3D, however, we surmise that the GATA-2 binds to sites in vivo that lie outside the L region. To test for effects of mutating the GATA motif on enhancer activity, we introduced a 2-bp mutation (m4′) into the N and 5′HS1(L) enhancer fragments and tested their transcriptional activity in K562 cells. As clearly shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the GATA site mutation completely abolished the enhancer activity of 5′HS1, demonstrating that the GATA site is indispensable for 5′HS1 enhancer activity in K562 cells. Because the data to this point suggested a vital role for the GATA site in 5′HS1 enhancer activity, we generated a 2-bp GATA site mutation (m4′) into a 150-kbp human β-globin YAC (Fig. 5A) to evaluate its in vivo function. We then generated 5 lines of intact, single copy YAC TgM (Fig. 5, B and C) and termed them mutGATA/5′HS1 TgM. To examine the effects of GATA motif mutation in 5′HS1 on GATA factor binding in vivo, we first conducted a ChIP analysis using nucleated erythroid cells recovered from the spleens of adult TgM (Fig. 6). Three regions within the human LCR-5′HS1, HS2, and HS3, as well as the endogenous mouse 5′HS1 were analyzed by different PCR primer sets. ChIP analyses of two sets of TgM pairs (wild-type line 31 and mutant lines 2748 or 2723) revealed that human HS2 was not significantly occupied by GATA-1 in the WT or mutant TgM (Fig. 6B). Human HS3 (Fig. 6C) and mouse 5′HS1 (Fig. 6D) were both bound by GATA-1, regardless of whether they carry an intact or mutant 5′HS1 transgene. In striking contrast, GATA-1 was preferentially recruited to human 5′HS1 in the WT, but clearly not in the MT, TgM (Fig. 6A). The difference in enrichment between WT and MT alleles was 2–4-fold. Considering that there are other GATA motifs in the vicinity of human LCR-HS1 (not shown), this difference is quite significant. In contrast, GATA-2 recruitment to the human 5′HS1 did not differ significantly between WT and MT TgM (Fig. 6E), supporting our previous contention that GATA-2 binds to sites lying outside of the L region in 5′HS1. Thus, GATA-1 in fact binds to the human and mouse 5′HS1 in vivo and mutation of the GATA site severely attenuated GATA-1 binding to the human 5′HS1 in definitive erythroid progenitor cells. We next analyzed human ϵ- and γ-globin gene expression in primitive erythroid cells of the mutGATA/HS1 TgM (Fig. 7A). Total RNA was recovered from the yolk sacs (9.5 dpc) and expression of globin mRNAs was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using endogenous mouse α-globin gene expression as an internal control. The data show that ϵ gene expression fell by 80–90% (Fig. 7A, top) in the mutant lines (mutGATA/5′HS1) in comparison to wild-type (WT; 29Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D.

This phenotype was gene-specific because γ-globin gene expression was not significantly affected by the same mutation (Fig. 7A, bottom). We next collected fetal livers (14.5 dpc) from TgM and analyzed human γ- and β-globin gene expression in these definitive erythroid progenitor cells (Fig. 7B). Although RT-PCR analysis showed that both γ- and β-globin gene expression levels were slightly reduced in the mutant TgM, statistically significant differences were found only in a subset of the lines. After 5 days of phenylhydrazine treatment, anemic spleens were collected from two animals representing each line for RNA"
https://openalex.org/W2056839820,"Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the binding affinities between the hormone 17-estradiol (E2) and different estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Previous phylogenetic analysis indicates that a whole genome duplication prior to the divergence of ray-finned fish led to two distinct ER isoforms, ER and ER, and the recent whole genome duplication in the ancestral salmonid created two ER isoforms, ER and ER. The objective of our computational studies is to provide insight into the underlying evolutionary pressures on these isoforms. For the ER subtype our results show that E2 binds preferentially to ER over ER. Tests of lineage specific N/S ratios indicate that the ligand binding domain of the ER gene is evolving under relaxed selection relative to all other ER genes. Comparison with the highly conserved DNA binding domain suggests that ER may be undergoing neofunctionalization possibly by binding to another ligand. By contrast, both ER and ER bind similarly to E2 and the best fitting model of selection indicates that the ligand binding domain of all ER genes are evolving under the same level of purifying selection, comparable to ER."
