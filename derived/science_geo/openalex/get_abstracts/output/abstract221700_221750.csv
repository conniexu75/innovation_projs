Exposure of neutrophils, monocytes, or macrophages to HMGB1 results in increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB and enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Although the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been shown to interact with HMGB1, other putative HMGB1 receptors are known to exist but have not been characterized. In the present experiments, we explored the role of RAGE, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR 4, as well as associated kinases, in HMGB1-induced cellular activation. Culture of neutrophils or macrophages with HMGB1 produced activation of NF-κB through TLR 4-independent mechanisms. Unlike lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which primarily increased the activity of IKKβ, HMGB1 exposure resulted in activation of both IKKα and IKKβ. Kinases and scaffolding proteins downstream of TLR 2 and TLR 4, but not TLR/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-independent kinases such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2, were involved in the enhancement of NF-κB-dependent transcription by HMGB1. Transfections with dominant negative constructs demonstrated that TLR 2 and TLR 4 were both involved in HMGB1-induced activation of NF-κB. In contrast, RAGE played only a minor role in macrophage activation by HMGB1. Interactions of HMGB1 with TLR 2 and TLR 4 may provide an explanation for the ability of HMGB1 to generate inflammatory responses that are similar to those initiated by LPS.

HMGB1-deficient mice die within a few hours of birth, demonstrating the crucial role of this protein in cellular function. HMGB1 consists of two tandem L-shaped domains, HMGB boxes A and B, each ∼75 amino acids in length, and a highly acidic carboxyl terminus of 30 amino acids in length.HMGB1 appears to have two distinct functions in cellular systems. First, it has been shown to be an intracellular regulator of transcription, and, second, HMGB1 can occupy an extracellular role in which it promotes tumor metastasis and inflammation (2Andersson U.

Production of proinflammatory cytokines after exposure to HMGB1 occurs with delayed kinetics as compared with LPS-induced stimulation. For example, culture of macrophages with LPS results in increases in TNF-α that are apparent within less than 1 h, whereas TNF-α synthesis following HMGB1 exposure only begins to occur after 2 h and then persists for as long as 8 h (8Wang H.

The signaling mechanisms responsible for the delayed expression of proinflammatory cytokines by HMGB1-stimulated cells remain incompletely explained but appear to involve the p38, ERK, JNK, and Akt kinases and to lead to enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB (12Fiuza C.

Arcaroli J. Yum H.K. Yang H. Wang H. Yang K.Y. Choe K.H. Strassheim D. Pitts T.M. Tracey K.J. Abraham E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C870-C879Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we found that the magnitude and kinetics of cytokine expression and nuclear translocation of NF-κB after culture of neutrophils with HMGB1 or LPS were similar, suggesting that overlapping mechanisms of cellular activation might be involved. Comparison of gene expression arrays also demonstrated substantial but not complete homology in response to HMGB1 and LPS. Signaling via the TLR 4 receptor is responsible for LPS-induced activation of the IKK kinase complex, including IKKα and IKKβ, that then leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes whose transcription is dependent on NF-κB (15Takeuchi O.

Although the similarity in gene expression, kinase activation, and patterns in NF-κB translocation after exposure to HMGB1 and LPS suggest that similar receptors, including TLR 4, might be involved in cellular activation by the two stimuli, the role of TLR 4 in HMGB1-induced signaling has not been reported.

The recent finding that HMGB1-induced differentiation of erythroleukemia cells is independent of RAGE indicates that additional HMGB1 receptors exist (21Sparatore B. Pedrazzi M. Passalacqua M. Gaggero D. Patrone M. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, such RAGE-independent HMGB1 receptors have not yet been identified. Additionally, no studies have examined the relative importance of RAGE versus other putative HMGB1 receptors.In the present experiments, we explored the role of RAGE, TLR 2, and TLR 4, as well as associated kinases, in HMGB1-induced cellular activation. Our studies demonstrate that RAGE plays only a minor role in macrophage activation by HMGB1, whereas signaling through TLR 2 and TLR 4 appears to be of much greater importance. Interactions of HMGB1 with TLR 2 and TLR 4 may provide an explanation of the ability of HMGB1 to potentiate many inflammatory responses initiated by LPS.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—LipofectAMINE 2000, RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen Corp.

All mice were 7–10 weeks of age when experiments were initiated. Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Isolation and Culture of Mouse Neutrophils—Peripheral neutrophils were purified from bone marrow cell suspensions as previously described (40Arcaroli J.

To obtain the bone marrow cell suspension, the femur and tibia of a mouse were flushed with 5 ml of RPMI 1640/penicillin/streptomycin, and the cells were passed through a glass wool column. The cell pellets from the bone marrow were resuspended in RPMI 1640/5%-defined fetal calf serum and then incubated with 10 μl of primary antibodies specific for the cell surface markers F4/80, CD4, CD45R, CD5, and TER119 for 15 min at 4 °C. This custom mixture (Stem Cell Technologies) is specific for T and B cells, red blood cells, monocytes, and macrophages. After 15-min incubation with the antibody mixture, 100 μl of antibiotin tetrameric antibody complexes was added for an additional 15 min at 4 °C. Following this, 60 μl of colloidal magnetic dextran iron particles were added to the suspension and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The entire cell suspension was then placed into a column surrounded by a magnet. The T cells, B cells, red blood cells, monocytes, and macrophages were captured in the column, allowing the neutrophils to pass through by negative selection methods. Viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was consistently greater than 98%. Neutrophil purity, as determined by Cytospin preparations stained with Wright's stain, was greater than 98%.Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640/10%-defined fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with 1000 ng/ml HMGB1 or 100 ng/ml LPS. Control cultures or those containing HMGB1 were supplemented with polymyxin B (10 μg/ml) to block any effects of contaminating endotoxin.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was plated on 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/ml on the day before transfection. Combinations of expression plasmid DNAs (1 μg/ml) were transfected by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Duplicate wells were set up for each group. The reporter plasmid used was pNF-κBluc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).

At 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with either LPS or HMGB1 for 1 h. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the luciferase assays were repeated at least three times. Representative results are shown for each experiment.Immune Complex Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 5 × 106 cells/ml. The lysates (5 × 106 cells/sample) were incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies (either anti-IKKα or anti-IKKβ) for 3 h at 4 °C, and then protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) were added for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and then once in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 20 mm MgCl2; 2 mm EGTA; 0.5 mm sodium vanadate; 10 mm β-glycerophosphate; 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 1 μg of IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) as a substrate; this step was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled and resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fixed gel was then exposed to an x-ray film.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—To obtain nuclear extracts, the neutrophils were suspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and the samples were incubated on ice for 20 min. After cytoplasm was removed from the nuclei by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended in extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol with 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe specific for the κB site, 5′-GCCATGGGGGGATCCCCGAAGTCC-3′ (Geneka Biotechnology) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). The complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris·HCl (pH 8.0)-borate-EDTA buffer at 10 V/cm. Dried gels were exposed with Kodak Biomax MS film (Rochester, NY) for 1–24 h at 70 °C. Quantification was performed by image analysis using densitometry (ChemiDoc system; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. for each experimental group. Student's t test (for comparisons between LPS- and HMGB1-stimulated cells) was used. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSHMGB1 Enhances Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB through Mechanisms Independent of TLR 4 —In a previous study (13Park J.S. Arcaroli J. Yum H.K. Yang H. Wang H. Yang K.Y. Choe K.H. Strassheim D. Pitts T.M. Tracey K.J. Abraham E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C870-C879Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we found that exposure of neutrophils to HMGB1 increased nuclear accumulation of NF-κB to approximately the same level as that seen after stimulation with LPS. Although interactions with TLR 4 are primarily responsible for LPS-induced cellular activation, the involvement of TLR 4 in HMGB1 signaling had not previously been determined. To examine the importance of TLR 4 and TLR 2 in HMGB1-associated NF-κB activation, we utilized neutrophils from transgenic mice lacking TLR 2 (TLR 2–/–), C3H/HeJ, and control C3H/HeN mice. C3H/HeJ mice lack a functional TLR 4 receptor due to a missense point mutation that results in the substitution of histidine for proline within the cytoplasmic portion of TLR 4 (43Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar).After exposure to HMGB1, nuclear translocation of NF-κB was increased to approximately the same degree in neutrophils from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice (Fig. 1A). In both mouse strains, maximal nuclear accumulation of NF-κB was present 15 min after stimulation with HMGB1. In contrast, after culture with LPS, the nuclear content of NF-κB was not altered in C3H/HeJ neutrophils, but was increased in neutrophils from C3H/HeN mice (Fig. 1B). Such results demonstrate that receptors other than TLR 4 participate in HMGB1-induced cellular activation.HMGB1 and LPS both increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB in neutrophils from TLR 2 –/– mice (Fig. 1C). As expected, exposure of TLR 2 –/– neutrophils to the TLR 2-specific ligands PGN and PAM did not produce any alterations in the nuclear concentrations of NF-κB. Such results indicate that receptors other than TLR 2 are involved in cellular activation after exposure to HMGB1.To delineate mechanisms by which HMGB1 leads to enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, we examined activation of IKKα and IKKβ in HMGB1- and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. IKKα and IKKβ are catalytically active components of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that, when activated after cellular exposure LPS or other stimuli, can phosphorylate members of the IκB family, freeing cytoplasmic NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and initiate transcriptional activity (45O"

Here we show that a putative deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp8, is a structurally nonessential component of both the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) and SAGA-like (SLIK) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes in yeast. Disruption of this gene dramatically increases the cellular level of ubiquitinated-H2B, and SAGA and SLIK are shown to have H2B deubiquitinase activity. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, how the ubiquitin moiety can be removed from histone H2B in a regulated fashion. Ubp8 is required for full expression of the SAGA- and SLIK-dependent gene GAL10 and is recruited to the upstream activation sequence (UAS) of this gene under activating conditions, while Rad6 dissociates. Furthermore, trimethylation of H3 at lysine 4 within the UAS increases significantly under activating conditions, and remarkably, Ubp8 is shown to have a role in regulating the methylation status of this residue. Collectively, these data suggest that the SAGA and SLIK HAT complexes can regulate an integrated set of multiple histone modifications, counteracting repressive effects that alter chromatin and regulate gene expression.

Collectively, these data suggest that the SAGA and SLIK HAT complexes can regulate an integrated set of multiple histone modifications, counteracting repressive effects that alter chromatin and regulate gene expression. Enzymes responsible for the post-translational modification of histones via acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination are rapidly emerging. Most of these, thus far, are components of stable multiprotein complexes that act on nucleosomal substrates (8.Grant P.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3.1-3.6Crossref Google Scholar), regulating specific biological processes through a possible histone code that reads distinct sequential and/or combinatorial patterns of modifications (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). The HAT enzyme, Gcn5, is the catalytic subunit of two related high molecular weight (∼1.8 MDa) protein coactivator complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae called SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) and SLIK (SAGA-like)/SALSA (SAGA altered, Spt8 absent) (9.Grant P.A.

SAGA and SLIK have been shown to be required for the expression of a subset of genes as well as being functionally redundant with the general transcription factor, TFIID, in the transcription of most RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes (12.Lee T.I.

However, distinct and separate functions for the SAGA and SLIK HAT complexes have been established through compositional differences (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M.

This study demonstrates that the yeast deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp8, is a component of both SAGA and SLIK and mediates the removal of ubiquitin from histone H2B. The process of H2B monoubiquitination in yeast has recently been shown to regulate H3 methylation and gene silencing in a unidirectional, trans-histone fashion (2.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D.

Here, we show that Ubp8 is required for full expression of the GAL10 gene and that Ubp8 is present at the promoter of this gene under activating conditions. Furthermore, we find that the removal of ubiquitin from H2B is involved in the regulation of histone H3 (Lys4) trimethylation, a feature of transcriptional activation (15.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Our data show a unique attribute of the SAGA coactivator complexes in the dual acetylation of histone H3 and deubiquitination of histone H2B, bridging two histone components of the nucleosome, while regulating the methylation of histone H3. These results have a profound implication for the understanding of how a cascade of post-translational histone modifications is generated in the process of gene expression. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—SAGA and SLIK were isolated for mass spectrometric analysis from yeast strain CY396 (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G.

Strain YZS236, expressing protein A-His7-tagged Rad6 protein, was derived from strain Y131 (hta1-htb1Δ::LEU2 hta2-htb2Δ HTA1-HTB1 (2μ URA3)). BY4741 and derivative ubp8Δ, spt20Δ, and rad6Δ strains were obtained from Research Genetics. Strains MBY1217, YZS276 (FLAG-HTB1) and YZS277 (FLAG-HTB1-K123R) are described previously (2.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Strain YZS282 (ubp8Δ::KAN) is derived from YZS276 and strain YJD1 (YCpIF17-Ubiquitin <GAL1-HA-UBI4 CEN TRP1>) is derived from YZS282. Purification of SAGA and SLIK Complexes and Mass Spectrometry— For mass spectrometric analysis, SAGA and SLIK were isolated and analyzed as described previously (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16.Grant P.A. Schieltz D.

The complexes were also partially purified from whole cell extracts of wild type, ubp8Δ and GST-Ubp8 yeast strains grown to mid-log phase in 4 liters of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium, by sequential Mono Q HR 16/10, Mono Q HR 5/5 column, Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns, and a second Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) (10.Pray-Grant M.G.

Western Blot Analysis and HAT Assays—Proteins from column fractionations were processed for immunoblotting using Ada2, Taf9, or GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antisera. HAT assays were performed with HeLa free histones or nucleosomes as described previously (17.Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 15: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For H2B studies, whole cell lysates were prepared and FLAG analysis was performed as described (2.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Histones from wild type and ubp8Δ mutant yeast were acid extracted and processed for immunoblotting using rabbit H3 antisera specific for the mono-, di-, or trimethylated states of lysine 4 (Abcam). Quantitation of relative fold changes (Western/Ponceau) was performed using ImageQuant software. Deubiquitination Assay—Plasmid-borne HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged H2B were both expressed in strain YJD1 under galactose induction, and a trichloroacetic acid lysate preparation was immunoprecipitated using sequential FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) and HA Affinity Matrix (Roche Applied Science) resins, largely as described previously (18.Kao C.F. Osley M.A. Methods. 2003; 31: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the assay, 4 μl of resuspended beads containing FLAG-HA-uH2B was mixed with 4 μl of a Mono Q fraction containing SAGA, SLIK, or Mono Q buffer only, along with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, in a 20 μl reaction containing 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol performed for 1 h at 30 °C. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using FLAG M1 (Sigma) and HA-peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) antisera. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays and Northern Blot Analysis—Chromatin preparations and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (19.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For ChIPs and Northerns, yeast were grown in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% raffinose and then reseeded and grown in SC-raffinose medium or SC medium containing 2% galactose for an additional 4 h. Chromatin from whole cell extracts of strains expressing GST-Ubp8 or PrA-Rad6-His7, and respective no tag controls, was then precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. ChIPs were also performed from wild type BY4741, ubp8Δ, and set1Δ strains with H3 (Lys4) mono-, di-, or trimethyl anitsera (Abcam). The input and precipitated DNA were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers specific for the UAS within the GAL1–10 or ACT1 promoter regions. Quantitation was performed using an AlphaImager 2000 documentation and analysis system from Alpha Innotech. The ratios of immunoprecipitated to input DNA were calculated and normalized to wild type or tag raffinose values, and these values are shown as relative amounts of IP/input signal. RNA purification and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A.

Ubp8 Is a Stable Component of the Yeast SAGA and SLIK HAT Complexes—To gain more insight into the transcriptional regulatory function of SLIK, we used mass spectrometric analysis of highly purified complex to identify a putative deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp8, as a novel component (Fig. 1A). These data are in agreement with large-scale proteomics studies finding Ubp8 in a complex with Gcn5 and Spt7 (20.Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3950) Google Scholar) and also with a study demonstrating that HA-tagged Ubp8 can co-immunoprecipitate certain SAGA/SLIK components (22.Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To test whether Ubp8 was SLIK-specific, we utilized a strain expressing GST-tagged Ubp8 protein. Immunoblotting of partially purified SAGA and SLIK revealed that GST-Ubp8 protein co-fractionated with both complexes (Fig. 1B), although existing in higher stoichiometric proportion in SLIK, consistent with the identification of Ubp8 as part of the SLIK complex (Fig. 1A). The polypeptides Spt20, Spt7, and Ada1 are required for the overall structural integrity of both SAGA and SLIK, because deletions of any of these genes cause severe phenotypes and do not allow normal chromatographic isolation of either complex (9.Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To test whether the Ubp8 protein is also required for structural integrity, we compared HAT complex fractionation profiles of wild type yeast to those bearing a UBP8 deletion by anion exchange chromatography. We found that SAGA and SLIK complexes lacking Ubp8 are intact and can acetylate free and nucleosomal histone H3 in vitro (Fig. 1C). Further anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography of the ubp8Δ extract indicated that the two mutant complexes have similar charge and size to those of wild type. Therefore, Ubp8 is not necessary for the integrity or HAT activity of either complex, concurring with the lack of any marked phenotype seen with the ubp8Δ yeast (Ref. 24.Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and data not shown). Ubp8 Regulates H2B Deubiquitination at Lysine 123—A possible role of the Ubp8 protein within a HAT complex is to deubiquitinate chromatin-associated substrates. A good candidate substrate appeared to be histone H2B, which in yeast is monoubiquitinated at the highly conserved lysine 123 residue (14.Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Most transcription studies thus far have concentrated on the addition of ubiquitin to proteins (25.Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), even though ubiquitination is an enzymatically reversible process, as evidenced in deubiquitinating activities associated with the proteosome (26.Papa F.R.

For regulation of rDNA and telomeric silencing, ubiquitination of lysine 123 in H2B by Rad6 has recently been demonstrated to be required for dimethylation of H3 at lysines 4 and 79 by their respective site-specific histone methyltransferase enzymes, Set1 and Dot1 (2.Sun Z.W.

Di-methylation of H3 at these residues and functional telomeric silencing are impaired in the absence of Rad6 or an intact H2B (Lys123) ubiquitination site, indicating that conjugation of ubiquitin to H2B controls these methylation events on H3. Using FLAG-tagged H2B yeast strains, we found that disruption of UBP8 caused a dramatic increase in the monoubiquitinated form of H2B as compared with wild type (Fig. 2A). The disruption of UBP3, another putative ubiquitin-specific protease shown to be involved in transcriptional silencing (27.Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and to associate with the SAGA/SLIK component Ada3 (28.Saleh A. Collart M. Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Allard S. Cote J. Brandl C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), had no apparent effect on uH2B (see the Supplemental Figure). This result indicates that Ubp8 specifically regulates the deubiquitination of H2B at lysine 123 in vivo. Since Ubp8 is a component of SAGA and SLIK, we wanted to test whether these two complexes were capable of directly hydrolyzing the ubiquitin moiety from histone H2B. To this end, we purified ubiquitinated-H2B from a yeast strain coexpressing FLAG-tagged H2B and HA-tagged ubiquitin proteins. Using this substrate, we show that SAGA and SLIK have in vitro H2B deubiquitinase activity (Fig. 2B). The detection of free HA-ubiquitin specifically after the addition of SAGA or SLIK confirms the ubiquitin-specific protease function of these two complexes. This result extends the in vivo finding that Ubp8 deubiquitinates H2B and establishes that this histone modification is also catalyzed, in vitro, in the context of SAGA and SLIK. Ubp8 Regulates Bulk H3 Methylation at Lysine 4—Given that ubp8Δ yeast have elevated uH2B and that this modification is required for methylation of H3 (Lys4), we hypothesized that the ubp8Δ strain might have increased H3 methylation at this residue. To test this, we compared H3 (Lys4) methylation of histones from wild type yeast to that of ubp8Δ by Western analysis using antibodies that are specific for the mono-, di-, or trimethylated form of histone H3 at lysine 4. Although we see a slight change in dimethylation, monomethylation of H3 (Lys4) increases significantly in the ubp8Δ mutant, while trimethylation at this residue decreases (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that removal of ubiquitin from H2B regulates the methylation state of lysine 4 on H3, promoting a transition from a mono- to trimethylated state. A recent study using these antibodies in ChIP analyses suggests that trimethylated H3 (Lys4) is present exclusively at active genes, while the dimethylated residue is in chromatin of both repressed and active genes (15.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The biological consequence of monomethylation on H3 (Lys4) has not yet been explored. Our results suggest that deubiquitination by Ubp8 affects bulk H3 lysine methylation status in vivo, promoting trimethylation of H3 (Lys4) and as part of HAT/co-activator complexes may promote gene activation. Ubp8 Is Recruited to a SAGA/SLIK-dependent Promoter during Activation, while Rad6 Dissociates—To utilize galactose as a carbon source, derepression of a number of GAL genes in yeast requires SAGA or SLIK. Binding of these complexes to the UAS-bound activator Gal4 influences recruitment of TATA-binding protein through interaction with the coactivator component Spt3 (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29.Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C.

Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to use the SAGA/SLIK-dependent gene GAL10 and its UAS GAL1–10 to study the effects of Ubp8 on transcription. To determine whether Ubp8 is present at the GAL1–10 UAS under activating conditions, we prepared chromatin from a strain expressing GST-tagged Ubp8 proteins. Cells grown in raffinose, or shifted to growth in galactose, were subjected to ChIP analysis using GST antisera and primers specific for the UAS within the GAL1–10 promoter region. Our results indicate that Ubp8 is present at the UAS specifically under activating conditions (Fig. 3A) and that this localization correlates well with recruitment of SAGA and SLIK and occurrence of H3 (Lys9/14) acetylation (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), consistent with its function as part of these HAT complexes. In contrast, we observe that Rad6 is present at the GAL1–10 UAS under raffinose-noninducing conditions and dissociates from this promoter region during activation (Fig. 3A). As a control, significant changes in Rad6 or Ubp8 were not observed at the control ACT1 promoter. These data are suggestive of opposing functional roles of Rad6 and Ubp8 in histone ubiquitination during transcriptional activation of the GAL genes. Trimethylation of H3 (Lys4) at the GAL1–10 Promoter Is Dependent on Ubp8 and Set1 during Activation—We also investigated changes in the methylation state of H3 (Lys4) under activating conditions at the GAL1–10 UAS, compared with the control ACT1 promoter, and whether Ubp8 functions in the regulation of this histone modification. Using H3 (Lys4) antibodies, we performed ChIP analysis from wild type, ubp8Δ, and set1Δ strains. Since Set1 is thought to be the only H3 (Lys4) methylating enzyme in yeast (15.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), we used the set1Δ mutant as a background control. In wild type yeast, although mono- and dimethylation are relatively unchanged upon activation, trimethylation of H3 (Lys4) at the GAL1–10 UAS increases. However, in the ubp8Δ or set1Δ mutant, trimethylation of H3 (Lys4) is impaired during activation (Fig. 3B). Thus, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that nucleosomal H3 (Lys4) within the GAL1–10 UAS is trimethylated upon activation and that this modification is dependent upon Ubp8. H2B Ubiquitination and H3 Methylation Affect Transcription of the GAL10 Gene—Since the methylation changes within the GAL1–10 promoter region are regulated by Ubp8, we investigated whether Ubp8 and Set1 had a direct role in the transcription of a gene regulated by this element. To address this, we isolated total RNA from wild type, ubp8Δ, and set1Δ strains grown in raffinose-noninducing or galactose-inducing media and performed Northern analysis with a probe specific for GAL10 expression. We find that the ubp8Δ, and more significantly, set1Δ mutants have decreased GAL10 expression compared with wild type, suggesting the Ubp8 and Set1 proteins are required for full transcription of this gene (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 17, 18, and 20). Northern analysis of RNA isolated from an spt20Δ strain, a mutation that disrupts SAGA/SLIK complex integrity, showed a deficiency in GAL10 expression slightly more severe than the ubp8Δ mutant, yet not as drastic as the set1Δ mutant (Fig. 3C). Thus, we demonstrate co-activating functions for the histone H3 methyltransferase, Set1, and the deubiquitinase, Ubp8, in SAGA/SLIK-dependent transcription of the galactose-regulated GAL10 gene. In contrast, after a 4-hour induction time, transcription of GAL10 is increased in the rad6Δ mutant compared with the isogenic wild type (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 17 and 21). This hyperactivation of GAL10 is visualized more dramatically when comparing two-hour galactose inductions (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 10 and 14). Interestingly, the rad6Δ mutant does not cause induction of GAL10 in noninducing conditions, suggesting that RAD6 is not sufficient to maintain repression of the GAL genes. These studies offer more evidence for the contrasting functional roles of Rad6 and Ubp8 in the transcriptional activation of galactose-regulated genes. Surprisingly, H2B-K123R yeast, bearing a mutation in the H2B ubiquitination site, have decreased GAL10 gene expression (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 15 and 16), demonstrating the need for a modifiable lysine at this position. This result may indicate that H2B ubiquitination, and subsequent deubiquitination, are both required for transcriptional activation. Alternatively, this lysine may be subject to other post-translational modifications such as acetylation or methylation. Our studies call attention to Ubp8, a component of the two yeast HAT complexes SAGA and SLIK. We present evidence that Ubp8 functions in the hydrolysis of ubiquitin from histone H2B and is recruited to the GAL1–10 UAS together with other SAGA and SLIK components during transcriptional activation (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30.Bhaumik S.R.

The association of Ubp8 at this locus coincides with (Lys9/14) acetylation (10.Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and (Lys4) hypermethylation of H3 allowing for normal expression of the GAL10 gene. In view of studies demonstrating that Rad6-mediated ubiquitination of H2B regulates H3 dimethylation and gene silencing, our data suggest that the SAGA and SLIK HAT complexes may counter Rad6 by influencing multiple modifications on more than one histone. During consideration of this manuscript, Henry et al. (33.Henry K.W. Wyce A. Lo W.S. Duggan L.J. Emre N.C. Kao C.F. Pillus L. Shilatifard A. Osley M.A. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2648-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) also reported Ubp8 as an H2B deubiquitinase within the SAGA complexes and, in keeping with our results, provide evidence of a role for Ubp8 in transcriptional activation of the GAL genes; however, they show that deletion of UBP8 results in an increase in H3 (Lys4) trimethylation at the GAL1–10 core promoter (33.Henry K.W. Wyce A. Lo W.S. Duggan L.J. Emre N.C. Kao C.F. Pillus L. Shilatifard A. Osley M.A. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2648-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In summary, we propose that repression of some genes through ubiquitinated-H2B is overcome by an activator-targeted HAT complex containing deubiquitinase activity. We favor the view that deubiquitination of H2B occurs in concert or prior to both histone acetyltransferase activity and the intricate regulation of methyltransferase activity. In turn, changes in chromatin structure and/or the epigenetic pattern of modifications within a promoter region allow recruitment of the transcription machinery. We thank M. A. Osley, M. Bryk, and S.

However, in adults, selenoprotein levels in several organs including liver can be substantially reduced by selenium deficiency without any apparent change in phenotype. To address the role of selenoproteins in liver function, mice homozygous for a floxed allele encoding the selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA[Ser]Sec gene were crossed with transgenic mice carrying the Cre recombinase under the control of the albumin promoter that expresses the recombinase specifically in liver. Recombination was nearly complete in mice 3 weeks of age, whereas liver selenoprotein synthesis was virtually absent, which correlated with the loss of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and activities of major selenoproteins. Total liver selenium was dramatically decreased, whereas levels of low molecular weight selenocompounds were little affected. Plasma selenoprotein P levels were reduced by about 75%, suggesting that selenoprotein P is primarily exported from the liver. Glutathione S-transferase levels were elevated in the selenoprotein-deficient liver, suggesting a compensatory activation of this detoxification program. Mice appeared normal until about 24 h before death. Most animals died between 1 and 3 months of age. Death appeared to be due to severe hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis with concomitant necrosis of peritoneal and retroperitoneal fat.

Death appeared to be due to severe hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis with concomitant necrosis of peritoneal and retroperitoneal fat. These studies revealed an essential role of selenoproteins in liver function. Selenium is an essential micronutrient in the diet of higher vertebrates, including humans and other mammals. Numerous health benefits have been attributed to this element. For example, evidence suggests that selenium has cancer chemopreventive properties, inhibits viral expression, and delays the progression of AIDS in patients who are positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+) (reviewed in Ref. 1Hatfield D.L. Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears to reduce the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular and muscle disorders, to slow the aging process, and to have roles in mammalian development, male reproduction, and immune function (1Hatfield D.L. Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001Crossref Google Scholar). Selenoproteins are most certainly responsible for many of the health benefits of selenium. Humans encode 25 selenoproteins in their genome and mice 24, but the functions of only about half of these proteins are now known (2Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Determining the identity and functions of selenoproteins is essential to understanding the role of selenium in human health. Selenium makes its way into protein as the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) (reviewed in Ref. 3Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Sec has its own code word, UGA, and its own tRNA designation, Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. Sec is biosynthesized on its tRNA after the tRNA is aminoacylated initially with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase. The presence of a stem-loop structure, designated a Sec insertion sequence element, in selenoprotein mRNAs dictates a UGA codon within an open reading frame to function as Sec and not as stop (4Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, much of the Sec protein insertion machinery is unique to this amino acid, and in mammals, there is a specific Sec insertion sequence-binding protein, SBP2 (5Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and a specific elongation factor, EFsec (6Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M.

Krol A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), required for Sec insertion into protein. Selenoproteins are the only known class of proteins for which expression is determined by the presence of a single tRNA. Thus, manipulating the expression of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec can perturb the expression of selenoproteins, which in turn provides an important tool in elucidating the biological functions of the various members of this class of proteins and their potential roles in promoting better health. One approach to elucidating the cellular roles of selenoproteins is to knock out the corresponding gene. Indeed, several laboratories have targeted specific selenoproteins for removal from the mouse genome, including glutathione peroxidases 1, 2, and 4 (GPx1 (8Cheng W.H. Ho Y.S. Ross D.A.

In a different approach, and to provide alternative models for examining the roles of selenium in health, we initially generated a transgenic mouse carrying a mutant Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec transgene wherein the expressed tRNA lacked a highly modified base, N6-isopentenyladenosine (i6A), at position 37 (14Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3840-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The i6A-tRNA[Ser]Sec-deficient mice manifested a reduction in selenoproteins that occurred in a protein- and tissue-specific manner. More recently, we generated a conditional knockout of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene encoding flanking loxP sites whereby the gene is receptive to removal by the Cre recombinase, which may be under the control of promoters targeted for specific organs or tissues (15Kumaraswamy E.

Mice that are homozygous for this floxed allele, designated Trspfl/fl, were crossed to transgenic mice carrying the Cre recombinase under the control of two promoters targeting mammary epithelium. Neither Cre recombinant resulted in complete removal of Trsp. However, one of the promoters, MMTV-Cre, removed about 80% of the Trsp, which resulted in an altered selenoprotein expression in mammary epithelium (15Kumaraswamy E. Carlson B.A. Morgan F. Miyoshi K.

A major protein differentially expressed between knockout and control livers was identified by N-terminal Edman degradation at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln proteomics core facility. Pathology Evaluation—Mice were sacrificed using CO2 inhalation. Necropsy examination was performed on a subset of mice that were sacrificed or that died spontaneously. The total numbers of mice examined were as follows: Trspf1/f1, scheduled sacrifice, 7 males and 0 females; Trspf1/f1-Alb-Cre+/-, scheduled sacrifice, 4 males and 2 females; and Trspf1/f1-AlbCre+/-, spontaneous death/clinically ill, 3 males and 6 females. A comprehensive set of organs and tissues was collected and fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin. Tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The TUNEL assay (Apoptag, Serologicals Corp.) was performed on sections of liver from all mice. Prussian blue stain for iron was performed on samples of necrotic fat. Blood and Selenium Analyses—Blood samples were taken from mice prior to necropsy by cardiac puncture. The serum was obtained by centrifugation and used for determining blood chemistries (run by the Pathology/Histotechnology Laboratory) using standard techniques. The analytes tested were urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and total bilirubin. To determine the levels of selenium in the form of low molecular weight selenocompounds or selenoproteins, 300 mg of liver were homogenized in 5 ml of a lysis buffer (14Moustafa M.E.

Practical Approach Series on CD-ROM. Oxford University Press, 1995-1996Google Scholar). Selenium levels in the extracts, pellets, and trichloroacetic acid supernatants and in all other tissues and organs were determined by the Oscar E. Olsen Biochemistry Laboratories at South Dakota State University. Specific Removal of Trsp from Liver—Alb-Cre has been reported to be highly specific to liver and virtually 100% efficient in hepatocytes when crossed with floxed alleles (16Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Its complete expression in liver occurred after an initial time lag of only a few weeks (17Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the status of Trsp in liver of mice with genotypes Trspfl/fl, Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/-, and Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- at 1, 3, and 12 weeks of age using the kidney as a control organ. As shown in Fig. 1A, between 80 and 90% of the gene was removed from the liver of mice about 1 week old (lane 3) and virtually completely removed in older mice (lanes 4 and 5). Trspfl/fl was unaffected in the kidney of Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice (lanes 8–10). The wild type gene (lacking the floxed allele, designated Trsp+) was observed in heterozygous mice encoding Trspfl, Trsp+, and Alb-Cre+/- where Trspfl was removed in liver (Fig. 1A, lane 2) but retained in kidney (lane 7). The small amounts of Trspfl observed in Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/- or Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice are likely because of the presence of cell forms other than hepatocytes (see “Discussion”). Total tRNA was isolated from perfused livers and from kidneys of Trspfl/fl, Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/-, and Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice. Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec levels were examined by Northern analysis and by RPC-5 chromatography (Fig. 1B). Relative to the amount of serine tRNA1, more than 90% of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec had been removed from livers lacking the corresponding gene (Fig. 1B, lane 3), whereas in the kidneys of these mice, the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec population was unaffected (lane 6), as shown by Northern blot analysis in the upper portion of Fig. 1B. Interestingly, the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec level was reduced to about 70% of the wild type amount in the liver of Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/- mice (see legend to Fig. 1). This reduction in Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec expression was similar to that observed in mice heterozygous for the standard tRNA[Ser]Sec knockout (15Kumaraswamy E. Carlson B.A. Morgan F. Miyoshi K. Robinson G.W. Su D. Wang S. Southon E. Tessarollo L. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hennighausen L. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Virtually all of the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec appeared to be absent in the liver of mice lacking Trsp in this tissue as compared with Trspfl/fl mice following fractionation of total tRNA from corresponding organs by RPC-5 chromatography, dot blotting on nylon membranes, and hybridization (see graph in lower portion of Fig. 1B). Selenoprotein Expression—The expression of selenoproteins in liver, kidney, plasma, brain and testes of Trspfl/fl, Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/-, and Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice was assessed by 75Se labeling of the corresponding mice and by examining the resulting labeled proteins from these tissues following gel electrophoresis. Coomassie Blue-stained gels of total proteins from livers of these mice appeared similar (Fig. 2, lower panels) with the exception of an enriched band in the extract of Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice (designated by an arrow). We extracted this 25-kDa band from gels and sequenced the first 10 residues, PMILGYWNVR. This sequence is identical to that of mouse glutathione S-transferase, demonstrating that the expression of this enzyme is elevated in the liver of selenoprotein-deficient mice. The selenoprotein population was dramatically different in the livers of the three lines of mice. The liver in the Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- strain lacked virtually any selenoprotein expression. The three major bands observed on the gels of Trspfl/fl and Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/- mice were TR1 (57 kDa) and GPx1 (22 kDa), and an uncharacterized selenoprotein at 52 kDa (14Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To verify that the band at 57 kDa was TR1, crude extracts of liver were enriched on ADP-Sepharose columns, which are known to serve as an affinity matrix for this enzyme (14Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3840-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The small panel attached to the right of the liver panel shows the Western blot of the corresponding extracts enriched for TR1 from the three mouse lines, demonstrating that the labeled band at 57 kDa was indeed TR1. Interestingly, protein from the three mouse lines, including that from Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/-, appeared to be present in virtually the same amounts. These data suggested that the TR1 polypeptide was efficiently made in the liver knockout mouse, but the open reading frame terminated at the penultimate UGA codon, and thus did not contain Sec (see below). In contrast to the 75Se labeling pattern observed in these three mouse lines in liver, labeling of the corresponding selenoprotein population in kidney was virtually identical. The four major selenoprotein bands in kidney were likely TR1 (57 kDa), an uncharacterized 52-kDa selenoprotein, GPx1 (22 kDa), and GPx 4 (20 kDa) (14Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol.

GPx1 and TR1, which are major selenoproteins expressed in the liver, often exhibit changes in expression that are opposite to each other (14Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El-Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol.

Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To confirm the decreased expression of these two selenoproteins in Trsp knockout liver, we assayed GPx1 and TR1 activities in mouse lines carrying the Trspfl/fl and Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- genotypes. Consistent with the 75Se labeling assays, the liver of Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice had less than 5% of the GPx1 activity of that found in the floxed control mouse, whereas the activities in kidney were virtually identical in these two mouse lines (data not shown). TR1 activity was similarly reduced in the liver of the Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice (data not shown), but TR1 levels were virtually unchanged (see Fig. 2 and its legend), providing further evidence that the protein is terminated at the penultimate UGA Sec codon. Two major selenoproteins, SelP and GPx3, have been described in plasma (Ref. 22Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Motley A.K. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and references therein). SelP has been reported to be synthesized in the liver and transported to plasma (23Kato T. Read R. Rozga J. Burk R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G854-G858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Saijoh K. Saito N. Lee M.J. Fujii M. Kobayashi T. Sumino K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to be imported into the brain and testes (25Yang X. Hill K.E. Maguire M.J. Burk R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the kidney-proximal tubules are the major source of plasma GPx3 (26Avvisar N. Ornt D.B. Yagil Y. Horowitz S. Watkins R.H. Kerl E.A. Takahashi K. Palmer I.S. Cohen H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C367-C375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brain has been reported to express SelP mRNA, but not testes, suggesting that SelP is also synthesized in brain but not testes (25Yang X. Hill K.E. Maguire M.J. Burk R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SelP level was reduced about 75% in plasma in Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice as shown in Fig. 2, “Plasma” panel. To verify that the major labeled band observed in plasma was SelP, a membrane containing the 75Se-labeled liver extracts from these three mouse lines was exposed to antibodies for SelP (Fig. 2, see small panel (insert) attached to the right of the Plasma panel). The Western blot shows that the first and second lanes (Fig. 2) with plasma of Trspfl/fl and Trspfl/+-Alb-Cre+/- mice yielded a positive signal with SelP antibodies, but that the lane with plasma from Trspfl/fl-Alb-Cre+/- mice did not respond to SelP antibodies. These results demonstrate that the major 75Se-labeled band in plasma is SelP (see also Ref. 22Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Motley A.K. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that SelP antibodies do not detect SelP in tissues. 2K. E. Hill and R. F. Burk, personal communication. In contrast, the Coomassie Blue-stained gels of total proteins from plasma of the three mouse lines appeared to be similar. The 75Se-selenoprotein labeling pattern observed in brain was similar in the different genetic backgrounds of each animal examined, whereas in testes a band that migrates at the expected position of SelP was reduced. The labeling pattern of GPx3 in plasma suggests that its level may not be affected, providing further evidence that its presence in this tissue is the result of its synthesis in kidney (26Avvisar N.

https://openalex.org/W2143975749,"Cytokines and growth factors in malignant ascites are thought to modulate a variety of cellular activities of cancer cells and normal host cells. The motility of cancer cells is an especially important activity for invasion and metastasis. Here, we examined the components in ascites, which are responsible for cell motility, from patients and cancer cell-injected mice. Ascites remarkably stimulated the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. This response was inhibited or abolished by pertussis toxin, monoglyceride lipase, an enzyme hydrolyzing lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and Ki16425 and VPC12249, antagonists for LPA receptors (LPA1 and LPA3), but not by an LPA3-selective antagonist. These agents also inhibited the response to LPA but not to the epidermal growth factor. In malignant ascites, LPA is present at a high level, which can explain the migration activity, and the fractionation study of ascites by lipid extraction and subsequent thin-layer chromatography indicated LPA as an active component. A significant level of LPA1 receptor mRNA is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells with high migration activity to ascites but not in cells with low migration activity. Small interfering RNA against LPA1 receptors specifically inhibited the receptor mRNA expression and abolished the migration response to ascites. These results suggest that LPA is a critical component of ascites for the motility of pancreatic cancer cells and LPA1 receptors may mediate this activity. LPA receptor antagonists including Ki16425 are potential therapeutic drugs against the migration and invasion of cancer cells.

Most of these LPA actions are mediated through the lipid-specific EDG family G protein-coupled receptors, i.e. LPA1/EDG-2, LPA2/EDG-4, and LPA3/EDG-7 (8Moolenaar W.H. Exp.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1706-1711PubMed Google Scholar), it was difficult to determine the extent to which LPA, among a variety of potent cytokines and growth factors present in ascites, serves as a mediator of these responses. LPA receptor antagonists, LPA-neutralizing antibodies, or the LPA-specific degrading enzyme would be very useful for this purpose. Especially, receptor-selective antagonists are strong tools for identifying the subtype of LPA receptors that are responsible for the lipid action and would be a platform to develop therapeutic agents. We have recently developed a novel LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425, which shows a preference for LPA1 and LPA3 over LPA2 (32Ohta K. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.-S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Ki16425 showed an extremely high specificity to LPA and its receptors. Thus, Ki16425 may be a useful tool for evaluating the role of LPA in biological samples, such as ascites. In the present paper, we showed that a considerably high amount of LPA is present in ascites from pancreatic cancer patients and that the formation of LPA-rich ascites can be duplicated by an intraperitoneal injection of human pancreatic cancer cells in nude mice. Furthermore, our data indicated that LPA in malignant ascites is an important component for the motility of pancreatic cancer cells through Ki16425-sensitive LPA receptors, especially LPA1. Materials—1-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (LPA), l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine palmitoyl (LPC, C16:0), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI); fatty acid-free BSA was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. (San Diego, CA); dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP 8:0) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL); PTX was from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA); EGF was from Sigma; 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was from Dojindo (Tokyo, Japan); MG lipase was from Asahi Kasei Corp.

Ki16425 (3-(4-[4-([1-(2-chlorophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl amino)-3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl] benzylsulfonyl)propanoic acid) was synthesized by Kirin Brewery Co. (Takasaki, Japan), and VPC12249 was a generous gift from Prof. Kevin R. Lynch (University of Virginia School of Medicine). Mice—Female BALB/c nude mice (5 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Sterile food and water were fed to the mice ad libitum. The mice were maintained in sterile cages on sterile bedding and housed in rooms at a constant temperature and humidity. All experiments using mice were performed according to procedures approved by the Gunma University Animal Care Committee. Ascites from Cancer Patients—Eight Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer were available for this study at the Second Department of Surgery, Gunma University Faculty of Medicine from 2001 through 2003. Table I summarized the characteristics of the patients. A cytological examination demonstrated that the ascites contains cancer cells. Plasma or ascites were collected in the presence of EDTA (at a final concentration of 2–3 mm) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min to remove cells. The cell-free fluid was stored at -80 °C until use. Informed consent was obtained from each patient for the use of samples.Table ILPA-equivalent level in malignant ascites and plasma Malignant ascites and plasma were collected from pancreatic cancer patients (8 cases) and healthy volunteers. Malignant ascitic fluid was also collected from mice injected with YAPC-PD cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their LPA levels were evaluated as LPA-equivalent levels by a bioassay based on the ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation in LPA1-expressing RH7777 cells, as shown under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of observations is shown in parentheses.PatientGenderAgeLPA-equivalent levelAscitesPlasmanmCase 1Male754560404Case 2Male4053473Case 3Male722318158Case 4Male736637189Case 5Male515469200Case 6Male791208100Case 7Male45557160Case 8Female685371072728 ± 876 (8)174 ± 36 (8)Normal human241 ± 22 (14)Ascites from mouse624 ± 213 (6) Open table in a new tab Establishment of a Highly Peritoneal Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Cell Line, YAPC-PD—A human pancreatic cancer cell line, YAPC-PD, was established from YAPC cells, which had been previously established in our laboratory (33Yamada T. Okajima F. Adachi M. Ohwada S. Kondo Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The YAPC is not a highly peritoneal metastatic cell line, but, in one nude mouse of 30, which were injected in the peritoneal cavity with YAPC cells (1 × 107 per mouse), peritoneal dissemination with bloody ascites was detected 12 weeks after the injection. Cells in the bloody ascites were harvested and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Intermingled mouse fibroblasts gradually decreased in number and finally disappeared within a 4-week culture. The rest of the cells attached on dishes were harvested, and 1 × 107 cells were then injected in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice. The same procedure was repeated in a fifth cycle, and we obtained the YAPC-PD cell line, which induces peritoneal dissemination with high frequency. More than 90% of nude mice injected intraperitoneally with this cell line developed peritoneal dissemination with bloody ascites within 4 to 6 weeks. Ascites from Mice Injected with the Human Pancreatic Cancer Cell Line, YAPC-PD—Ten million cells of YAPC-PD were injected into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice. Four to 6 weeks later, mice that developed abdominal distension were killed, and bloody ascites was collected in the presence of EDTA (at a final concentration of 2–3mm). The bloody ascites was rendered cell-free by centrifugation as described above. Cell Culture—Human pancreatic cancer cell lines, PK-1, PK-9, and Panc-1, were kindly provided by the Cancer Cell Repository, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan), and MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, and HPAC were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The YAPC cells were transfected with a pEFneo empty vector alone or a pEFneo vector containing human LPA1 receptor (34Sato K. Ui M. Okajima F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by electroporation, and the neomycin (G418 sulfate at 1 mg/ml)-resistant cells were selected. All pancreatic cancer cell lines and the receptor-transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the medium was changed to a fresh medium (without serum) containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (fraction V) unless otherwise specified. Where indicated, PTX (100 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium 24 h before the experiments. Transfection of siRNA—Pancreatic cancer cell lines, YAPC-PD and Panc-1, were plated on 12 multiwell plates at ∼2.0 × 105 cells/well. Sixteen h later, siRNAs (total 30 nm) were introduced into cells using an RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the cells were further cultured for 24 h. The LPA receptor mRNA level was measured using real-time TaqMan technology, and a cell migration assay was performed 24 h after serum starvation as described later. The following 21-mer oligonucleotide pairs were used as siRNAs against human LPA1: LPA1-102, 5′-r(CCGAAGUGGAAAGCAUCUU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(AAGAUGCUUUCCACUUCGG)d(TT)-3′; LPA1-228, 5′-r(CCGCCGCUUCCAUUUUCCU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(AGGAAAAUGGAAGCGGCGG)d(TT)-3′; and LPA1-945, 5′-r(AGAAAUGAGCGCCACCUUU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(AAAGGUGGCGCUCAUUUCU)d(TT)-3′. The numbers 102, 228, and 945 represent the position in the nucleotide sequence of the coding region. The following 21-mer RNA was used as a negative control: 5′-r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA)d(TT)-3′. These annealed oligonucleotides were obtained from Qiagen K.K. as high performance purity grade and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Evaluation of LPA-like Activity—LPA in malignant ascites and plasma (0.5 ml, unless otherwise stated) was selectively extracted as alkaline-soluble lipids as described previously (35Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By this procedure, major lipid components, such as phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and other neutral lipids, can be removed. To evaluate the content of LPA in this extract, a sensitive and specific bioassay based on the ability of LPA to inhibit cAMP accumulation in LPA1-expressing RH7777 cells was used because vector-transfected RH7777 cells do not respond to LPA (20Im D.S. Heise C.E. Harding M.A. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Theodorescu D. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The LPA1-expressing RH7777 cells (a generous gift from Prof. Kevin R. Lynch, University of Virginia School of Medicine) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Three days before the experiments, cells were seeded on 12-well plates that were coated with rat-tail collagen (400 μg/ml). Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the medium was changed to fresh minimal essential medium containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were washed twice with a HEPES-buffered medium (36Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23940-23947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and incubated with the extract or LPA (C18:1) standard in a HEPES-buffered medium containing 10 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine at a final concentration of 500 μl. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Cyclic AMP in the acid extracts was measured (36Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23940-23947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The cAMP-inhibiting activity of LPA or test samples was completely lost by MG lipase, an enzyme hydrolyzing monoglycerides, such as LPA, or Ki16425, an LPA antagonist. Furthermore, the activity was unchanged even when the LPA-like activity was measured after further purification with silica gel high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Merck) using a solvent system consisting of BuOH/acetic acid/water (3:1:1). These results support the specificity of this bioassay. By this method, we detected LPA C18:1 (1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) equivalent activity that was as low as 1 pmol/assay well. The evaluated LPA-like activity in the test sample was presented as an LPA C18:1 equivalent level. MG Lipase Treatment—LPA (1 μm), EGF (100 ng/ml), or ascites (10%) were treated with MG lipase at 10 units/ml for 30 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA. In separate experiments, we added [3H]LPA to the assay medium and confirmed that more than 98% of LPA in the test samples was degraded under these conditions. These MG lipase-treated samples were finally used by 10 times dilution with the assay medium. Extraction of an Active Component from Ascites—The ascites were treated with 2 volumes of BuOH and separated into two phases. The BuOH-extracted components were further separated by HPTLC using a solvent system consisting of BuOH/acetic acid/water (3:1:1) (37Kimura T. Sato K. Kuwabara A. Tomura H. Ishiwara M. Kobayashi I. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31780-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The silica gel with the resolved lipids (about 1-cm length each) was scraped off to obtain lipids covering the entire area of migration. The lipids were eluted and dried by evaporation. All fractions thus separated were dissolved in an assay medium containing 0.1% BSA and used at the final concentration corresponding to 1% ascites. Cell Migration Assay—The migration experiment was performed using a Boyden chamber apparatus, as previously described (38Tamama K. Kon J. Sato K. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Kanda T. Ohta H. Ui M. Kobayashi I. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, YAPC-PD cells and other cancer cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin containing 0.02% EDTA, washed once, and resuspended with RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were loaded into the upper chamber, and test agents were placed in the lower chamber, unless otherwise specified. A membrane filter with 8-mm pores was precoated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml rat-tail collagen. When the effects of LPA antagonists were examined, the cells were preincubated for 10 min with antagonists before loading. The number of cells that had migrated for4htothe lower surface were determined by counting the cells in four places under microscopy at ×400 magnification. Unless otherwise stated, this Boyden chamber method was used for the evaluation of the migratory activity of the cells. In some experiments, Transwell chemotaxis chambers (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μm pore size) (Costar, Inc.) were used. Chemotaxis filters were soaked in 100 μg/ml rat-tail collagen overnight, similarly to the Boyden chamber method. The cells were first attached on the filters; unattached cells were then removed 1 h after seeding, and test agents were placed in the lower chamber. The number of the cells that migrated to the lower surface during a 4-h incubation was determined as described above. Matrigel Invasion Assay—Cell invasion activity was assessed by using a Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The procedures are essentially the same as those for the migration assay using Transwell chemotaxis chambers, except that the incubation time was 24 h. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cells were harvested by trypsin, seeded on 48-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA and test agents, and then incubated for 1 or 4 h. At each time, floating cells were aspirated, plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the attached cells were then evaluated by an 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (33Yamada T. Okajima F. Adachi M. Ohwada S. Kondo Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded on 48-well plates at 2 × 104 cells in 0.4 ml. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA, and cells were exposed to the test agents for an additional 24 h. Cell proliferation was evaluated by an 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (33Yamada T. Okajima F. Adachi M. Ohwada S. Kondo Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Using Real-time TaqMan Technology—Total RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) treatment to remove possible traces of genomic DNA contaminating the RNA preparations, 5 μg of the total RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To evaluate the expression levels of the LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4/GPR23 mRNAs, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using real-time TaqMan technology with a sequence detection system model 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The human LPA1-, LPA2-, LPA3-, LPA4/GPR23-, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific probes were obtained from Assay-on-Demand products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The ID numbers of the products are Hs00173500 for LPA1, Hs00173704 for LPA2, Hs00173857 for LPA3, Hs00271072 for LPA4/GPR23, and Hs99999905 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Amplification reaction was performed using the TaqMan universal PCR master mixture following the instructions from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. The procedure for the calculation of their expression was essentially the same as that described previously (39Aihara Y. Kasuya H. Onda H. Hori T. Takeda J. Stroke. 2001; 32: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The expression level of the target mRNA was normalized to the relative ratio of the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Each reverse transcriptase-PCR assay was performed at least three times, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared as described above. Twenty μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 3.7% formaldehyde in a 20 mm MOPS buffer and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N) with 20× standard saline citrate (SSC). The cDNA probe of LPA1 (20 ng) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random oligonucleotide priming and added to the blots at a concentration of about 5 × 106 disintegrations/min in 5 ml of a hybridization buffer as described previously (34Sato K. Ui M. Okajima F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out at 60 °C. Following hybridization, the blots were washed at 60 °C with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS as described previously (34Sato K. Ui M. Okajima F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data Presentation—All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate.

https://openalex.org/W2046507147,"The key transporter responsible for hepatic uptake of bile acids from portal circulation is Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, SLC10A1). This transporter is thought to be critical for the maintenance of enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and hepatocyte function. Therefore, functionally relevant polymorphisms in this transporter would be predicted to have an important impact on bile acid homeostasis/liver function. However, little is known regarding genetic heterogeneity in NTCP. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in NTCP in populations of European, African, Chinese, and Hispanic Americans. Specifically four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with a significant loss of transport function were identified. Cell surface biotinylation experiments indicated that the altered transport activity of T668C (Ile223 → Thr), a variant seen only in African Americans, was due at least in part to decreased plasma membrane expression. Similar expression patterns were observed when the variant alleles were expressed in HepG2 cells, and plasma membrane expression was assessed using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Interestingly the C800T (Ser267 → Phe) variant, seen only in Chinese Americans, exhibited a near complete loss of function for bile acid uptake yet fully normal transport function for the non-bile acid substrate estrone sulfate, suggesting this position may be part of a region in the transporter critical and specific for bile acid substrate recognition. Accordingly, our study indicates functionally important polymorphisms in NTCP exist and that the likelihood of being carriers of such polymorphisms is dependent on ethnicity.

Accordingly, our study indicates functionally important polymorphisms in NTCP exist and that the likelihood of being carriers of such polymorphisms is dependent on ethnicity. Bile acids, synthesized from the enzymatic catabolism of cholesterol, are the major solutes in bile, essential for the maintenance of bile flow and biliary lipid secretion (1St. Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an important mechanism for cholesterol homeostasis occurs through its elimination in the form of bile acids. Indeed de novo synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol is thought to account for nearly half of the daily elimination of cholesterol from the body (1St. Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the gastrointestinal tract, bile acids also modulate the release of pancreatic secretions and gastrointestinal peptides and activate enzymes required for the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins (2Koop I. Schindler M. Bosshammer A. Scheibner J. Stange E. Koop H. Gut. 1996; 39: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Riepl R.L. Fiedler F. Ernstberger M. Teufel J. Lehnert P. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996; 1: 499-505PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, their detergent properties assist solubilization of cholesterol and dietary fats in the intestine. Bile salts are efficiently reabsorbed in the small intestine and are returned to the liver via the portal circulation and resecreted into bile, thus forming an enterohepatic circuit (4Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The efficient enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids is maintained by polarized expression of bile acid uptake and efflux transporters in the intestine and liver (4Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Moreover, taurine or glycine conjugates of bile acids tend to be polar and hydrophilic, thus dependent on transporter proteins for cellular uptake and efflux (5Hofmann A.F. Feldman M. Scharschmidt B.F. Sleisenger M.H. Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1998: 937-948Google Scholar). In the liver, it is estimated that Na+-dependent transport pathways account for greater than 80% of the hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids such as taurocholate (6Muller M. Jansen P.L. J.

The transporter responsible for the observed Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated bile salts is Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, 1The abbreviations used are: NTCP, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ISBT, ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter; BSEP, bile salt export pump; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: NTCP, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ISBT, ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter; BSEP, bile salt export pump; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Investig. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This bile acid uptake transporter, whose function is coupled to a sodium gradient (15Weinman S.A. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1997; 70: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed exclusively in the liver and localized to the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte (16Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Hochli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human NTCP gene encodes a 349-amino acid protein (14Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and shares 77% amino acid sequence identity with rat Ntcp (17Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Hagenbuch et al. (18Hagenbuch B. Scharschmidt B.F. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, when Xenopus laevis oocytes were coinjected with total rat liver mRNA and antisense oligonucleotides specific to Ntcp, the expressed Na+-dependent taurocholate transport activity was reduced by 95%. This finding suggests a potentially central role for Ntcp in the hepatic uptake of bile acids. Accordingly, the extent of its expression or function would be predicted to significantly affect enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and directly affect cellular signaling pathways importantly involved in cholesterol homeostasis and hepatocyte function. One potential source of altered NTCP function may be genetic heterogeneity in this transporter related to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. Indeed, functional polymorphisms are known to exist among bile acid transporter family members. For example, mutations in the ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter (ISBT, SLC10A2) have been identified (19Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This transporter, expressed on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes and mediating the Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids in the intestine (20Craddock A.L. Love M.W.

Interestingly, certain loss of function mutations in the coding regions of ISBT result in a syndrome of primary bile acid malabsorption (19Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), characterized by severe diarrhea, malabsorption of fat, and malnutrition. Furthermore, a number of mutations in the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the ATP-dependent bile salt efflux transporter localized to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (25Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol.

Genet. 1998; 20: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), a progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by loss of biliary bile acid secretion and an absence of BSEP expression on the canalicular membrane. However, little is known regarding genetic heterogeneity in NTCP. The only published data to date have been a report of two SNPs in the coding region of NTCP in the Japanese population, conducted as a part of a large scale SNP discovery effort but lacking any functional studies of identified SNPs (28Saito S. Iida A. Sekine A. Ogawa C. Kawauchi S. Higuchi S. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Clearly, loss of function mutations in NTCP, if found to be present, would significantly add to our knowledge of the genetic basis of altered bile acid absorption, cholesterol elimination, and hepatocyte function. In this report we present data that support the presence of ethnicity-dependent functionally deleterious polymorphisms in NTCP. Moreover, functional studies indicate the presence of a discrete region within NTCP that is essential for bile acid substrate recognition. Materials—[3H]Taurocholate (3.4 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), unlabeled taurocholate, [3H]cholate (55 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), unlabeled cholate, [3H]estrone sulfate (53 Ci/mmol, >97% purity), and unlabeled estrone sulfate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant vaccinia virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (vtf-7) was a gift provided by Dr. Bernard Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal mouse anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Human liver samples were kindly provided by Dr. F. P. Guengerich at our institution. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy European American, African American, Chinese American, and Hispanic American volunteers was purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). All other chemical and reagents, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Identification of SNPs in NTCP—Initially, total genomic DNA was isolated from human liver samples (Nashville Regional Organ Procurement Agency, Nashville, TN) from 20 European American donors without any history of underlying liver pathology or prior medications via the DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified using an MBA 2000 mass spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 additional European American, 50 African American, and 50 Chinese American healthy volunteers was obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories. A 226-kilobase bacterial artificial chromosome clone (CNS01RG6) containing the complete intron-exon boundaries for the human NTCP gene was identified from the Human Genome Project (GenBank™). Primer pairs to amplify each of the five exonic regions of NTCP were designed and are as follows: exon 1, forward 5′-GAACTGCACAAGAAACGGAGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCTTCCCCTCAATTGTGAC-3′; exon 2, forward 5′-GCACTTAGCAGGCACTCAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GACAGTGAATCCTTAGAGTGC-3′; exon 3, forward 5′-CCAATTTCTACCTGTGCTTCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGCAGTGAGCTGAGAATGTG-3′; exon 4, forward 5′-CAGCACTGGGACAAAGTTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCTCAGGTCTAATATTGGAG-3′; exon 5, forward 5′-CACACTCTAGGGCTGAGTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTTCTTGGGTAGACACCCTGTC-3′. Using a GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), PCR was carried out using ∼200 ng of human liver genomic DNA for European American subjects or ∼25 ng of genomic DNA (Coriell Cell Repositories) previously digested with the restriction endonuclease XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) for additional European Americans and all African American and Chinese American subjects consisting of dNTPs (0.25 mm each), the specific primer pair (4 μm each), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. PCR was generally carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s for 30 cycles with the exception of exon 2, which was carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s for 30 cycles. PCR products of expected sizes were completely visualized using ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels and were fully sequenced in all subjects with an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). SNPs were identified utilizing the computer software program AlignX (Vector NTI, Version 7.0, InforMax, Inc., Frederick, MD) and confirmed by direct visualization of the sequences. A search of available SNP data bases 2Data bases included IMS-JST Japanese SNP (snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), dbSNP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db = snp), PharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org), and GeneCards™ (bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/). was performed to identify any additional polymorphisms. Wild-type and Variant NTCP Plasmid Construction—The full open reading frame of human NTCP cDNA was obtained by PCR using AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from a cDNA library synthesized from human liver mRNA using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATGGAGGCCCACAACGCGTCT-3′ as the forward and 5′-CTAGGCTGTGCAAGGGGA-3′ as the reverse. A single PCR product of expected size was visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gel. An aliquot of the PCR product was ligated into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). After transformation and growth in Escherichia coli, individual colonies containing the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO®/NTCP construct were identified. A pEF6/V5-His-TOPO®/NTCP with the NTCP cDNA inserted in the sense orientation downstream from the T7 promoter region was fully sequenced using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and found to fully match the published reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_003049) (14Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This clone was termed NTCP*1. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create the identified nonsynonymous allelic variants: C800T and T836C identified from Chinese American samples, A940G identified from a Hispanic American sample, and T668C identified from African American samples. The appropriate point mutations were introduced individually into wild-type NTCP (*1) packaged into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following oligonucleotide primers: C800T, forward 5′-CAAAATGTCCAACTCTGTTTCACCATCCTCAATGTGGCCTTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAAGGCCACATTGAGGATGGTGAAACAGAGTTGGACATTTTG-3′; T668C, forward 5′-GCCATGACACCACTCTTGACTGCCACCTCCTCCCTGATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCAGGGAGGAGGTGGCAGTCAAGAGTGGTGTCATGGC-3′; T836C, forward 5′-GGCCTTTCCACCTGAAGTCACTGGACCACTTTTCTTCTTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAAGAAGAAAAGTGGTCCAGTGACTTCAGGTGGAAAGGCC-3′; A940G, forward 5′-GAGAAATTCAAGACTCCCGAGGATAAAACAAAAATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATTTTTGTTTTATCCTCGGGAGTCTTGAATTTCTC-3′. The presence of the mutations was verified by full sequencing. Wild-type and variant NTCP were renamed the following for expression studies: wild-type, NTCP*1; C800T, NTCP*2; T668C, NTCP*3; T836C, NTCP*4; and A940G, NTCP*5. Determination of Genotypic Frequencies—Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed to determine the genotypic frequencies of the nonsynonymous polymorphisms C800T, T668C, T836C, and A940G. PCR was carried out as previously described utilizing genomic DNA digested previously with the restriction endonuclease XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) from a total of 90 European American, 90 African American, 90 Hispanic American, and 100 Chinese American healthy volunteers (Coriell Cell Repositories) with primers to amplify exon 3 and exon 4 of the NTCP gene. Single PCR products of expected sizes were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. PCR products were fully sequenced in all subjects using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Allele frequencies were calculated based upon the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Cell Culture and Virus Preparation—HeLa (American Type Culture Collection) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For preparation of a viral stock of vtf-7 virus, HeLa cells grown to near confluency in 25-cm tissue culture plates were infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/10 cells. After an incubation period of 48 h at 37 °C, the infected cells were pelleted, homogenized, and recovered through centrifugation followed by titering of viral stock as described by Blakely et al. (29Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Human hepatoma (American Type Culture Collection) cells (HepG2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfection, cells were grown on sterile uncoated 35-mm glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected at 70-80% confluency with 4 μg of V5-tagged NTCP plasmid DNA (NTCP*1, -*2, or -*3) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Transport Studies Using Recombinant Vaccinia Virus—HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates (∼0.8 × 106 cells/well) were infected with vaccinia (vtf-7) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells in each well were then transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or variant NTCP cDNA packaged into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) along with Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The parental plasmid lacking any insert was used as control. Transport was then evaluated using labeled substrates as outlined previously (30Kim R.B. Leake B. Cvetkovic M. Roden M.M. Nadeau J. Walubo A. Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 1204-1209PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the taurocholate, cholate, and estrone sulfate transport kinetics, radiolabeled substrate uptake during the linear phase (first 3 min) was assessed in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled compound. Passive diffusion was determined by carrying out parallel experiments using the parental plasmid DNA lacking the transporter cDNA, and this value was then subtracted from the total uptake rate seen in the presence of the transporter cDNA. Michaelis-Menten-type nonlinear curve fitting was carried out to obtain estimates of the maximal uptake rate (Vmax) and the concentration at which half the maximal uptake occurs (Km) (Prism™, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All experiments were carried out in duplicate on at least 2-3 experimental days. Epitope-tagged Wild-type and Variant NTCP Construction—Because of a lack of a high affinity antibody to human NTCP, we utilized a 14-amino acid epitope (V5) in the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) to generate V5-tagged wild-type and variant NCTP proteins. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce a point mutation that converted the stop codon of NTCP to a lysine residue (TAG → AAG) utilizing the following oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers: 5′-CTGCTCCCCTTGCACAGCCAAGAAGGGCAATTCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGAATTGCCCTTCTTGGCTGTGCAAGGGGAGCAG-3′. The presence of the mutation was verified by full sequencing. The V5 tag was generated for wild-type NTCP and each of the nonsynonymous NTCP variants, and these were used for characterization of total protein and cell surface expression. NTCP Expression in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells transfected with NTCP cDNA tagged with the V5 epitope were scraped off plates, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was reconstituted with HED buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. Samples were diluted with Laemmli buffer, and 3.75 μg of total cell protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Invitrogen) and appropriate secondary antibody. To normalize sample loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-calnexin antibody (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). NTCP Cell Surface Expression—HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with the NTCP cDNAs tagged with the V5 epitope using a similar protocol for transport experiments. Sixteen hours post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ (138 mm NaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and then treated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin, 1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with the same buffer to remove the remaining labeling agent. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were disrupted with 700 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. Following centrifugation, 140 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) was added to 600 μl of cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were released by incubation of the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Similar to total cell lysates, samples of the biotinylated fractions (25 μl) were subjected to Western analysis for detection of immunodetectable NTCP with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution) and the intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin as described previously. Deglycosylation of Total and Cell Surface-expressed NTCP—HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with the wild-type NTCP cDNA tagged with the V5 epitope using a protocol similar to that for transport experiments. Total and cell-surface expressed fractions of wild-type NTCP (*1) were isolated as described previously and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation (Glyko, San Leandro, CA). Briefly 15 μl of total or cell-surface expressed NTCP*1 was dissolved in 30 μl of deionized water. 10 μl of 5× incubation buffer (0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and 2.5 μl of denaturation solution (2% SDS and 1 m β-mercaptoethanol) were added to the proteins, gently mixed, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, 2.5 μl of detergent solution (15% Nonidet P-40) was added to the proteins. Then 1 μl each of N-glycanase, sialidase A, and O-glycanase or 3 μl of water (control) was added to the proteins and subsequently incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Samples were diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western analysis by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels for detection of immunodetectable NTCP with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution). Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HepG2 cells transiently transfected with V5-tagged NTCP plasmid DNA were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 70% methanol. After a 5-min wash in PBS, cells were permeabilized for 10 min in PBT (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4). After a 5-min wash in PBS, cells were placed in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in primary antibody (anti-V5 antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4), cells were then incubated with secondary fluorescent dye (Texas Red)-labeled goat anti-mouse whole antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After three 5-min washes in PBST, cells were placed in PBS and viewed by confocal microscopy. HepG2 cells transfected with plasmid alone and cells transfected with V5-tagged NTCP wild-type plasmid DNA without incubation in primary antibody were used as two separate controls. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope equipped with a LSM510 laser scanning unit. A Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat oil immersion objective was used for all experiments. Confocal images were obtained using single excitation (595 nm) and emission (610-630 nm Texas Red) filter sets. For slow frame scanning, confocal images were obtained by scanning either laterally (top view, x-y scans) or axially (side view, x-z scans) across the cell. Image analysis and processing were performed with Zeiss LSM and Adobe Photoshop software. Statistical Analysis—Determination of the statistical differences between various group parameters was determined using either Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance (using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test), or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was taken to be the minimum level of statistical significance. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in NTCP—To identify coding region SNPs, initial screening PCR was performed on all five exons of NTCP from genomic DNA samples of 50 European Americans, 50 African Americans, and 50 Chinese Americans and analyzed by direct sequencing. Obtained sequences were compared with the published NTCP reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_003049). Two nonsynonymous SNPs were identified by direct sequencing of PCR products from this initial screening of genomic DNA samples. The allelic variant C800T (Ser267 → Phe), in exon 4 of NTCP, was observed in 6 of 50 Chinese American DNA samples but was not seen in European Americans or African Americans (Fig. 1B). Another allelic variant T668C (Ile223 → Thr), in exon 3 of NTCP, was identified in 4 of 50 African American DNA samples but not seen in European Americans"
https://openalex.org/W2012733189,"We have shown that mitochondrial DNA-depleted (ρ0) SK-Hep1 hepatoma cells are resistant to apoptosis, contrary to previous papers reporting normal apoptotic susceptibility of ρ0 cells. We studied the changes of gene expression in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells. DNA chip analysis showed that MnSOD expression was profoundly increased in ρ0 cells. O2·¯ contents increased during ρ0 cell derivation but became normalized after establishment of ρ0 phenotypes, suggesting that MnSOD induction is an adaptive process to increased O2·¯. ρ0 cells were resistant to menadione, paraquat, or doxorubicin, and O2·¯ contents after treatment with them were lower in ρ0 cells compared with parental cells because of MnSOD overexpression. Expression levels and activity of glutathione peroxidases were also increased in ρ0 cells, rendering them resistant to exogenous H2O2. ρ0 cells were resistant to p53, and intracellular ROS contents after p53 expression were lower compared with parental cells. Other types of ρ0 cells also showed increased MnSOD expression and resistance against ROS. Heme oxygenase-1 expression was increased in ρ0 cells, and a heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor decreased the induction of MnSOD in ρ0 cells and their resistance against ROS donors. These results indicate that ρ0 cells are resistant to cell death contrary to previous reports and suggest that an adaptive increase in the expression of antioxidant enzymes renders cancer cells or aged cells with frequent mitochondrial DNA mutations to resist against oxidative stress, host anti-cancer surveillance, or chemotherapeutic agents, conferring survival advantage on them.

Such cells and their cybrids provided valuable cell models for studying important functions of mitochondria such as oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, electron transport, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition to such well known functions, recent investigations revealed that mitochondria are the master players in both apoptosis and necrosis, two classical modes of cell death (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar, 3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Because of the essential role of mitochondria in cell death, ρ0 cells could be employed as important tools for the study of cell death. However, most ρ0 cells have been reported to undergo apoptosis as efficiently as their parental cells (4Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C.

In contrast, we have reported that mtDNA-depleted hepatoma cells (SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells) are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which is consistent with the importance of mitochondria in cell death (7Kim J.Y. Kim Y.H. Chang I. Kim S. Pak Y.K. Oh B.H. Yagita H. Jung Y.K. Oh Y.J. Lee M.-S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3139-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is not clearly elucidated how those cells with mitochondrial dysfunction resist cell death. It is even not well understood how such cells with defective oxidative phosphorylation survive. We studied the changes of the gene expression profile in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells that allow them to survive in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation and to resist against apoptotic stimuli. We observed that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and other antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx) are up-regulated in those cells leading to an efficient disposal of increased oxidative stress and increased resistance against ROS or p53, which might be related to the resistance of cancer cells (8Polyak K.

Our results indicate that ρ0 cells are resistant to various forms of cell death contrary to previous reports and that intact mitochondrial function is crucial for the execution of cell death. MtDNA-depleted ρ0 Cells—SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were derived from SK-Hep1 hepatoma cells by culturing in the presence of 100 ng/ml EtBr for more than 20 generations (7Kim J.Y. Kim Y.H. Chang I. Kim S.

PCR analysis using primers specific for human or murine mtDNA, measurement of cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP contents all indicated that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells (12Park K.-S. Nam K.-J. Kim J.-W. Lee Y.-B. Han C.-Y. Jeong J.-K. Lee H.-K. Pak Y.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E1007-E1014PubMed Google Scholar) and MIN6N8 ρ0 cells are authentic ρ0 cells. MDA-MB-435 ρ0 cells of a breast cancer cell origin were derived by essentially the same method (14Delsite R. Kachhap S. Anbazhagan R. Gabrielson E. Singh K.K. Mol. Cancer. 2002; 1: 1-10Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All ρ0 cells were maintained in the presence of 50 μg/ml uridine. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from parental cells and SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was digested by RNase-free DNase I treatment for 20 min, extracted using phenolchloroform, and then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. Reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–18 primer. PCR amplification using primer sets specific for each target gene was carried out at 59 °C annealing temperature for 25 cycles. Nucleotide sequences of the primers were based on published cDNA sequences (MnSOD forward, GGTAGCACCAGCACTAGCAG; MnSOD reverse, GTGCAGTACTCTATACCACTACA; copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) forward, CAGTGCAGGTCCTCACTTTA; Cu,Zn-SOD reverse, CCTGTCTTTGTACTTTCTTC; classical GPx (cGPx) forward, AAGGTACTACTTATCGAGAATGTG; cGPx reverse, GTCAGGCTCGATGTCAATGGTCTG; phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (PHGPx) forward, TGTGCGCGCTCCATGCACGAGT; PHGPx reverse, AAATAGTGGGGCAGGTCCTTCTCT; catalase forward, TTAATCCATTCGATCTCACC; catalase reverse, GGCGGTGAGTGTCAGGATAG; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, TTCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT); heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) forward, CAGGCAGAGAATGCTGAGTTC; HO-1 reverse, GATCTTGAGCAGGAACGCAGT. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using a commercial protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). After adding a loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 8% glycerol, and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol, an equal amount of protein for each sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation in 1:1,000 dilution of primary antibodies to MnSOD (Calbiochem), Cu,Zn-SOD(Upstate USA Inc., Charlottesville, VA) or cGPx (Labfrontier Co., Seoul, Korea), membranes were probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Bound antibody was visualized using an ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Cell Death—After treatment of cells with 25 to 75 mm menadione (Sigma), 1 to 20 mm paraquat (Sigma), 50 to 100 mm H2O2 (Sigma), 100 to 200 nm doxorubicin (Donga Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea), or infection with Avpp53 (15Hwang E.S. Kim J. Kim J.S. Kao C. Chung L. Lee J.-H. Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer. 1998; 8: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the trypan blue exclusion test was performed by incubating cells in 0.02% trypan blue solution (Invitrogen) for 5 min. Avpp53 and Ad5CMVSOD2 (Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) were propagated in HEK 293 cells and concentrated by the standard CsCl ultracentrifugation method. Cells seeded on 96-well plates were infected with Avpp53 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 in a serum-free medium for 1 h. For multiple adenoviral transduction, Ad5CMVSOD2 infection at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100 was performed 24 h before Avpp53 infection. For some experiments, preincubation with 1 mmN-acetylcysteine (Sigma) or 1 mm reduced GSH (Sigma) for 30 min or with Zn(II) protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP, Frontier Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) for 24 h was done before treatment with test reagents. ROS Measurement—For intracellular superoxide anion (O2·¯) measurement, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml fresh dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 15 min. Flow cytometry was conducted after washing in Hanks' balanced salt solution (excitation, 518 nm; emission, 605 nm). In the case of intracellular H2O2, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml fresh 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 30 min for flow cytometry (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm). GPx Activity—cGPx activity was measured using a published protocol with modifications (16Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In short, postnuclear fractions were prepared by douncing cells in an isotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin) and spinning down at 800 × g. Supernatant comprising both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fraction was sonicated in a Branson sonifier 450 (Danbury, CT) and saved for measurement of enzymatic activity. Appropriately diluted protein samples were added to 700 μl of the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 0.5 unit of glutathione reductase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The reaction was started by adding 350 μl of 0.22 mmt-butyl hydroperoxide as a substrate at 25 °C. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored by a UV spectrophotometer for conversion to the enzyme activity. The rate of the decrease in A340 was converted to the activity using the following formula: 1 milliunit/ml = 1 nmol of NADPH/min/ml = ΔA340/min/0.00622. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (17Suk K. Chang I. Kim Y.H. Kim S. Kim J.Y. Kim H. Lee M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13153-13159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides of the consensus NF-κB binding sequence, AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC (Promega), were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract was incubated with the labeled probe in the presence of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES at room temperature for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Increased MnSOD Expression in SK-Hep1 ρ0 Cells—First, we studied the changes of gene expression in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells using DNA chip analysis (Genomic Tree, Taejon, Korea). Among the genes that were overexpressed in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells, MnSOD was one of the genes that showed the most striking increase in the expression levels compared with parental cells (-fold increase of 20.9). The increased expression of MnSOD in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to MnSOD that is expressed in mitochondria and metabolizes O2·¯ produced during mitochondrial electron transfer, the expression of Cu,Zn-SOD, another major superoxide dismutase expressed in cytoplasm was not changed as demonstrated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Increased ROS Production during ρ0 Cell Derivation but Not in Established ρ0 Cells—The increased expression of MnSOD could be an adaptive response to the failure of mitochondrial electron transport and an increase in the leakage of O2·¯ from mitochondria of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells (18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). As SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells might be in a new equilibrium between increased O2·¯ production and increased MnSOD expression, they might not be good models to study the changes in ROS contents by the interruption of mitochondrial electron transfer (see Fig. 2C). Thus, we reiterated the derivation of mtDNA-depleted SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells by culturing parental cells with 100 ng/ml EtBr and studied if the blockade of the mitochondrial electron transfer by the inhibition of mtDNA replication with EtBr leads to an increased intracellular ROS. As hypothesized, intracellular O2·¯ contents measured by dihydroethidium were increased after incubation of parental cells with EtBr for 10 days compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complexes blocks mitochondrial electron transport between mitochondrial respiratory complexes and enhances the production of O2·¯ (18Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Intracellular H2O2 measured by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was not increased by SK-Hep1 parental cell treatment with EtBr probably because the compensatory increase in MnSOD and the adaptive increase in the dismutation of O2·¯ to H2O2 had not yet occurred after 10 days of treatment (Fig. 2B). O2·¯ contents in fully established SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells that have been maintained for more than 2 years was not different from that in parental cells probably because of the equilibrium between the increased O2·¯ production and increased O2·¯ dismutation (Fig. 2C). Resistance of SK-Hep1 ρ0 Cells against ROS—Next, we studied if SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were resistant to ROS by metabolizing ROS efficiently because of the increased expression of MnSOD. We first treated SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells and parental cells with menadione, a prototypic oxygen stressor of the quinonoid type producing O2·¯ (19Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hollensworth S.B. Shen C.-C. Sim J.E. Spitz D.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We employed a trypan blue exclusion assay as a measure of cell death because ROS induces cell death of mixed patterns showing both necrosis and apoptosis depending on the experimental condition and differentiation between necrosis, and apoptosis on the morphological ground does not have much significance when the death effector is already known as ROS (21Higuchi M. Honda T. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2753-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187 (G. D.): 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was not employed because such assay testing of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was not considered appropriate when studying cells with mtDNA depletion. Treatment with 25–75 μm menadione for 24 h induced death of SK-Hep1 parental cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were resistant to treatment with menadione (Fig. 3A). Because these results suggested the possibility that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells acquired resistance to menadione by metabolizing O2·¯ more rapidly because of the increased MnSOD, we next measured the intracellular O2·¯ contents after treatment with menadione. As hypothesized, intracellular O2·¯ contents after treatment of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells with 1 mm menadione for 20 min were significantly lower than that after the same treatment of parental cells (Fig. 3B). O2·¯ contents before menadione treatment was not different between the two cells probably because of the equilibrium between the increases in O2·¯ production and that in disposal (Fig. 2C). Contents of H2O2 after menadione treatment that is produced from O2·¯ by SOD were not significantly different between SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells and parental cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting a new equilibrium between the increased dismutation of O2·¯ and an increased processing of H2O2 in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells (see Figs. 5 and 6).Fig. 5Increased GPx expression in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells.A, RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of cGPx and PHGPx was increased in ρ0 cells compared with parental cells at the RNA level, whereas the expression of catalase was not different between the two cells. B, immunoblot analysis showed that cGPx protein expression was increased in ρ0 cells. C, cGPx activity was also increased in ρ0 cells compared with parental cells (mean ± S.D.).

Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 123: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Huang T.-T. Yasunami M. Carlson E.J. Gillespie A.N. Reaume A.G. Hoffman E.K. Chan P.H. Scott R.W. Epstein C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Treatment with 1–20 mm paraquat induced death of SK-Hep1 parental cells in a dose-dependent manner; however, SK-Hep1 ρ0 cell death after paraquat treatment was markedly less compared with parental cells (Fig. 4A). Similar to the menadione treatment, intracellular O2·¯ contents after treatment of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells with 10 mm paraquat were lower than that after the same treatment of parental cells, which is consistent with our hypothesis that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells are able to metabolize O2·¯ more rapidly by increased MnSOD and acquired resistance to O2·¯ (Fig. 4B). H2O2 contents after paraquat treatment were not significantly different between SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells and parental cells, similar to menadione treatment (Fig. 4C). Next we studied the expression of H2O2 metabolizing enzymes and the susceptibility of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells to H2O2 because SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells may need to process increased intracellular H2O2 by MnSOD overexpression. We studied the expression of GPx that catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 to H2O and O2 in various compartments of the cells including mitochondria (25Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of 2 types of GPx (cGPx and PHGPx) that are expressed in mitochondria (25Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was increased in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells compared with parental cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the expression of catalase that metabolizes H2O2 in peroxisome was not increased (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis also demonstrated that the expression of the cGPx protein was increased in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells (Fig. 5B). The increased cGPx expression was functional because cGPx activity in the postnuclear fraction of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells comprising both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions was significantly increased compared with parental cells (Fig. 5C). To directly prove that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells have an increased ability to process H2O2, we studied susceptibility of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells to exogenous H2O2 that readily permeates across biological membranes (26Mathai J.C. Sitaramam V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 27: 17784-17793Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Similar to other oxidative stressors, 50–100 μm H2O2 induced SK-Hep1 parental cell death in a dose-dependent manner. However, SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were markedly resistant to H2O2, suggesting a more rapid disposal of exogenous H2O2 by the increased GPx expression (Fig. 6A). Intracellular H2O2 contents after H2O2 treatment were also lower in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells compared with parental cells (Fig. 6B), which is consistent with our hypothesis that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells acquired resistance to H2O2 by the increased expression of cGPx or PHGPx. H2O2 contents before H2O2 treatment were not different between the two cells (Fig. 6C). Resistance of SK-Hep1 ρ0 Cells to p53—Next we studied the possible resistance of SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells against p53 because several previous reports indicated the role of ROS in p53-induced apoptosis (27Johnson T.M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 28Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 29Li P.-F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). SK-Hep1 cell death after infection with adenovirus expressing p53 (Avpp53) was dependent upon ROS because antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or GSH inhibited p53-induced SK-Hep1 parental cell death (Fig. 7A). Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were markedly resistant to adenoviral transduction of p53, consistent with our hypothesis (Fig. 7B). Both intracellular O2·¯ and H2O2 contents in SK-Hep1 parental cells were increased after adenoviral expression of p53, consistent with the inhibition of p53-induced SK-Hep1 cell death by antioxidants (Fig. 7C). Intracellular O2·¯ and H2O2 contents after adenoviral expression of p53 in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were not apparently different from that before infection, suggesting that the increased expression of MnSOD and GPx protected SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells from p53-induced death by attenuating ROS production (Fig. 7C). In addition to p53, SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells were resistant to doxorubicin that induces target cell death by multiple mechanisms including DNA breakage, p53 induction (30Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 31Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), and ROS production (32Mimnaugh E.G. Trush M.A. Gram T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Morgan W.A. Kaler B. Bach P.H. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 94: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7D). Protection of Parental Cells by MnSOD Overexpression—To directly prove the role of MnSOD in the resistance against ROS or p53, we infected parental cells with adenovirus expressing MnSOD (Ad5CMVSOD2). MnSOD expression was strongly induced by infection with Ad5CMVSOD2 (Fig. 8A). Adenoviral overexpression of MnSOD partly but significantly reduced target cell death by menadione, paraquat, adenoviral p53 expression, and doxorubicin, suggesting that the increased dismutation of O2·¯ by adenoviral MnSOD expression decreased cell death by ROS donors or p53. However, SK-Hep1 cell death by H2O2 that occurs downstream of MnSOD was not decreased by adenoviral expression of MnSOD (Fig. 8B). Resistance of Other Types of ρ0 Cells against ROS—To investigate if the increased expression of MnSOD and the resistance against ROS are restricted to a specific type of ρ0 cells (SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells) or relevant to other types of ρ0 cells, we examined the expression of MnSOD in MIN6N8 ρ0 cells and MDA-MB-435 ρ0 cells. Both cells had increased expression of MnSOD compared with their respective parental cells and showed resistance against menadione (Fig. 9, A and B), paraquat, or doxorubicin (data not shown), suggesting that the induction of MnSOD and the resistance against ROS are general phenomena common to a wide variety of ρ0 cells. Role of HO-1 in MnSOD Induction—To address the mechanism of antioxidant enzyme induction in ρ0 cells, we studied the possible activation of NF-κB that is reportedly activated by ROS and induces MnSOD expression. However, our electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis clearly showed that NF-κB was not activated in untreated SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells, whereas treatment with 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α for 15 min induced strong NF-κB activation in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells as well as parental cells (Fig. 10A). We next studied the role of HO-1 whose expression was increased more than 4-fold in our DNA chip analysis and which has been reported to induce MnSOD in response to oxidative stress (34Manganaro F. Chopra V.S. Mydlarski M.B. Bernatchez G. Schipper H.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Frankel D. Mehindate K. Schipper H.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A strong induction of HO-1 in SK-Hep1 ρ0 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 10B). Treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP for 24 h decreased the expression of MnSOD and cGPx at RNA and prote"

Mutation of residues Phe-668 (helix II), Arg-680, or Phe-684 (helix III) to Ala (or Val or Leu) and Glu-837 (helix VII) to Ile (or Gln) reduced the inhibitory effects of NPS 2143 on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses. The calcimimetic NPS R-568 increases the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in functional assays of CaR.

In all cases, mutant CaRs responded normally to Ca<sup>2+</sup> or phenylalanine, which act at distinct site(s). Discrimination by the Arg-680 mutant is consistent with the structural differences between NPS 2143, which contains an alkyl bridge hydroxyl group, and NPS R-568, which does not. The homology model of the CaR transmembrane domain robustly accounts for binding of both an allosteric antagonist and agonist, which share a common site, and provides a basis for the development of more specific and/or potent allosteric modulators of CaR. These studies suggest that the bRho backbone can be used as a starting point for homology modeling of even distantly related G protein-coupled receptors and provide a rational framework for investigation of the contributions of the transmembrane domain to CaR function."
https://openalex.org/W2169811773,"Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by ventricular dilation with systolic dysfunction of cardiac muscle. Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in genes for cytoskeleton proteins distributed in the Z-disc and/or intercalated discs of the cardiac muscle are major predictors of cardiomyopathy. However, as mutations in these genes can account for only a part of the patient population, there should be another disease-causing gene(s) for cardiomyopathy. Cypher/ZASP appears to be an ideal candidate for the cardiomyopathy causative gene, because Cypher/ZASP encodes a Z-disc associated protein, and recent studies have demonstrated that Cypher/ZASP knock-out mice develop cardiomyopathy. In this study, we searched for sequence variations in Cypher/ZASP in 96 unrelated Japanese patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. A D626N mutation located within the third LIM domain was identified in a familial case but not found in the unrelated controls. A family study of the patient showed that all affected siblings tested had the same mutation. Clinical information of the affected family members suggested that the mutation was associated with late onset cardiomyopathy. To reveal the biochemical changes due to the mutation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and a pull-down assay. It was demonstrated by both assays that the D626N mutation of Cypher/ZASP increased the affinity of the LIM domain for protein kinase C, suggesting a novel biochemical mechanism of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Family studies of DCM patients have demonstrated that 20-35% of DCM is caused by inherited gene mutations (familial DCM) (1Grunig E. Tasman J.A. Kucherer H. Franz W. Kubler W. Katus H.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although familial DCM can be transmitted as autosomal recessive, X-linked, or through mitochondrial traits, it is evident that autosomal dominant inheritance occurs the most (2Seidman J.G. Seidman C.

However, mutations in the known causative genes can be found only in a part of the patient population. In addition, linkage studies in multiplex families have suggested that there are several other disease loci of which the gene responsible for causing DCM remains to be identified, including one mapped on 10q21-q23 (16Bowles K.R.

Abnormalities in Z-disc-related cytoskeletal proteins are associated with DCM also in animal models. For example, mice lacking MLP display many characteristic features of human DCM (17Arber S.

Similarly, loss of δ-sarcoglycan results in DCM in a hamster model (18Nigro V. Okazaki Y. Belsito A. Piluso G. Matsuda Y. Politano L. Nigro G. Ventura C. Abbondanza C. Molinari A.M. Acampora D.

Rep. 2000; 2: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Myocardial function is associated with the regulation or activation of cell signal kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC). For example, modification of myocardial proteins by PKC plays a key role in the regulation of contractility and the growth of cardiomyocytes (21Steinberg S.F. Goldberg M. Rybin V.O. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 141-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas alterations in the expression, activity, or localization of PKC are associated with cardiac hypertrophy and failure (22Bowling N.

Recently, a gene for the PDZ and LIM domain-containing cytoskeletal protein, Cypher/ZASP, was identified in mouse (Cypher) (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol.

In addition, Cypher/ZASP knock-out mice display disorganized and fragmented Z-discs in both skeletal and cardiac muscles, leading to a severe form of congenital myopathy and cardiomyopathy (27Huang C.

Moreover, human Cypher/ZASP is mapped on chromosome 10q22.3-q23.2 (University of California at Santa Cruz Human Genome Browser, July 2003; chromosome 10, 88093025-88159329) (25Faulkner G.

We report here a Cypher/ZASP gene mutation, associated with late-onset familial DCM, that increases the LIM-PKC interaction. This is the first report suggesting that an abnormality in the anchoring-protein of PKC may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DCM. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis of Cypher/ZASP—Expression of Cypher/ZASP was investigated by RT-PCR analyses using mRNAs from various human tissues. The combination of primers used in the RT-PCR are as follows: F1N (5′-GTGCCCTCTCACTCAACCCTCT-3′) in exon 1 and R4 (5′-GAGTCCAGCCTGTTGGGGTGG-3′) in exon 9; F2 (5′-CAGGAACGCTTCAACCCCAGTG-3′) in exon 6 and R8 (5′-GGGCTGTAGGAAGAGGCCTGG-3′) in exon 11; 365PF (5′-TTCTCCTCACTCGCCGAGG-3′) in exon 4 and R2 (5′-GCATGAATTCTGTCCCCGTCATCT-3′) in exon 7; and LIMF (5′-GAATTCAGCAGCCGGACTCCACTCT-3′) in exon 12 and R3N (5′-CCTCCCGAATCCTTTGTTGCCAG-3′) in exon 16. Subjects—Patients and family members were evaluated as described previously (12Itoh-Satoh M. Hayashi T. Nishi H. Koga Y. Arimura T. Koyanagi T. Takahashi M. Hohda S. Ueda K. Nouchi T. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Imaizumi T. Yasunami M. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thirty-four proband patients with familial DCM and 62 sporadic DCM cases were the subjects. These patients had been examined before and had no mutation in the genes for dystrophin, α-cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, β-cardiac myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, α-tropomyosin, vinculin, MLP, Tcap/telethonin, and titin. When a sequence variation in Cypher/ZASP was found, family relatives and 400 unrelated healthy controls were examined. Blood samples were collected after obtaining informed consent from the subjects. All patients and controls were Japanese. The protocol for research on human materials was approved by the Ethics Reviewing Committee of the Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Genomic DNA Extraction and PCR-SSCP Analysis—DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes from each subject. Extracted DNA was subjected to PCR by using primer pairs specific to the analyzed regions. Sequences of primers are available upon request. The PCR products from the subjects were searched for sequence variations by the PCR-SSCP method (12Itoh-Satoh M. Hayashi T. Nishi H. Koga Y. Arimura T. Koyanagi T. Takahashi M. Hohda S. Ueda K. Nouchi T. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Imaizumi T. Yasunami M. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). When an abnormal SSCP pattern was obtained, the PCR fragment was sequenced on both strands. To confirm the D626N mutation in exon 15, TspEI was used for detection of the mutation, and the digestion products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel. Yeast Two-hybrid (Y2H) Assay—The cDNA fragments of human Cypher/ZASP and PKC were obtained by RT-PCR from human adult heart cDNA. A cDNA fragment covering the third LIM domain of the wild type Cypher/ZASP (Cypher-C) was amplified using primers LIMcF (5′-GAATTCAGCACCAAGTGCCATGGCTGCGAT-3′; underlined sequences are added for cloning) and LIMR (5′-GGATCCCTACAAGTTGATGGTGTGTGC-3′), whereas an equivalent mutant cDNA fragment (Cypher-M) having a G to A substitution on the sense strand (boldfaced letters in LIMcF and LIMmF) was amplified using primers LIMmF (5′-GAATTCAGCACCAAGTGCCATGGCTGCAAT-3′) and LIMR. The cDNA fragments containing a conserved region of PKC-α (PKCA-P), PKC-ϵ (PKCE-P), and PKC-ζ (PKCZ-P) were obtained using the following primers: PKC-AF (5′-GAATTCATGGCTGACGTTTTCCCGG-3′) and PKC-AR (5′-GGATCCGCAGAGGCTGGGGACATTG-3′) (containing two C1 domains; residues 1-160); PKC-EF (5′-GAATTCATGGTAGTGTTCAATGGCCTTC-3′) and PKC-ER (5′-GGATCCACAGTTGGGAGCCACGTTG-3′) (C2 domain and two C1 domains; residues 1-297); and PKC-ZF (5′-GAATTCATGCCCAGCAGGACCGACC-3′) and PKC-ZR (5′-GGATCCGCAGGTCAGCGGGACGAGG-3′) (C1 domain; residues 1-180), respectively. The amplicons were cloned into pCR2.1 for sequence confirmation and excised by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI. The excised DNA fragments were then cloned into the pGBKT7 vector as a bait (Cypher-CB and Cypher-MB) or into the pGADT7 vector as a prey (Cypher-CP, Cypher-MP, PKCA-P, PKCE-P, and PKCZ-P) (MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3; Clontech). These constructs were sequenced again to ensure that no errors were introduced and used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The transformations were tested by the filter assay for β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The β-gal activities were also measured with o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and expressed arbitrarily as means ± S.E., as reported previously (12Itoh-Satoh M. Hayashi T. Nishi H. Koga Y. Arimura T. Koyanagi T. Takahashi M. Hohda S. Ueda K. Nouchi T. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Imaizumi T. Yasunami M. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Statistical differences in the β-gal activities were examined by Student's t test for paired value, and p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Plasmid Construction and Immunoprecipitation from 293 Cells— Expression vectors for PKC-α, -β, and -ϵ and wild type Cypher1 have been described previously (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mutant Cypher1 was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis and sequenced to ensure that no PCR errors were introduced. Plasmids containing wild type, mutant Cypher, and distinct PKCs (5 μg each) were transfected into 293 cells, which were plated in 10-cm dishes at 80% confluence via Superfect (Qiagen Inc.). Cells were harvested, and 100 μg of total protein from PKC-transfected cells was mixed with 100 μg of total protein from either wild type or mutant Cypher-transfected cells to perform immunoprecipitation assay as described (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Expression of Cypher/ZASP in Human Tissues—Several different cDNA isoforms of Cypher/ZASP were reported in human and mouse striated muscle (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G.

Dev. 2000; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene (Fig. 1A, Ensembl gene identification number ENSG00000122367). To investigate the alternative splice pattern in various human tissues, we performed RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, human Cypher/ZASP expressed several transcripts. There were two different PCR products from exon 1 to 9; a short form (Cypher 2s; nomenclature is according to Ref. 27Huang C. Zhou Q. Liang P. Hollander M.S. Sheikh F. Li X. Greaser M. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was preferentially expressed in the skeletal muscle, whereas a long form (Cypher 2c) was abundant in the fetal heart. On the other hand, transcripts covering exons 4-7 were expressed preferentially in the fetal heart. Two different transcripts spanning exons 6-11 were generated; the longer form (corresponding to Cypher 1s) was expressed in the heart. Several other combinations of primers were used in addition to investigate the alternative splicing (for example, exons 4-11; data not shown). The RT-PCR products were sequenced to confirm that there were at least six different splice variants in human (Fig. 1C) as was reported in mouse (27Huang C. Zhou Q. Liang P. Hollander M.S. Sheikh F. Li X. Greaser M. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ZASP variant 2, which was reported to have a deletion of 31 base pairs (25Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of a splice to a minor acceptor site in exon 11, could not be identified in this study with any combinations of primers (data not shown). Identification of a Missense Mutation in the Cypher/ZASP Gene in a DCM Family—Sequence variations in the Cypher/ZASP gene were searched in 96 patients with DCM, and five different variations were identified (Fig. 1A). These include a T to C transition in an intron (-13 in intron 6) and four variations in the exons (GTC to ATC at codon 55 in exon 2, GTC to ATC at codon 588 in exon 14, GAT to AAT at codon 626 in exon15, and CAT to CAC at codon 644 in exon 15; codon numbers are from Cypher/ZASP 1c in Fig. 1C). Among the variations leading to amino acid replacement, V55I and V588I were polymorphisms because they were also found in unrelated healthy controls. In contrast, the D626N variation identified in a proband patient of familial DCM (designated II-6; Fig. 2, A and C) was not found in 400 unrelated healthy controls. A family study showed that the D626N mutation was present in all affected members tested (Fig. 2, B and D). The mutation was located at the fifth position next to a constant cystein (29Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) in the third LIM domain, and this position was occupied exclusively by acidic residues in Cypher/ZASP and other PDZ-LIM proteins and in Enigma and the Enigma homologue protein (ENH) from various species (Fig. 2E). The patients in this family developed DCM after age 50 (in the early (II-1 and II-9) or late (II-5 and II-6) fifties in male cases and at age 69 in a female case (II-2)), suggesting that the mutation was associated with late-onset DCM (Fig. 2A). Electrocardiogram findings of the affected individuals demonstrated no primary conduction defect. It was interesting to note that a sister (II-4) had the mutation but did not suffer from DCM, although she had been affected with cerebellar ataxia (CA). The CA was initially considered to be as a clinical consequence of her carrying the mutation; however, this possibility was ruled out because another brother (II-3) who also suffered from CA did not have the mutation. No sign of skeletal muscle involvement was noted in the DCM patients, although a muscle biopsy could not be performed because consent was not obtained. Altered Interaction of LIM-LIM and LIM-PKC Binding Due to the D626N Mutation—Because the D626N mutation changes the acidic residue conserved in the PDZ-LIM protein family, we tested the functional alteration using Y2H assays. Wild type or mutant bait plasmid containing the third LIM domain of Cypher/ZASP (Cypher-CB or Cypher-MB, respectively) was co-transformed with a prey plasmid containing wild type Cypher/ZASP (Cypher-CP), mutant Cypher/ZASP (Cypher-MP), PKC-α (PKCA-P), PKC-ϵ (PKCE-P), or PKC-ζ (PKCZ-P) (Fig. 3A). In the test for LIM-LIM homodimeric interaction, the β-gal activity of colonies containing Cypher-CB and Cypher-CP was 1.447 ± 0.094, whereas that of Cypher-MB and Cypher CP was significantly low (0.714 ± 0.075, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, β-gal activity in colonies of Cypher-CB and Cypher-MP was low (0.510 ± 0.024, p < 0.001) (data not shown). On the other hand, the Y2H assays showed that the β-gal activity in the colonies of Cypher-MB and PKCA-P was significantly higher than that of Cypher-CB and PKCA-P (1.072 ± 0.108 versus 0.747 ± 0.094, p < 0.05). In addition, the β-gal activity obtained from the mutant LIM and PKC-ϵ interaction was significantly higher than that of the normal LIM and PKC-ϵ interaction (0.872 ± 0.054 versus 0.562 ± 0.036, p < 0.001). Similarly, the β-gal activity for the mutant LIM-PKC-ζ interaction was significantly higher than that for the normal LIM-PKC-ζ interaction (0.554 ± 0.026 versus 0.325 ± 0.010, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). We investigated, through an independent approach, whether the mutation would affect the LIM-PKC interaction. In the pull-down experiments, a mutation equivalent to human D626N was introduced into mouse Cypher/ZASP (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates of wild type or mutant Cypher with HA-tagged PKCs (PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-ϵ) revealed that, despite equal expression of genes, mutant Cypher had a higher affinity to the PKCs than the normal Cypher (1.96 ± 0.03-fold, p < 0.01 for PKC-α; 1.38 ± 0.12-fold, p < 0.02 for PKC-β; and 1.50 ± 0.29-fold, p < 0.04 for PKC-ϵ) (Fig. 3, C-E). In this study, a Cypher/ZASP mutation in the third LIM domain was found in a DCM family, and the mutation altered the function of the LIM domain (i.e. a decrease in dimeric binding while the binding to PKCs was increased). All affected members had the mutation, but one female carrying the mutation did not suffer from DCM (II-4, 65 years old). She might develop DCM later in life, because the DCM phenotype was late-onset and the eldest sister (II-2) developed the disease at the age of 69. Another reason why II-4 may not develop DCM might also be because she could not exercise for several years due to CA, since DCM due to the Z-disc abnormality can be exacerbated by cardiac stress, as demonstrated in MLP-deficient mice (13Knoll R. Hoshijima M. Hoffman H.M. Person V. Lorenzen-Schmidt I. Bang M.L. Hayashi T. Shiga N. Yasukawa H. Schaper W. McKenna W. Yokoyama M. Schork N.J. Omens J.H. McCulloch A.D. Kimura A. Gregorio C.C. Poller W. Schaper J. Schultheiss H.P. Chien K.R. Cell. 2002; 111: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The Cypher/ZASP isoforms have a PDZ domain and three LIM domains. These structures are highly homologous to other PDZ-LIM proteins such as Enigma and ENH (30Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25085-25090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31029-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The ability of Cypher/ZASP isoforms to bind to α-actinin through the PDZ domain and various PKC subtypes via the LIM domains in the Z-discs of the cardiac muscle imply that Cypher/ZASP might play a role in stretch response. The LIM domain consists of 50-60 amino acid residues and participates in protein-protein interactions (29Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mutant LIM showed increased binding affinity to PKCs in both Y2H assays and pull-down assays, although the extent of the increased affinity was different between these assays. This could be because one human LIM domain was used in the Y2H assays, and three mouse LIM domains were used for the pull-down assays. Nevertheless, our results demonstrated that the interaction of the Cypher/ZASP LIM domain to PKC, especially the ϵ subtype, was augmented by the mutation. PKCs localize in nucleus, perinucleus, cytosol, and Z-discs in the cardiomyocytes (32Mochily-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1301-1307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Upon activation by lipid-derived second messengers, PKCs are known to translocate from one cell component to another via the function of anchoring proteins, and the proteins anchoring the inactivated PKCs are referred to as RICKs (receptors for inactivated protein kinase C), whereas those anchoring the activated PKCs are referred to as RACKs (receptors for activated protein kinase C), and each PKC isozyme associates with specific anchoring proteins to mediate isozyme-specific PKC functions (34Robia S.L. Ghanta J. Robu V.G. Walker J.W. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2140-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have shown here, as reported previously (24Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), that Cypher/ZASP interacts with PKCs. Although Cypher/ZASP is not a bona fide RICK or RACK, because it can bind multiple PKC isozymes it will be of interest to determine whether Cypher/ZASP has RICK- or RACK-like functions. On the other hand, it has been shown that the expression of PKC-ϵ and its translocation from a cytosol fraction to a membrane fraction is increased during the transition from compensated hypertrophy to congestive heart failure (23Jalili T. Takeishi Y. Song G. Ball N.A. Howles G. Walsh R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2298-H2304PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal part of PKC-ϵ interacts selectively with a specific isotype of RACKs, RACK2 (32Mochily-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1301-1307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and it was reported that PKC-ϵ·RACK2 interactions played a key role in cardioprotection against ischemic stress (35Mochly-Rosen D.

Li R.C. Bolli R. Ping P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H946-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of PKC-ϵ·RACK2 interaction has been shown to inhibit cardiac cell contraction (37Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and accelerate cell death (38Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Mochly-Rosen D. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1937-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is likely that the translocation of PKC-ϵ in the heart may be involved in myocardial remodeling and ultimately lead to heart failure. Because the N-terminal part of PKC-ϵ interacts with both Cypher/ZASP and RACK2, an interesting hypothesis may be that the augmentation of binding affinity between Cypher/ZASP and PKC-ϵ by the Cypher/ZASP mutation might, in turn, reduce the amount of a PKC-ϵ·RACK2 complex and cause early progression to heart failure. This hypothesis should be tested in future studies. In summary, we identified a Cypher/ZASP mutation associated with DCM that increased the LIM-PKCs interaction. These observations suggest an association between DCM and the inherited abnormality involved in signal transduction, which is consistent with the findings of mutations in phospholamban and MLP. Although the molecular mechanisms of DCM due to the Cypher/ZASP mutation remain to be elucidated, and other DCM patients should be screened for Cypher/ZASP mutation to formally confirm the causality of the mutation in DCM, our observations imply that the cardiac dysfunction might be associated not only with the alteration in each sarcomeric interaction but also with the altered recruitment of molecules participating in intracellular signaling.

The current work aimed to identify candidate active proteinases in joint diseases using an in vitro model for cartilage degradation induced by interleukin-1. A critical event in the process of cartilage destruction in joint disease is the failure of the collagen fiber network to maintain integrity. Proteins binding to the surface of the fibers are likely early points of failure. Fibromodulin, a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein family, is one predominant protein in cartilage and is known for its roles in the formation of collagen fibrils and sustained interaction with these formed fibers. Cleavage removes the tyrosine sulfate-rich region in the N terminus of fibromodulin. Whereas fibromodulin bound to collagen in tissue was digested, purified fibromodulin was not cleaved. In contrast an N-terminal 10-kDa fragment, Gln19-Lys98, of the protein generated by Lys-C digestion contains the cleavage site and was a substrate cleaved by the enzyme in medium from stimulated cultures. In solution, digestion of this substrate with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, -8, and -13 demonstrated that only MMP-13 was capable to efficiently cleave it. The cleavage product obtained after MMP-13 digestion was identical to that observed in cleaved fibromodulin from cartilage explant cultures stimulated with interleukin-1. MMP-13 treatment of fresh articular cartilage also produced the fragment under study. The elucidation of the enzyme responsible for such cleavage may lead to treatment modalities involving its selective inhibition for patients suffering from arthritis. The known structure of the fragments permits the generation of neo-epitope antibodies to the cleavage site, which can be used to detect ongoing cartilage degradation in patients with arthritic disease, an important adjunct in monitoring disease progression, active disease, and efficacy of treatment.

Fibromodulin is a member of the small leucine-rich repeat protein family. It was originally described as a 59-kDa collagen-binding protein (1Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

This substitution is suggested to occur in tyrosines located next to acidic residues, although later work has shown a new consensus for the modification of tyrosine residues (9Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two disulfide loops are present in fibromodulin. The most N-terminal loop may have a role in the coordination of metal binding as has been described for two of its relatives, decorin and biglycan (10Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C.

Fibromodulin can be substituted on asparagine residues with keratan sulfate chains at four potential sites, within the leucine-rich repeat region (2Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D.

Binding of fibromodulin to both type I and type II collagen in vitro has been demonstrated and is thought to have an important role in correct fiber formation (1Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding appears to be independent of disulfide bridging and appears to include a region in the C terminus of fibromodulin (13Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both fibromodulin and lumican have been shown to bind to the same site on the collagen fibril, whereas decorin appears to bind to a separate site (14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

Fibromodulin appears also to modify the properties of the completed collagen fiber and is found localized at the gap region with a surface density differing with dimensions of the fiber (1Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibromodulin null mice have recently been demonstrated to form abnormally thin type I collagen fibrils in tendon (16Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F.P. Faüssler R. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol.

They show an increased incidence of arthritis in later life possibly as a result of malfunctioning ligaments (17Gill M.R. Oldberg Å. Reinholt F.P.

In this report we have used a well characterized destructive model of bovine cartilage to elucidate the exact site of cleavage of fibromodulin by an as of yet unidentified protease. The characterization of this site will allow the generation of neo-epitope antibodies that could be used as markers of cartilage degeneration in disease. Neo-epitope antibodies have been used to study cartilage breakdown, more specifically of aggrecan (27Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. Bayne E.K. Donatelli S.A. Weidner J.R. Williams H.R. Ayala J.M.

The cleavage of fibromodulin may precede major destruction of type II collagen and may be permissive for this process. This degradation is thought to be a crucial point in joint destruction past which expectation for self-repair of cartilage tissue is low. Also, the identification of the enzyme responsible for the generation of this major cleavage product could lead to treatment modalities involving its selective inhibition in patients suffering from arthritic disease. The capacity for early detection and inhibition of this process may be fundamental in limiting the breakdown of joint cartilage. Bovine Nasal Cartilage Explant Cultures—Bovine nasal septa were obtained from a local abattoir and processed for culture within 2 h of slaughter. Full depth cores (from one perichondrium to the other) were punched using a sterile 2-mm diameter punch tool. The perichondrium was dissected from the cartilage with a scalpel with as little removal of cartilage as possible. The explants were immediately placed into cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate with 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). The tissue was washed twice with this mixture and once again with the latter containing 10 times concentration of penicillin and streptomycin. The cores were randomly divided into wells of 96-well plates (Costar), one core per well, and then their individual wet weights determined. Explants were cultured for 1 day in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml tissue culture grade BSA (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml ascorbate. Following this period, explants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/BSA with 50 μg/ml ascorbate in the presence or absence of human recombinant IL-1 (Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. Six replicates per treatment and time point were assayed. Medium was changed every 3 days for a total duration of culture of 18-24 days. Explants were harvested every 6 days. Guanidine HCl Extraction of Explant Tissues—Harvested tissues were embedded in medium for frozen tissue specimens (O.C.T. Compound, Tissue Tek™) and immediately frozen on solid CO2. Tissues were sectioned to a thickness of 20 μm on a Micron cryostat (30Bayliss M.T. Ali S.Y. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These sections were recovered and placed at 4 °C for 5 min to thaw for ease of handling. The volume occupied by the tissue sections including embedding medium was estimated to be ∼50-100 μl. To this volume was added 1 ml of 4 ○ guanidine HCl in 50 m○ sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing a mixture of standard protease inhibitors. Extractions were carried out at 4 °C for 48 h with constant agitation. Hydroxyproline Determination—Tissue residues remaining after guanidine HCl extractions were washed three times with distilled water and dried. Hydrolysis with 6 ○ HCl was performed for 16 h at 100 °C with 500 μl of acid per 10-15 mg of initial cartilage wet weight. Acid was evaporated using a Speed Vac concentrator and hydrolysates were re-dissolved in 500 μl of distilled water. Determination of hydroxyproline was performed as previously described (31Stegemann H. Stalder K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting of Tissue Extracts and Media—One hundred-microliter portions of guanidine HCl extracts of cartilage prior to culture, pre-cultured for 2 days, and cultured with or without additive for 6, 12, and 18 days were precipitated with a final concentration of 90% (v/v) ethanol. Precipitated proteins were recovered at 10,000 × g and washed twice with 750 μl of cold 80% (v/v) ethanol with 50 m○ sodium acetate. After drying on a Speed Vac type concentrator, samples were re-suspended in 50 μl of 50 m○ sodium acetate, pH 5.8. To remove interference by aggrecan, a final concentration of 0.1 unit/ml of highly purified chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Japan) was added to each sample that was incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 h. For visualization of core proteins, samples were treated with N- glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) to remove keratan sulfate chains (32Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondroitinase ABC-treated samples were made up to a final concentration of 0.01% (v/v) SDS and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Excess SDS was scavenged by addition of a 5-fold concentration of Nonidet P-40. N-Glycosidase F digestion was performed using a final concentration of 10 milliunits/ml enzyme at 37 °C for 16-24 h. Samples were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences) (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked in 3% (w/v) low-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. Fibromodulin was located using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for its core protein. The antibody was diluted in 1% (w/v) lowfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween. The second antibody was a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO A/S, Denmark) also diluted in the same buffer. Reactive bands were visualized by incubating blots in the presence of a chemiluminescent HRP substrate. Blots were exposed to CRONEX™ film (Sterling Diagnostic Imaging). Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—Samples of medium containing the fragmented form of fibromodulin were concentrated in Microcon YM10 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Bioseparations) according to the manufacturers guidelines. One milliliter of medium was concentrated 20-fold and buffer was exchanged during the procedure to 50 m○ sodium acetate, pH 5.8. N-Glycosidase F digestion and gel electrophoresis were performed as described above in “SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of Tissue and Media.” Gels were fixed in 40% (v/v) methanol, 7% (v/v) acetic acid for 1 h and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva). Following de-staining with distilled water, strongly staining bands were excised and washed with 400 μl of water for 1 h. The gel pieces were then de-stained with four 300-μl washes with 40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 m○ NH4HCO3 for 15 min each until they were visibly colorless. They were then dried in a Speed Vac concentrator. Samples were re-hydrated in 40 μl of 10 m○ dithiothreitol in 25 m○ NH4HCO3. Reduction of proteins was carried out at 56 °C for 30 min. Superfluous solution was removed and proteins were alkylated with 40 μl of 50 m○ iodoacetamide in 25 m○ NH4HCO3 and incubated in complete darkness at room temperature. The gel pieces were then washed three times with 40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 m○ NH4HCO3 and evaporated to complete dryness. Identification of Fibromodulin Fragment by Mass Spectrometry— Proteins were degraded into characteristic fragments with trypsin (Sequencing grade, Promega), endoproteinase Glu-C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, gel pieces were re-hydrated in 12 μl of the respective enzyme solutions: trypsin at 20 μg/ml and Lys-C at 25 μg/ml in 25 m○ NH4HCO3. Following re-hydration, 23 μl of the same buffer was added and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 h. For Glu-C digestion PBS was used instead of NH4HCO3. The gel pieces were then extracted with 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. Peptide containing solutions were then purified on C18 Ziptips (Millipore) with subsequent elutions at 20, 50, and 70% trifluoroacetic acid made up in saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). One-microliter aliquots of elution solution/matrix mixtures were spotted directly onto a MALDI target plate and allowed to air dry. The MALDI target plate was loaded into a Bruker Reflex™ III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The polarity of the instrument was set for positive ions using delayed extraction and with the detector in reflector mode. The acceleration voltage was set at 26 kV and 120 shots per sample spot were summed in each spectrum. Internal calibrants were used as reference masses. Spectra were analyzed for matches using the ProFound™ search engine (Rockefeller University) (35Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Neo-epitope Antibody Production—The new N-terminal amino acid sequence Ala64-Pro73 was used to synthesize a peptide to which a C-terminal cysteine was added for coupling purposes. This peptide was coupled to BSA, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and thiopropyl-Sepharose, respectively (Schafer-N, Copenhagen, Denmark). Five hundred micrograms of keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate was dissolved in 500 μl of PBS and then emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. New Zealand White rabbits were injected with a 500-μg dose followed by a booster injection 4 weeks later. Booster injections were prepared in the same manner although with incomplete adjuvant. Test bleeds were taken 2-3 weeks after the first boost. Affinity Purification of Neo-fibromodulin Antiserum—A six hundred-microliter (packed bed volume) column of neo-fibromodulin conjugated to thiopropyl-Sepharose was prepared in a Bio-Rad column fitted with a 22-gauge needle to slow down the flow rate. The column was washed with 4 ml of PBS. One milliliter of crude serum was allowed to drip through. The flow-through was recovered and passed through three times more. Four milliliters of PBS containing 1 ○ NaCl was used to wash away loosely bound material. The column was then washed with 4 ml of PBS. Specific antibodies were eluted with 100 m○ glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and 250-μl fractions were neutralized by collection into Eppendorf tubes containing 12.5 μl of 100 m○ Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Testing of Neo-epitope Antibody Specificity by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Falcon 96-well plates (BD Bioscience) were coated with 2 μg per well of either BSA-conjugated neo-fibromodulin peptide or purified bovine fibromodulin in 100 m○ Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.2, for 16-24 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with 150 m○ NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash solution). Unoccupied sites were blocked with 100 μl of 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at ambient temperature. The plates were washed three times with wash solution. Affinity purified antiserum was diluted to 1:100 in PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS/BSA/Tween) and then doubling dilutions were carried out to 1:520,000. Test serum was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then plates were washed three times with wash solution. The second antibody was a swine anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (DAKO A/S, Denmark) used at 1:2,000 dilution in PBS/BSA/Tween and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. The plates were washed with wash solution and developed with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8. Testing of Neo-epitope Antibody Specificity by Western Blotting— Specificity for the cleaved form of fibromodulin and confirmation of the neo-epitope was performed by Western blotting of guanidine HCl extracts of cartilage cultured with IL-1. Such extracts contain both intact and cleaved forms of fibromodulin, as judged by blotting with the anti-fibromodulin polyclonal antiserum. Extracts were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These were incubated with the anti-AYGSPPQPEP neo-epitope antibody at 1:250 in 1% skim milk for 3-4 h at room temperature. The conjugated second antibody was an anti-rabbit HRP (DAKO, Denmark) used at 1:1000. Generation and Purification of the N-terminal Peptide of Fibromodulin (Gln19-Lys98)—Purified bovine fibromodulin (36Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 400-600 μg, was dissolved in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 30 μl of 500 μg/ml Lys-C was added followed by incubation for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition 2 μl of 1 mg/ml TLCK and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed by addition of 5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche) and incubation for 16 h at 37 °C. Before loading onto a MiniQ SMART column (Amersham Biosciences), 1500 μl of 10 m○ Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, containing 6 ○ urea (buffer A for anion exchange chromatography) was added. A gradient of 0-100% buffer B (buffer A + 600 m○ NaCl) over 20 column volumes was used to elute bound peptides. The column was regenerated with 2 ml of NaOH following each run. Aliquots from fractions containing peaks were dried and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the anti-fibromodulin polyclonal antiserum. An aliquot from each fraction was desalted on C18 ziptips and peptides were eluted onto spots of dried α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid on a MALDI target plate. Fractions deemed by Western blot and MALDI analysis to contain the N-terminal peptide were pooled and loaded onto a Sephacel C8 mini-RPC column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound material was eluted with a gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile in 20 column volumes. The resulting peak was dried and stored at -20 °C. Aliquots were taken from all steps of the digestion and purification processes and evaluated by Western blotting with an anti-fibromodulin polyclonal antiserum and monoclonal antibody 5D4, directed against keratan sulfate chains (a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Caterson). Determination of MMP Activity—One microgram of the 10-kDa Nterminal fragment of fibromodulin was added to 100 μl of conditioned culture medium from day 16. Possible combinations of presence or absence of the following additives were elaborated: CaCl2, 5 m○; o- phenanthroline, 5 m○ (stock solution 200 m○ in methanol); aminophenylmercuric acetate, 1 m○ (stock solution 100 m○ in Me2SO). The reactions were incubated for 16 h and stopped by the addition of EDTA to 15 m○ final concentration. Samples were electrophoresed on 13% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted with anti-fibromodulin at 1:1000 in 1% skim milk. Biotinylation of the N-terminal Peptide of Fibromodulin for Activity Assays—Approximately ∼100 μg of N-terminal peptide of fibromodulin was re-suspended in 50 μl of PBS, pH 7.3, and biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Free biotin was removed by reversed phase chromatography on a Sephasil C8 mini-RPC column (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting verified the efficiency of biotinylation. Control blots were performed using the unmodified N-terminal peptide of fibromodulin and N-terminal peptide of fibromodulin-biotin using the anti-fibromodulin polyclonal antiserum and streptavidin-HRP (DAKO, Denmark), respectively. To confirm that biotinylation occurred only at the expected site represented by the side chain of the C-terminal lysine (Lys99), an aliquot of peptide found to be biotinylated by Western blotting was digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Kinetics of Degradation in Conditioned Medium of the Biotinylated N Terminus of Fibromodulin—The biotinylated 10-kDa N-terminal fragment was dissolved in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.05% NaN3 and 5 μg was added to a 200-μl aliquot of conditioned culture medium from days 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20, respectively. Fifty microliters from each respective sample was removed immediately and treated with EDTA at 15 m○ final concentration. Removal of a 50-μl aliquot was repeated for each sample at 3, 6, and 20 h and the reaction was stopped with EDTA. A control consisted of 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 5 μg of biotinylated N-terminal fibromodulin. This sample was incubated for the full 20-h period. Laemmli loading buffer was added to the EDTA-treated samples and they were electrophoresed on 13% SDS-PAGE gels. Blotting was performed and blotted proteins were reacted with streptavidin-HRP at 1:5000 in 1% skim milk. The blots were developed with ECL reagent and exposure of membranes to CRONEX® film. Gelatin and Casein Zymography—Aliquots of conditioned medium from days 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 of culture were added with Laemmli loading buffer (1% SDS final concentration) and applied to casein and gelatin zymograms (Bio-Rad). Gels and buffers were cooled on ice and the current was fixed at 30 mA. SDS was scavenged from the gels with 2 changes of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in distilled water and one wash with water each for 15 min. The gels were incubated at 37 °C overnight in 15 ml of 50 m○ Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 m○ NaCl, 10 m○ CaCl2, 0.05% NaN3. The zymograms were then fixed in 40% ethanol, 7% acetic acid and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Digestion of the N-terminal Peptide of Fibromodulin by Purified MMPs-2, -8, -9, and -13—To determine candidate metalloproteinases that perform the cleavage of interest, the N-terminal peptide of fibromodulin was incubated with purified MMPs-2 and -9 (Chemicon), recombinant rat MMP-8 (a kind gift from Dr. Chris Overall, University of British Col"

The observation of the involvement of the Rho-ROCK pathway in tumor invasion and in diseases such as hypertension and bronchial asthma makes it an interesting target for drug development. We herein present the crystal structure of the complex between active RhoA and the Rho-binding domain of ROCKI. The Rho-binding domain structure forms a parallel α-helical coiled-coil dimer and, in contrast to the published Rho-protein kinase N structure, binds exclusively to the switch I and II regions of the guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate-bound RhoA. The switch regions of two different RhoA molecules form a predominantly hydrophobic patch, which is complementarily bound by two identical short helices of 13 residues (amino acids 998-1010). The identified ROCK-binding site of RhoA strikingly supports the assumption of a common consensus-binding site for effector recognition.

A hallmark of small GTPases is their ability to undergo structural changes in response to the binding of GDP or GTP. The inactive GDP-bound and the active GTP-bound states are recognized by different partner proteins, thereby allowing the small GTPases to function as molecular switches (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A.

Two ROCK isoforms, ROCKI/ROKβ/p160ROCK and ROCKII/ROKα/Rho kinase, that share 65% overall identity and 95% homology have so far been identified (11Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol.

Interest in the Rho-ROCK pathway emerges from the fact that abnormal activation of this pathway plays a role not only in tumor invasion and metastasis (18Itoh K. Yoshioka K. Akedo H. Uehata M.

ROCK proteins consist of an N-terminal kinase domain followed by a central putative coiled-coil region, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A) (11Leung T.

The Rho-binding domain (RBD) within the predicted amphipathic α-helical coiled-coil (Fig. 1A) is responsible for the recognition and binding of the active Rho proteins (13Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Coiled-coil structures have also been predicted for the RBDs of most Rho effectors (rhotekin, rhophilin, Citron kinase, and Kinectin) (9Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). The most recent crystal structure of bovine ROCKII showed that two long helical strands of the RBD formed a parallel coiled-coil dimer (24Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Amano M. Kaibuchi K.

A different scenario has been described for the PKN where two adjacent domains at the N terminus of PKN, called homology region (HR)1a and HR1b, have been identified to bind RhoA (25Watanabe G.

HR1a of PKN binds RhoA at two different contact sites (I and II) from which only contact site II overlaps with the switch regions (27Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T.

Mutagenesis studies have shown that HR1b is also capable of binding Rac1, another GTPase of the Rho family, at a region corresponding to the contact site I of RhoA (28Owen D. Lowe P.N. Nietlispach D.

To examine the interaction of ROCK with RhoA, we determined the crystal structure of the complex between the human ROCKI-RBD (residues 947-1015) and the truncated form of human RhoA (residues 1-181) bound to the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p. Whereas the overall structure of the ROCKI-RBD parallel coiled-coil is distinct from the structure of unbound ROCKII-RBD, the C-terminal part where the interaction with RhoA takes place shares high structural similarity. A short stretch of 13 residues at the C terminus creates a minimal Rho-interacting motif of ROCK by forming a parallel coiled-coil dimer. This motif represents a novel type of interaction with a small GTPase by employing both helices interacting with the switch regions of RhoA in a complementary manner. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The truncated RhoA (amino acids 1-181) and ROCKI-RBD (amino acids 947-1015) were generated by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) via BamHI/XhoI restriction sites. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified by a GSH-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) using 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithioerythritol. After cleavage with thrombin, proteins were purified using a benzamidine column (Pharmacia) to remove the protease and subsequent gel filtration (Superdex G75, Pharmacia). Purified protein quality and the nucleotide binding capacity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C-18 column (ODS-Hypersil, 5 μm, Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany), respectively. The complex of RhoA·Gpp(NH)p and ROCKI-RBD was isolated by gel filtration (Superdex 75, 16/60, Pharmacia). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of truncated RhoA (residues 1-181) in complex with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p and ROCKI-RBD (residues 947-1015) were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 20 °C by adding equal volumes of reservoir solution (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 2% isopropyl alcohol) and protein solution (10 mg/ml in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol). Crystals appeared after 2 days and grew as plates attached to spherulites to a final dimension of 0.1 × 0.5 × 0.05 mm in ∼10 days. The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 34.4 Å, b = 89.5 Å, c = 98.1 Å, and β = 91.9°. For data collection at 100 K, the solution containing the crystals was adjusted to 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 15% glycerol, and 3% isopropyl alcohol. Cryoprotected crystals were then suspended in a rayon loop (Hampton Research) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector at the ID29 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a α-helical coiled-coil ROCKI-RBD dimer and two RhoA molecules (Fig. 1B). A 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis runs through the center of the coiled-coil dimer at the interacting interface with RhoA (Fig. 1C). The structure of RhoA·Gpp(NH)p is very similar to the GTPγS-bound RhoA structure alone (33Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.42 Å for 181 Cα atoms) and in the complex with PKN-RBD (r.m.s.d. of 0.33 Å for 181 Cα atoms) (27Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The binding of Gpp(NH)p and the coordination of the magnesium ion are conserved. The ROCKI-RBD forms a 95-Å long α-helix that assembles into a parallel coiled-coil (Fig. 1D) with a total buried solvent-accessible surface of 3200 Å2. Coiled-coil arrangement of ROCKI-RBD is consistent with the published data on bovine ROCKII-RBD (24Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46046-46051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Chen X.Q. Tan I. Ng C.H. Hall C. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12680-12688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which showed that ROCK-RBDs exist as dimers. A periodicity of seven residues over two helical turns called heptad repeat is the characteristic feature of a canonical left-handed coiled-coil. These seven residues are commonly designated as abcdefg (35Gruber M. Lupas A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The interaction between the helices in a canonical coiled-coil is mediated by the hydrophobic residues at the positions a and d and oppositely charged residues at the positions e and g (35Gruber M. Lupas A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Seven heptad repeats were found along the coiled-coil of ROCKI-RBD between the residues Ile-952 and Arg-1012 (Fig. 1D) together with three so-called “stutters” at the residue positions Met-966, Lys-977, and Ile-981 (marked by red arrows). Stutters are insertions of four residues into the heptad repeat pattern that cause a non-canonical right-handed twist of a coiled-coil (35Gruber M. Lupas A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The twist of ROCKI-RBD is therefore left-handed at the N- and C-terminal part but right-handed in the central region (residues 965-985) (Fig. 1D). The coiled-coil structure of bovine ROCKII alone (24Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46046-46051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reveals a persistent heptad repeat motif without stutters forming a canonical left-handed coiled-coil. Although we cannot exclude that the observed differences in the overall spatial arrangement compared with the human ROCKI are caused by crystal packing, it is very likely that they emerge because of deviations in the N-terminal and central regions of the primary structure of these isoforms. In contrast to these differences, the C-terminal parts of both structures where ROCKI contacts RhoA (see next section), are very similar (Fig. 1, D-F), implicating that this region is structurally conserved. The repetition of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions within the heptad repeat is not strictly conserved in the middle of the ROCKI-RBD, and as a consequence the structure is less ordered. It is worth noting that three of four amino acids at positions e and g in the C-terminal part are hydrophobic and increase the exposed hydrophobic surface, facilitating the interaction with RhoA (see below). The RhoA-ROCK-RBD Interface—The interface between the helical ROCKI dimer and one of the RhoA molecules buries a solvent-accessible surface of 1328 Å2 comparable to the interfaces of Ras-PI3Kγ (37Pacold M.E. Suire S. Perisic O. Lara-Gonzalez S. Davis C.T. Walker E.H. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Eccleston J.F. Williams R.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rac-p67phox (38Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The structure of the RhoA·ROCKI complex defines a 13-residue left-handed coiled-coil at the C-terminal part of the ROCK-RBD (residues 998-1010) as the minimal Rho-interacting motif (Fig. 1A). This Rho binding motif is invariant in all of the ROCK proteins from different organisms. Both switch regions of RhoA are involved in the interaction with ROCKI. One of the coiled-coil helices (Fig. 2, B and C, cyan) faces switch I, whereas the second coiled-coil helix (blue) faces switch II. The interface between the RhoA molecules and the RBD dimer is formed by a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2, B and C). The interaction between the hydrophobic patches of RhoA (Pro-36, Val-38, Phe-39, Tyr-66, Leu-69, and Leu-72) and ROCK (Ala-1002, Val-1003, Leu-1006, Ala-1007, and Met-1010) 2For better visibility, the ROCK residues are indicated in italics. is stabilized by a number of electrostatic interactions at their edge (Glu-40/Lys-1005, Asp-65/Lys-999, and Arg-68/Asn-1004). Two polar residues (Tyr-66 and Lys-1005) also partially contribute to the hydrophobic interaction, whereas their hydrophilic parts interact with the main chain carbonyl groups of Leu-998 and Phe-39, respectively. Remarkably, four amino acids of RhoA (Val-38, Phe-39, Asp-65, and Tyr-66) interact with both RBD helices and stabilize their dimeric structure (Fig. 2, B and C). Two key residues (Leu-998 and Lys-1005) of the right helix (cyan) of the ROCK-RBD create a hydrophobic cluster where Leu-998 tightly binds to a pocket formed by Pro-36, Gln-63, Asp-65, and Tyr-66 of RhoA, whereas Lys-1005 contacts Val-38 and Phe-39 (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, Lys-1005, stabilized by an intramolecular salt bridge with Glu-1008 (Fig. 2A), mediates two electrostatic interactions with the carboxyl group of Glu-40. Furthermore, Lys-999 and Asn-1004 from the left helix (blue) of the RBD form hydrogen bonds with Asp-65 and Arg-68 of RhoA, respectively. Our structural data of the binding interface between RhoA and ROCKI nicely match with the mutational analysis of previous studies. Two regions of RhoA (residues 23-40 and 75-92) have been implicated as binding determinants for ROCKI (39Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18943-18949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, B and C, shows that the C-terminal part of the first region overlaps with the switch I region that interacts with ROCKI-RBD. Accordingly, the mutations of Phe-39 and Glu-40 have been shown to disrupt ROCKI binding (40Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 41Zong H. Raman N. Mickelson-Young L.A. Atkinson S.J. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4551-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), supporting the crucial role of these residues in the RhoA-ROCKI interaction described in this study. Unlike the previous study (39Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18943-18949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), our structure does not confirm a direct involvement of the second region (residues 75-92) in the ROCK-RBD interaction. As the central part of this region is buried in the hydrophobic pocket of both RhoA and Rac1 proteins, it is very likely that substitutions such as F78I or I80M (Rac-Rho chimera) may cause overall structural changes creating or disrupting the GTPase-effector interaction. Mutations of ROCKII at residues Lys-999, Gln-1001, Asn-1004, and Lys-1005, which are all important components of the interface of both ROCK helices, resulted in the loss of RhoA binding (11Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed by Shimizu et al. (24Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46046-46051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that the C-terminal part of the coiled-coil structure of ROCKII-RBD binds the RhoA molecule. However, the described positive electrostatic potential of this RBD serves only as a long range driving force for initial recognition because the RBD-RhoA interface is predominantly mediated by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3B). Comparison with the RhoA-related Proteins—Whereas RhoA has been the most thoroughly investigated member of the Rho subfamily, the role of the highly related RhoB and RhoC that share over 85% amino acid identity with RhoA has not been completely elucidated (42Ridley A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ROCKII binds to RhoA as well as to its isoforms RhoB and RhoC (11Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the region of RhoA contacting ROCK-RBD is identical to the corresponding sequence of RhoB and RhoC, both of these isoforms are likely to interact with ROCKI in a same way as RhoA. On the other hand, Rnd proteins, a GTPase-deficient Rho-related protein subfamily, have been shown to antagonize some effects of the RhoA-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (43Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 44Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although the Rnd3 structure reveals remarkable similarities in the arrangement of the switch I region, it shows major amino acid and surface deviations at the switch II region compared with RhoA (45Fiegen D. Blumenstein L. Stege P. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Garavini H. Riento K. Phelan J.P. McAlister M.S. Ridley A.J. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6303-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The deviation at positions Gln-63, Glu-64, and Asp-65 of RhoA to SPY in Rnd3 (45Fiegen D. Blumenstein L. Stege P. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) is apparently the reason why Rnd3 does not bind the ROCKI-RBD, 3P. Chardin, personal communication. because both Gln-63 and Asp-65 of RhoA are essential for the interaction with ROCKI (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, a competition between Rnd3 and RhoA for ROCK binding can be excluded as a possible explanation for the antagonistic effect of Rnd3 on Rho signaling. Most recently, it has been shown that Rnd proteins bind the N terminus of ROCKI close to the kinase domain (47Riento K. Guasch R.M. Garg R. Jin B. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and thereby prevent Rho-ROCK interaction. Another model proposes a down-regulation of Rho by activation of Rho-specific GAPs via Rnds (48Naud N. Toure A. Liu J. Pineau C. Morin L. Dorseuil O. Escalier D. Chardin P. Gacon G. Biochem.

We evaluated the inhibitory effects of SEA0400 on Na<sup>+</sup><sub>i</sub>-dependent <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and whole-cell Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange currents in NCX-transfected fibroblasts. SEA0400 preferentially inhibited <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by NCX1 compared with inhibitions by NCX2, NCX3, and NCKX2. SEA0400 also selectively blocked outward exchange currents from NCX1 transfectants. We searched for regions that may form the SEA0400 receptor in the NCX1 molecule by NCX1/NCX3 chimeric analysis. The results suggest that the first intracellular loop and the fifth transmembrane segment are mostly responsible for the differential drug responses between NCX1 and NCX3. Further site-directed mutagenesis revealed that multiple mutations at Phe-213 markedly reduced sensitivity to SEA0400 without affecting that to KB-R7943. We also found that Gly-833-to-Cys mutation (within the α-2 repeat) greatly reduced the inhibition by SEA0400, but unexpectedly the NCX1 chimera with an α-2 repeat from NCKX2 possessed normal drug sensitivity. In addition, exchangers with mutated exchanger inhibitory peptide regions, which display either undetectable or accelerated Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation, had a markedly reduced sensitivity or hypersensitivity to SEA0400, respectively. To verify the efficacy of the NCX inhibitor, we examined the renoprotective effect of SEA0400 in a hypoxic injury model using porcine renal tubular cells. SEA0400 protected against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell damage in tubular cells expressing wild-type NCX1 but not in cells expressing SEA0400-insensitive mutants. These results suggest that Phe-213, Gly-833, and residues that eliminate Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent inactivation are critical determinants for the inhibition by SEA0400, and their mutants are very useful for checking the pharmacological importance of NCX inhibition by SEA0400."

The repressor activity of Bach1 is inhibited by the direct binding of heme. To investigate the involvement of Bach1 in the heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the β-globin gene, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were cultured with succinylacetone (SA), a specific inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, and the level of β-globin mRNA was examined. A marked decrease of β-globin mRNA in SA-treated cells was observed, and this decrease was reversed by the addition of hemin. An iron chelator, desferrioxamine, also lowered the level of β-globin mRNA. The heme-dependent expression of β-globin is a transcriptional event since the expression of the human β-globin gene promoter-reporter gene containing the microlocus control region (μLCR) was inhibited when human erythroleukemia K562 cells and MEL cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease in promoter activity caused by SA. The control of the μLCR-β-globin promoter reporter gene by heme was dependent on DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), which contains MARE. The MARE binding activity of Bach1 in K562 and MEL cells increased upon SA treatment, and the increase was diminished by the treatment with hemin. Transient expression of Bach1 suppressed the μLCR activity, and this repressor activity was cancelled by treatment with hemin. The expression of a mutated Bach1 lacking heme-binding sites led to a loss in the heme responsiveness of the μLCR. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Bach1 bound to the MARE of HS2 increased by the treatment of MEL cells with SA, and this was cancelled by hemin.

We propose that heme positively regulates the β-globin gene expression by blocking the interaction of Bach1 with the MARE in the LCR. The biochemical role of heme is related to either the transport or the utilization of oxygen, and therefore, heme exerts regulatory effects on various cell functions that sense oxygen. In addition, oxygen is an essential requirement of heme biosynthesis. In yeast, heme regulates the expression of genes involved in the respiratory chain, heme biosynthesis, and oxidative stress, at the transcriptional level, via heme-responsive transcription factors HAP1 and HAP2/3/4/5p (1Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, heme has a profound effect on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. Heme not only is incorporated as a structural component of hemoglobin but also causes an increase in the expression of globin as well as enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway in erythroid cells (2Charnay P.

Hemin (the ferric chloride salt of heme) treatment also increases both the number of transferrin receptor and the ferritin content (5Battistini A. Marziali G. Albertini R. Habetswallner D.

Thus, heme plays a key role in the coordinated expression of several genes during the differentiation of erythroid cells. The human globin gene cluster spans a region of 70 kb containing five developmentally regulated genes including ϵ, γG, γA, δ, and β.

Namely, high level expression of globin genes requires the μLCR, an upstream region that enhances globin gene transcription and insulates the locus from the influence of flanking elements (8Blom van Assendelft G.

Evidence from transgenic mice indicates that switching of the globin genes involves competition between globin promoters for enhancement by the μLCR (9Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).

Targeted disruption of HS in both mouse culture cells and mice has revealed that the μLCR is not required to initiate or maintain open chromatin and basal transcription, suggesting that the main function of the μLCR is the enhancement of transcription (9Fraser P.

The AP-1-like sites in the mouse HS1-4 are closely related to the Maf recognition elements (MAREs: TGCTGA(T/GT)TCAGCA) (12Walter M. Martin D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Various leucine zipper proteins including p45 NF-E2, Nrf1, Nrf2, and Bach1 can interact with MAREs as heterodimers with the small Maf proteins (13Blank V. Andrew N.C. Trends Biochem.

Among MARE-associated proteins, Bach1 is unique in that it has a BTB/POZ domain (17Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Bach1 forms a multivalent DNA-binding complex, raising the possibility that it can act as an architectural component that is simultaneously able to crosslink multiple MAREs, resulting in the repression of transcription (18Igarashi K.

Bach1 is a heme-binding protein, and the DNA binding activity is negatively regulated by heme (20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bach1 is involved in the regulation of HO-1, a rate-limiting enzyme of heme catabolism. The heme-mediated inhibition of Bach1 confers heme inducibility upon HO-1 (21Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Bach1 is involved in the regulation of other heme-responsive genes besides ho-1. We were particularly interested in the fact that the enhancer activity of the LCR is induced by hemin treatment of erythroid cells (15Ney P.A. Sotrentino B.P. McDough K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Gene Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Ney P.A. Sotrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To clarify whether Bach1 regulates β-globin gene expression, we examined heme-dependent expression of the β-globin gene in human erythroleukemia K562 and MEL cells and the regulation of the interaction of Bach1 with the LCR by heme. Here we demonstrated that heme positively regulates the β-globin gene expression by disrupting the interaction of Bach1 with the LCR. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and poly(dI-dC) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Co. and Toyobo Co. Nylon membranes (Biodiene Type B) were products of Pall Co. The transfection reagent LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. Antibodies for c-Fos and p45 NF-E2 were purchased from Oncogene Science Co. and Santa Crutz Biotechnology Inc., respectively. Antibodies specific for Bach1 were described elsewhere, 2J. Sun and K.

Plasmids—An 838-bp human β-globin gene promoter from BGT14LCR (22Ellis J. Tan-Un K.C. Harper A. Michalovich D. Yannoutsos N. Philipsen S. Grosveld F.

A reporter plasmid pGLCRhβHS2mut, lacking the tandem MAREs within the mouse HS2, was constructed as follows. Using pGLCRhβ (19Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as a template, flanking regions of the tandem MAREs were amplified by PCR. Primers used were: 5′-GAATTCGCCGCTCCCACCTCCAGCTTAGGGTGTGTGCCCAGATGTTC-3′ (primer a) and 5′-CGAGCCCGGGCTAGCACGCGTA-3′ (primer b) for one side, and 5′-CTGGAGGTGGGAGCGGCGAATTCGCTTGAGCCAGAAGGTTTGCTTAG-3′ (primer c) and 5′-CTCAGAGCCTGATGTTAATTTAGC-3′ (primer d) for the other side. Amplified DNA were purified and mixed, and subsequent PCR was carried out using the above primers b and d. The resulting HS2 DNA lacked the tandem MAREs where the EcoRI site was introduced instead. The mutated HS2 DNA was digested with SpeI and used to replace the SpeI fragment, containing the wild-type HS2 DNA, on the pGLCRhβ. The resulting pGLCRhβHS2mut carried the HS4, HS3, and the mutated HS2 fused with the β-globin promoter and firefly luciferase gene. Mammalian expression vectors carrying wild-type Bach1 and its derivative lacking the heme-binding sites (Bach1mCP1-6) were described previously (17Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H.

Cell Cultures—Mouse BALB/3T3 cells and MEL cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To reduce the level of heme in cells, the cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum in the presence of 1 mm SA for 16 h. The amounts of heme and porphyrin in the cells were determined as described previously (23Taketani S. Adachi Y. Kohno H. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31388-31394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the differentiation of MEL cells, the cells were cultured with 2% Me2SO for 72 h and then collected. Reporter Assay—Cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids pGL3B, pGLβp, pGLCRhβ and pGLCRhβHS2mut, and pRL-CMV (Promega) using a LipofectAMINE reagent, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were incubated with 1 mm SA for 16 h after the transfection and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. They were then lysed in a Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), the lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for luciferase. The Photinus and Renilla luciferase assays were performed according to the protocol for the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activity. Gel-shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schneider et al. (24Schreiber E. Matthhius P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, MEL cells (1 × 107) and K562 cells (1 × 107) left untreated or treated with 1 mm SA for 16 h were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and then lysed with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were centrifuged, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 400 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were also obtained from MEL cells cultured with 2% Me2SO for 48 and 72 h. The oligonucleotide probe containing the MARE/NF-E2 site from the β-globin enhancer was described previously (25Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled probe (35,000 cpm) in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (26Mizutani A.

After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, and electrophoresed at 100 V at room temperature. The gels were exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C. RNA Blots—Total RNA was isolated from the cells by the guanidium isothiocyanate method (23Taketani S. Adachi Y. Kohno H. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31388-31394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The RNA (20 μg) was applied to a 1% agarose gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto a nylon membrane (Biodiene Type B) for hybridization with biotin-labeled antisense β-globin and actin RNAs. The filters were hybridized and washed, according to the method of Suzuki et al. (27Suzuki T. Takahashi T. Yamasaki A. Fujiwara T. Hirakawa M. Akagi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hybridized RNA was incubated with alkaline phophatase-conjugated avidin, washed, and examined for positive signals with a luminol reagent (Roche Applied Science). The RNA concentration was quantified using an Advantec DMU-33c densitometer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Chromatin was fixed and purified, according to the method of Shang et al. (28Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEL cells (1 × 108) were fixed in 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations with anti-Bach1 and NF-E2 antibodies were performed followed by isolation of immunoprecipitates with protein A-Sepharose beads. The PCR reaction was carried out in the reaction mixture containing 1 μCi (1 Ci = 37GBq) of [α-32P]dCTP and 25 cycles of amplification was used. Primers used were 5′-CACTTCTTCATATTCTCTCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTTATTTTCTTTTCACCTTCCCTG-3′ to amplify the DNA fragment of HS2 (29Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After PCR products were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels, the gels were exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C Effects of SA and Hemin on β-Globin mRNA in MEL Cells—SA is known as a competitive inhibitor of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, the second enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. MEL cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm SA or an iron chelator, DFO (100 μm), for 16 h, after which the amount of heme in the cells was measured. The heme content of SA- and DFO-treated cells decreased to about 70 and 45%, respectively, of that of control cells (Fig. 1A). Although the expression of globin genes is markedly induced upon the differentiation of MEL cells treated with Me2SO, α- and β-globin are known to be synthesized at lower levels in uninduced MEL cells. To examine whether SA or DFO causes any change in the β-globin expression in the absence of the differentiation-inducer Me2SO, Northern blot analysis of β-globin mRNA in uninduced cells was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1B, β-globin mRNA in SA-treated cells decreased to about 40%. Since the level was restored on the addition of 50 μm hemin, the effect of SA was through its inhibition of heme synthesis. Treatment of the cells with 100 μm DFO also resulted in a decrease of β-globin mRNA. Again, culture of the cells with 50 μm hemin reversed the decrease caused by DFO. When MEL cells were induced to differentiate with 2% Me2SO for 48 h, β-globin mRNA was expressed (Fig. 1C). The increase in β-globin mRNA upon the differentiation of MEL cell was markedly inhibited when the cells were cultured with 1 mm SA in addition to Me2SO. The decreased β-globin expression by the inhibition of heme biosynthesis was reversed by culture with 50 μm hemin, suggesting that the expression of β-globin mRNA in MEL cells is controlled by heme in both uninduced and induced cells. To clarify whether the heme-dependent expression of β-globin mRNA is regulated at the transcriptional level, we investigated the effect of SA on the human β-globin gene promoter/LCR reporters in human erythroleukemia K562 cells. The reporter plasmid pGLβp contains the upstream 836bp of the human β-globin gene, whereas pGLCRhβ was made by inserting human μLCR (30Ellis J. Pasceri P. Tan-Un K.C. Wu X. Harper A. Fraser P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) into pGLβp (19Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The reporter activity was weak in pGLβp-transfected K562 cells, and no change in the activity was observed on treatment with 1 mm SA or 50 μm hemin for 16 h (Fig. 2A). The reporter activity was strengthened when pGLCRhβ was transfected, consistent with the enhancer activity of the μLCR. The μLCR-dependent reporter gene activity decreased to 60% when the culture was treated with 1 mm SA. This loss of reporter activity was restored upon the addition of 50 μm hemin. To confirm these observations in other cells, MEL cells were transfected with pGLβp and pGLCRhβ, and the effects of SA and hemin on the reporter activity were also examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the decrease in pGLCRhβ activity caused by SA, and its cancellation by hemin, was similar to that in K562 cells. In contrast, when BALB/3T3 cells were examined, neither the μLCR-dependent activation nor the SA-dependent inhibition of the β-globin gene reporter was observed (Fig. 2C). Thus, heme induces the expression of the β-globin gene by stimulating the enhancer activity of the β-globin LCR in erythroid cells. Involvement of HS2 of the LCR in the Regulation of Hemin-dependent Expression in K562 and MEL Cells—Among the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs), HS3 and HS4 harbor single MAREs, and HS2 contains tandem duplicated MAREs. It was shown previously that hemin induces the enhancer activity of the tandem MAREs of HS-2 (previously referred to as the NF-E2 site) in K562 cells (15Ney P.A. Sotrentino B.P. McDough K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Gene Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Ney P.A. Sotrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To verify that the tandem MAREs are involved in hemin-dependent regulation of the reporter gene, activities of a reporter plasmid pGLCRhβHS2mut carrying the mutated MAREs of HS2 in the μLCR were compared using cells treated with SA or hemin. As shown in Fig. 3A, the basal activity of pGLCRhβHS2mut in K562 cells was significantly less than that of the wild-type control pGLCRhβ. Moreover, the reporter activity of pGLCRhβHS2mut was not affected by SA or hemin. When MEL cells were induced to differentiate with 2% Me2SO for 24 h, the reporter activity of pGLCRhβ was markedly increased as compared with that in uninduced cells (Fig. 3B). The reporter activity of pGLCRhβ was inhibited by SA, and the effect of SA was cancelled by simultaneously adding hemin. In contrast, the reporter activity of pGLCRhβHS2mut did not change significantly in the presence of SA or SA plus hemin (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that a deficiency of heme in the cells leads to the suppression of the enhancer activity of the LCR and that this regulation by heme involves the tandem MAREs within the HS2. Regulation of Hemin-dependent Expression of β-Globin Gene in Erythroid Cells by Bach1—The above results confirm previous observations that the tandem MAREs were essential for the Me2SO-induced expression of the μLCR reporter. Bach1 interacts with the tandem MAREs in vitro and competes for the sites with p45 NF-E2 (18Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Since Bach1 acts as a repressor of MARE-dependent transcription and its DNA binding activity is inhibited by hemin (18Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M.

Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), it may be involved in the regulation of the enhancer activity of HS2 by heme. We then conducted a conventional gel-shift assay using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe containing a MARE from the chicken β-globin 3′ enhancer to examine whether the DNA binding activity of endogenous Bach1 is indeed regulated by heme. To characterize the binding of Bach1 and p45 NF-E2, the MARE probe was incubated with nuclear extracts of untreated and Me2SO-treated MEL cells. As reported previously (18Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we observed two specific retarding bands (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The upper band disappeared upon preincubation of the nuclear extracts with anti-MafK and Bach1, indicating that the binding complex was composed of Bach1 and small Maf protein. The DNA binding activity of the Bach1/small Maf complex was slightly and markedly decreased in 48- and 72-h-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 4A). The lower band, NF-E2 (p45 and small Maf heterodimer), which disappeared with anti-p45 NF-E2 antibodies, intensified upon Me2SO-induced differentiation. The specific band corresponding to Bach1 intensified when MEL cells were treated with 1 mm SA (Fig. 4B). The DNA binding activity of Bach1 was decreased by treating the cells with SA plus 50 μm hemin. In this experiment, a weak band corresponding to NF-E2 was found, and the activity remained unchanged by a 16-h incubation. In Me2SO-treated MEL cells, SA caused an increase in the Bach1 activity but inhibited the increase in the NF-E2 activity (Fig. 4A). When nuclear extracts from K562 cells were used, the probe containing MAREs exhibited a binding pattern similar to that seen with MEL cells (Fig. 4C). No change in the bindings of Bach1 and NF-E2 to the MARE occurred by the addition of SA in vitro (data not shown). We next examined whether Bach1 affects the hemin-dependent activity of the μLCR. The reporter activity was measured in K562 cells in the presence of the wild-type and heme-insensitive Bach1-expression plasmids. The Bach1 mutant (Bach1mCP1-6) carrying multiple changes in the heme-binding cysteine-proline (CP) motifs does not bind heme, and its DNA binding activity is not inhibited by heme (20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Hoshino H.

As shown in Fig. 5A, the reporter activity of pGLCRhβ was suppressed by the wild-type Bach1. Consistent with the previous results using a synthetic reporter and HO-1 reporter (20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), the repressor activity of Bach1 was lost by treating cells with hemin (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the repressor activity of Bach1mCP1-6 was not affected by hemin treatment (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the repressor activity of Bach1 further dropped in SA-treated cells. Unlike the case for the wild-type Bach1, the reporter activity was not further reduced by SA in Bach1mCP1-6 expressing cells (Fig. 5B). When Bach1 was expressed in MEL cells, a heme-dependent regulation of the LCR activity, similar to that in the case of K562 cells, was observed (data not shown). These results suggest that Bach1 regulates the heme-dependent activity of the HS2 enhancer and that the repressive ability of Bach1 on the LCR activity is independent of the heme responsiveness. Occupancy of HS2 of the β-Globin LCR Enhancer by Bach1 and NF-E2—We finally examined the recruitment of Bach1 and NF-E2 to the MARE of HS2 in MEL cells treated with SA and hemin. The status of the endogenous transcription complexes present on the HS2 was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitations. The presence of the HS2 in the chromatin immunoprecipitates was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the HS2 of the LCR. As shown in Fig. 6A, the PCR product increased dependent on 22-28 cycles, and then we analyzed the products with 25 cycles of PCR to evaluate the binding of Bach1 and NF-E2 to HS2. Bach1 and NF-E2 were equally bound to the HS2, and an increase in the binding of Bach1 was observed when cells were treated with 1 mm SA (Fig. 6B). The increase of Bach1 was cancelled by treatment with 50 μm hemin, whereas the binding of NF-E2 to the HS2 increased in the same cells. The present study showed that Bach1 plays an important role in the differentiation of erythroid cells and directly regulates the expression of β-globin, mediated by hemin. The expression of β-globin mRNA was reduced when the content of heme in uninduced and Me2SO-treated MEL cells was decreased by treatment with SA or DFO. Exogenously added hemin restored the level of β-globin mRNA. These findings were similar to previous observations that the expression of globin chains in MEL and human erythroid progenitor cells was reduced when these cells were cultured with SA (31Battistini A. Coccia E.M. Marziali G. Bulgarini D. Scalzo S. Fiorucci G. Romeo G. Affabris E. Testa U. Rossi G.B. Peschle C. Blood. 1991; 78: 2098-2103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fibach E. Kollia P. Schechter A.N. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Blood. 1995; 85: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and support the concept of the positive effect of heme on β-globin synthesis (33Fukuda Y. Fujita H. Garbaczewski L. Sassa S. Blood. 1994; 83: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Meguro K. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Fujita H. Sassa S. Blood. 1995; 86: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a promoter assay of β-globin, the present study confirmed that the expression of β-globin mRNA is regulated by hemin at the transcriptional level. There are also many reports that heme induces erythropoiesis by the coordinate expression of α-, and β-globin, transferrin receptors, ferrochelatase, and erythroid specific δ-aminolevulinic acidsynthase (4Fukuda Y Fujita H. Taketani S. Sassa S. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Fibach E. Kollia P. Schechter A.N. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Blood. 1995; 85: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fujita H. Yamamoto M. Yamagami T. Hayashi N. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17494-17502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In erythroid cells, it is reported that heme acts as not only a transcription factor NF-Y for ferritin synthesis (36Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Testa U. Coccia E.M. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but also as a transcription factor for kinases including the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (37Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y. Browne C. Chin G Fleming M. Leboulch P. Orkin S.H. Chen J.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6909-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is also known that heme-regulated eIF2α kinase mRNA increases in induced MEL cells but decreases when the heme biosynthesis is blocked (38Crosby J.S. Chefalo P.J. Yeh I. Ying S. London I.M. Leboulch P. Chen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, dominant negative heme-regulated eIF2α kinase mutant expressed in MEL cells resulted in the increase in hemoglobin synthesis (38Crosby J.S. Chefalo P.J. Yeh I. Ying S. London I.M. Leboulch P. Chen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, heme is well known to regulate the synthesis of globin chains at the translational step. We have shown for the first time that the hemin-dependent activation of β-globin expression at the transcriptional level occurred at the HS2 of the LCR, where it interacted with Bach1. Analysis by atomic force microscopy revealed large looped DNA structures between MAREs located in different regulatory elements within the human β-globin LCR formed by Bach1/MafK heterodimer (19Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that the formation of these loops required the Bach1 BTB/POZ protein interaction domain (19Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Bach1 would function as an architectural factor and cause the repression of the enhancer activity of the LCR. We confirmed that Bach1 suppresses the activity of the μLCR and demonstrated that the heme binding ability of Bach1 contributes to the hemin-dependent induction of the LCR enhancer (Fig. 5). Consistent with previous findings that the formation of a multimetric and multivalent DNA complex with multiple MAREs occurs simultaneously (18Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and that β-globin LCR holocomplex can be formed by structurally connecting the MAREs present in HS2, HS3, and HS4 of the LCR (9Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 19Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Bach1 contributes to the generation of a multiprotein complex as a repressosome among the HS of the LCR (39Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). The present data by gel-shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitations clearly showed the physiological role of the interaction of Bach1 with HS2 in the regulation of the expression of β-globin. Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-MafK and anti-p45 NF-E2 showed that the LCR was occupied by small Maf proteins in uninduced MEL cells where the synthesis of globin is suppressed (29Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and that p45 NF-E2 was recruited to the LCR as well as the active globin promoters on erythroid differentiation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitations, we found that the recruitments of Bach1 and NF-E2 to the MARE of HS2 were regulated by the intracellular level of heme, indicating that Bach1 and NF-E2 share MAREs and effectively compete with them. Furthermore, the present study and a previous study (18Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed that the DNA complex with Bach1 was down-regulated at the late stage of Me2SO-induced MEL cell differentiation, whereas the NF-E2 complex was induced to form by Me2SO treatment. Bach1 may be involved in the assembly of the LCR complex at the early stages of hematopoietic cell differentiation, whereas p45 NF-E2 contributes to the activation of globin genes per se at the late stage. Based on the fact that the level of intracellular heme was markedly elevated in Me2SO-treated cells and that a marked decrease in Bach1 activity was observed in hemin-treated cells, heme contributes to the loss of function of Bach1 during erythroid differentiation. This is supported by the finding that the expression of Bach1 and Bach1mCP1-6 led to a decrease in the activity for the LCR enhancement, but the hemin-dependent restoration of the μLCR activity was only observed in wild-type Bach1-expressing cells (Fig. 5). In fact, the treatment of MEL cells with Me2SO increased NF-E2 activity significantly (40Nagai T. Igarashi K. Akasaka J. Furuyama K. Fujita H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5358-5365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is also supported by the present observation that the reporter activity of pGLCRhβ in Me2SO-induced MEL cells was markedly increased as compared with that in uninduced cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the induction of the p45 NF-E2 binding activity during erythroid differentiation implies that the replacement of the Bach1 associated with small Maf molecules with the NF-E2 complex occurs dependent on the stage of the differentiation. Similarly, a recent study (21Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) clarified the mechanisms involved in the induction of HO-1 by hemin. Namely, Bach1 represses the expression of HO-1 under physiological conditions, and an increased level of heme displaces Bach1 from the enhancers by inhibiting DNA binding, allowing activators to bind the enhancers. Thus, heterodimers of small Maf- and p45 NF-E2-related activators including Nrf2 are most likely the form binding to the HO-1 enhancers upon transcriptional activation. We now provide evidence of a new function of heme directly regulating the transcription of genes. For a long time, it has been considered that intracellular heme has a significant role in the transcriptional up-regulation of several erythroid-specific proteins, including globin chains, transferrin receptors, ferritin, and enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway (3Sassa S. Nagai T. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 63: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We identified the LCR β-globin gene as one of the targets of Bach1 where heme acts as a positive regulator of the transcription of the β-globin gene by regulating the interaction of Bach1 with the MARE region of the μLCR (HS2). We propose that transcriptional regulation of β-globin is a direct sensing of heme levels during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells. Since Bach1 is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues, there may be activation systems for various genes involving the replacement of the repressor Bach1 with some enhancer protein, the event being triggered by heme.

The SpsA-pIgR interaction mediates adherence and internalization of the human pathogen into epithelial cells. In this study the results of SpsA binding to human, mouse, and chimeric SC strongly supported the human specificity of this unique interaction and suggested that binding sites in the third and fourth Ig-like domain of human SC (D3 and D4, respectively) are involved in SpsA-pIgR complex formation. Binding of SpsA to SC-derived synthetic peptides indicated surface-located potential binding motifs in D3 and D4. Adherence and uptake of pneumococci or SpsA-coated latex beads depended on the SpsA hexapeptide motif as well as SpsA-binding sites in D3 and D4 of human pIgR. The involvement of D3 and D4 in adherence and invasion was demonstrated by the lack of binding of SpsA-coated latex beads to transfected epithelial cells expressing mutated pIgR. Finally, blocking experiments with chimeric human-mouse SC as well as synthetic peptides indicated the participation of D3 and a key role of D4 in pneumococcal invasion.

The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) 1The abbreviations used are: pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; hpIgR, human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; pIgA, polymeric immunoglobulin A; D, domain; SC, secretory component; SIgA, secretory IgA; FSC, free secretory component; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. 1The abbreviations used are: pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; hpIgR, human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; pIgA, polymeric immunoglobulin A; D, domain; SC, secretory component; SIgA, secretory IgA; FSC, free secretory component; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. is synthesized as an integral membrane glycoprotein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of mucosal epithelial cells and comprises a polymeric IgA (pIgA)-binding extracellular region, a 23-amino acid membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tail of 103 amino acids (1Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1984; 308: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Piskurich J.F. Blanchard M.H. Youngman K.R. France J.A. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1735-1747PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular region of pIgR is divided into the leader peptide, and five Ig-like domains (D1 to D5) of 100-110 amino acids each, out of which D1 represents the initial pIgA-binding domain (3Bakos M.A. Widen S.G. Goldblum R.M. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A sixth non-Ig-like domain connects the extracellular domains to the transmembrane region (1Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1984; 308: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The pIgR is crucial for the generation of secretory IgA (SIgA) because it mediates transport of pIgA to mucosal secretions (4Johansen F.E. Pekna M. Norderhaug I.N. Haneberg B. Hietala M.A. Krajci P.

The pIgR-pIgA complex is endocytosed from the basolateral pole and translocated by vesicular transport to the apical surface of the epithelium. Release of SIgA and free secretory component (FSC, from unoccupied receptor) occurs by proteolytic cleavage of the pIgR near the plasma membrane (1Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1984; 308: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Piskurich J.F. Blanchard M.H. Youngman K.R. France J.A. Kaetzel C.S. J.

In addition to its role in pIgA transport, pIgR/SC provides increased stability and mucosal anchoring to secretory antibodies (17Phalipon A. Corthesy B.

Moreover, free or IgA-bound SC may compete with pathogens for adhesion sites on the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells (19Williams R.C. Gibbons R.J.

Some pathogens have developed strategies to exploit these host defense functions of the pIgR, for their invasion into the epithelium. In infections by type 2 herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus, virus-specific pIgA antibodies act as a bridge that connects the pathogen with the pIgR-expressing epithelium thereby facilitating internalization of virus (23Sixbey J.W.

Investig. 2000; 80: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to nasopharyngeal epithelial cells was associated with pIgR-mediated translocation of the bacteria across the epithelial barrier (27Zhang J.R. Mostov K.E. Lamm M.E. Nanno M. Shimida S. Ohwaki M. Tuomanen E. Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae is a frequent resident of the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans, but pneumococci are also important human pathogens, causing relatively harmless local infections such as otitis media and sinusitis as well as life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis (28Musher D.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 29Tuomanen E.I. Austrian R. Masure H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Pneumococcal dissemination starts at the respiratory tract after penetration of the epithelial barrier, and disease outcome depends on bacterial virulence and host defense factors. The surface-displayed choline-binding protein SpsA (also designated CbpA and PspC) of S. pneumoniae exhibits a unique interaction with FSC or the SC portion of pIgR and SIgA (27Zhang J.R. Mostov K.E. Lamm M.E. Nanno M. Shimida S. Ohwaki M. Tuomanen E. Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 30Hammerschmidt S. Talay S.R. Brandtzaeg P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This interaction may be of pathogenic significance because it provides a mechanism for adherence of pneumococci to nasopharyngeal pIgR-expressing cells. Apical recycling of the pIgR may allow bacterial invasion and subsequent translocation across human epithelial barriers (27Zhang J.R. Mostov K.E. Lamm M.E. Nanno M. Shimida S. Ohwaki M. Tuomanen E. Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Whether this apical to basolateral translocation occurs by utilizing the pIgR-transcytosis machinery in reverse or by other mechanisms is not known. We have previously shown that SC from mouse, rat, guinea pig, and rabbit does not interact with SpsA in vitro (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a hexapeptide motif (YRNYPT), located in a highly conserved part of the N-terminal region of SpsA, was identified as the minimal pIgR/SC-binding motif by synthetic peptide technology. Systematic replacement analysis indicated a crucial role of the YPT sequence in this motif (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate by the sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique that pIgR/SC from mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, dog, cow, and horse do not bind to SpsA. Furthermore, we used two complementary approaches to identify the SpsA binding site on human SC: first, chimeric domains swap molecules between human and mouse SC identified human D3 and D4 as required for the interaction with SpsA; second, synthetic peptide array technology identified several epitopes in human pIgR capable of interacting with SpsA. Putative binding sites were identified in extracellular domains D2133-148, D2/3208-225, and D4349-375. Crucial roles of the hexapeptide binding motif of SpsA and the identified SpsA binding sites in D3 and D4 in hpIgR-mediated adherence of SpsA coated latex beads and in pneumococcal invasion of epithelial cells was confirmed. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—S. pneumoniae strains utilized were NCTC 10319 (Cps+ type 35A), ATCC 11733 (Cps+ type 2), and the unencapsulated D39 derivative R6x (Cps-). Isogenic spsA mutants generated from the wild-type strains were described earlier (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pneumococci were cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Great Britain) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) and erythromycin (5 μg ml-1), if appropriate, or grown on blood agar (Merck). Cell Culture—The pIgR-expressing human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 (ATCC HTB-55) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (ATCC CCL-34) epithelial cells that were stably transfected with the hpIgR cDNA in pCB6 (MDCK-hpIgR) (32Tamer C.M. Lamm M.E. Robinson J.K. Piskurich J.F. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 707-714PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin G (100 IU ml-1), and streptomycin (100 μg ml-1) (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The medium for Calu-3 cells was further supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli M15[pREP4] (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used as host for recombinant pQE expression plasmids and cultured at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or grown on LB-agar containing 100 μgml-1 ampicillin. Expression and purification of His-tagged fusion proteins was performed as described previously (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To obtain His-tagged fusion proteins SpsA SH2, SpsA SH12, SpsA SH3, SpsA SM1, and SpsA SH2201 (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) of highest purity and to eliminate contaminations that might interfere in the BIAcore analysis, affinity purified His-tagged proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography using HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). To obtain the bacterial adhesin for hpIgR/SC in its native form, SpsA from S. pneumoniae ATCC 33400 serotype 1 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Protein A-purified polyclonal anti-SpsA IgG (10 mg) generated in rabbit against SpsA protein SH2 (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractionation and enrichment of solubilized pneumococcal cell wall proteins was performed as described previously (33Bergmann S. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1273-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The cell wall protein fraction was applied to the coupled antiserum and SpsA was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4. Its purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain and its SC binding activity by immunoblot analysis. SIgA and FSC from humans and other species such as rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, bovines, equine, canines, and hamsters were purified as described earlier from milk or bile (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Association and dissociation reactions of FSC and SIgA were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore™ optical biosensor 2000 (Amersham Biosciences). SpsA purified from S. pneumoniae and SpsA derivatives SH2, SH12, SM1, and SH2201 were covalently immobilized on CM5 sensor chips as described previously (34Nice E.C. McInerney T.L. Jackson D.C. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, SpsA proteins, each in a concentration of 1 mg ml-1 in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, were coupled at 10 μl min-1 onto N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.05 m), N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (0.2 m)-activated sensor chips using a volume of 70 μl with a flow rate of 10 μl min-1. Binding analysis was performed in a HBS BIAcore running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) using a flow rate of 10 μl ml-1 in all experiments. Regeneration of the affinity surface between sequential analyte injections was conducted twice with 20 μl of 20-30 mm NaOH. The kinetics of FSC and SIgA binding to immobilized SpsA proteins was analyzed from raw data of the BIAcore sensorgrams using a linear kinetic model included in BIAevaluation software version 3.0. For every evaluation, a minimum of six data sets corresponding to FSC/SIgA binding reactions at concentrations between 0.19 and 500 nm were analyzed. Sensorgram data were fitted globally to the algorithms representing a simple 1:1 Langmuir kinetic. Construction of Chimeric SC Molecules and Binding to SpsA—A pcDNA3.1-derived (Invitrogen) expression plasmid encoding human FSC has been described previously (35Johansen F.E. Natvig N.I. Roe M. Sandlie I. Brandtzaeg P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1701-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A similar expression plasmid for murine FSC was made by amplifying the 6 extracellular domains of murine pIgR and inserting the coding region into pcDNA3.1his6. Domain swap chimeras indicated in Figs. 3 and 4 were made by PCR splice overlap extension and the chimeric cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1his6 (details provided upon request). Domain boundaries of the chimeric constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and were as indicated in Piskurich et al. (2Piskurich J.F. Blanchard M.H. Youngman K.R. France J.A. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1735-1747PubMed Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 4. For recombinant expression of wild-type human and murine SC as well as all the chimeric and mutant SC variants, 293E cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg ml-1 gentamicin, were transiently transfected by FuGENE (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Supernatants were harvested 2, 4, and 6 days after the end of the transfection, pooled (30 ml in total), SC precipitated by adding 12 g of ammonium sulfate, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% azide. Binding to SpsA fragments was analyzed by ELISA. Microtiter plates (Costar) were coated with 1.5 μg ml-1 of SpsA fragments in 0.02 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, overnight and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 90 min. Dimeric IgA was coated at 3.0 μg ml-1. Titration experiments demonstrated that maximal OD was achieved when the SC concentration was between 0.5 and 1.0 μg ml-1. All SC variants were therefore diluted to ∼2 μg ml-1 in ELISA buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 90 min, and binding was determined by incubation with a mixture of rabbit antiserum to human SC (DAKO; diluted 1/3000) and murine SC (gift from Blaise Corthesy, diluted 1/10000), and revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum.Fig. 4Alignment of the sequence of human and mouse SC. The single letter amino acid sequence of human SC is shown on top with the mouse sequence below. Dashes indicate identical amino acids, whereas dots indicate gaps in the alignment. Broken arrows show domain boundaries. Alignment of positive peptides (#) in the spot membrane analysis is indicated as lines above the human SC sequence. Deletion mutants used in transient transfection studies (Fig. 8) are indicated below the sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Spot-synthesized hpIgR Peptides for SpsA Binding Activity—The leader sequence and extracellular domains of the hpIgR from amino acid 1 to 592 were divided into 200 overlapping peptide fragments, each consisting of 15 amino acids (see Supplementary Materials), with an offset of three amino acids (36Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1996; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized as an array of spots on an aminophenylated cellulose membrane (AIMS Scientific Products GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) as described previously (37Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), and are NH2-terminal acetylated and remain covalently attached to the membrane via their carboxyl terminus. Binding of SpsA to hpIgR-derived peptides was carried out by using a SpsA-derivative SH12 and anti-SpsA IgG followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pneumococcal Adherence and Invasion—Pneumococcal adherence to and invasion of Calu-3 and MDCK-hpIgR-expressing cells were performed in 24-well plates (Greiner, Germany) on glass coverslips (diameter, 12 mm). Confluent epithelial cells with a density of ∼2 × 105 cells were inoculated with 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 pneumococci and infections were carried out for 4 h in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium-HEPES at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To remove non-adherent bacteria, the cells were rinsed several times with PBS. Synthetic peptides used in inhibition experiments were purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-8) with water/acetonitrile gradients containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and characterized by amino acid analysis. Immunofluorescence—Extra- and intracellular pneumococci were stained using a polyclonal anti-pneumococcal antiserum and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 488 (green) or Alexa 568 (red) (MoBiTec). Pneumococcal antiserum was generated in rabbit against heat-inactivated pneumococci (R6x and ATCC 11733) and it reacts equally well against different pneumococcal strains. Briefly, extracellular bacteria, adhering to epithelial cells, were incubated for 15 min with the polyclonal anti-pneumococcal antiserum, washed, and fixated in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. After washing coverslips were incubated with the Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugate. The intracellularly located invasive pneumococci were stained after permeabilization of the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed in PBS, followed by incubation with anti-pneumococcal antiserum and Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugate. Extracellular pneumococci appear yellow, whereas intracellular appear red. At least 50 cells per glass coverslip were scored for pneumococcal adherence and invasion. Each experiment was repeated at least five times and results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Mutagenesis of hpIg Receptor Domains—Deletion of regions in pIgR that were identified as potential SpsA binding sites was achieved by inframe deletions of the domain encoding sequences by inverse PCR. PCR products were generated using DNA primers incorporating SacII restriction sites for re-ligation and pcDNA3.1hpIgR as template. This strategy finally resulted in hpIgR expression derivatives pcDNA3.1hpIgRD2Δ133-148, pcDNA3.1hpIgRD2/3Δ206-229, and pcDNA3.1hpIgRD4Δ349-389 (indicated in Fig. 4). Transfection of Epithelial Cells—Transfection of MDCK cells with pcDNA3.1hpIgR and constructs pcDNA3.1hpIgRD2Δ133-148, pcDNA3.1hpIgRD2/3Δ206-229, and pcDNA3.1hpIgRD4Δ349-389, respectively, were conducted using FuGENE 6 (Roche) as transfection reagent according to the instructions of the supplier. Briefly, 1 × 104 MDCK cells were seeded on coverslips in medium without antibiotics. Serum- and antibiotic-free medium was mixed with FuGENE reagent and 0.5 μg of DNA was added (FuGENE:DNA in a ratio of 3:1). The solution was mixed gently and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The complex mixture was added to the cells and the 24-well plate was swirled to ensure even dispersal. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for at least 2 days prior to incubation with the SpsA-coated latex beads. SpsA-coated latex beads were detected by anti-SpsA IgG followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 568 and efficiency of transfection was visualized by immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-SC antiserum as primary antibody followed by Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugate (MoBiTec). Attachment and Internalization of SpsA Derivatives Coupled to Latex Beads—SpsA derivatives (rSpsA SH12, rSpsA SH2, rSpsA SH201) expressed as recombinant proteins were coated on 3-μm polystyrene latex beads (Sigma) by incubating 108 beads with 5 μg of the proteins in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, beads were resuspended in culture medium to a final concentration of 108 beads ml-1. Efficiency of protein coating was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (data not shown). Binding of 107 SpsA-coated beads was assayed to 2 × 105 Calu-3 or MDCK cells. Cells were grown on a 12-mm glass coverslip and incubated with latex beads for 1 to 4 h incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After washing six times with adhered or internalized PBS, beads were visualized by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, or scanning electron microscopy. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Following incubation with SpsA-coupled latex beads, Calu-3 or MDCK-hpIgR cells were fixed with a fixation solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 3% formaldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 1 h on ice and washed with cacodylate buffer. After washing several times in TE buffer, samples were dehydrated with a gradient series of acetone (10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%) on ice, each step 15 min, followed by critical point drying with liquid CO2. Samples were examined in a Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope DSM982 Gemini at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV using the Everhard Thornely SE-detector and the inlens-SE detector in a 50:50 ratio. Statistical Analysis—The differences in adherence were analyzed by the Student's t test, unpaired, and statistically significant for p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively. Association and Dissociation Kinetics of SC/SIgA to SpsA Proteins—The complex formation of SpsA-SC and SpsA-SIgA were analyzed using SPR. Kinetics of hFSC and SIgA binding to SpsA purified from S. pneumoniae and recombinant N-terminal SpsA derivatives SH2, SH12, SM1, and SpsA protein SH2201, containing an amino acid substitution at position 201 (Tyr → Asp) of the hexapeptide binding motif (Fig. 1), were measured. Representative sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 2. The observed rates of complex formation between native SpsA, SH2, SH12, and SM1 were dependent on the concentration of applied hFSC or SIgA (Fig. 2, A and B). SpsA with a single substitution of a critical amino acid in the hexapepetide motif did not bind hFSC or human SIgA as shown by a total lack of increase of resonance units (Fig. 2C). Assuming a simple one-step bimolecular association reaction and fitting, therefore, the data globally according to the 1:1 Langmuir kinetic model revealed similar association and dissociation rate constants for native SpsA-hFSC/SIgA (Table I). The equilibrium dissociation constants as defined by KD = koff/kass are in the nanomolar range (Table I) for the interaction of hFSC with native SpsA (KD = 3.53 × 10-9m), to SpsA derivatives SH2 (KD = 3.29 × 10-9m) and SH12 (KD = 8.20 × 10-9m), respectively (Table I). The hexapeptide motif YRNYPT of SpsA, which represents the minimal SC binding motif (31Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is present once in SpsA derivative SH2 at position 198-203 and twice in SpsA derivative SH12, at positions 163-168 and 325-330. Nevertheless, SPR revealed that the number of SC binding motifs does not affect rates of association and dissociation of the SpsA and SC interaction. Moreover, SPR analysis confirmed our previous findings that SC from mouse, rat, and SIgA from bovine, canine, equine, guinea pig, hamster, mouse, rabbit, and rat did not bind to SpsA as indicated by a total lack of increase of resonance units (data not shown).Fig. 2Surface plasmon resonance measurements of the SpsA-FSC/SIgA interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2059220343,"Homologous desensitization of D1 dopamine receptors is thought to occur through their phosphorylation leading to arrestin association which interdicts G protein coupling. In order to identify the relevant domains of receptor phosphorylation, and to determine how this leads to arrestin association, we created a series of mutated D1 receptor constructs. In one mutant, all of the serine/threonine residues within the 3rd cytoplasmic domain were altered (3rdTOT). A second construct was created in which only three of these serines (serines 256, 258, and 259) were mutated (3rd234). We also created four truncation mutants of the carboxyl terminus (T347, T369, T394, and T404). All of these constructs were comparable with the wild-type receptor with respect to expression and adenylyl cyclase activation. In contrast, both of the 3rd loop mutants exhibited attenuated agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation that was correlated with an impaired desensitization response. Sequential truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor resulted in a sequential loss of agonist-induced phosphorylation. No phosphorylation was observed with the most severely truncated T347 mutant. Surprisingly, all of the truncated receptors exhibited normal desensitization. The ability of the receptor constructs to promote arrestin association was evaluated using arrestin-green fluorescent protein translocation assays and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The 3rd234 mutant receptor was impaired in its ability to induce arrrestin translocation, whereas the T347 mutant was comparable with wild type. Our data suggest a model in which arrestin directly associates with the activated 3rd cytoplasmic domain in an agonist-dependent fashion; however, under basal conditions, this is sterically prevented by the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Receptor activation promotes the sequential phosphorylation of residues, first within the carboxyl terminus and then the 3rd cytoplasmic loop, thereby dissociating these domains and allowing arrestin to bind to the activated 3rd loop. Thus, the role of receptor phosphorylation is to allow access of arrestin to its receptor binding domain rather than to create an arrestin binding site per se.

Thus, the role of receptor phosphorylation is to allow access of arrestin to its receptor binding domain rather than to create an arrestin binding site per se. Agonist activation of most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. is quickly followed by homeostatic processes that desensitize or return the receptor activity back toward basal levels (reviewed in Refs. 1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 3Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Desensitization of GPCRs is thought to largely involve their phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases. One category of protein kinases, involved in heterologous desensitization, are those activated by second messengers, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by these kinases does not require agonist occupancy and results in reduced G protein coupling. A second category of protein kinases are the GPCR kinases (GRKs) that mediate homologous desensitization of GPCRs. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs is strictly dependent on agonist occupancy resulting in desensitization of only those receptors that were activated. GRK phosphorylation generally occurs on serine and/or threonine residues in the GPCR carboxyl terminus and/or 3rd cytoplasmic loop. Phosphorylation by GRKs has been shown to decrease the affinity of the GPCR for its cognate G protein and also results in the binding of an arrestin protein. Arrestin association further prohibits G protein coupling and also targets the GPCR for endocytosis. Once internalized, the GPCR can engage additional signaling pathways and be sorted for recycling to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 3Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although this basic desensitization paradigm may be operative for most G protein-coupled receptors, it is becoming apparent that there may be significant exceptions and widespread variations on this general scheme. One area of significant complexity is the mechanism by which GRK phosphorylation leads to arrestin association with the GPCR. Surprising little is known about this process with most information coming from the rhodopsin-visual arrestin system. Gurevich and co-workers (4Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A.

Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have proposed a model whereby arrestin binds to the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin resulting in the disruption of intramolecular forces within the arrestin protein leading to an altered conformation with high affinity for rhodopsin. By using constitutively active mutants of arrestins, Gurevich and co-workers (6Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have also provided evidence that this model may be applicable to the β2-adrenergic receptor that also undergoes GRK-mediated phosphorylation on its carboxyl terminus. Despite these advances, it is not clear if this model is generally applicable to all GPCR/arrestin interactions, particularly for GPCRs that do not undergo GRK phosphorylation on their carboxyl termini. Remaining unclear for the vast majority of GPCRs is the precise number, location, and role of GRK phosphorylation sites that lead to arrestin association and ultimately desensitization. Like most GPCRs, the D1 dopamine receptor undergoes both second messenger and GRK-mediated phosphorylation reactions that lead to its desensitization. Conflicting evidence has been provided as to the relative role of second messenger activated protein kinases, primarily PKA, and that of GRK-mediated phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 8Sibley D.R. Neve K.A. Neve K.A. Neve R.L. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 383-424Google Scholar). In some systems, agonist-induced phosphorylation of the D1 receptor appears to be mediated predominantly by PKA (9Mason J.N. Kozell L.B. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas in others GRKs appear to play a primary role (10Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Similarly, the exact sites of phosphorylation are unclear. Both Jiang and Sibley (14Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar) and Mason et al. (9Mason J.N. Kozell L.B. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that T268 in the 3rd cytoplasmic loop of the D1 receptor is phosphorylated in a PKA-dependent fashion and that this regulates either the rate of desensitization (14Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar) or intracellular trafficking of the receptor once internalized (9Mason J.N. Kozell L.B. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, Jackson et al. (15Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Chaar Z.Y. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the D1 receptor is primarily phosphorylated on multiple residues within its carboxyl terminus. Similarly, Lamey et al. (13Lamey M. Thompson M. Varghese G. Chi H. Sawzdargo M. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9415-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that agonist-induced phosphorylation of the human D1 receptor is restricted to the carboxyl terminus; however, they report that only a single residue, T360, is involved and that this is likely phosphorylated by a GRK. This finding conflicts with a previous observation by Tiberi et al. (10Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3771-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the D1 receptor takes place exclusively on serine residues. Many of these studies utilized different cellular host systems for receptor expression, suggesting that this might account for some of these disparate results. Because Tiberi et al. (10Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3771-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of the D1 receptor in HEK293 cells is predominantly mediated by GRK(s) and because we are interested in mapping the functionally relevant domains of GRK-mediated phosphorylation and determining how this leads to arrestin association, we have used these cells in our current study. We now provide evidence for functionally relevant phosphorylation sites within both the 3rd cytoplasmic loop and the carboxyl terminus of the D1 receptor and that phosphorylation of both of these domains is required for rapid association of arrestin with the receptor. Rather than the creation of an arrestin binding site per se, however, the only role of receptor phosphorylation is to alter the conformation of the 3rd cytoplasmic loop and/or the carboxyl terminus such that arrestin can associate with and bind to the activated 3rd cytoplasmic domain. Materials—HEK293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK293-tsa201 (HEK293T) cells (16Heinzel S.S. Krysan P.J. Calos M.P. DuBridge R.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. Vanitha Ramakrishnan. [3H]SCH-23390 (70–71.3 Ci/mmol) and [3H]cAMP (31.4 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Dopamine, Ro-20-1724, (±)-propranolol, and (+)-butaclamol were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Cyclic AMP assay kits were from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). Cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Summit Biotechnology (Purchase, CO). Calcium phosphate transfection kits were from Invitrogen. MiniComplete™ protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Applied Science. M2-affinity gel and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °Cin5%CO2 and 90% humidity. An amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged construct of the rat D1 receptor (17Monsma Jr., F.J. Mahan L.C. McVittie L.D. Gerfen C.R. Sibley D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) was created from pSFβ2, an expression construct containing a FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor (18Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor sequence was excised using NcoI and SalI, and following NcoI/SalI digestion of the rat D1 receptor sequence, the D1 receptor was inserted in-frame 3′ to the FLAG epitope sequence to create pSFD1, as reported previously (12Gardner B. Liu Z.F. Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This construct, and mutants thereof, were used for all experiments except for the confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Similarly, HEK293-tsa201 (HEK293T) cells were used for all experiments except for those shown in Figs. 12 and 13, which employed regular HEK293 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuickChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Truncated receptors were created by generating stop codons at the indicated locations (Fig. 1) in the protein sequence. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing prior to use. HEK293 or HEK293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 100- or 150-mm2 plates, and transfection was carried out at ∼50% confluency. DNA and 60 μlof2 m CaCl2 were mixed in H2O in a total volume of 1 ml and then slowly mixed with HEPES-buffered saline. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 25 min and then evenly added to the cell culture dish containing 20 ml of fresh media. After 18 h, the transfection media were replaced with fresh media, and the cells were divided for subsequent experiments.Fig. 13Translocation of arrestin3-GFP to the wild-type and mutant D1 receptors. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with arrestin3-GFP and either the WT, Ser-234 or T347 D1 receptor constructs. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes, and confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). Images were collected sequentially every 30 s after agonist stimulation with 20 μm dopamine using single line excitation (488 nm). Shown are representative confocal microscopic images of arrestin3-GFP fluorescence 300 s (5 min) after treatment with dopamine. Movies showing the dopamine treatments from 0 to 20 min are provided as Supplemental Material for the WT, Ser-234, and T347 D1 receptor constructs. This experiment was performed three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Diagram of the rat D1 dopamine receptor sequence. The wild-type (WT) receptor sequence is shown along with the various mutant constructs utilized in this study. The black residues highlight the serine and threonine residues within the 3rd cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal domains. Four truncation mutants are shown (T347, T369, T394, and T404) in which the receptor was truncated at the position indicated. Two 3rd loop mutants are shown. In the 3rd TOTAL (3rdTOT) mutant, all of the serine and threonine residues within the 3rd cytoplasmic loop were changed to either alanine or valine as indicated. In the 3rd234 mutant, only the three serine residues indicated (serines 256, 258, and 259) were mutated to alanines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Radioligand Binding Assays—HEK293T cells were harvested by incubation with 5 mm EDTA in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4 °C; 5 mm MgCl2) and were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 34,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The membrane suspension (final protein concentration = 20 μg/tube) was then added to assay tubes containing [3H]SCH-23390 in a final volume of 1.0 ml. (+)-Butaclamol was added at the final concentration of 3 μm to determine nonspecific binding. The assay tubes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Radioactivity bound to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 47%. Determination of cAMP Production—HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates (150,000 cells per well) and cultured for 1 day prior to the experiment. To assess desensitization, the cultures were first pretreated for the indicated times in the absence or presence of dopamine with 0.1 mm l-ascorbic acid and 5 μm (±)-propranolol (to block endogenous β-adrenergic receptors) and in HDMEM (20 mm HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, 37 °C). Subsequently, the cells were washed four times with 400 μl of EBSS (37 °C) and were further incubated with various concentrations of dopamine in a total volume of 250 μl at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 30 μm Ro-20-1724, 100 μm l-ascorbic acid, and 5 μm (±)-propranolol. The reaction was terminated by discarding the supernatant and adding 200 μl of 3% perchloric acid per well. After incubating on ice for 30 min, 80 μl of 15% KHCO3 was added to the wells, and the plates were further incubated for 10 min. The plates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,300 × g, and 50 μl of the supernatant from each well was subsequently transferred to a 1.2-ml tube containing 250 μl of reaction mixture (150 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, 50 μl of cAMP-binding protein, and 50 μlof[3H]cAMP). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, 250 μl of charcoal/dextran mix (1%) was added to each tube followed by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min and then centrifugation for 15 min at 1,300 × g. Radioactivity in the supernatant from each tube was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 47%. Cyclic AMP concentrations were calculated using a standard curve according to the protocol of the assay kit. Whole Cell Phosphorylation Assays—These were performed as described previously (12Gardner B. Liu Z.F. Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day prior to the experiment, HEK293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 per well of a 6-well plate and cultured overnight. Cells were then washed with EBSS and incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM. Media were then removed and replaced with 2 ml of fresh media supplemented with 200 μCi/ml carrier-free [32P]H3PO4. After 90 min at 37 °C, the cells were then challenged with dopamine in media supplemented with 100 μm l-ascorbic acid for the times and concentrations described in the text. Cells were then transferred to ice, washed twice with ice-cold EBSS, and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 4 °C) + 150 mm NaCl supplemented with MiniComplete™ protease mixture, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF). The samples were cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce). In each experiment, the level of receptor expression for each construct was quantified via radioligand binding assays using cells from duplicate wells that were treated identically except for the addition of [32P]H3PO4. After receptor/protein quantification, equal amounts of solubilized receptor protein were then transferred to fresh tubes with 50 μl of washed M2-affinity gel and incubated overnight with mixing at 4 °C. The samples were then washed once with solubilization buffer + 500 mm NaCl, once with solubilization buffer + 150 mm NaCl, and once with TE (Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4, 4 °C). Samples were then incubated in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 1 h at 37 °C before being resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. All assays included cells challenged with vehicle as an internal control. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assays—HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated D1 receptor constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated plates 1 day prior to the whole cell biotinylation experiment. The level of receptor expression for each construct was determined by radioligand binding assays in cells from duplicate plates as described above. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1 mg/ml biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 37 °C. After the whole cell biotinylation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 4 °C) supplemented 150 mm NaCl with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After a 1-h incubation on ice, the samples were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of receptor protein, as determined for the phosphorylation assays, were then transferred to fresh tubes with 50 μl of washed M2-affinity gel and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The samples were then washed once with solubilization buffer + 500 mm NaCl, once with solubilization buffer + 150 mm NaCl, and once with TE (Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4, 4 °C). Samples were then incubated in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 1 h at 37 °C before being resolved on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE mini-gel. The proteins from the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 30 min at 25 V. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was washed with TBST (Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20) three times and incubated with Vectastain ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. The membrane was washed with TBST four times and developed using with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). The relative intensities of biotinylated bands were determined by scanning densitometry and analysis using the software program NIH Image. Confocal Microscopy and Arrestin-GFP Translocation Assays—In order to obtain increased receptor expression in regular HEK293 cells, we excised the entire expression cassettes from the pSFD1 vector (harboring either the wild-type or mutant D1 receptors) using HindIII and SalI and subcloned them into expression vector pCMV5 (19Kim K.M.

For confocal microscopy, 3 × 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 60-mm2 culture plates, and 24 h later, each plate was transfected with 5 μg of receptor DNA and 1 μg of either arrestin2-GFP or arrestin3-GFP (gifts from Dr. Marc G. Caron). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes. Two hours prior to stimulation, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). Images were collected sequentially every 30 s after agonist stimulation with 20 μm dopamine using single line excitation (488 nm). Data Analysis—All binding assays were routinely performed in triplicate and were repeated three to four times. Cyclic AMP experiments were performed in duplicate and were repeated three to four times. Estimation of the radioligand binding parameters, KD and Bmax, as well as the EC50 values for dopamine stimulation of cAMP production were calculated using the GraphPad Prizm curve-fitting program. The curves presented throughout this paper, representing the best fits to the data, were generated using this software program as well. The relative intensities of phosphorylated bands were determined by scanning the autoradiographs and analyzing using the software program NIH Image. Expression of Wild-type and Mutated D1Receptors in HEK293T Cells—In order to identify the functionally relevant sites of phosphorylation in the D1 receptor and to determine how phosphorylation leads to arrestin association and desensitization, we created a series of mutated D1 receptor constructs. Because multiple phosphorylation sites have been mapped to both the 3rd cytoplasmic domain and carboxyl termini of most GPCRs, we decided to focus on these regions within the D1 receptor protein. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the rat D1 receptor and all of the mutated receptors used in this study. We created two mutant constructs with altered residues within the 3rd cytoplasmic domain. One of these, termed the 3rd TOTAL (3rdTOT) mutant, had all of the serine and threonine residues within the 3rd cytoplasmic loop simultaneously changed to either alanine or valine, as indicated (Fig. 1). The other mutant receptor, termed 3rd234, had only three of the serine residues in the 3rd cytoplasmic loop (Ser-256, Ser-258, and Ser-259) simultaneously mutated to alanines. We also created four truncation mutants of the carboxyl terminus (T347, T369, T394, and T404). This was accomplished by engineering stop codons such that the receptor protein was truncated at the indicated locations (Fig. 1). We initially evaluated the expression of the various receptor constructs by transiently expressing them in HEK293T cells. Fig. 2 shows a single experiment in which all of the constructs were simultaneously expressed and saturation binding isotherms constructed using [3H]SCH-23390, a radiolabeled D1 receptor antagonist. We found that all of the mutant receptors were expressed at a similar level as the wild-type receptor with the exception of the most severely truncated receptor, T347, which consistently expressed at about one-third the level of the WT construct. No difference in affinity for [3H]SCH-23390 was noted for any of the receptor constructs. We next evaluated the functional activity of the D1 receptor constructs by examining their ability to activate adenylate cyclase and raise intracellular levels of cAMP. Fig. 3 shows an experiment in which all of the receptors were simultaneously expressed, and dose-response curves for dopamine stimulation of cAMP accumulation were constructed. All of the mutant receptors were able to stimulate intracellular cAMP accumulation to the same degree as the wild-type receptor. Similarly, all of the mutant receptors, with the exception of the 3rdTOT construct, exhibited an identical potency for dopamine. The 3rdTOT receptor consistently showed an approximate 3–4-fold rightward shift in the dopamine dose-response curve. In order to establish that the transiently transfected D1 receptor will exhibit significant agonist-induced desensitization in the HEK293T cells, we performed the experiment shown in Fig."

In this study we tested whether biologically active decorin and its glycoprotein core would form dimers in solution. We used homo- and hetero-bifunctional chemical cross-linking reagents, BS3 and sulfo-SMPB, respectively, as well as glutaraldehyde and found no preferential dimer formation, whether chemical cross-linking was performed in the presence or absence of live cells. Under the same experimental conditions, we easily detected dimers of epidermal growth factor receptor and basic fibroblast growth factor, two glycoproteins known to dimerize. Only at very high cross-linker to decorin molar ratios (2000:1) were trimers and multimers observed, but performing the chemical cross-linking in the presence of a reducing agent abolished these. The elution of decorin protein core in Superose 6 gel chromatography gave masses compatible with monomeric proteins, both before and after denaturation with 2.5 m guanidine HCl. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization gave a mass of 44,077 Da for decorin protein core, without any evidence of dimers or oligomers. Extensive oligomerization of the decorin protein core was observed only after dialysis against water and freeze-drying. These oligomers were considered artifacts because they were independent of chemical cross-linking and were resistant to heat denaturation and disulfide-bond reduction. Oligomeric preparations showed markedly reduced biological activity in both phosphorylation and collagen fibrillogenesis assays. Thus, biologically active decorin is a monomer in solution and, as such, is a monovalent ligand for various extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and cell surface receptors.

This view implies that the biologically active form of decorin is a monomer in solution and thus a monovalent ligand for various extracellular matrix proteins and surface receptors. However, a recent paper (34Scott P.G. Grossmann J.G. Dodd C.M. Sheehan J.K. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18353-18359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has challenged this body of evidence by reporting that the predominant form of decorin in solution is a dimer. According to this report, the inner concave face of decorin, a structural feature that has been proposed to provide sites for protein-protein interaction in the prototype ribonuclease inhibitor (35Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) as well as other leucine-rich repeat proteins (36Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), is indeed facilitating the dimerization. In the present study, we provide several lines of evidence that decorin proteoglycan and its glycoprotein core are primarily, if not exclusively, monomers in solution. First, we purified recombinant decorin under non-denaturing conditions from the secretions of cultured human fibrosarcoma or 293 embryonic kidney cells and verified its biological activity by specific interaction with the EGFR. Second, this decorin preparation was tested in affinity chemical cross-linking reactions using several cross-linking agents of diverse functionality and bridge length, in the presence of live cells and in cell-free systems. In all cases, there was no preferential dimer formation. In contrast, we detected significant dimerization of both EGFR and FGF2, two glycoproteins known to dimerize. Only at very high cross-linker to decorin molar ratios (2000:1) were trimers and multimers observed, but these could be abolished by a reducing agent. Third, the elution of decorin protein core in Superose 6 gel chromatography gave masses compatible with the monomeric proteins, both before and after denaturation with the chaotropic agent GdnHCl. Fourth, MALDI-MS gave a mass of 44,077 Da for decorin protein core, without any evidence for dimers or oligomers. Finally, extensive oligomerization of decorin protein core was observed after dialysis against water and freeze-drying, and these preparations lost activity in phosphorylation and collagen fibrillogenesis assays. We conclude that biologically active decorin and its glycoprotein core are monomers in solution. Materials—All the chemicals unless specified were obtained from Sigma.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Decorin and Biglycan and Gel Filtration Chromatography—Recombinant decorin was produced by using either a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system or a stably transfected 293-EBNA cell line. Generation of the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the mature form of decorin (38Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol.

This system was adapted for large-scale expression using a Celligen Plus bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) packed with Fibra-Cel disks. In brief, HT-1080 cells were seeded in the bioreactor and allowed to grow to saturation. At that time, recombinant virus was added in serum-free media, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h. Serum-free media was then collected, and the recombinant polyhistidine decorin fusion protein was purified by nickel-chelating chromatography and elution with a gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, pH 8.0. Fractions containing decorin were pooled, concentrated, and desalted into PBS containing 0.2% CHAPS. The decorin-expressing 293-EBNA cell line was created by transferring the vaccinia decorin construct into the pCEP4 (Invitrogen) expression vector. After transfection, stable expressing cells were selected with hygromycin. Cells were then grown to saturation in the Celligen Plus bioreactor, and protein production was achieved by switching to serum-free culture media. Conditioned media was collected every 48 h. After concentration of the conditioned media using a Pellicon 2 Tangential Flow system (Millipore, Bedford, MA), recombinant decorin was purified as described above. Both expression systems resulted in the production of protein core and proteoglycan forms of decorin. In some experiments, protein core was separated from proteoglycan after anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and elution with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 M NaCl in PBS, 0.2% CHAPS. Protein core samples were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography before and after dialysis against water and freeze-drying. Dried proteins were resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and chromatographed on Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS with or without 2.5 m GdnHCl. Biological Activity of Decorin and Cross-linking Experiments—To assess the biological activity of our decorin and decorin protein core preparations, confluent cultures of A431 squamous carcinoma cells (40Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D. Nugent M.A. Hajnóczky G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32879-32887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were serum-starved for 16 h and incubated for various times at 37 °C with decorin or its protein core (0.5–1 μm) or EGF (16 nm)in400 μl total volume of DPBS (2.5 mm Ca2+), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-P-tyrosine, anti-EGFR, and anti-P-MAPK antibodies. Fibrillogenesis assays were done essentially as described previously (41Birk D.E. Silver F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 4 °C, stock solutions (1–2 mg ml-1) of pepsin-extracted, bovine dermal type I collagen were neutralized with 10× PBS and brought to the desired concentration with 1× PBS (15 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2). Decorin protein core was added to aliquots of the mixture at 25–50 μgml-1. The samples were transferred to the water-jacketed sample holder of a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer, and assays were performed at 37 °C. Chemical cross-linking reactions were performed in the presence of A431 cells or in cell-free experimental conditions. In the former case, cells were incubated with decorin for 30 min, and then the cross-linker sulfo-SMPB (1 mm) was added for 20–30 min at 37 °C before being quenched with 90 mm (final concentration) glycine, 9 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for 5 min. After the cross-linking reaction, 250-μl aliquots were collected and precipitated with 1.5 ml of ethanol/potassium acetate at -20 °C for 18 h. Samples were subjected to a linear gradient SDS-PAGE (3–15% (w/v) gel) with the addition of reducing agent (0.2% βME). In the cell-free experiments, chemical cross-linking was carried out in a 40-μl volume containing either decorin or decorin protein core (100–200 nm) in DPBS (2.5 mm Ca2+) in the presence or absence of 0.2% β ME. 10-μl aliquots of each serially diluted cross-linker (sulfo-SMPB, BS3, or glutaraldehyde) were added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The samples were quenched as above, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (3–15% linear gradient and 8.5% gel for decorin and its protein core, respectively) under reducing conditions. Western immunoblottings to detect decorin were carried out with specific antibodies (37Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 38Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For additional information, see the text and figure legends. MALDI-MS—Sinapinic acid (∼10 mg ml-1) in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile was used as a matrix solution. About 1 pmol of myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, or decorin protein core was added to the matrix at 1:10 ratio. After crystallization, the surfaces were washed with water, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and placed into the mass spectrometer. MALDI-MS spectra of the protein preparations were acquired in the linear mode with a Voyager Elite Reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) fitted with a 337-nm wavelength nitrogen laser essentially as described before (42Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin protein core preparations were analyzed under several different instrument conditions with several different protein concentrations and under conditions that have previously been shown to be amenable to measuring dimer formation for FGF2 (42Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biologically Active Decorin Does Not Form Dimers in Solution with Three Cross-linkers of Diverse Bridge Length and Functional Properties—Our recombinant decorin preparation, which was kept in solution at a concentration of ∼1–1.5 mg ml-1 (38Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), contained about 85% decorin proteoglycan, ∼13% protein core, and only <2% dimer/trimer, as judged by scanning densitometry on reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-3). To mimic a physiologically relevant situation, we incubated recombinant decorin in the presence of A431 cells for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with sulfo-SMPB, a water soluble, non-cleavable, heterobifunctional cross-linker. Sulfo-SMPB has an extended chain length of 14.5 Å, which limits steric hindrance, and it is reactive toward amino and sulfhydryl groups. The latter property provides hetero-bifunctionality and allows for sequential conjugations with specific groups of proteins, thereby minimizing undesirable polymerization or self-conjugation. Notably, at 1 mm sulfo-SMPB, equivalent to a 1300:1 cross-linker to decorin molar ratio, no preferential dimer formation was observed (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Only small amounts of trimers and multimers were formed as compared with control (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Under the same conditions, sulfo-SMPB was capable of cross-linking the EGF-induced EGFR dimers in A431 cells (not shown). The biological activity of decorin was independently proved by its ability to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation while inducing the phosphorylation of the MAPK for prolonged times (not shown), which is in agreement with previous results (12Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 40Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I.

In cross-linking studies, it is imperative to ensure that the chemical covalent cross-linking is an accurate reflection of specific protein-protein interactions rather than an artifact of adventitious cross-linking (42Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we performed a detailed analysis of various cross-linkers with different properties and bridge lengths. The spanning arm of a cross-linker is the length between its two reactive groups. The length affects the distance over which the reagent can establish a bond between two primary amines of closely associated proteins. We performed in vitro cell-free cross-linking experiments in which we kept the concentration of decorin constant (100 nm) while varying the cross-linker to decorin molar ratios, from 0.02 to 2000:1. In the case of sulfo-SMPB (chain length = 14.5 Å), dimers and multimers were formed only at very high molar ratios (Fig. 1B), which probably represented nonspecific polymerization of decorin and its protein core (see below). We then utilized BS3, a non-cleavable, membrane impermeable, homo-bifunctional cross-linker with a chain length of 11.4 Å and reactivity toward amino groups. In this case, we found very little aggregate formation even at 2000:1 molar ratio of cross-linker to decorin (Fig. 1C). Finally, we tested glutaraldehyde, a widely used agent which is also a lysine-specific cross-linker but has a chain length (2.85 Å) about one-quarter that of BS3. Even at 2000:1 molar ratio of cross-linker to decorin there was no preferential formation of dimers in solution (Fig. 1D). Identical results were obtained with and without physiological concentrations (1.5 mm) of Ca2+ (not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that decorin does not preferentially exist as a dimer in solution. Dimers of Decorin Protein Core Are Generated by Non-specific Disulfide Bonding and Are Induced by Freeze-drying—The previous results could have been obfuscated by the fact that dimers of decorin protein core would co-migrate with decorin monomers. To bypass this potential problem, we utilized highly purified preparations of decorin protein core and performed cross-linking experiments in the presence or absence of βME. The latter was used to eliminate the possibility of covalent oligomerization due to disulfide bond formation among the surface-exposed cysteine residues of the native protein core. Trace amounts of decorin protein core dimers were formed only with BS3 to protein molar ratios of 2000:1 (Fig. 2A), but not with glutaraldehyde. Notably, the BS3-induced dimers could be abolished by performing the cross-linking reaction in the presence of 0.2% βME (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested whether dimers of decorin protein core could be induced by prior freeze-drying, because removal of the water forces proteins to nonspecifically self-associate. We performed two sets of cross-linking experiments. In the first, protein core preparations in PBS/0.2% CHAPS were directly freeze-dried and then resuspended in the same volume as the controls. In these samples, we found an increased propensity to form dimers at lower (200:1) BS3 to protein core ratios, and a significantly higher proportion of dimers at BS3 to protein core molar ratios of 2000:1 (Fig. 2C), when compared with control samples that were not previously freeze-dried (Fig. 2A). However, all the dimers were non-specifically cross-linked due to disulfide bonding, because they were completely eliminated by performing the chemical cross-linking reaction in the presence of βME (Fig. 2C). In the second set of experiments, protein core preparations in PBS/0.2% CHAPS were extensively dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and then re-suspended in the same volume of reconstituted buffer as the controls. In these samples, we detected dimers that were not prevented by βME (Fig. 2D). Moreover, trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers of decorin protein core appeared in both reduced and unreduced samples. As a further control for our cross-linking studies, we investigated FGF2, which is known to oligomerize in solution (42Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same experimental conditions, there was a stable dimer formation at very low (0.02:1) cross-linker to FGF2 molar ratio, as expected for a protein with a propensity to self-associate (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the dimer increased proportionally to the increase in cross-linker to FGF2 molar ratios, and at 20:1 molar ratio, a trimer appeared. At higher BS3 to FGF2 molar ratios, the product became a large aggregate that did not penetrate the gel (Fig. 2E). Quantification by scanning densitometry revealed a dose-dependent increase in dimer formation (Fig. 2F). Because we used the same experimental conditions as those described above for decorin or its protein core, we conclude that the lack of detection of decorin dimers is not a failure of our cross-linking strategy but rather a lack of decorin dimers. Moreover, because the three cross-linkers with different chemical mechanisms and linker geometries yielded the same results, steric or chemical inaccessibility of cross-linking sites is unlikely. This is particularly true because the amino acid targets for all of the three cross-linkers are abundantly located along the decorin protein core. It is noteworthy that in the experimental conditions used in our study, all of the samples were heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min under reducing conditions before SDS-PAGE. Thus, the presence of insoluble complexes, which are resistant to heat denaturation/reduction and are independent of chemical cross-linking, indicate that they are artifactual products resulting from dialysis and freeze-drying. A potential problem with our recombinant decorin protein core is the presence of a His6 tag at the N terminus (38Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which could potentially interfere with dimer formation in solution. To address this issue, we digested the His6 tag with Factor Xa, which was later removed by binding to benzamidine-Sepharose. The cleavage of the His6 tag and bridge sequence was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. The latter, obtained with an Applied Biosystem Procise Sequencer, gave the predicted first nine amino acid residues of human decorin plus an initial Gly belonging to the bridge sequence (GMLEDEASGI). When this preparation was used in experiments identical to those described above, we found no dimers or oligomers using BS3 to protein ratios between 0.02:1 and 2000:1 and a constant concentration (∼300 nm) of cleaved decorin protein core (not shown). As an additional control, we tested biglycan protein core because it was shown previously to oligomerize in solution, a process further enhanced by the presence of Zn2+ (43Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that bovine articular cartilage biglycan, at concentrations >50 μg ml-1 and in the presence of 5 mm Zn2+, existed predominantly as a hexamer with a z-average molecular weight of ∼6 × 105 (43Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H."
https://openalex.org/W2109282318,"ADAR2 is a double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase involved in the editing of mammalian RNAs by the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine. We have demonstrated previously that ADAR2 can modify its own pre-mRNA, leading to the creation of a proximal 3′-splice junction containing a non-canonical adenosine-inosine (A-I) dinucleotide. Alternative splicing to this proximal acceptor shifts the reading frame of the mature mRNA transcript, resulting in the loss of functional ADAR2 expression. Both evolutionary sequence conservation and mutational analysis support the existence of an extended RNA duplex within the ADAR2 pre-mRNA formed by base-pairing interactions between regions ∼1.3-kilobases apart in intron 4 and exon 5. Characterization of ADAR2 pre-mRNA transcripts isolated from adult rat brain identified 16 editing sites within this duplex region, and sites preferentially modified by ADAR1 and ADAR2 have been defined using both tissue culture and in vitro editing systems. Statistical analysis of nucleotide sequences surrounding edited and non-edited adenosine residues have identified a nucleotide sequence bias correlating with ADAR2 site preference and editing efficiency. Among a mixed population of ADAR substrates, ADAR2 preferentially favors its own transcript, yet mutation of a poor substrate to conform to the defined nucleotide bias increases the ability of that substrate to be modified by ADAR2. These data suggest that both sequence and structural elements are required to define adenosine moieties targeted for specific ADAR2-mediated deamination.

These data suggest that both sequence and structural elements are required to define adenosine moieties targeted for specific ADAR2-mediated deamination. The conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) by RNA editing is catalyzed by hydrolytic deamination (1Polson A.G. Crain P.F. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Bass B.L.

RNA. 1997; 3: 947-949PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific enzymes that contain variable N termini, multiple copies of a dsRNA-binding motif (DRBM) and conserved C-terminal sequences encoding a catalytic adenosine deaminase domain (2Bass B.L.

Two enzymes in this family, ADAR1 and ADAR2, have been shown to be involved in the site-selective deamination of adenosines within multiple RNA transcripts (2Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 4Rueter S. Emeson R. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 343-361Google Scholar), yet the basis for their distinct, but overlapping, specificities at particular adenosine moieties is not well understood (6Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R.

The DRBMs of ADAR1 and ADAR2 are similar to the domains that mediate dsRNA interactions in a large variety of proteins, including dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, Drosophila staufen and Escherichia coli RNase III (8St Johnston D.

Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Previous studies of A-to-I editing have revealed that an RNA duplex interrupted by single-strand bulges and loops is critical for site-specific A-to-I conversion (2Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 5Schaub M. Keller W. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Gott J.M. Emeson R.B.

This imperfect duplex structure is generally formed by intramolecular base-pairing interactions between exon and intron sequences in pre-mRNA transcripts that can be in close proximity to one another or as many as 1700 nucleotides (nt) apart (14Burns C.M.

It has been proposed that selective binding of the RNA by the DRBM, as well as complementarity between the RNA structure surrounding the targeted adenosine and the catalytic domain, may determine the adenosine(s) that are selectively modified in vivo (19Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Stephens O.M. Beal P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37827-37833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While there is no discrete sequence motif common among substrates to direct the deamination of specific adenosine residues, distinct 5′-nearest neighbor sequence preferences have been identified for both ADAR1 (U = A > C > G) and ADAR2 (U = A > C = G) using in vitro editing assays with artificial RNA duplexes and a 3′-nearest neighbor preference for ADAR2 has also been suggested (U = G > C = A) (7Lehmann K.A. Bass B.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12875-12884Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). While up to 50% of the adenosine residues within a perfect RNA duplex may be modified by ADAR1 and ADAR2 in vitro, RNA substrates whose duplex structures are interrupted by mismatches, bulges and loops are edited more selectively (20Nishikura K. Yoo C. Kim U. Murray J.M. Estes P.A. Cash F.E. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3523-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Polson A.G. Bass B.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5701-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies with synthetic RNA substrates have indicated that internal loops within ADAR substrates may serve to uncouple adjacent helices to convert long, promiscuously deaminated substrates into a series of short, selectively modified RNA targets (22Lehmann K.A. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Previous studies have demonstrated that ADAR2 edits a specific adenosine moiety within intron 4 (also referred to as intron 1, Ref. 23Slavov D. Gardiner K. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of its own pre-mRNA to generate a non-canonical 3′-splice acceptor containing an adenosine-inosine dinucleotide that effectively mimics the highly conserved AG sequence normally found at 3′-splice junctions (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Splicing to this proximal acceptor site (site -1) alters the reading frame of the ADAR2 mRNA and results in loss of expression for the catalytically active 78 kDa protein, suggesting that autoediting may represent a negative feedback loop by which ADAR2 can modulate its own level of protein expression (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Further support for this model was recently reported by Maas et al. (24Maas S. Patt S. Schrey M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) in which a direct and specific correlation between ADAR2 activity and the extent of autoediting at the -1 position was observed. A-to-I editing has also been identified in mRNAs encoding Drosophila ADAR (dADAR) at a conserved residue of the catalytic domain, suggesting a common paradigm for ADAR regulation by autoediting (25Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1004-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Like all characterized ADAR substrates, ADAR2 pre-mRNA is predicted to form an RNA duplex as a result of intramolecular base pairing between two halves of an imperfect inverted repeat (-1512 to -1416 and -61 to +34, relative to the proximal 3′-splice site) (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 23Slavov D. Gardiner K. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In this study, we report that nucleotide sequence conservation between five vertebrate ADAR2 pre-mRNAs supports the base-pairing features underlying the predicted RNA secondary structure and we identify a total of 16 editing sites within ADAR2 pre-mRNA transcripts isolated from adult rat brain. The effects of mutations designed to disrupt base-pairing interactions were consistent with local structures surrounding editing sites and further suggested a model of two independent ADAR2 editing domains separated by a large internal loop. Competition analyses with mutant RNAs revealed that ADAR2 preferentially modifies its own pre-mRNA (site -1) based upon sequence/structure information contained immediately surrounding this region of the duplex. These findings correlate with increased evolutionary sequence conservation surrounding site -1 and suggest that ADAR2 is specifically targeted to the region of the alternate 3′-splice acceptor. Analysis of sequences surrounding fourteen ADAR2 sites within the ADAR2 pre-mRNA revealed a significant nucleotide bias at eight positions and three of these positions coincided with increased levels of editing in vitro. Furthermore, the ability of natural ADAR2 substrates to compete for ADAR2 editing (site -1) correlated with their conformity to this nucleotide bias, suggesting that both a consensus sequence and structural elements are required to define the preference and efficiency of ADAR2-mediated deamination.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnalysis of ADAR2 Secondary Structure and Nucleotide Distribution—The secondary structure of rat ADAR2 pre-mRNA, in a region encompassing previously identified A-to-I editing events (-1668 to +200 relative to the proximal 3′-splice site) (16Rueter S.M.

Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), mouse (accession no. AF411054), and pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) (accession nos. AF124050 and AF124049) were aligned using the Megalign program of the DNASTAR software suite (DNASTAR, Inc.). To identify potential nucleotide preferences in sequences surrounding ADAR2 editing sites, the distribution of sequence information was analyzed surrounding 14 adenosine moieties that were edited by ADAR2 in vitro (Table I). Forty nucleotides flanking each edited adenosine were manually aligned and the nucleotide distribution, purine/pyrimidine ratio and GC content at each position were determined. This information was then compared by a χ2-test of independence to the nucleotide distribution observed at equivalent positions for all 50 non-edited adenosines in the predicted region of the ADAR2 duplex. Positions at which the χ2-analysis indicated a nucleotide preference (p < 0.05) were considered statistically significant.Table IEditing frequency in rADAR2 pre-mRNA* Brackets indicate sites in which editing events were linked according to a χ2-test of independence. nd, not determined. Open table in a new tab Tissue Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transiently co-transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (29Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) with rat ADAR1a (rADAR1a) or rat ADAR2b (rADAR2b) cDNAs containing an N-terminal epitope (FLAG) tag in the presence of a 3606-nt rADAR2 minigene, a 3360-nt rADAR2 minigene, or a control eukaryotic expression vector (pRC-CMV; Invitrogen) (Fig. 3). Crude nuclear extracts and total RNA were prepared ∼60 h post-transfection, as previously described (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Expression levels of ADAR proteins in crude nuclear extracts from transfected cells were monitored by Western blotting analysis (29Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by secondary antisera conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch). The secondary antibody was detected using the SuperSignal West Dura Extended chemiluminescence reaction kit (Pierce, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence was monitored using the Bio-Rad image detection system and quantitation was performed using Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad) on serially diluted samples that fell within the linear range of detection.Quantification of RNA Editing—To quantify the editing of ADAR2 transcripts in RNAs isolated from rat brain or transiently transfected HEK293 cells, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3-5 μg of total RNA, amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and assessed by either direct DNA sequencing of individual cDNA isolates subcloned into pBKSII- (Stratagene) or by a modified primer-extension analysis (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of site -1 was performed as previously described (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For site -1428, primer-extension was performed using a sense primer (5′-CTTTGTCAGCTGGGAG-3′) in the presence of 1.2 mm dATP, 1.2 mm dCTP, 1.2 mm dTTP, and 5 mm ddGTP. Site -1476 editing was measured by extension of an antisense primer (5′-TCTTTTGCTGGAGGATG-3′) in the presence of 1.2 mm dATP, 1.2 mm dCTP, 1.2 mm dGTP and 5 mm ddTTP. Analysis of editing site concurrence was determined by direct sequence analysis of 100 independent rat brain ADAR2 cDNA clones, extending the full-length of the predicted duplex, and assessed by a χ2-test of independence.Site-directed Mutagenesis—ADAR2 intron 4 mutations were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed site mutagenesis in pBSKII- (Stratagene) as described (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides to introduce restriction site-based mutations.In Vitro Transcription of RNA Substrates—All RNA substrates were synthesized in vitro using the Megascript T7 RNA transcription kit (Ambion). To determine RNA concentrations, RNA synthesis was performed in the presence of [α-32P] adenosine 5′-triphosphate as a trace label (final specific activity = 6 × 105 cpm/mmole UTP); RNA was precipitated with 2-propyl alcohol and quantified by scintillation spectrometry. The ADAR2 substrate was synthesized from an 873 bp template linearized at an FspI restriction site, while ADAR2 competitor RNA was transcribed from the 257-bp template linearized at ApaI (Fig. 2A). A PCR fragment containing the R/G duplex sequence was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the synthetic oligonucleotide primers (5′-ACACCTAAAGGATCCTCATTAAGG-3′) and (5′-TAAGAGTCTTAAAGACACATCAGGG-3′), and cloned into pBSKII- (Stratagene). This construct was linearized at an EcoRI restriction site and used as template for R/G competitor RNA synthesis. 5-HT2CR competitor RNA was transcribed from a 288-bp genomic DNA fragment as previously described (14Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense strands of the nonspecific dsRNA substrate were synthesized separately from a fragment of the rat α2-adrenergic receptor and the single-stranded RNAs were annealed as described (31Rueter S.M. Burns C.M. Coode S.A. Mookherjee P. Emeson R.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to generate the nonspecific duplex substrate.Fig. 2In vitro time course analysis of ADAR2 editing.A, schematic diagram is presented indicating the structure of ADAR2 genomic fragments (3606- and 3360-nt minigenes) used for transfection studies and corresponding 704 and 232 nt transcripts used for in vitro editing analysis; the position of exon and intron sequences are indicated by closed boxes and solid lines, respectively, while dashed lines indicate sequence information deleted from the in vitro transcripts. The position of the imperfect inverted repeat, predicted to form an extended RNA duplex (see Fig. 1), is designated with arrows; the specific coordinates of the inverted repeat and sequences included in the in vitro substrates are indicated relative to the proximal 3′-splice site.

The FLAG-rADAR2b cDNA (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Pichia pastoris pPIC3.5K vector, introduced into the GS115 yeast strain by electroporation and selected in 3 mg/ml neomycin; yeast cell lysates were prepared at 4 °C per manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 100 ml breaking buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), homogenized with glass beads by 20 cycles of vortexing for 30 s and clarified by high speed centrifugation. The supernatant was then exchanged into standard purification buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT + 10% glycerol). Recombinant FLAG-rADAR2b protein was purified from 100 ml of supernatant using a protocol modified from O'Connell et al. (32O'Connell M.A. Gerber A. Keegan L.P. Methods. 1998; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for the purification of human ADAR2 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Recombinant proteins were first resolved by SP-Sepharose cation exchange followed by Source Q anion exchange fast-performance liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). For the 25-ml SP-Sepharose column, proteins were eluted in 240 ml of purification buffer over a gradient of 100-500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were then resolved on a 1-ml Source Q column over a gradient of 50-500 mm NaCl in a volume of 35 ml of buffer. FLAG-rADAR2b peak fractions, as assessed by Western blotting analysis, eluted between 280 and 350 mm NaCl. Finally, the recombinant protein was purified by Poly(I)*-Poly(C)* dsRNA affinity chromatography as described (32O'Connell M.A. Gerber A. Keegan L.P. Methods. 1998; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and dialyzed into standard purification buffer containing 0.05% Igepal and 50% glycerol.The peak fraction of FLAG-rADAR2b was purified to near homogeneity according to silver staining and Western blotting analysis using the M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). The peak fraction of FLAG-rADAR2b was serially diluted in the presence of 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and resolved by SDS-PAGE alongside BSA standards of known concentration. The protein concentration was then quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager by comparing the density of the ADAR2 band to the BSA standard curve.In Vitro Editing/Deamination assays—Editing assays were performed under single turnover conditions at 37 °C with 7.5 nm FLAG-rADAR2b protein and 0.3 nmin vitro transcribed RNA as substrate in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, 100 μg/ml RNase-free BSA, 0.003% Igepal, and 0.8 units of RNasin/μl. Reactions were stopped by addition of Proteinase K, SDS and EDTA as described previously (33Hough R.F. Bass B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the editing of ADAR2 at site -1, first-strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the unique 3′-extension of the ADAR2 RNA substrate that was not present in competitor RNAs. First-strand cDNA was amplified by PCR and the extent of editing was quantified by primer-extension analysis as described (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Apparent Km values were measured for ADAR2, 5-HT2CR and R/G duplex substrates by assessing the A-to-I conversion at 5 min over a concentration range of 0-316 nm RNA by primer-extension analysis. Primer extension of 5-HT2CR transcripts was performed as previously reported (14Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). For the R/G site, extension proceeded using an antisense primer (5′-GTTATAC TATTCCACCC-3′) in the presence of 1.2 mm dATP, 1.2 mm dCTP, 1.2 mm dGTP, and 5 mm ddTTP. For competition studies, the editing of 0.3 nm ADAR2 (site -1) was assessed in the presence of competitor at concentrations ranging from 10-13m to 10-5m RNA.RESULTSPredicted Secondary Structure for ADAR2 pre-mRNA—We demonstrated previously that intronic sequences critical for ADAR2 pre-mRNA editing (site -1) were contained between -1668 and -1154, relative to the proximal 3′-splice site (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Further analysis of ADAR2 pre-mRNA sequences using RNA-folding algorithms (26Zuker M.

Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic, 1999: 11-43Google Scholar) identified an imperfect inverted repeat that formed a putative RNA duplex as a result of base-pairing interactions between a portion of this critical upstream region and the 3′-end of the intron (Fig. 1). Comparisons of ADAR2 genomic sequences between rat, mouse, human, and pufferfish revealed >90% intronic sequence conservation in the predicted region of the inverted repeats (Fig. 1), with a majority of the nucleotide differences clustered in predicted bulge regions within the duplex. Furthermore, 100% sequence identity was maintained in both halves of the inverted repeat for a region extending 18-nt upstream and 16-nt downstream from the edited splice junction (site -1) (Fig. 1), suggesting that the structure of this region is conserved to maintain ADAR2 autoediting among multiple vertebrate species (23Slavov D. Gardiner K. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Predicted secondary structure and evolutionary conservation of ADAR2 pre-mRNA sequence in the region of major A-to-I editing modifications. The nucleotide sequence and predicted RNA secondary structure for the rat ADAR2 pre-mRNA is presented showing the positions of 16 editing sites identified in ADAR2 pre-mRNA transcripts isolated from adult rat brain; coordinates of the editing sites are relative to the proximal 3′-splice junction in intron 4 (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and the number of nucleotides omitted from the figure is indicated in the loop. Comparisons of evolutionary sequence conservation between human, rat, mouse and two pufferfish ADAR2 genes are presented in which the percentage of species demonstrating 75-100% (black), 25-50% (green), and 0% (red) sequence identity to the rat ADAR2 gene are indicated by colored lettering. The shaded box denotes a region of the predicted RNA duplex where 100% sequence identity has been maintained in all five vertebrate ADAR2 genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Editing Sites within ADAR2 pre-mRNA Transcripts—In addition to the ADAR2 editing event responsible for generating a proximal 3′-splice site within intron 4 (site -1), four additional A-to-I modifications were observed previously at positions -2, +10, +23 and +24 (relative to the proximal 3′-splice site) (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). To further examine editing events within the predicted rADAR2 duplex, sequence comparisons of rat ADAR2 genomic DNA and adult rat brain cDNA clones, generated from RT-PCR amplification of ADAR2 pre-mRNA, were performed to identify additional A-to-G discrepancies. In total, 16 RNA editing sites were identified (Fig. 1) and the frequency of editing at each position was quantified (Table I); nucleotide discrepancies that were observed in less than 5% of the isolated cDNA clones were not considered for subsequent analysis. In addition to the five editing sites previously identified within the ADAR2 duplex (16Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), three additional sites were observed in the 3′-portion of the inverted repeat (positions -4, -27, and -28) and eight sites in the 5′-half of the duplex.

The topological arrangement is not known, but a leucine heptad repeat in transmembrane domain (TM) 2 and a glycophorin-like motif in TM6 have been proposed to stabilize the oligomer. To determine the topology, we generated versions of the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) that carried cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins at their amino and/or carboxyl terminus. Appropriate pairs were coexpressed to measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Donor photobleaching FRET microscopy was employed to deduce the following arrangement: within the monomer, the amino and carboxyl termini are in close vicinity. In addition, in the oligomer, the carboxyl termini are closer to each other than the amino termini. Hence, a separate interaction domain (i.e. distinct from TM2 and TM6) must reside in the carboxyl-terminal half of hSERT. This was confirmed by expressing the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of hSERT. These were retained intracellularly; they also retained the coexpressed full-length transporter by forming export-deficient oligomers and, when cotransfected in all possible combinations, supported FRET. Hence, both the carboxyl and amino termini contain elements that drive oligomerization. By employing fragments comprising two neighboring TM helices, we unequivocally identified TM11/12 as a new contact site by donor photobleaching FRET and β-lactamase protein fragment complementation assay. TM1/2 was also found to self-associate. Thus, oligomerization of hSERT involves at least two discontinuous interfaces. The currently identified interaction sites drive homophilic interactions.

SERT is of clinical relevance because it is the target of antidepressants. It is also the site of action for drugs of abuse, viz. ecstasy (methylenedioxymetamphetamine) and its congeners; these compounds release serotonin because they induce reverse transport (1Scholze P. Zwach J. Kattinger A. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 870-878PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic core of SERT consists of 12 transmembrane domains (TMs); this structural feature is shared by all neurotransmitter transporters and by many other transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein-like efflux pumps) and membrane proteins (e.g. mammalian isoforms of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase). Several Na+/Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters have been shown to form constitutive oligomers in the plasma membrane (2Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H.

Although the precise biological role of oligomerization remains enigmatic, there are many arguments that support the conjecture that oligomer formation is a prerequisite for export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (reviewed in Ref. 9Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The topological arrangements of the 12 TM helices is not known; in the recently solved structure of two distantly related bacterial transporters, the first six TM helices and the carboxyl-terminal six helices are arranged in two pseudosymmetrical lobes around the central pore (10Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 11Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The connecting loops that connect the TM helices are substantially shorter in human SERT (hSERT) than in the bacterial transporters. Thus, it is likely that the topology of the hydrophobic core differs substantially in hSERT. However, it is reasonable to predict that the 12 TM helices are arranged in a ring-like structure around a central substrate-binding cavity. The ring-like structure ought to allow for a number of contacts between individual transporter monomers. In a dimeric arrangement, a self-limiting structure is achieved by a symmetric interface, i.e. via homophilic interactions. However, in all other instances (e.g. trimers or tetramers), there must be more than one interface, and these contact sites must represent, at least in part, interactions between distinct segments, i.e. heterophilic interactions (12Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this work, we have examined these predictions by generating several tagged versions of hSERT. This allowed us to confirm the close proximity of amino and carboxyl termini. In addition, we identified at least two discontinuous contact sites that support homophilic interactions. Based on these observations, we propose that SERT may have the propensity to form an array-like structure in the membrane. Construction of Fluorescently Tagged hSERT and hSERT Fragments—We used plasmids pECFP-N1/pEYFP-N1 and pECFP-C1/ pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) to drive expression of the fluorescent full-length transporter and fragments thereof in mammalian cells. YFP/CFP-hSERT (hSERT Met1–Val630 carrying YFP or CFP at its amino terminus) has been described previously (3Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol.

PCR 2Primer sequences are available upon request. was employed to generate the following additional constructs (see also Fig. 1A for an overview): hSERT-YFP/CFP (hSERT Met1–Val630 fused to YFP or CFP at its carboxyl terminus) and CFP-hSERT-YFP (hSERT Met1–Val630 carrying CFP at its amino terminus and YFP at its carboxyl terminus). Severing the double-tagged hSERT in the middle yielded two constructs: YFP/CFP-hSERT-N-term (hSERT Met1–Asn356 with amino-terminal YFP or CFP) comprising TM1–6 and hSERT-C-term-YFP/CFP (hSERT Cys357–Val630 with carboxyl-terminal YFP or CFP) comprising TM7–12. YFP-labeled fragments were created that comprised two neighboring TM helices: YFP-hSERT-TM1/2 (hSERT Met1–Ile150), YFP-hSERT-TM3/4 (hSERT Trp151–Gly278), YFP-hSERT-TM5/6 (hSERT Lys275–Asn357), YFP-hSERT-TM7/8 (hSERT Cys357–Leu451), YFP-hSERT-TM 9/10 (hSERT Asp452–Arg523), and hSERT-TM11/12-YFP (hSERT Lys526–Val630). The integrity of each engineered construct was verified by fluorescent sequencing. Cell Transfection, Uptake Experiments, and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Microscopy—The conditions for cell culture and the uptake experiments have been described in detail elsewhere (3Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate method was used for transient transfection. Donor photobleaching FRET microscopy was performed as described previously (10Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). To measure donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP), we acquired a donor (CFP) image before (Ib) and after (Ia) photobleaching using the YFP setting for 90 s (excitation = 500 nm, dichroic mirror = 525 nm, and emission = 535 nm). DRAP was quantified by FRET efficiency (E) as described by Miyawaki and Tsien (14Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) according to the following equation: E = (Ia – Ib)/Ia. Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding—Cells were detached mechanically, lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle, and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 300 mm sucrose. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min (10Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]β-CIT (specific activity of ∼50 Ci/mmol; Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom) was determined in a final volume of 40 μl containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, cell membranes (10 μg for full-length SERT constructs and 50 μg for the severed transporters), and concentrations of [3H]β-CIT ranging from 0.25 to 10 nm. The reaction was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm paroxetine and was <10% of total binding in the KD range for full-length constructs. Bound and free radioligands were separated by filtration over glass-fiber filters. β-Lactamase Protein Fragment Complementation Assay—For the β-lactamase protein fragment complementation assay, we used plasmids pcDNA3.1-Zeo+/F[I]m182T and pcDNA3.1-Zeo+/F[II] to drive the expression of proteins fused to β-lactamase fragments F[I] and F[II] (15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Constructs of hSERT that comprised two neighboring TM helices were generated by PCR 2Primer sequences are available upon request.: F[I]-TM1/2 and F[II]-TM1/2 (hSERT Gly83–Gly146), F[I]-TM5/6 and F[II]-TM5/6 (hSERT Val274–Asn356), and F[I]- and F[II]-TM11/12 (hSERT Phe536–Thr600). Cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids using LipofectAMINE. After 24–48 h, cells were detached mechanically, lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, and pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The membrane suspension (20-μl aliquot) was incubated in the presence of 100 μm nitrocefin in phosphate-buffered saline in a total volume of 200 μl for 45 min at 37 °C. Absorption at 492 nm was measured using an automated plate reader. Characterization of Tagged hSERT and Half-molecules— The topology of neurotransmitter transporters is not known; and in particular, it is not clear how individual monomers assemble into the oligomeric structure that resides in the plasma membrane. Previous experiments showed that, when tagged with fluorescent proteins, the amino termini of hSERT are close enough to support FRET. Resonance energy transfer is exquisitely sensitive to variation in distance, with energy transfer declining with the sixth power of distance. We therefore generated additional fusion proteins comprising hSERT and the spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein, CFP and YFP. Fig. 1A shows a schematic rendering of the hSERT constructs that were employed. We ruled out that the position of the fluorescent protein tag interfered with hSERT function: the Km for inward transport of the substrate was comparable regardless of whether the fluorescent protein was attached to the amino terminus (CFP-hSERT; Km = 1.5 ± 0.7 μm, n = 3) (Fig. 1B, closed squares), the carboxyl terminus (hSERT-CFP; Km = 2.5 ± 0.8 μm, n = 3) (inverted closed triangles), or both (CFP-hSERT-YFP; Km = 1.5 ± 0.6 μm; n = 3) (closed circles). The Km determined in parallel for the transiently expressed untagged wild-type hSERT protein (Fig. 1B, open triangles) was 2.6 ± 0.6 μm (n = 3). Differences in the maximum velocity of uptake (Vmax) can be accounted for by variations in expression levels. This can be gauged from the saturation experiment depicted in Fig. 1C, where differences in Bmax levels essentially reflect the variability in the velocity of uptake (Fig. 1, compare B and C). The affinity of the inhibitor β-CIT for the tagged full-length transporters was virtually identical (KD = 1.2 ± 0.2, 1.5 ± 0.3, 2.1 ± 1.7, and 1.3 ± 0.2 nm for CFP-hSERT-YFP, CFP-hSERT, hSERT-CFP, and hSERT, respectively; n = 3). In contrast, if SERT was severed, the resulting half-molecules failed to transport substrate and to bind the inhibitor regardless of whether the amino-terminal (Fig. 1B, open circles) and carboxyl-terminal (open squares) fragments were expressed alone or in combination (Fig. 1, B and C, closed diamonds). Segments of the amino and carboxyl termini are thought to support the interaction of hSERT (16Jess U. El Far O. Kirsch J. Betz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and related transporters such as the γ-aminobutyric acid (17Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J.

We therefore verified that the presence of the fluorescent tag did not interfere with insertion of SERT into the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 1D, provided that hSERT was expressed as a full-length protein, it was efficiently inserted into the plasma membrane regardless of whether the fluorescent protein was fused to the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus, or both. This was also seen upon expression in differentiated PC12 cells, where all full-length versions of hSERT were efficiently transported to the extending neurite (data not shown). In contrast, the severed half-transporters that comprised only the amino- or carboxyl-terminal six TM segments (CFP-hSERT-N-term and hSERT-C-term-CFP) were invariably retained within the cell (Fig. 1D). This intracellular retention was not overcome by coexpression of the half-molecules (data not shown). Finally, we also verified that the presence of a YFP moiety did not affect 5-HT transport by hSERT (Km = 0.9 ± 0.2 μm for YFP-hSERT, and Km = 1.1 ± 0.3 μm for hSERT-YFP), inhibitor binding, and subcellular localization (data not shown in Fig. 1). FRET Microscopy with Amino- and Carboxyl-terminally Tagged Versions of hSERT—There are several ways to assess resonance energy transfer. Previously, we employed two methods, viz. ratio imaging, and determination of fluorescence decay after donor photobleaching, to demonstrate that YFP-hSERT and CFP-hSERT formed a constitutive oligomer (2Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the present study, we relied primarily on measuring the decay lifetimes after donor photobleaching because this allows for a statistical comparison provided that the number of measurements is large enough (and provided that the measurements are done in parallel to account for inherent variations in lamp intensity). The serpentine diagram depicted in Fig. 1A is misleading, for it suggests a maximum distance between the amino and carboxyl termini. However, the transporter has to provide for a pore, i.e. a hydrophilic channel, which allows for TM permeation of the substrate and the cotransported ions. Thus, it is more plausible that the helices arrange in a ring-like structure in which amino and carboxyl termini are in close vicinity. Accordingly, the decay of fluorescence was substantially slower in the double-tagged CFP-hSERT-YFP than in the coexpressed pair CFP-hSERT/hSERT-YFP (Fig. 2, A–C). The addition of substrates or inhibitors did not result in any appreciable change of energy transfer (data not shown). Donor photobleaching FRET microscopy relies on the fact that energy transfer to the acceptor protects the donor against bleaching. For a given pair of FRET fluorophores (e.g. CFP and YFP), the protection (and hence, the increase in the decay lifetime) depends on the distance between acceptor and donor and on their relative orientation. Based on the data shown in Fig. 2C, the carboxyl and amino termini are more closely associated than the amino termini. However, it is obviously not possible to differentiate between intra- and intermolecular energy transfer in CFP-hSERT-YFP. To assess the contribution of intermolecular energy transfer, we determined fluorescence decay lifetimes for the combination YFP-hSERT and hSERT-CFP and, as an internal control, the reverse pair, CFP-hSERT and hSERT-YFP. As shown in Fig. 2C, the lifetimes for these two pairs were virtually identical and shorter than for the double-tagged CFP-hSERT-YFP. This indicates that the intramolecular distance between amino and carboxyl termini is smaller than the intermolecular distance. On the other hand, the lifetimes obtained for the pairs of amino- and carboxyl-terminally tagged transporters (e.g. YFP-hSERT and hSERT-CFP) were longer than that obtained for the combination in which both donor and acceptor resided on the amino terminus (i.e. YFP-hSERT and CFP-hSERT). Finally, we tested a pair of carboxyl-terminally tagged transporters. The lifetime determined for this combination again exceeded that of the amino-terminally tagged transporters. FRET is exquisitely sensitive to the distance of the fluorophore, i.e. it declines with the sixth power of the distance; in addition, resonance energy transfer is affected by the orientation of the fluorophores (22Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4910) Google Scholar, 23Schmid J.A. Sitte H.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The observations indicated that the intermolecular distance between the carboxyl termini was smaller than that of the amino termini. Alternatively, and less likely, the relative orientation of the dipoles may have been more favorable if the two fluorophores were attached to the carboxyl termini rather than to the amino termini or to each an amino and a carboxyl terminus. However, the interpretation of the differences in lifetimes relies on the assumption that the amount of acceptor fluorophore is not limiting in the vicinity of the donor. In transient transfection, expression levels vary widely from cell to cell. The data displayed in Fig. 2C were obtained by selecting for cells that displayed bright acceptor fluorescence. In addition, we also carried out a separate series of experiments in which the ratio of plasmid encoding the donor and that encoding the acceptor was varied between 1:1 and 1:4 (using the combinations CFP-hSERT + YFP-hSERT, CFP-hSERT + hSERT-YFP, and hSERT-CFP + hSERT-YFP), and resonance energy transfer was determined by DRAP. There was not any appreciable difference in resonance energy transfer if the amount of plasmid encoding the acceptor was increased 4-fold (shown in Fig. 2D for the combination CFP-hSERT + YFP-hSERT). The DRAP experiment also confirmed that FRET efficiency was higher with the carboxyl-terminally tagged combination (hSERT-CFP + hSERT-YFP) than if the fluorophores were attached to the amino termini (CFP-hSERT + hSERT-YFP) (Fig. 2D). The double-tagged transporter (CFP-hSERT-YFP) showed the highest FRET efficiency (p < 0.001). Oligomer Formation by Half-molecules—The intracellular carboxyl terminus of hSERT comprises 35 amino acids, which may provide for a flexible tether of the fluorescent protein tag. Hence, the short intermolecular distance between the carboxyl termini does not necessarily indicate that the carboxyl-terminal TM segments support any association in the oligomer. We therefore engineered constructs that allowed for the expression of half-molecules to test if the carboxyl-terminal half of hSERT supports self-association. These half-transporters were retained within the cell (Fig. 1D). Nevertheless, donor photobleaching experiments showed that they were capable of self-association. This was true for the combination CFP-hSERT-N-term + YFP-hSERT-N-term as well as for hSERT-C-term-CFP + hSERT-C-term-YFP (Fig. 2C). In cells expressing the donor alone (CFP-hSERT-N-term), the lifetime of fluorescence decay was 19.1 ± 1.2 s (n = 42). Coexpression of CFP- and YFP-labeled amino-terminal halves increased it to 21.9 ± 1.2 s (n = 30) (CFP-hSERT-N-term + YFP-hSERT-N-term) and to 25.3 ± 2.6 s (n = 25) (hSERT-C-term-CFP + hSERT-C-term-YFP) for the carboxyl-terminal halves. These values are significantly different from the reference based on analysis of variance and Scheffé's post hoc test (p < 0.05). Expression of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves together prolonged the lifetime to 23.5 ± 2.3 s (n = 22) (CFP-hSERT-N-term + hSERT-C-term-YFP) and to 24.4 ± 2.3 s (n = 31) (hSERT-C-term-CFP + YFP-hSERT-N-term). Thus, the amino-terminal half interacts with the carboxyl-terminal half in intracellular membrane compartments; this interaction is not strong enough to reconstitute a functional transporter (Fig. 1, B and C) that is able to overcome intracellular retention. Based on these data, we conclude that hSERT has to contain more than one domain important for oligomerization, viz. at least one each in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the transporter. Oligomer formation is required for efficient export of transporters from the ER, and point mutations that suppress oligomerization result in intracellular retention (9Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the half-molecules of hSERT do form oligomers, these are retained in intracellular compartments. This presumably arises from the disruption of ER export signals that are formed by discontinuous segments. Regardless of the underlying basis, the intracellular retention can be exploited as an interaction assay. We therefore coexpressed YFP-tagged full-length hSERT and the CFP-tagged half-molecules. This allows each molecule to be visualized individually, viz. the intracellularly retained half-molecule with the CFP filter (Fig. 3, B and D) and the fate of the full-length transporter with the YFP filter set (Fig. 3, A and B); in addition, we used limiting amounts of the plasmid driving expression of the half-molecule. This resulted in a mixture of cells that expressed both full-length and severed transporters and exclusively full-length hSERT; the latter cells served as an internal control. In cells that expressed either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal half-molecule and the full-length transporter, hSERT was retained within the cell. In contrast, in cells that expressed only the full-length transporter, hSERT was efficiently inserted into the plasma membrane (YFP filter) (Fig. 3, A and C). Obviously, only those transporters that are inserted into the plasma membrane support uptake of substrate. Thus, the retention of hSERT by the half-molecules can also be quantified as the average effect on the uptake of [3H]5-HT by a transiently transfected cell population. HEK293 cells were therefore transfected with a constant amount of plasmid DNA encoding full-length hSERT, increasing amounts of DNA encoding the half-molecules, and empty plasmid to keep the total amount of DNA constant. The uptake of [3H]5-HT was progressively reduced as the expression of the amino-terminal (Fig. 3E, closed circles) and carboxyl-terminal (open triangles) half-molecules was forced by raising the amount of cognate plasmid DNA. We noted that inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake was observed over a reasonably comparable range of plasmid DNA. However, it is self-evident that quantitative interpretations are limited by the fact that the amount of protein produced per μg of plasmid DNA may vary considerably. Aggregated fragments may have caused nonspecific retention of the full-length transporter in the ER. This was ruled out by coexpressing the human dopamine D2 receptor tagged at its carboxyl terminus with CFP (hD2-CFP) and either of the YFP-labeled half-molecules of hSERT in HEK293 cells. Neither the amino-terminal (YFP-hSERT-N-term) (Fig. 3G) nor the carboxyl-terminal (hSERT-C-term-YFP) (Fig. 3I) half of hSERT caused accumulation of the receptor within the cell (CFP filter) (Fig. 3, F and H) to an extent that exceeded retention in the absence of half-molecules (data not shown). The extent of retention of hD2-CFP in cells expressing both constructs was also quantified by having a blinded observer score a random selection of transfected cells for intracellular retention: CFP-hD2 + YFP-hSERT-N-term, 16%; and CFP-hD2 + hSERT-C-term-YFP, 10%. This extent of intracellular retention was also observed in cells transfected with the receptor alone. Discontinuous Nature of the Oligomeric Interface—Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal half of hSERT contributes an interface to oligomer formation. We generated fragments that comprised two neighboring TM segments of hSERT and YFP: YFP-hSERT-TM1/2, -TM3/4, -TM5/6, -TM7/8, and -TM9/10 and hSERT-TM11/12-YFP. Upon expression in HEK293 cells, they were not delivered to the plasma membrane. Hence, it was possible to exploit intracellular retention of CFP-tagged hSERT by each fragment as an assay to determine which fragment interacted with the full-length transporter. Fig. 4A shows the fluorescence micrographs (using YFP and CFP filter sets) of cells expressing individual YFP-tagged fragments and the CFP-tagged full-length transporter. When expressed in the same cell, constructs comprising TM1/2, TM5/6, and TM11/12 prevented full-length hSERT from being correctly inserted into the plasma membrane. In contrast, the other fragments (TM3/4, TM7/8, and TM9/10) failed to retain the full-length transporter. The extent of retention in cells expressing both constructs was also quantified by having an unbiased observer score a random selection of transfected cells for intracellular retention (Fig. 4B). The observer was blinded with respect to th"

Lipid-free apoA-I inhibited the binding of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 more efficiently than pre-β1-LpA-I, reconstituted HDL particles r(LpA-I), or HDL3 (IC50 = 0.35 ± 1.14, apoA-I; 1.69 ± 1.07, pre-β1-LpA-I; 17.91 ± 1.39, r(LpA-I); and 48.15 ± 1.72 μg/ml, HDL3). Treatment of intact cells with either phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C or sphingomyelinase affected neither 125I-apoA-I binding nor 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 cross-linking. We next investigated the dynamics of apoA-I lipidation by monitoring the kinetic of apoA-I dissociation from ABCA1. The dissociation of 125I-apoA-I from normal cells at 37 °C was rapid (t½ = 1.4 ± 0.66 h; n = 3) but almost completely inhibited at either 15 or 4 °C. A time course analysis of apoA-I-containing particles released during the dissociation period showed nascent apoA-I-phospholipid complexes that exhibited α-electrophoretic mobility with a particle size ranging from 9 to 20 nm (designated α-LpA-I-like particles), whereas lipid-free apoA-I incubated with ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells was unable to form such particles. These results demonstrate that: 1) the physical interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 does not depend on membrane phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin; 2) the association of apoA-I with lipids reduces its ability to interact with ABCA1; and 3) the lipid translocase activity of ABCA1 generates α-LpA-I-like particles.

On the other hand, it is well established that apoA-I binds to the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) (12Krieger M. J. Clin.

Furthermore, the amphipathic helix was found to be a key structural motif for peptide-mediated lipid efflux from ABCA1. Without knowledge of specific binding parameters of apoA-I-containing particles to ABCA1, it is not possible to predict whether ABCA1 might function as a significant receptor for apoA-I in the presence of other apolipoproteins, which demonstrate affinity for the same protein. A recent study by Basso et al. (18Basso F. Freeman L. Knapper C.L. Remaley A. Stonik J. Neufeld E.B. Tansey T. Amar M.J. Fruchart-Najib J. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 296-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the hepatic expression of ABCA1 is an important source of plasma HDL-C has stimulated our interest for apoA-I lipidation in peripheral cells. In the present study, experiments were directed at defining the mechanism by which apoA-I is lipidated by ABCA1 and how the formation of the apoA-I/ABCA1 complex can be affected by apoA-I conformation within discoidal and spherical HDL particles, by specific hydrolysis of plasma membranes phospholipids, or by naturally occurring mutants of ABCA1. In addition, the dynamics of apoA-I lipidation were investigated by determining the kinetic parameters of apoA-I/ABCA1 dissociation and the characterization of apoA-I-containing particles generated during this process. Patient Selection—For the present study, we selected fibroblasts from 3 normal control subjects and 1 patient with TD (homozygous for Q597R at the ABCA1 gene). The protocol for the study was reviewed and accepted by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Center. Separate consent forms for blood sampling, DNA isolation, and skin biopsy were provided. Cell Culture—Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from 3.0-mm punch biopsies of the forearm of patients and healthy control subjects and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.1% nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human Plasma ApoA-I—Purified plasma apoA-I (Biodesign) was resolubilized in 4 m guanidine HCL and dialyzed extensively against Tris buffer, (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl; pH 8.2). Freshly resolubilized apoA-I was used within 48 h. ApoA-I Binding Assay—ApoA-I was iodinated with 125I by IODOGEN® (Pierce) to a specific activity of 800–2500 cpm/ng apoA-I. Cells were grown on 24-well plates and were stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 125I-apoA-I in DMEM/BSA (1 mg/ml) as specified for each experiment in the presence or absence of a 30-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I, to subtract the nonspecific binding. The cells were then washed rapidly two times with ice-cold PBS/BSA, two times with cold PBS and lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. The amount of bound iodinated ligand was determined by γ-counting. Chemical Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chemical cross-linking was performed as described by Wang et al. (19Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes and then stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h in DMEM/BSA. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of either 3 μg/ml of unlabeled apoA-I or 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I in DMEM/BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then placed on ice for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. DSP (cross-linker agent) was dissolved immediately before use in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted to 500 μm with PBS. 8 ml of DSP solution was added in each well. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h; the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C with IP buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (Invitrogen), and the suspension was allowed to stand for 30 min at 4 °C in presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). ApoA-I/ABCA1 complex was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody (Novus Biologicals) as previously described (20Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After SDS-gel electrophoresis either apoA-I or ABCA1 were detected by immunopurified polyclonal anti-apoA-I antibody (Biodesign) or affinity-purified human anti-ABCA1 antibody (Novus). The presence of labeled 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 complexes were directly detected by autoradiography using XAR-2 Kodak film. Quantitative Cross-linking of ApoA-I to ABCA1—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes and then stimulated for 20 h. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of 5 units/ml PC-PLC or 0.4 units/ml SM-ase. After washing to remove phospholipases, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I (1500–2500 cpm/ng) in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I. Cells were then placed on ice for 15 min and washed three times with PBS, and then cross-linking with DSP was performed as described above. Samples containing 125I-apoA-I cross-linked to ABCA1 (200 μg of total protein) were incubated with 10 μl of affinity-purified human anti-ABCA1 antibody for 20 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein A bound to Sepharose (30 μl) as we have described previously (21Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2373-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of bound iodinated apoA-I to ABCA1 in the immunoprecipitates was determined by γ-counting. ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) was used as a negative control. Dissociation of Specifically Bound 125I-ApoA-I from Intact Cells— Fibroblasts were grown to near confluence in 24-well plates and then stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h in DMEM/BSA. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I in the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA. For nonspecific binding determination, cells were incubated with a 30-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I. After washing to remove unbound 125I-apoA-I, 0.5 ml of DMEM was added, and the plates were immediately incubated at 37 °C, 15 °C, or 4 °C for the indicated times. The medium was then collected, cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity in the medium and in the cells was determined by γ-counting. Cellular Lipid Efflux and Lipid Labeling—Phospholipid and cholesterol efflux were determined as previously described (3Marcil M. Bissonnette R. Vincent J. Krimbou L. Genest J. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50,000 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. At mid-confluence, the cells were labeled with 0.2–5 μCi/ml [3H]choline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 0.2–5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 48 h. At confluence, cells were cholesterol-loaded (20 μg/ml) for 24 h. During a 24 h equilibration period, cells were stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h. Phospholipid or cholesterol efflux were determined at either 2 or 24 h with 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Cellular lipid efflux was determined as follow: 3H cpm in medium/(3H cpm in medium + 3H cpm in cells); the results were expressed as percent of total radiolabeled phospholipids or cholesterol. Cell phospholipids were also labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as follows: fibroblasts from control subject were grown to confluence in 100-mm or 150-mm diameter dishes and were incubated for 72 h with 300–1500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate mixed with DMEM. The cells were stimulated as described above before incubation with lipid-free apoA-I as specified for each experiment. Separation of Lipoproteins by Two-dimensional Non-denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—ApoA-I-containing particles were separated by two-dimensional-PAGGE, as previously described (22Krimbou L. Marcil M. Davignon J. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33241-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Krimbou L. Marcil M. Chiba H. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 884-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (30–100 μl) were separated in the first dimension (according to their charge) by 0.75% agarose gel electrophoresis (100 V, 3 h, 4 °C) and in the second dimension (according to the size) by 5–23% polyacrylamide concave gradient gel electrophoresis (125 V, 24 h, 4 °C). Iodinated high molecular weight protein mixture (7.1–17.0 nm, Amersham Biosciences) was run as a standard on each gel. Electrophoretically separated samples were electrotransferred (30 V, 24 h, 4 °C) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). ApoA-I-containing particles were detected by incubating the membranes with immunopurified polyclonal anti-apoA-I antibody (Biodesign) labeled with 125I. The presence of labeled 125I-apoA-I or 32P-phospholipids were directly detected by autoradiography using XAR-2 Kodak film. Preparation of Reconstituted HDL Particles (rLpA-I)—Complexes comprising apoA-I, POPC, and cholesterol were prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method (24Jonas A. Steinmetz A. Churgay L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1596-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I/POPC/cholesterol molar ratio of 1:100:5 was used in this experiment. r(LpA-I) particles were further concentrated by ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, MWCO 50,000, Amicon) to discard any lipid-free apoA-I or proteolytic peptides. ApoA-I-lipid complex formation was verified by analysis with two-dimensional-PAGGE. Pre-β1-LpA-I Purification from Plasma—Pre-β1-LpA-I was purified from freshly drawn venous blood under nondenaturing conditions as described by Kunitake et al. (25Kunitake S.T. Chen G.C. Kung S.F. Schilling J.W. Hardman D.A. Kane J.P. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Typically, blood is drawn into a tube containing 1 mm sodium EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm DTNB, and cooled immediately on ice. Plasma is separated by low speed centrifugation (1,800 × g, 30 min) and aliquots (20 ml) were subjected to human immunopurified anti-apoA-I antibody (12171–21A, Genzyme Corp)-coupled Sepharose column (23Krimbou L. Marcil M. Chiba H. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 884-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26DeMattos R.B. Curtiss L.K. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4206-4212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ApoA-I-containing fractions were then dialyzed and concentrated. Samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the pre-β-migrating region was excised out. Agarose gel pieces containing the pre-β-migrating region were placed at the top of 3–26% non-denaturing gradient gels, as previously described (27Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Jacques H. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An immunoblot of apoA-I-containing lipoproteins separated by two-dimensional-PAGGE gels was used as a template to localize pre-β1-LpA-I particles, which are recovered from the gels by electroelution. Pre-β1-LpA-I particles were further concentrated by ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, MWCO 50,000, Amicon) to discard any lipid-free apoA-I or proteolytic peptides. The integrity of isolated plasma pre-β1-LpA-I fraction was verified by two-dimensional-PAGGE. In the present study, we have examined the binding of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 in normal cultured human fibroblasts. To determine the specific binding of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1, binding studies were performed in fibroblasts in which ABCA1 was induced with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (stimulated cells), as well as in unstimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, a marked and consistent increased binding of 125I-apoA-I to stimulated cells was measured. However, significant binding was also observed in unstimulated cells. This is presumably due to basal level of ABCA1 expression and the presence of other apoA-I binding sites at the cell surface. We have not been able to detect any SR-BI receptor presence in fibroblasts as compared with hepatocytes as examined by gel electrophoresis of cellular membranes fraction followed by immunoblotting with an anti-SR-BI antibody (data not shown). The specific binding curve and the binding parameters Kd and Bmax for apoA-I/ABCA1 interactions were determined by subtracting the binding values for the unstimulated cells from the corresponding values from stimulated cells. In the present binding assay apoA-I binds to ABCA1 (ABCA1 specific) with relatively high affinity (Kd = 0.65 ± 0.20 μg/ml), and the binding was saturable (Bmax = 0.10 ± 0.05 ng/μg cell protein) (Fig. 1A). Maximum specific binding of apoA-I to ABCA1 was reached in less than 30 min and remained constant for the remaining 2 h of the experiment (data not shown). To ensure that the binding parameters obtained reflect specific increased of 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 association in stimulated cells, the cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 was examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, apoA-I forms a complex with ABCA1. Furthermore, stimulation of cells lead to an increase of both cellular ABCA1 expression and apoA-I/ABCA1 cross-linking compared with unstimulated cells. At the same time, phospholipid and cholesterol efflux were increased in stimulated cells, as shown in Fig. 1C. In order to verify that the specific association of 125I-apoA-I with ABCA1 was dependent on the temperature, stimulated cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I for 2 h at either 37 °C, 20 °C or 4 °C, and then specific 125I-apoA-I cell association was determined as described above. Association with 125I-apoA-I-stimulated cells showed remarkable temperature dependence (100 ± 2%, 29 ± 4% and 13 ± 2%; 37 °C, 20 °C and 4 °C, respectively). Results are expressed as percent of the incubation at 37 °C (100%). It is well established that the conformation of apoA-I within HDL particles is affected by its association with lipid molecules. It was therefore of interest to determine whether apoA-I conformation/organization within particles would affect its interaction with ABCA1. Competition assays were performed to determine the ability of pre-β1-LpA-I, as well as discoidal reconstituted HDL r(LpA-I) and spherical HDL particles (HDL3), to compete for the binding of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 in stimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, lipid-free apoA-I inhibited the binding of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 more efficiently than either isolated plasma pre-β1-LpA-I, reconstituted HDL particles r(LpA-I) (11–12 nm of diameter), or native HDL3 (IC50 = 0.35 ± 1.14, apoA-I; 1.69 ± 1.07, pre-β1-LpA-I; 17.91 ± 1.39, r(LpA-I); and 48.15 ± 1.72 μg/ml, HDL3). Control experiments were conducted to examine whether the apparent decrease in cell binding of the labeled apoA-I may be due to the 125I-apoA-I binding to different competitors particles instead of the cells. An experiment was therefore carried out in which either r(LpA-I) or HDL3 particles were incubated with 125I-apoA-I under similar conditions used for apoA-I binding assay, and then the samples were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). No significant amount of 125I-apoA-I was found associated with r(LpA-I) or HDL3 (data not shown), supporting our results shown in Fig. 2A. To verify the integrity of competitors particles, either isolated pre-β1-LpA-I, lipid-free apoA-I, r(LpA-I), or plasma were separated by two-dimensional-PAGGE and apoA-I was detected with immunopurified polyclonal anti-apoA-I antibody labeled with 125I, as shown in Fig. 2B. Because the lipid binding characteristics of apoA-I have been proposed to be important in the apoA-I/ABCA1 interaction (14Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the question was raised whether the binding of apoA-I to ABCA1 was dependent on the presence of lipids at the cell surface. Stimulated cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of either 5 units/ml phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) or 0.4 units/ml sphingomyelinase (SM-ase). To assess how effectively phospholipids were removed by phospholipases treatment, the cells were labeled with [3H]choline and the lipids separated by TLC and counted. PC-PLC and SM-ase treatment digested greater than 65% of phosphatidyl [3H]choline and 80% of [3H]sphingomyelin, respectively. Cells were then incubated with 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I for 2 h at 37 °C and specific 125I-apoA-I binding was determined as described above. As shown in Fig. 3A, no significant effect of phospholipases treatment on the 125I-apoA-I binding level was observed. In order to further verify that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 was not dependent on the presence of plasma membrane phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin, we determined whether the cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 could be affected by phospholipases treatment. Quantitative cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 was performed as described in “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3B (lower panel), treatment of intact cells with phospholipases did not affect significantly 125I-apoA-I cross-linking to ABCA1. The presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I (200 μg/ml) reduced the cross-linking of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 by 78% of control. In addition, ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) that has been shown previously to not cross-link to apoA-I (13Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control for the present experiment and showed no binding or cross-linking to ABCA1 (Fig. 3, A and B). To ensure that the immunoprecipitates contained only 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 complex, immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by 4–22.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3B (upper panel), only 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 complex was detected in immunoprecipitated samples. Also, to rule out the possibility that treatment with phospholipases might induce membrane aggregation or affect ABCA1 protein structure, which may trap apoA-I and result in nonspecific cross-linking, we examined the effect of phospholipases treatment on the cross-linking of 125I-apoA-I to ABCA1 mutant (Q597R). As shown in Fig. 3B (upper panel), 125I-apoA-I did not cross-link to Q597R mutant whether treated with PC-PLC, SM-ase, or left intact. We initially hypothesized that any specific apoA-I dissociation from ABCA1 would be associated with a significant increase in apoA-I lipidation state. To better understand the mechanism by which apoA-I was lipidated by ABCA1, the kinetics of the dissociat"

However, mechanism for these inhibitions remains unknown. As a derivative of HCA, BCA (2′-benzoyl-oxycinnamaldehyde) was synthesized by replacing hydroxyl group with benzoyl-oxyl group. When p53-mutated cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell and SW620 colon cancer cell) were treated with 10 μm HCA or BCA, it induced growth arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells. Markers of apoptosis such as degradations of chromosomal DNA and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and activation of caspase-3 were detected after HCA or BCA treatment. BCA-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment of cells with anti-oxidants, glutathione, or N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, BCA-induced activation of caspase-3 and degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were abolished by pretreatment of cells with the anti-oxidants. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species are major regulator of BCA-induced apoptosis. HCA or BCA-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species was detected by using DCF-DA, an intracellular probe of oxidative stress. Furthermore, when BCA (100 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally or orally into a nude mouse, it inhibited >88 or 41% of tumor growth, respectively, without any detectable weight change. These results suggest that BCA is a good drug candidate for cancer therapy. 2′-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) has been shown to have inhibitory effects on farnesyl protein transferase in vitro, angiogenesis, and tumor cell growth.

Apoptosis was initially described by its morphological characteristics including cell shrinking, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation (8Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12717) Google Scholar). Defects in apoptotic pathways are considered to contribute to a number of human diseases ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to malignancy. The notion that apoptosis might influence the malignant phenotype goes back to the early 1970s. Subsequent studies reveal high frequency of apoptosis in spontaneously regressing tumors and in tumors treated with cytotoxic anti-cancer agents.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the induction of apoptosis but are not the common mediator (9Curtin J.F. Donovan M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 49-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 10Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F.

ROS are involved in apoptosis induced by transforming growth factor-β (12Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and by p53 (13Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oxidative radical stress-induced apoptosis is partly suppressed by Bcl-2 (15Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 may inhibit pro-oxidant-induced mitochondrial change and then prevent the formation of ROS. Cell death caused by abnormal redox was postulated to be one of the major causes of several diseases such as Parkinson's disease.For protection against increased level of ROS, cells possess several anti-oxidants or reductants that maintain the intracellular redox environment in a highly reduced state (11Palmer H.J. Paulson K.E. Nutr. Rev. 1997; 55: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH) is a major cellular reductant found in all eucaryotic cells (16Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1978; 54: 109-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Cellular H2O2 and other peroxides are eliminated by seleno-enzyme GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction with GSH as substrate. The dosage of the redox signal is an important factor in the modulation of cell functions (17Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cell cycle is arrested when cells are exposed to moderate levels of oxidative radical stress (18Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas a very low dose of ROS induces mitogenic effects to stimulate cell proliferation. The mode of cell death is also shifted from apoptosis to necrosis, corresponding to increases in the level of oxidative radical stress (19Dypbukt J.M. Ankarcrona M. Burkitt M. Sjoholm A. Strom K. Orrenius S. Nicotera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30553-30560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The tumor suppressor p53 is known to be an important regulator for cell cycle progression and apoptotic cell death. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is inactivated by point mutation in approximately 50% of all human cancers. Such a high frequency of mutation in p53 indicates that loss of p53 function is a very important step in tumor progression. It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis induced by Bax (20Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), CD95 or DR5 (21Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), ROS (14Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c (22Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3077-3083PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 induces apoptosis through a three-step process: 1) the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes; 2) the formation of ROS; and 3) the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components (14Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Because p53 has been shown to be involved in apoptosis and >50% of human cancer has mutated p53, it is important for pharmacological drugs to be able to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent pathway.Our study has provided a mechanism involving 2′-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) or HCA-induced apoptosis in p53-mutated cancer cell lines. The observed apoptotic activity of HCA or BCA was associated with a ROS generation. This means that ROS can induce apoptosis in a p53-independent pathway. Furthermore, BCA significantly blocked tumor growth in a nude mouse assay, demonstrating BCA as a good drug candidate for cancer therapy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All of the chemicals used in this experiments were purchased from Sigma. HCA and BCA were prepared by the reported method, and Me2SO was the solvent for the drug stock and dilution. Polyclonal anti-EGFR was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against MAPK and phospho-MAPK, cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-PARP, and PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling. PY-20, annexin V-FITC, anti-Bcl-X, anti-Fas ligand, and Z-VAD-fmk were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-Bcl-2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Biosciences.Cell Culture—The cell lines used were obtained originally from ATCC. SW620 (human colon cancer cell line) and MDA-MD-231 (human breast cancer cell line) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 25 mm Hepes. Human smooth muscle cell line (HUSMC) was obtained from Cambrex and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 and B104-1-1 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in an incubator. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to HCA or BCA at the indicated concentrations for different lengths of time.Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells (5,000 cells) were seeded into 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 20-24 h, cells were replenished with fresh complete medium containing either a test compound or 0.1% Me2SO. After incubation for 48 h, cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) was added to each well. The amount of WST-1 formazan produced was measured at 450 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Bio-Rad)Cell Cycle Analysis—To analyze the DNA content by flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized from the culture flask. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, the supernatant was removed. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution and fixed with 3 ml of ice cold 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 0.24 g of KH2PO4·H2O/liter, adjusted to pH 7.2) containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Collected cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (100 μl/1 × 105 cells) and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Propidium iodide was then added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for DNA staining, and 20,000 fixed cells were analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using the Modifit program (BD Biosciences).Detection of DNA Fragmentation—MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 μm or 30 μm HCA or BCA for 48 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended with 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 30 min, genomic DNA was extracted by removing proteins with phenol, precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, and separated on 1.5% agarose gel. DNA in the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light.Annexin V-FITC Staining—To analyze the apoptosis by flow cytometry, cells were collected 24 h after BCA or HCA treatment, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of cells were transferred to a 5-ml culture tube and 5 μl of annexin V-FITC and 10 μl of propidium iodide and mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. 400 μl of 1× binding buffer was added into each tube, and stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—A 20-μg protein was resolved by 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science). Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The primary antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) or from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG from Jackson immunology. The antibodies were used at dilution recommended by the manufacturers. Membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed five times with TBS-T, and visualized with chemiluminescence peroxidase reagents (Roche Applied Science). For immuno-precipitation, 200 μg of lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in rotatory shaker and then 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added. After 1 h, beads containing lysates were centrifuged and washed three times with lysis buffer. Bead-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted using specific antibody.Nude Mouse Xenograft Assay—For the evaluation of BCA for anti-tumor activity in vivo, SW620 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (3 ×107 cells/ml) were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice on day 0. Compound was dissolved in 0.5% Tween 80 and was administered intraperitoneally for 18 days or orally for 25 days at a concentration of 30 or 100 mg/kg/day. Tumor volumes were estimated as length (mm) × width (mm) × height (mm)/2. To determine the toxicity of the compound, the body weight of tumor-bearing animals was measured. On day 18 or 25, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were weighed.RESULTSInhibition of Tumor Cell Growth—To determine whether cinnamaldehyde inhibits cancer cell proliferation, MDA-MB-231 and SW620, both of which have mutated p53, were treated with HCA or BCA at different concentrations (0-100 μm) for 48 h (Fig. 1, A and B). HCA exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in a broad range of concentrations, and the IC50 value of HCA for in vitro growth inhibition was ∼10 μm. BCA was synthesized as an analogue of HCA, and it showed similar activity as HCA with the exception of low toxicity in beagle dog. 2D. C. Han, M.-Y. Lee, K. D. Shin, S. B. Jeon, J. M. Kim, K.-H. Son, H.-C. Kim, H.-M. Kim, and B.-M. Kwon, unpublished data. One of the characteristic features of HCA or BCA treated cells was rounding of cell morphology and detachment from culture plate. Therefore, for the further studies, cells were collected both from the attached and the suspended cells.To determine the effect of BCA on the cell cycle, FACS analysis was performed using human cancer cell line SW620 and MDA-MB-231. The concentration of BCA was 10 μm. The cells were harvested at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment and analyzed with a FACScalibur. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, BCA treatment of SW620 cells for 12 h increases in DNA content to tetraploid, indicating cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. In addition, significant fractions of cells were detected from subdiploid range, suggesting apoptosis of treated cells. Similarly, HUSMC was treated with 10 μm BCA and analyzed using FACS. As shown in Fig. 2, BCA showed no effect on the cell cycle profile of the HUSMC, the normal human cell line. In addition, BCA could not affect the cell cycle distribution of mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that BCA has tumor selectivity for inducing cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.Fig. 2Representative cell cycle distribution of HUSMC cells in the presence and absence of BCA. A and B, HUSMC cells were treated with 10 μm BCA (B) or with 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO)(A) for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h and harvested, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide. 20,000 stained cells then were subjected to FACScalibur analysis to determine the distribution of cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cinnamaldehyde Induces Apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and SW620 Cancer Cells—Because of subdiploid population from HCA- or BCA-treated cells, we tested whether HCA or BCA can induce chromosomal DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 3, both HCA and BCA caused chromosomal degradation in MDA-MB-231 and SW620 cells. PARP is involved in DNA repair in response to environmental stress and one of the apoptosis markers. As shown in Fig. 3, PARP degradation was induced by HCA and BCA from MDA-MB-231 and SW620 cells. These results suggested that HCA and BCA induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and SW620 cells in a p53-independent manner.Fig. 3Degradation of chromosomal DNA and PARP were induced by HCA and BCA. MDA-MB-231 (A) or SW620 (B) cells were treated with different concentrations of HCA or BCA or with vehicle solvent (0.1% Me2SO (DMSO)) for 48 h, and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PARP antibody (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To distinguish between necrosis and apoptosis, FACS analysis was carried out after staining cells with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. As shown in Fig. 4, 30 μm HCA induced apoptosis from >40% MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, 30 μm BCA induced apoptosis from >35% SW620 cells. 30 μm BCA caused significant necrosis of MDA-MB231 cells compared with HCA, and this necrosis was not detected from SW620. These results imply that HCA and BCA have different efficiencies on inducing apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and SW620 cells.Fig. 4HCA and BCA induce apoptosis of MBA-MB-231 and SW620 cells. MDA-MB-231 (top) or SW620 (bottom) cells were treated with 30 μm HCA or BCA or with vehicle solvent (0.1% Me2SO) for 24 h and stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 20,000 stained cells then were subjected to FACScalibur analysis to determine the distribution of cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To study BCA-induced apoptosis in detail, we monitored time-course response of cells after BCA treatment. 0.5 h after BCA treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells lost spreading, becoming round in morphology (Fig. 5A). 12 h after the treatment, caspase-3 was activated and PARP was degraded (Fig. 5, B and C).Fig. 5Time courses of morphology and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 30 μm BCA for different times, and lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer. Before making lysates, cell morphology was imaged by Nikon fluorescence microscope. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cleavage-specific caspase-3 (B) or anti-cleavage-specific PARP (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine further the effect of caspase-3 activation on BCA-induced apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cells, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk to determine whether caspase-3 activation is linked to apoptosis after BCA treatment. As expected, pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-fmk could block BCA-induced chromosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6A), caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6B), and PARP degradation (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that BCA may induce apoptosis through caspase-3 activation.Fig. 6BCA-induced chromosomal DNA degradation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP degradation was blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor. A-C, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Z-VAD-fmk (40 μm). After 30 min, 30 μm BCA were treated and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cleaved caspase-3 or anti-PARP antibody. DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BCA Induced Sustained EGF Receptor and p38 Kinase Activation—To characterize mechanisms of BCA-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, we analyzed the profile of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins after cells were treated with 30 μm BCA (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of an ∼170-kDa protein was enhanced 0.5 h after treatment of BCA and reached maximum 12 h after treatment. MDA-MB-231 has been known to highly express EGF receptor (23Davidson N.E. Gelmann E.P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To test whether highly phosphorylated protein is the EGF receptor, the EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated by using EGF receptor antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted using PY-20 antibody (Fig. 7, B and C). As shown in Fig. 7B, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor was enhanced 0.5 h after treatment of BCA and further maintained until 48 h after treatment. This is unusual case because EGF receptor was activated for 1 h after EGF treatment and quickly returned basal level. This prolonged activation of EGF receptor might be involved BCA-induced apoptosis.Fig. 7Sustained activation of EGF receptor and p38 kinase by BCA. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 30 μm BCA for different times, and the lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer. 20 μg of lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with PY-20 antibody (A). B, 200 μg of lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with EGFR antibody and protein A-agarose beads, and precipitants were resolved by SDS-PAGE after washing three times and immunoblotted with PY-20 antibody (B) or anti-EGFR antibody (C). The same whole cell lysates were resolved with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ERK1, anti-p38, anti-JNK2, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38, or phospho-JNK (D-F). WCL, whole cell lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because BCA induced sustained activation of EGF receptor, we tested the effect of BCA on the activity of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK using antibodies specifically recognizing the active phosphorylated forms (Fig. 7, D-F). p38 kinase was activated 0.5 h after treatment of BCA and sustained its activation for 24 h (Fig. 7E). However, we could not detect any significant increase of activation of ERK1/2. This is unexpected because ERK1/2 is well known downstream of EGF receptor signaling. The lack of activation of ERK1/2 by EGF receptor was postulated to be due to oncogenic K-Ras (23Davidson N.E. Gelmann E.P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Ennis B.W. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Investig. 1991; 9: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, we could not see activation of JNK by treatment of BCA.To examine the importance of EGF receptor signaling for the induction of apoptosis by BCA, we used AG1478 to inhibit EGF receptor. When cells were pretreated with the inhibitor, we could not detect any enhancement of survival of BCA-treated cells (Fig. 8). This result was further confirmed by using a cell line, B104-1-1, expressing constitutive ErbB-2, an EGF receptor family member. When cell cycle profiles of B104-1-1 or NIH3T3 cell lines were examined after treatment of Me2SO or BCA, we could not detect any change of profile of cell cycle (data not shown). These results suggest that EGF receptor may not be involved in BCA-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.Fig. 8Anti-oxidants can abolish BCA-induced apoptosis. MDAMB-231 cells were treated with NAC (15 mm), PD98059 (25 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), AG1478 (20 μm), or PP2 (25 μm). 30 min after the treatments, BCA (30 μm) was added and further incubated for 48 h and viability of cells was determined by using WST-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a control, 0.1% Me2SO was used instead of BCA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When cells were treated with BCA, they became round in morphology within 1 h and detached from the bottom of culture dishes (Fig. 5). It was reported that cell detachment triggers p38 kinase-dependent overexpression of Fas ligand (25Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that BCA may induce apoptosis through p38 activation and overexpression of Fas ligand. However, we could not detect any overexpression of Fas ligand after BCA treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, when cells were pretreated with SB203580, a p38 kinase inhibitor, we could not observe any enhancement of survival of BCA-treated cells (Fig. 8). These results implied that BCA-induced apoptosis is not through p38 pathway. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) efficiently blocked BCA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). This finding suggests that oxidative stress may be involved in BCA-induced apoptosis.Cinnamaldehyde-induced Apoptosis Was Caused by Elevation of ROS Content—ROS are constantly generated under normal conditions as a consequence of aerobic metabolism state (9Curtin J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2010616064,"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a blistering cutaneous disease featuring protein aggregates. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms linking protein aggregates to cell death in a cellular model of EBS in which HaCaT keratinocytes are transfected with plasmids expressing various mutant forms of keratin 14 (K14). In HaCaT cells, mutant K14 was found to form ubiquitinated protein aggregates that suppressed 20 S proteasome function instead of being degraded by 20 S proteasome. Keratinocytes with mutant K14-induced phosphorylation of the stress-activated kinase c-Jun, as well as up-regulation of unfolding protein Bip, indicates induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. HaCaT cells were susceptible to apoptosis by activation of caspases-3, and -8, but not caspase-9 or -12. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in the culture medium was increased in keratinocytes with mutant K14 compared with wild K14, and the addition of neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody to the culture medium rescued keratinocytes from cell death. Thus, TNFα release and the subsequent activation of the TNFα receptor by an autocrine/paracrine pathway links protein aggregates to cell death in this keratinocyte EBS cellular model. Furthermore, mutation in K14 reduced its affinity to TNFα receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), suggesting that the susceptibility of keratinocytes to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis is increased in mutated K14 because of impairment of the cytoprotective mechanism mediated by K14-TRADD interaction.

Protein folding is the process by which a linear polymer of amino acids is converted to the unique three-dimensional structure of a functional protein molecule. The folding process may fail because of genetic mutations or environmental stresses, such as heat stress (1Vidair C.A. Huang R.N. Doxsey S.J. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1996; 12: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and oxidative stress (2Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of protein aggregates.

However, the mechanism by which protein aggregates induce ER stress and cell death is not known. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major nonlysosomal proteolytic pathway that functions to rapidly eliminate proteins having abnormal conformations (3Goldberg A.L. Science. 1995; 268: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 4Ceichanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Degradation of proteins by this pathway involves two successive steps: (i) covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the target protein, and (ii) degradation of the target protein by the 26 S proteolytic complex. The 20 S proteasome, the catalytic core of the 26 S proteolytic complex, is a cylindrical stack of four seven-membered rings; its proteolytic site faces an interior chamber that can be accessed only through pores at either end of the cylinder. The protein aggregates in several neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be ubiquitin-positive (5Ross C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Folded proteins cannot enter the chamber of the 20 S proteasome unless they are unfolded. Because ubiquitinated protein aggregates are barely unfolded, they cannot enter the chamber of 20 S proteasome, and thus are resistant to degradation (6Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R.

Malfolded proteins are unfolded in the ER; accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER induces an adaptive process, the so-called unfolded protein response (7Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The unfolded protein response has at least two distinct components. The first consists of a rapid and transient attenuation of new protein synthesis, which lightens the load on the folding apparatus in the ER. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER phosphorylates PERK, which in turn phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor-2α to inhibit further protein synthesis. The second component consists of up-regulation of the expression of genes, the products of which promote protein folding in the ER and the degradation of malfolded proteins. Unfolded proteins in the ER lumen phosphorylate IRE1, activating the endonuclease domain of IRE1 and initiating splicing of mRNA encoding a putative transcription factor, leading to enhanced transcription of ER chaperone genes, including Bip and CHOP. IRE1 phosphorylation also triggers phosphorylation of the stress-activated kinase c-Jun, leading to enhanced transcription of ER chaperone genes. ER stress causes apoptotic cell death (8Nishitoh H.

Although the pathways linking ER stress to apoptosis are still controversial, activation of caspase-12 (12Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces apoptosis in some cell types (13Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev.

TNFα exerts its effects by binding to TNFα receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2. The cytotoxic effects of TNFα are mediated by TNFR1, which has a cytoplasmic death domain that interacts with an adaptor protein, TNFα receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), following ligand binding. TRADD subsequently interacts with another adapter protein, FAS-associated death domain (FADD), which recruits and activates pro-caspase-8, resulting in activation of the cell death machinery. The keratin family of proteins forms the intermediate filaments of epithelial cells, which are heterodimers of type I (acidic) and type II (neutral basic) keratins. The expression of the various combinations of keratin isoforms depends on the pathway of epithelial differentiation; keratin 5 (K5) and K14 heterodimers (K5/K14) and K1/K10 are expressed in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes of the keratinized squamous epithelium, respectively (17Fuchs E.

Mutations in either K5 or K14 genes markedly alter tissue integrity and cause epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a well defined blistering disorder in the epidermis of skin (23Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.L. Epstein Jr., E.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Certain types of EBS are characterized by formation of mutant K5 or K14 aggregates in vivo (24Ishida-Yamamoto A. McGrath J.A. Chapman S.J. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Eady R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection of disease-causing mutant keratins results in protein aggregations in vitro (25Coulombe P.A. Hutton M.E. Letai A. Hebert A. Paller A.S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that transfection of mutant K14 into keratinocytes induces formation of K14 aggregations. We investigated the mechanism linking protein aggregates to cell death using an in vitro cellular EBS model. Our data indicate that autocrine/paracrine TNFR1 stimulation and the resultant caspase-8-mediated apoptosis links K14 aggregates to cell death in keratinocytes. Plasmid Construction—cDNA containing the entire coding region of K14 (K14(WT)) was subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The replacement of Arg125 with Cys (K14(R125C)), Val270 with Met (K14(V270M)), or Leu384 with Pro (K14(L384P)) was made by overlap extension using PCR methods, and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector. Pairs of primers used for the first PCR to generate the K14(R125C) fragment were: sense, 5′-ATGACTACCTGCAGCCGCCA, antisense, 5′-GTCCAGGTAGGAGGCCAGGcagTCATTGAGGTTCTGCATGG; and sense, 5′-CCATGCAGAACCTCAATGActgCCTGGCCTCCTACCTGGAC, anti-sense, 5′-GTTCTTGGTGCGAAGGACCT, where small letters in bold denote mutations introduced. A pair of primers for the second PCR was: sense, 5′-ATGACTACCTGCAGCCGCCA, anti-sense, 5′-GTTCTTGGTGCGAAGGACCT. Mutated fragments for K14(V270M) and K14(L384P) were similarly generated using overhang primers: sense, 5′-AGGTGGGTGGAGATGTCAATatgGAGATGGACGCTGCACCT, antisense, 5′-AGGTGCAGCGTCCATCTCcatATTGACATCTCCACCCACCT; and sense, 5′-TGGCAGCGTGGAGGAGCAGccgGCCCAGCTCCGCTGCGAGA; antisense, 5′-TCTCGCAGCGGAGCTGGGCcggCTGCTCCTCCACGCTGCCA, respectively. cDNA encoding K14(WT) and K14(R125C) were subcloned into SmaI-digested yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pAS2-1 (pAS2-1/K14(WT) and pAS2-1/K14(R125C), respectively). The C terminus of the human TNFα-receptor (TNFR)-associated death domain (aa 245-312) in the yeast GAL4 DNA activation domain vector pGAD-C1 (pGAD-C1/TRADD-CT) is previously described (26Inada H. Izawa I. Nishizawa M. Fujita E. Kiyono T. Takahashi T. Momoi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The sequence of each of the plasmid constructs was verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the 377 DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfection—The culture and transfection of HaCaT cells were carried out as previously described with minor modifications (27Yoneda K. Fujimoto T. Imamura S. Ogawa K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 724-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zheng Y.J. Furukawa T. Ogura T. Tajimi K. Inagaki N. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were plated on 35- or 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml 24 h before plasmid transfection, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (450 mg/dl glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. A portion of 2 μg of K14(WT) or one of the K14 mutants in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector for 35-mm dishes and 5 μg for 60-mm dishes were transfected into cells with LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected for further analysis. In each experiment, transfection efficiency was confirmed to be similar among types of transfected plasmids using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining (29Ban N. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Miyawaki K. Ihara Y. Hosokawa M. Toyokuni S. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Primary Antibodies—Anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen, anti-ubiquitin and anti-TNFα antibody from Dako, anti-cyclin D1 (H-295), anti-Bip (GRP78), and anti-α-tubulin antibody (H-300) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-c-Jun, anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-cleaved caspase-8, anti-cleaved caspase-9, and anti-caspase-12 antibody from Cell Signaling. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunostaining was performed as described previously (30Yoneda K. Steinert P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells on glass coverslips were fixed with methanol. Cells on glass coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-V5 (1:300), anti-ubiquitin (1:20), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:300), anti-cleaved caspase 8 (1:300), and anti-cleaved caspase 9 (1:300)) overnight at 4 °C, and detection was with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to rabbit IgG or a combination of Cy3-conjugated streptavidin and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Immunofluorescent images were viewed with a confocal laser microscope (Olympus). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (31Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were washed twice with washing buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.25 m sucrose) and lysed in precipitation assay buffer (8 g/liter NaCl, 200 mg/liter KCl, 1150 mg/liter Na2HPO4, 200 mg/liter NaH2PO4, 2% Empigen BB, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm each leupeptin, and pepstatin) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cell lysates were presorbed by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 1,500 × g. The supernatant was incubated with 2 μg/ml of anti-V5 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complexes were washed with the precipitation assay buffer, eluted with Laemmli buffer (consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue), and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—HaCaT cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer (consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) on ice for 30 min, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 min, and supernatant (cell lysates) was collected. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (anti-V5 (1:5000), anti-ubiquitin (1:50), anti-cyclin D1 (1:200), anti-phospho-c-Jun (1:500), anti-Bip (1:100), anti-α-tubulin (1:200), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:500), anti-cleaved caspase 8 (1:500), anti-cleaved caspase 9 (1:500), anti-caspase 12 (1:500), or anti-TNF α (1:500) antibody) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody, and the proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein expression level was quantified by measuring the density of immunostaining by NIH Image software. Assay for 20 S Proteasome Activity—Cells were lysed in buffer comprising 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm each of leupeptin and pepstatin on ice for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 min, and supernatant (cell lysates) was collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Cell lysates containing 0.2 mg of proteins were incubated with 1 mm carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-glutamic acid α-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide in the absence or presence of 10 μm tripeptide aldehyde benzoylcarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (zLLLal; Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) for 3 h at room temperature, and fluorescence was monitored (excitation at 360-400 nm, and emission at 440-480 nm) with a Multi-Well Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystem). The difference in emitted fluorescence between the presence and absence of 10 μm zLLLal was considered to represent relative 20 S proteasome activity. Annexin-V and TUNEL Staining—106 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline comprised of 80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin-V (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at room temperature, and served for flow cytometric analysis with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). TUNEL staining was performed with ApopTag apoptosis detection kit (Intergen). HaCaT cells on coverslips were fixed with -20 °C methanol, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline 2 times, and treated with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min. They were then incubated with the anti-V5 antibody for 30 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times, and incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 30 min, followed by incubation with streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with working strength terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme at 37 °C for 1 h, extensively washed with stop/wash buffer and phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-digoxigenin conjugate fluorescent dye for 30 min. They were mounted on a glass slide with PermaFluor (ThermoShandon) and observed by confocal laser microscope (Olympus). TNFα Measurement—The content of TNFα in cell culture medium was measured with a solid phase Enzyme Amplified Sensitivity Immunoassay kit (BioSource) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 200 μl of culture medium was added to each plate coated with monoclonal anti-TNFα antibody (mAbs I), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature on a horizontal shaker. After washing the plates 3 times with the washing buffer supplied, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAbs II) against the epitope of the TNFα distinct from that for mAbs I was added, and plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature to allow formation of the coated mAb I-TNFα-mAb II-horseradish peroxidase complex. After washing 3 times with the washing buffer, the plates were incubated with chromogenic solution containing tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2 for 30 min. Reaction was terminated by addition of 0.36 n H2SO4, and absorbance at A450 was measured with a spectrophotometer (ELNX96, TFB). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast in vivo interaction assay was performed with the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 (Clontech) as described previously (32Furukawa T. Ono Y. Tsuchiya H. Katayama Y. Bang M.L. Labeit D. Labeit S. Inagaki N. Gregorio C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Saccaromyces cerevisiae strain Y190 was co-transformed with plasmid containing the GAL4 DNA-binding and -activation domains, and then spread on Trp-, Leu-, His- plates containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. After 7-10 days, His 3 positive colonies were subjected to β-galactosidase filter assay. Colonies were transferred to filter papers (Whatman No. 5), frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on filtration paper, and incubated with 1 mm X-gal (WAKO) in Z-buffer (consisting of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed with Galacton-Star (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—All values are presented as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to test for significance (p < 0.05). Aggregations and Ubiquitination of Mutant K14—First, to determine whether mutant K14 protein aggregates form in cultured keratinocytes as in keratinocytes of EBS in vivo (24Ishida-Yamamoto A. McGrath J.A. Chapman S.J. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Eady R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we transfected HaCaT cells, an epidermis-derived cell line, with V5-tagged K14(WT) or K14(R125C), the most common mutation in the Dowling-Meara type of EBS (25Coulombe P.A. Hutton M.E. Letai A. Hebert A. Paller A.S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 33Chan Y.M. Cheng J. Gedde-Dahl Jr., T. Niemi K.-M. Fuchs E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and stained them with an anti-V5 antibody. Whereas wild-type K14 (K14(WT)) form fine filamentous networks in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a, upper left panel), K14(R125C) are aggregated, failing to form a coherent filamentous network (Fig. 1a, lower left panel). Ubiquitination is currently recognized as a signal not only for protein degradation but also for various cell functions including endocytosis, trafficking, and exocytosis (34Hicke L. Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Because many protein aggregates that are ubiquitinated are related to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (35Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, NY1998Crossref Google Scholar), we investigated to determine whether mutated K14 aggregates are ubiquitinated. We stained cells transfected with V5-tagged K14(WT) or K14(R125C) dually with an anti-V5 and an anti-ubiquitin antibody. K14(WT)-transfected cells exhibit only weak immunoreactivities for ubiquitin, diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a, upper middle panel). In contrast, K14(R125C)-transfected cells exhibit strong immunoreactivities for ubiquitin (Fig. 1a, lower middle panel). The V5 immunoreactivities representing K14(R125C) aggregates and strong ubiquitin immunoreactivities overlap, suggesting ubiquitination of K14(R125C) aggregates (Fig. 1a, lower right panel). To confirm that K14(R125C) is ubiquitinated, lysates of cells transfected with K14(WT) or K14(R125C) were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1, b and c). In K14(WT)-transfected cells, a weak smear pattern appeared at molecular weights greater than 52,000, the molecular size of K14. When cells were treated with 10 μm zLLLal, an inhibitor of 20 S proteasome, for 3 h prior to cell harvest, the density of smear pattern immunostaining was markedly increased, showing that K14(WT) is under control of the UPS, as has been previously reported (36Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with K14(R125C), a smear pattern of ubiquitin immunostaining was evident without treatment with zLLLal, and zLLLal did not further increase the density. To ascertain that the UPS is utilized for protein degradation, the expression level of K14 protein was assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, d and e). K14(WT) expression is significantly increased by zLLLal treatment, whereas K14(R125C) expression is high even without zLLLal treatment and not further increased by zLLLal. These results indicate that ubiquitination of K14 is utilized as a signal for degradation, conferring resistance of mutated K14 to degradation by the 20 S proteasome. K14(R125C) Aggregates Inhibit 20 S Proteasome Function—To determine whether ubiquitinated mutant K14 aggregates inhibit 20 S proteasome degradation, we first examined the effects of K14(R125C) aggregates on 20 S proteasome function. To measure 20 S proteasome function, the fluorescent UPS substrate z-Leu-Leu-Glu-α-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, which exhibits fluorescence upon its breakdown by 20 S proteasome, was used. Induced fluorescence was significantly attenuated in K14(R125C)-transfected cells compared with K14(WT)-transfected cells (Fig. 1f). We also tested the effects of K14(R125C) aggregates on turnover of cyclin D1, a defined 20 S proteasome substrate (37Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) that is not relevant to K14. Immunoblot analysis showed that in K14(WT)-transfected cells, the protein level of cyclin D1 was low in the basal state and markedly increased by treatment with zLLLal. In K14(R125C)-transfected cells, the protein level of cyclin D1 was high in the control state, and zLLLal treatment did not further increase its expression level (Fig. 1g). These results indicate that K14(R125C) aggregates suppress 20 S proteasome function, interfering with the turnover of proteins such as cyclin D1 that are under the regulated control of the UPS in normal circumstances. Apoptosis in K14(R125C)-transfected Cells—We then investigated the fate of keratinocytes having K14(R125C) aggregates. We utilized fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin-V to detect apoptotic cells: translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner leaflet of plasma membrane to the outer leaflet is a biochemical marker of apoptosis that can be detected by the phosphatidylserine-binding protein annexin-V. Fluocytometric analysis showed annexin-V-positive cells to be significantly increased by K14(R125C) transfection (47.6 ± 5.2%) but not by K14(WT) transfection (20.1 ± 0.8%), compared with mock transfection (18.7 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 2a). We also performed TUNEL staining in K14(WT)- or K14(R125C)-transfected cells. Positive TUNEL stainings were observed in the nuclei in K14(R125C)-transfected cells but not in K14(WT)-transfected cells (Fig. 2b). These data indicate susceptibility of keratinocytes having K14 mutations to apoptosis. Induction of ER Stress—Protein aggregates are frequently related to ER stress (12Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 38Johnston J.A. Ward C.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). To determine whether K14(R125C) aggregates induce ER stress, we examined the phosphorylation of one of the stress-activated kinases, c-Jun, and the expression level of the unfolding protein, Bip, both of which are biomarkers of ER stress (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody revealed c-Jun to be considerably phosphorylated in K14(R125C)-transfected cells but only barely in mock- or K14(WT)-transfected cells. The expression level of Bip was significantly increased in cells transfected with K14(R125C) but not in K14(WT)-transfected cells, compared with mock transfection. These data suggest that, as in neurodegenerative diseases, K14(R125C) aggregates inhibit the UPS, subsequently inducing ER stress, resulting in apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2093815823,"The penultimate step in the pathway of riboflavin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase (LS). One of the most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is the structural quaternary divergence found in different species. The protein exists as pentameric and icosahedral forms, built from practically the same structural monomeric unit. The pentameric structure is formed by five 18-kDa monomers, each extensively contacting neighboring monomers. The icosahedrical structure consists of 60 LS monomers arranged as 12 pentamers giving rise to a capsid exhibiting icosahedral 532 symmetry. In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. The Brucella sp. lumazine synthase (BLS) sequence clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate its quaternary arrangement. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analyses that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for lumazine synthases. We also describe by spectroscopic studies the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of this macromolecular assembly. The higher molecular order of BLS increases its stability 20 °C compared with pentameric lumazine synthases. The decameric arrangement described in this work highlights the importance of quaternary interactions in the stabilization of proteins.

In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. The Brucella sp. lumazine synthase (BLS) sequence clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate its quaternary arrangement. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analyses that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for lumazine synthases. We also describe by spectroscopic studies the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of this macromolecular assembly. The higher molecular order of BLS increases its stability 20 °C compared with pentameric lumazine synthases. The decameric arrangement described in this work highlights the importance of quaternary interactions in the stabilization of proteins. Riboflavin, an essential cofactor for all organisms, is biosynthesized in plants, fungi, and microorganisms. The penultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase (LS). 1The abbreviations used are: LS, lumazine synthase; BLS, Brucella sp. lumazine synthase; CD, circular dichroism; TF, tryptophan fluorescence; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid; SLS, static light scattering; SEC, size exclusion chromatography column; LEM, lineal extrapolation method; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; M̄w, weight average molecular weight; DTT, dithiothreitol; ASA, accessible surface area. 1The abbreviations used are: LS, lumazine synthase; BLS, Brucella sp. lumazine synthase; CD, circular dichroism; TF, tryptophan fluorescence; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid; SLS, static light scattering; SEC, size exclusion chromatography column; LEM, lineal extrapolation method; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; M̄w, weight average molecular weight; DTT, dithiothreitol; ASA, accessible surface area. One of the most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is the structural quaternary divergence found in different species. The protein exists as pentameric and icosahedral forms, built from practically the same structural monomeric unit. The structure of the monomer consists of four repeated β-strand/α-helix motifs producing a sandwich of four parallel β-strands surrounded by four α-helices, two on each face of the β sheet (1Ladenstein R. Schneider M. Huber R. Bartunik H.D. Wilson K. Schott K. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1045-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In all LS studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules (2Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S. Kaiser J.T. Cushman M. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bacilliaceae express a bifunctional enzyme complex with lumazine synthase and riboflavin synthase activity. Three α-subunits (riboflavin synthase) enclosed by 60 β-subunits (lumazine synthase) form a protein particle of ∼1 MDa (1Ladenstein R. Schneider M. Huber R. Bartunik H.D. Wilson K. Schott K. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1045-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Bacher A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the lumazine synthase/riboflavin synthase from Bacillus subtilis complexed with a substrate analogue has been determined (4Ritsert K. Huber R. Turk D. Ladenstein R. Schmidt-Base K. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This structure consists of 60 β-subunits (lumazine synthase monomers) arranged as 12 pentamers giving rise to a capsid exhibiting icosahedral 532 symmetry. Two other icosahedric LS have been described by x-ray crystallography. Spinach and thermophilic bacterial Aquifex aelicus LS also exhibit icosahedral 532 symmetry. The three proteins form 1-MDa spherical capsids of 60 LS subunits with icosahedral symmetry. The icosahedral LS structures superimpose very well, highlighting the conservation of the overall folding and quaternary arrangement despite the low sequence homology between them (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Four structurally characterized LS assemble as pentamers in their native form and do not further associate to form an icosahedral capsid. These include fungal Magnaporthe grisea, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and bacterial Brucella abortus LS (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the four pentameric enzymes fold in a similar arrangement, the postulated reasons for the lack of icosahedral order differ. Superposition of the pentameric LS shows that the loop connecting the helices α4 and α5 is critical for preventing the formation of capsids. In all icosahedral LS a pentapeptide kink located in this loop is essential for pentamer-pentamer contacts (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Braden B.C. Velikovsky C.A. Cauerhff A.A. Polikarpov I. Goldbaum F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The yeast and fungal pentameric enzymes have insertions of different length in this loop that change its overall orientation and disrupt potential contacts to neighboring subunits (7Meining W. Mortl S. Fischer M. Cushman M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously analyzed the divergence in macromolecular assembly between pentameric and icosahedral LS enzymes. In this regard, a high degree of divergence was observed between the sequence from B. abortus LS and the other pentameric structurally characterized members of the family (8Fornasari M.S. Laplagne D.A. Frankel N. Cauerhff A.A. Goldbaum F.A. Echave J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 10.1093/molbev/msg1244PubMed Google Scholar). BLS has a 3-residue insertion between helices α4 and α5 that contribute to form a continuous undistorted helix, unable to form the capsid-stabilizing kink (6Braden B.C. Velikovsky C.A. Cauerhff A.A. Polikarpov I. Goldbaum F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the BLS structure clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes because of the lack of this critical loop. The different orientation of this straight helix is compensated by a longer loop bridging the helix structure with the contiguous sheet. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate the quaternary arrangement of BLS. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analysis that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for LS. We also describe, by spectroscopic studies, the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of its macromolecular assembly. The Brucella sp. LS gene was cloned in pET11a vector (Novagen) as reported previously (9Goldbaum F.A. Velikovsky C.A. Baldi P.C. Mortl S. Bacher A. Fossati C.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The plasmid was used to transform BL21(DE3) strain Escherichia coli-competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown until A600 = 1.0 in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C with agitation (300 rpm). Five milliliters of this culture was diluted to 500 ml and grown to reach an A600 of 1.0. At this point the culture was induced adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with agitation (300 rpm). The bacteria were centrifuged at 15,000 × g during 20 min at 4 °C. BLS protein was successfully expressed as inclusion bodies by transformation of strain BL21(DE3) E. coli-competent cells (9Goldbaum F.A. Velikovsky C.A. Baldi P.C. Mortl S. Bacher A. Fossati C.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 8 m urea pH 8.0 at room temperature overnight with agitation. The solubilized material was refolded by dialysis during 72 h against phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. This preparation was purified in a Mono-Q column in a fast-protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) using a linear gradient of buffer B (50 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.5). The peak enriched with BLS was further purified on a Superdex-200 column with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 1 mm DTT. The purity of the BLS preparation was determined on SDS-15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Purified BLS was concentrated (10 mg/ml), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -20 °C. BLS samples were diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, with increasing concentration of denaturants (urea or GdnHCl). All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and samples were incubated at least 2 h before taking CD measurements. Spectra were measured on a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-810) using either 0.1- or 0.5-cm path length quartz cells. Unfolding was monitored by far-UV CD (260–200 nm) and expressed as the percentage of molar ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of denaturant concentration. The molar ellipticity of the protein incubated without GdnHCl was taken as 100%. For renaturation tests, BLS was first denatured in high concentration of GdnHCl (6 m), and renaturation was induced by overnight dialysis against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT. After this treatment, the CD and SLS signals typical of the native protein were recovered. Emission spectra were carried out by excitation of the samples at 295 nm, and data collection from 300 to 450 nm, using 3-nm band passes for both excitation and emission. Experiments were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea or GdnHCl. Samples were incubated for at least 2 h prior to taking fluorescence measurements. All fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on a Jasco FP-770 spectrofluorometer. BLS samples were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0 (in the presence or absence of 2 m GdnHCl) or in 50 mm buffer citrate, 1 mm DTT, pH 4.5. Thermal denaturation was conducted by slowly increasing the temperature with a Peltier system (Jasco). The range of temperature scanning was 25–95 °C at a speed of 4 °C/min. Molar ellipticity at 220 nm was measured every 0.5 °C. Fast or slow cooling back to 25 °C (from 95 to 25 °C at a speed of 1 °C/min) did not show a recovery of ellipticity demonstrating the irreversibility of the thermal unfolding. Thus the temperature midpoint of the thermal transition was considered as an apparent Tm. pH-induced BLS dissociation and unfolding was evaluated by diluting protein samples (5 μm monomers) in 50 mm citrate, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.0–2.5 or in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5-7.0. After 1–2 h of incubation at room temperature, CD and SLS signals were determined. ANS fluorescence emission was measured in the same buffer conditions as CD and SLS experiments, aggregating to the samples 50 μm ANS. Values were normalized to ANS fluorescence emission in the same buffer. Excitation and emission were set at 365 and 470 nm, respectively. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of BLS under different conditions was determined on a Precision Detectors PD2010 light-scattering instrument tandemly connected to an high-performance liquid chromatography system and an LKB 2142 differential refractometer. In general, 20–100 μl of LS (0.3–1 mg/ml) was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR-10/30 (24 ml) or a Sephadex G-25 (1 ml) column and eluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, 1 mm DTT under different pH, urea, GdnHCl, and NaCl conditions. The 90° light scattering and refractive index signals of the eluting material were recorded on a PC computer and analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by Precision Detectors. The 90° light scattering detector was calibrated using bovine serum albumin (M̄w: 66.5 kDa) as a standard. Prior to the injection in a size exclusion chromatography column (SEC), each sample was preincubated for 1–2 h at room temperature in the elution buffer. Thermodynamics evaluation of GdnHCl-induced unfolding of BLS was fitted to a two-step model: N10↔Ku1(2)N5↔Ku25U. The first step (N10 ↔ 2N5) represents the dissociation of decameric BLS (N10) in two folded pentamers (N5), whereas the second step (N5 ↔ 5U) represents the concomitant dissociation and unfolding of the pentameric structure (N5) in monomeric subunits (U). Because both steps are well resolved from each other, their thermodynamic parameters were independently analyzed using the lineal extrapolation method (Equation 1) assuming a two-state transition model for each step (10Greene Jr., R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ΔGU=ΔGH2O-m[D](Eq. 1) where ΔGU is the free energy of unfolding of a protein at a given denaturant concentration, ΔGH2O is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and m the dependence of the free energy on denaturant concentration ([D]). Step 1—The first step was monitored by SLS in the range of 1.5–2.2 m GdnHCl. The concentration at equilibrium of the N10 and N5 species of BLS were calculated using Equations 4 and 5 derived from rearrangement of Equations 2 and 3, <INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""zbc27998093eq2""></INLINE-FIG>(Eq. 1) ccT=ccN10+ccN5(Eq. 1) <INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""zbc27998093eq4""></INLINE-FIG>(Eq. 1) <INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""zbc27998093eq5""></INLINE-FIG>(Eq. 1) where M̄w represents the weight average molecular weight of BLS. ccN10, ccN5, and ccT represent the decamer, pentamer, and total protein concentration in millgrams/ml, respectively. [N10] and [N5] represent the molar concentration and M̄w10 and M̄w5 the molecular weight of the decameric (174.4 kDa) and pentameric (87.2 kDa) species of BLS, respectively. The equilibrium constant KU(1) and the free energy change ΔGU(1) for Step 1 are defined in Equations 6 and 7. KU(1)=[N5]2/[N10](Eq. 1) ΔGU(1)=-RTlnKU(1)(Eq. 1) The ΔGH2O(1) and m(1) values (Equation 1) for this transition were obtained from the extrapolation to zero denaturant concentration and from the slope of the linear regression fit of the ΔGU(1) values calculated as a function of GdnHCl concentration in the range of 1.5 to 2.2 m. The dissociation constant of the decameric arrangement (KD) was estimated from the ΔGH2O value of this transition using the equation, KD = e(-ΔGH2O/(RT)). Step 3—The second step was monitored by CD and FT in the range of 2.4 and 3.5 m GdnHCl. The equilibrium constant KU(2) and the free energy change ΔGU(2) for this transition are defined in Equations 8 and 9. KU(2)=[U]5/[N5](Eq. 1) ΔGU(2)=-RTlnKU(2)(Eq. 1) The total protein concentration in monomer units (PT) and the fractional population in the native (FN) and unfolded (FU) states were calculated using Equations 10, 11, 12, PT=5[N5]+[U](Eq. 1) FN=5[N5]/PT(Eq. 1) FU=1-FN=[U]/PT=(mf[D]+F)-Y/[(mf[D]+F)-(mu[D]-U)](Eq. 1) where Y is the experimental spectroscopic value, [D] is the GdnHCl concentration, F and U are the intercepts, and mf and mu are the slopes of the pre- and post-unfolding baselines, respectively. Combining Equations 1 and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, we obtain the general equation (Equation 13) as follows. 5(mf[D]+F)-Y(mf[D]+F)-(mu[D]+U)5PT4+(mf[D]+F)-Y(mf[D]+F)-(mu[D]+U)-1e(ΔGH2O-m(2)[D])/RT=0(Eq. 1) ΔGH2O(2) and m(2) values of Step 2 were obtained fitting the experimental data measured by CD and FT to Equation 13 by a non-linear square fit method.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), two further crystal forms of BLS were obtained in this work by means of the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method. The first form was diamond-like crystals obtained using 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, which diffracted to 2.9 Å and belongs to the trigonal space group P3121. Furthermore, we obtained plate-like crystals using 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, which diffracted to 3.0 Å and belongs to the monoclinic space group P21. X-ray diffraction data were collected both at our in-house x-ray source, a Bruker M18XH6 MAC Science rotating anode interfaced to a Siemens X-1000 multiwire area detector and at the D03B protein crystallography beamline at the Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Síncrotron, Campinas, Brazil (11Polikarpov I.

Data reduction and processing were carried out with the programs MOSFLM, Scala, and Truncate from the CCP4 suite (12Navaza J.A.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), with the previously solved BLS structure as a search model. Crystallographic symmetry construction was carried out using the program O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Total accessible surface area and buried surface areas of interaction (ΔASA) between monomers and pentamers in pentamer and decamer structures, respectively, were calculated with Surface Racer 1.2 program (14Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) using an implementation of the Lee and Richards (15Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol.

Intermolecular polar and non-polar interactions were calculated with the Molmol 2k.2 (16Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and Contacts of Structural Units (17Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) programs. Any pair of atoms is considered to be in contact if the distance between them is less than 4 Å. BLS Is a Stable Dimer of Pentamers in Solution—Previous studies (6Braden B.C. Velikovsky C.A. Cauerhff A.A. Polikarpov I. Goldbaum F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Goldbaum F.A. Velikovsky C.A. Baldi P.C. Mortl S. Bacher A. Fossati C.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that BLS does not assemble as a 1-MDa capsid oligomer, having a retention time in SEC compatible with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa. This behavior suggested that the oligomeric structure of this protein in solution was a pentamer. However, the estimation of the molecular weight of a protein by its retention time on a SEC column is a method prone to artifacts. Additionally, the sequence divergence of BLS, compared with other pentameric LS, prompted us to re-analyze the quaternary structure of the protein by spectroscopic techniques such as static light scattering (SLS). SLS experiments show that the protein has a molecular mass of 180 kDa in solution, corresponding to an assembly of two pentamers (decameric arrangement of the 18-kDa polypeptide chain). To characterize this new quaternary arrangement, we studied the thermodynamic stability of BLS, evaluating the unfolding of the protein induced by the common chemical denaturants (urea and GdnHCl) and pH. Preincubation of BLS with increasing concentrations of urea shows that the enzyme remains as a stable dimer of pentamers, with no detectable change in its quaternary structure (180 kDa, determined by SLS, data not shown) as well as in its tertiary and secondary structures as followed by tryptophan fluorescence and CD (Fig. 1). The absence of structural changes, even in 8 m urea, indicates that the quaternary arrangement of BLS is very stable. Conversely, GdnHCl produces a cooperative and reversible change in the tertiary structure reflected by a decrease in tryptophan fluorescence emission (Fig. 1A). This measure senses the environment of Trp-22, the unique tryptophan in BLS monomers that is located on the active site at the monomer-monomer interface (6Braden B.C. Velikovsky C.A. Cauerhff A.A. Polikarpov I. Goldbaum F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, GdnHCl incubation (6 m) produces a complete loss of secondary structure of BLS as monitored by CD spectra (Fig. 1B). The differential effect of GdnHCl and urea cannot be explained by their differences in ionic strength. The behavior of BLS in 8.0 m urea and in the presence of 1 m NaCl is superimposable with its described stability in absence of salt (data not shown), implying that unfolding with GdnHCl seems to be due to more specific interactions of the guanidinium cation with the protein (18Botelho M.G. Gralle M. Oliveira C.L. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34259-34267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Kohn W.D. Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25495-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, we used GdnHCl-induced denaturation to study the mechanism of BLS unfolding. Dissociation of BLS Dimer of Pentamers Is Tight and Precedes the Unfolding of the Pentamer—SLS analysis of the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of BLS shows a biphasic behavior (Fig. 2A). In the first step, observed between 1.5 and 2.2 m GdnHCl, the SLS signal intensity of the protein is reduced to half the value measured in the absence of denaturant. However, no changes in the far-UV CD spectra and tryptophan fluorescence of the protein are observed in this range (Figs. 1A and 2A). Thus, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is completely insensitive to the change in the quaternary structure of the protein, indicating that the dissociation does not modify significantly the environment of Trp-22. These results point to the existence of a dissociation phenomenon of the decameric structure of BLS into two pentameric subunits, with no further changes in tertiary and secondary structure. On the other hand, the second step observed between 2.4 and 3.5 m GdnHCl, shows a 5-fold decrease in the SLS signal of BLS concomitantly to the disappearance of its far-UV CD signal at 222 nm, and a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of its single tryptophan residue (Figs. 1A and 2A). These results are interpreted as an unfolding and loss of the tertiary and secondary structures of the protein coupled to the dissociation of its pentameric arrangement in five monomeric subunits (18 kDa). The overlapping of the changes observed in the second step by SLS, CD (Fig. 2A) and fluorescence (Fig. 1A) clearly supports our model. These results were further verified by SLS coupled to gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2B), where it was possible to isolate a 90-kDa intermediate at 2 m GdnHCl. The fact that an intermediate of 90 kDa is stable enough to be detected by this methodology suggests that the decameric assembly is composed of two previously associated pentamers. The dissociation of the decamer to folded pentamers is also observed when BLS is incubated at acidic pH (Fig. 3). This phenomenon is evidenced by a 2-fold decrease in the SLS signal intensity in the range of pH 4.0–5.0 as compared with the value measured at pH 7.0. ANS binds to exposed hydrophobic surfaces in partially folded intermediates with higher affinity than to native or completely unfolded proteins (20Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 21Daniel E. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22D'Alfonso L. Collini M. Baldini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This binding result in a marked increase in fluorescence emission compared with the free ANS. We found that the dissociation of BLS at pH in the range 6.0–4.0 is a reversible process that occurs without significant exposure of hydrophobic patches and changes in secondary structure as monitored by ANS fluorescence and CD spectra (Fig. 3). At pHs below 4.0 the protein shows an irreversible unfolding, evidenced by a loss of ellipticity at 222 nm and a dramatic increase in binding to ANS. Clearly, both changes are coupled, implying that at acidic pHs the protein exposes hydrophobic surfaces when secondary structure is lost. The light scattering response cannot be accurately monitored below pH 4.0, presumably because of aggregation. Thermodynamic Stability of BLS Measured by Chemical Denaturation—To describe the thermodynamic stability of BLS, we studied the dissociation and unfolding steps taking advantage of the differential effect of GdnHCl at distinct concentration ranges. Both transitions (Steps 1 and 2) were shown to be highly cooperative and reversible. The dissociation step was characterized by SLS using GdnHCl up to 2.2 m, in a condition that does not disturb the tertiary and secondary structures of the pentamer. This assumption is supported by the facts that the circular dichroism spectrum is not modified (see Fig. 2A) and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence does not vary upon addition of GdnHCl (see Fig. 1A). The SLS determination of the equilibrium between the dimer of pentamers and the pentamer gives a ΔG of 90 ± 20 kJ/mol decamer as estimated by the LEM method assuming a two-state transition (see “Experimental Procedures”). This value indicates that the protein remains as a decamer under physiological conditions (estimated KD = 2.48 × 10-16m). On the other hand, the transition from folded pentamer to unfolded monomers is a highly cooperative process that can be measured by GdnHCl denaturation at higher concentrations followed by tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1A), SLS, and circular dichroism (Fig. 2A). These signals show a sharp and overlapping change around 2.4–3.5 m GdnHCl. Thus, all three spectroscopic analyses rule out the existence of a populated intermediate during this transition. The dependence of [D]50% with protein concentration (Table I) clearly supports the model of a two-state transition from a folded pentamer to unfolded monomers. Thermodynamic analysis of this equilibrium shows that the ΔG is 330 ± 30 kJ/mol pentamer (Table I; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In agreement with this analysis, GdnHCl denaturation of BLS previously incubated at pH 5.0 (as a dissociated pentamer, see Fig. 3), gives a"

Quantitative assessment of GUS activity in seeds bearing the promoter mutants indicated that both sequence and spacing of the TATA elements influenced the efficiency of transcription. Substitution, insertion or deletion mutations had no effect on histochemical staining patterns indicating that strict spacing requirements are not essential for correct spatial expression of phas during embryogenesis. Further evaluation of the phas promoter by in vitro transcription analysis revealed the presence of multiple TATA-dependent transcription initiation start sites. The distance between TATA elements and transcription start sites was maintained in insertion and deletion mutants through the creation of novel initiation sites, indicating that positioning of the TATA elements rather than DNA sequence was the primary determinant of start site location. We conclude that, while dispensable for proper spatial distribution, the complex architecture of the phas promoter is required to ensure high levels of accurate phas transcription initiation in the developing embryo. The β-phaseolin (phas) gene, which encodes one of the major seed storage proteins of P. vulgaris, is tightly regulated at the transcription level resulting in strict tissue-specific and spatial expression during embryonic development. The phas proximal promoter contains a complex arrangement of core promoter elements including three TATA boxes as well as several putative initiator elements. To delineate the respective contributions of the core promoter elements to transcription initiation we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of the phas promoter.

We conclude that, while dispensable for proper spatial distribution, the complex architecture of the phas promoter is required to ensure high levels of accurate phas transcription initiation in the developing embryo. The proximal promoter region of a gene contains core promoter elements that determine the basal transcription activity of the gene and typically direct the positioning of the transcription initiation start site. Three different classes of transcription initiation elements have been identified in eukaryotes: TATA boxes, initiator (Inr) 1The abbreviations used are: Inr, initiator; DPE, downstream promoter element; phas, β-phaseolin; TBP, TATA-binding protein; hTBP, human TATA-binding protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence. elements and downstream promoter elements (DPE). To date, only TATA boxes and Inr elements have been identified in plant promoters. All three elements utilize similar mechanisms of initiation requiring RNA polymerase II and sequence-specific binding of transcription factor IID (1Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, mechanistic differences exist between the different initiation elements. TATA-containing promoters can function in the absence of an Inr, whereas DPE promoters are Inr-dependent; TATA box directed transcription occurs on average 25–30 bp downstream of the TATA box while Inr driven transcription typically originates at the adenosine residue in the +1 position of the Inr element itself (2O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the Drosophila and human genomes indicates that only a minority of promoters contain the classical arrangement of one TATA box and one Inr element (3Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Burke T.W. Willy P.J. Kutach A.K. Butler J.E. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The remaining promoters contain varying combinations of TATA, Inr, and DPE elements. It remains unclear, however, what role this core promoter diversity plays in transcription regulation. Originally core promoter elements were thought to mediate basal transcription whereas gene-specific upstream regulatory elements were responsible for directing regulated gene expression. However, recent studies with both plant and animal genes have demonstrated that core promoter elements can play an integral role in both environmentally induced and developmentally regulated gene expression (1Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Recently, developmental stage-specific recruitment of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) has been demonstrated for the human γ-globin gene (5Duan Z.J. Fang X. Rohde A. Han H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Li Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5509-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and light-induced expression of the TATA-less photosystem I gene psaDb was found to be Inr-dependent (6Nakamura M. Tsunoda T. Obokata J. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several plant and animal promoters have been identified which contain multiple TATA boxes (7Yamada M. Ozawa A. Ishii S. Shibusawa N. Hashida T. Ishizuka T. Hosoya T. Monden T. Satoh T. Mori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Doyle M.C. Han I.S. Mol. Cells. 2001; 12: 197-203PubMed Google Scholar). Although the benefit, if any, of having more than one TBP binding site has not been well documented, recent analysis of the tubulin promoter in soybean indicates that the two TATA boxes present in this promoter function additively to direct transcription in seedlings. Interestingly, these two TATA boxes are differentially sensitive to light conditions (8Doyle M.C. Han I.S. Mol. Cells. 2001; 12: 197-203PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that, in the case of tubulin, the multiple TATA boxes play a role not only in directing high levels of transcription but also provide a mechanism for titrating gene activity in response to altered environmental conditions. Finally, recent enhancer-trapping studies in Drosophila (9Kadonaga J.T. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Butler J.E. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and analysis of upstream activating sequences (UAS) in yeast (11Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Zhu X. Li L. Shen W.C. Dixit B.L. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1240-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) indicate that many enhancers and UAS preferentially activate select groups of core promoters, suggesting that the composition of a core promoter may restrict its responsiveness to specific transcription regulators. These studies, along with the recent identification of several general transcription factors that regulate a distinct subset of genes in a developmental-specific manner (12Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that core promoter elements play a more active role in determining gene expression patterns than previously expected. Core promoter diversity may thus provide an additional level of transcription control beyond that achieved with upstream regulatory elements. We have employed the seed storage protein gene β-phaseolin (phas) as a model for understanding how core promoter elements participate in the regulation of plant gene expression. The phas gene is under strict developmental and tissue-specific control (14Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Bustos M.M. Begum D. Kalkan F.A. Battraw M.J. Hall T.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), primarily at the level of transcription initiation (16Li G. Chandrasekharan M.B. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The AT rich proximal promoter region of phas contains a complex array of transcription initiation regulatory elements within 45 bp of the transcription start site. These elements include two consensus TATA boxes (termed TATA1 and TATA2), a third non-canonical TATA box (TATA3) as well as two putative Inr elements (located at -9 and +1) based on sequence homology to a consensus mammalian Inr element (1Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 17Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). TATA1 and TATA2 conform to the consensus for dicot TATA boxes (TATAA/TA) and are predicted to be equally capable of directing high levels of transcription (18Joshi C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6643-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The divergent TATA3 (TAATAT), however, would not be expected to participate significantly in transcription initiation (19Juo Z.S. Chiu T.K. Leiberman P.M. Baikalov I. Berk A.J. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In plant promoters, as in animal promoters, there is strong conservation of spacing (25–30 bp) between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site; however, due to the paucity of plant promoter studies, the role of core element spacing in both location and intensity of transcription initiation remains uncertain. Here, we have employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro transcription analyses to determine the respective roles of the phas core promoter elements in directing basal transcription. The detection of multiple phas mRNAs with variable 5′ ends in vivo (21Slightom J.L. Drong R.F. Klassy R.C. Hoffman L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6483-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggested the existence of several functional transcription initiation sites. We show here that both the sequence and spacing of the TATA elements is critical for high levels of accurately initiated transcription. Mutation analysis revealed that TATA1 is responsible for directing faithful initiation at the secondary transcription start site (-12) while TATA2 is required for transcription from the primary transcription start site (+1). TATA3 was found to be completely dispensable for transcription initiation. In the absence of a functional TATA box, the two putative Inr elements were insufficient to direct transcription suggesting either that these are not functional Inr elements or that they fall into the class of weak Inr elements which function solely to augment promoter strength of TATA-containing constructs. Further mutagenesis of the Inr elements themselves will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. Analysis of insertion and deletion mutants revealed a dependence on TATA spacing for accurate and efficient transcription initiation and suggested that the multiple TATA boxes function cooperatively to enhance phas transcription. The respective role of each TATA box was confirmed by parallel studies performed on Arabidopsis seeds harboring the TATA mutants. We conclude that the complex architecture of the TATA region of the phas promoter is not essential for maintaining spatially regulated expression of phas during embryogenesis, but is required to ensure high levels of phas message production during development. Mutagenesis—Except for TATA3, the mutations shown in Fig. 2 were introduced into the TATA elements within the -295 to +34 region of the phas promoter present in -295phas/pPCR-Script (14Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using Mega-primer PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (22Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Products obtained following two rounds of amplification were ligated to an SrfI-digested vector (pPCR-Script® (Amp) SK+: Stratagene Inc.). The TATA3 mutant was generated using a QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.) with -295phas/pPCR-Script as the DNA template. Incorporation of the mutations into the specific cis-elements and the integrity of the other regions of the promoter were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid Constructions—Promoter fragments bearing mutations in the TATA region were digested with HindIII and NcoI, and ligated to HindIII/NcoI-digested vector -295phas-gus-3′/pUC (14Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the constructs were digested with HindIII and EcoRI to release fragments containing the mutant -295phas promoter, reporter gene and the 3′ region. The fragments were fused to HindIII/EcoRI-digested plant transformation vector pHM301K. The vector pHM301K is a derivative of pCB301 (23Xiang C. Han P. Lutziger I. Wang K. Oliver D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), modified to include a CaMV35S-nptII-nos3′ cassette and a polycloning site in an inverted orientation to that of the parent vector. The control, -295phas-gus-3′phas fragment (3.4 kb) was excised from the vector -295phas-gus-3′phas/pUC19 using HindIII and EcoRI. The fragment was then mobilized into HindIII and EcoRI-digested pHM301K to obtain -295phas-gus-3′phas/HM301K. Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation—The promoter-gus fusions mTATA1-gus, mTATA2-gus, mTATA123-gus, mTATAΔ4-gus, mTATA5AT-gus, mTATA10GC-gus, and -295phas-gus in pHM301K were mobilized into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 and grown to saturation in LB medium containing gentamicin (30 mg/liter) and kanamycin (30 mg/liter) for plant transformation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Columbia) were transformed using vacuum infiltration (24Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). The T1 seeds were surface-sterilized using 50% bleach and plated on MS medium containing 1× B5 vitamins, kanamycin (50 mg/liter), and Timentin (ticarcillin disodium and clauvulanate potassium: SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA; 150 mg/liter). Two weeks after plating, putative transformants (kanamycin-resistant seedlings, T1 plants) were transferred to fresh MS medium containing 1× B5 vitamins and antibiotics, and grown until they formed rosette leaves. The plants were subsequently transferred individually to soil in pots and grown to maturity in the greenhouse. The T2 seeds were collected from the dried siliques of individual transformants. Several individual homozygous or heterozygous lines were established for various phas/gus constructs. Genomic DNA blots were performed to determine the copy number of T-DNA insertions in the transgenic plants. Assays for β-Glucuronidase Activity—For histochemical staining, Arabidopsis embryos were dissected from T2 seeds ∼12–15 days after flowering. For each construct, embryos were dissected from at least 4 different lines bearing a single-copy insert of -295phas-gus and the mutant derivatives. For each line, ∼30 embryos from 4–5 siliques were dissected. The embryos were stained in GUS staining solution at 37 °C according to the method of Jefferson et al. (25Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (8307) Google Scholar). Incubation ranged from 15 min to overnight, depending on the promoter construct present. After staining, embryos were removed from the staining solution and immersed in 95% ethanol to remove chlorophyll. Images of the stained embryos were captured using a Zeiss SV11 microscope fitted with an AxioCam HRc camera. GUS-specific fluorescence was determined according to (25Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (8307) Google Scholar) and activity was calculated as nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone/h/μg of protein using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. Protein estimation was performed as described by Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Three independent fluorimetric assays were performed for dry T2 seeds from several individual lines of Arabidopsis for each construct (Table I). Statistical analyses of the data were performed according to the method of Nap et al. (27Nap J.-P. Keizer P. Jansen R. Plant Mol. Biol.

Unless otherwise noted, all in vitro transcription reactions were performed with 500 ng of template DNA. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared exactly as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (29Workman J.L. Abmayr S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

Final protein concentration ranged from 5 to 10 mg/ml. Phas promoter activity in HeLa extract was found to be dose-dependent on addition of human TBP (hTBP). All in vitro transcription reactions were supplemented with recombinant hTBP (ProteinOne Inc., College Park, MD) to a final concentration of 0.4 ng/μl. In vitro transcription reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Primer Extension Analysis—RNA products were purified and analyzed by primer extension using a radiolabeled DNA primer (5′-CAGACTGAATGCCCACAGGCCG-3′) complementary to bp +105 to +84 of the -295phas-gus DNA template as described previously (28Crowe A.J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. Each mutant was analyzed in at least three independent in vitro transcription reactions. Quantification was performed using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager with ImageQuant v1.2 software. Multiple TATA Elements Are Not Essential for Spatial Expression but Are Required for High Levels of Transcriptional Activity from the phas Promoter—The presence of three phased TATA elements within the phas promoter prompted an evaluation of their respective contributions to tissue-specificity and spatial distribution during embryogenesis. Substitution mutations were made in individual TATA elements (Fig. 1) and the ability of debilitated promoters (mTATA1 and mTATA2) to drive expression of the reporter gene (gus) was assessed in seeds and embryos of stably-transformed Arabidopsis plants. As shown in Fig. 2, histochemical staining patterns for embryos harboring mTATA1-gus (B)or mTATA2-gus (C) were similar to that obtained for embryos bearing the -295phas-gus control (A). The absence of GUS expression in the radicle is consistent with earlier findings that expression in this region is mediated by distal regulatory elements upstream of bp -295 (14Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As with -295phas-gus control plants, no GUS expression could be detected in leaves of the stably transformed Arabidopsis plants harboring the TATA mutants (data not shown). Conservation of the wild type staining pattern indicates that both tissue-specific expression and modular expression of phas within the embryo are not dependent on core promoter organization. To identify any potential contributions from TATA-independent transcription, a mutant derivative of -295phas promoter bearing mutations in all three TATA elements (mTATA123) was generated (Fig. 1). Given the importance of TATA elements in transcriptional initiation, we anticipated that debilitation of all three TATA elements would completely abrogate transcription from the phas promoter. This was essentially confirmed by the absence of GUS expression in embryos harboring mTATA123-gus, except for a faint staining in cotyledons upon prolonged incubation (>5 h) in the X-gluc substrate (Fig. 2E). This faint staining was not observed for non-transgenic embryos (Fig. 2F). This qualitative assessment suggested that while tissue-specific and spatial positioning are maintained in the TATA mutants, high levels of phas expression require the presence of at least one functioning TATA box. In order to asses the quantitative contribution of individual TATA elements to overall promoter activity, GUS activity was evaluated in seeds bearing each of the TATA mutants. As shown in Table I, mutation of TATA1 or TATA2 yielded 33 and 54%, respectively, of the GUS activity obtained for the -295phas-gus control. The statistically significant reduction in GUS activity due to these mutations indicates that both TATA1 and TATA2 contribute to the overall high level of expression from the phas promoter. As predicted from the histochemical analysis, mutation of all three TATA boxes essentially eliminated phas promoter activity. The minimal (∼4%) activity shown for mTATA123-gus plants suggests that, in vivo, a cryptic cis-element or Inr site may be utilized in the absence of TATA elements to initiate low levels of transcription. The 68% reduction in GUS activity for seeds of mTATA1-gus lines as compared with the 46% reduction in GUS activity observed for mTATA2-gus, suggested that TATA1 was functionally more important than TATA2. However, statistical analyses (two sample Student's t test) of the pairwise comparison of GUS activity values for the seeds of transgenic lines bearing mTATA1-gus and mTATA2-gus yielded a p value of 0.1 (data not shown), indicating that any ascribed functional hierarchy to the TATA elements is statistically insignificant. Spacing of TATA Elements Influences phas Promoter Activity—The role of TATA element spacing relative to each other and to the transcription start site was evaluated by deletion of 4 bp between TATA2 and TATA3 (mTATAΔ4-gus; Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2D, the embryos harboring the deletion derivative displayed a staining pattern similar to that obtained for the embryos bearing the control -295phas-gus (Fig. 2A). However, quantitative fluorimetric MUG assays indicated that the juxtaposition of TATA2 and TATA3 caused a statistically significant 63% reduction in GUS activity relative to control. Thus, disruption of spacing between the TATA elements did not greatly affect spatial regulation during embryogenesis, but did severely inhibit overall promoter activity. To further explore how TATA box spacing contributed to phas promoter regulation, we generated two additional spacing mutants, mTATA5AT-gus and mTATA10GC-gus, which contain insertions between TATA1 and TATA2 of 5 and 10 bp, respectively (Fig. 1). Interestingly, quantitative evaluation of GUS activity in embryos harboring these mutants (Table I) suggests that the two insertion mutants have distinct effects on phas activity. Introduction of 10 bp in the mTATA10GC-gus mutant enhanced promoter activity relative to the -295phas-gus control whereas the 5 bp insertion (mTATA5AT-gus) caused a slight, although statistically insignificant, reduction in total activity. The relative positioning of TATA elements to each other and to the site of transcription initiation thus can have a substantial impact on phas promoter strength. Reconstitution of phas Transcription in Vitro—To further analyze the role of phas promoter architecture on the accuracy and intensity of transcription initiation, we established phas transcription in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, in vitro transcription of increasing concentrations of -295phas-gus DNA in HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with hTBP demonstrated DNA template-dependent transcription. The observed sensitivity to low levels of α-amanitin (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 8 and 9) suggests that the transcription products are RNA polymerase II-specific (31Lindell T.J. Weinberg F. Morris P.W.

https://openalex.org/W2004300505,"We have analyzed the in vitro disassembly of the capsid of the minute virus of mice, and the stability of capsid chimeras carrying heterologous epitope insertions. Upon heating in a physiological buffer, empty capsids formed by 60 copies of protein VP2 underwent first a reversible conformational change with a small enthalpy change detected by fluorescence. This change was associated with, but not limited to, externalization of the VP2 N terminus. Irreversible capsid dissociation as detected by changes in fluorescence, hemagglutination activity, and electrophoretic mobility occurred at much higher temperatures. Differential scanning calorimetry in the same conditions indicated that the dissociation/denaturation transition involved a high enthalpy change and proceeded through one or more intermediates. In contrast, in the presence of 1.5 m guanidinium chloride, heat-induced disassembly fitted a two-state irreversible process. Both thermally and chemically induced dissociation/denaturation yielded a form that had lost a part of the tertiary structure, but still retained the native secondary structure. Data from chemical dissociation indicates this form may correspond to a molten globule-like monomeric state of the capsid protein. All five antigenic peptide insertions attempted in exposed loops, despite being perhaps among the least disruptive, led to defects in folding/assembly of the capsid and, in most cases, to reduced capsid stability against thermal dissociation. The results with one of the simplest viral capsids reveal a complex pathway for disassembly, and a reduction in capsid assembly and stability upon insertion of peptides, even within the most exposed capsid loops. We have analyzed the in vitro disassembly of the capsid of the minute virus of mice, and the stability of capsid chimeras carrying heterologous epitope insertions. Upon heating in a physiological buffer, empty capsids formed by 60 copies of protein VP2 underwent first a reversible conformational change with a small enthalpy change detected by fluorescence. This change was associated with, but not limited to, externalization of the VP2 N terminus. Irreversible capsid dissociation as detected by changes in fluorescence, hemagglutination activity, and electrophoretic mobility occurred at much higher temperatures. Differential scanning calorimetry in the same conditions indicated that the dissociation/denaturation transition involved a high enthalpy change and proceeded through one or more intermediates. In contrast, in the presence of 1.5 m guanidinium chloride, heat-induced disassembly fitted a two-state irreversible process. Both thermally and chemically induced dissociation/denaturation yielded a form that had lost a part of the tertiary structure, but still retained the native secondary structure. Data from chemical dissociation indicates this form may correspond to a molten globule-like monomeric state of the capsid protein. All five antigenic peptide insertions attempted in exposed loops, despite being perhaps among the least disruptive, led to defects in folding/assembly of the capsid and, in most cases, to reduced capsid stability against thermal dissociation. The results with one of the simplest viral capsids reveal a complex pathway for disassembly, and a reduction in capsid assembly and stability upon insertion of peptides, even within the most exposed capsid loops. The study of the folding, association, and disassembly of large multimeric proteins is complicated by their size, the general irreversibility of the reactions involved, and the frequent occurrence of off-pathway intermediates. However, the significant advances already made hold promise for a detailed understanding of these processes (1Jaenicke R. Lilie H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 329-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Spherical virus capsids are large, multimeric proteins (2Liljas L. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

In addition, viral capsids are highly dynamic entities and have evolved unique structural solutions in response to the diverse, sometimes conflicting functions they must perform during the virus life cycle (4Chiu W.

Thus, they provide good opportunities to understand finely tuned structure-function relationships in proteins and to develop new antiviral approaches based on the inhibition of assembly or uncoating (15Rossmann M.G.

VP2 is the major capsid protein and can self-assemble into empty (DNA-free) capsids (viral-like particles or VLPs). 1The abbreviations used are: VLP, viral-like particle; CPV, canine parvovirus; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; MVM, minute virus of mice; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tm is the half-transition temperature except for DSC analyses where it denotes the temperature of the maximum in the heat capacity function and may equate or be higher than the half-transition temperature, depending on the denaturation mechanism. VP1, a minor component of natural capsids, includes the VP2 sequence plus an N-terminal extension. VP3 is produced only in assembled virions by the proteolytic removal of a short N-terminal segment in a fraction of VP2 subunits (25Muzyczka N. Berns K.I. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields' Virology. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2361-2380Google Scholar). The structure, stability, and other physical and antigenic properties of empty capsids of parvoviruses containing only VP2 are very similar to those of native capsids containing also VP1 (26Hernando E.

Almendral, unpublished observations. Such VLPs thus constitute very simple models to study the mechanisms of assembly, stability, and disassembly of parvoviruses and of large macromolecular assemblies in general. In vivo, assembly of autonomous parvoviruses may proceed through a trimeric intermediate (20Wu H. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol.

Uncoating may involve acidification at the endosomes (29Basak S. Turner H. Virology. 1992; 186: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Ros C. Burckhardt C.J. Kempf C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12634-12645Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the disassembly pathway is also unclear. In vitro, urea- or pH-induced disassembly of virions or empty capsids of the canine parvovirus (CPV) led to subunits of heterogeneous size (31Yuan W. Parrish C.R. Virology. 2001; 279: 546-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Heating of virions of the minute virus of mice (MVM) retarded their electrophoretic mobility, increased the susceptibility of the viral DNA to nuclease attack, and led to exposure of the VP1 N terminus and, finally, to capsid dissociation into monomers as deduced from electrophoretic analysis (32Cotmore S.F. D-Abramo Jr., A.M. Ticknor C.M. Tattersall P. Virology. 1999; 254: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Native empty capsids as well as VLPs of MVM subjected to high temperatures (70 °C) externalized the VP2 N terminus prior to dissociation (26Hernando E. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Foces-Foces C. McKenna R. Portman I. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. Virology. 2000; 267: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite the progress made, assembly and uncoating of parvoviruses, or of many other viruses, are incompletely understood. Chimeric parvoviral VLPs and other viral capsids carrying heterologous epitopes derived from diverse pathogens hold considerable promise to develop new vaccines (reviewed in Refs. 33Burke K.L.

Parvovirus capsids present large loops where insertions can be made, and are extremely stable against heat and other denaturing agents. However, large deletions in three exposed loops on the surface of VLPs from CPV seriously impaired expression and assembly (44Hurtado A. Rueda P. Nowicky J. Sarraseca J. Casal I. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5422-5429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion in these loops of a 10- to 13-mer amino acid peptide, avoiding deletion of any capsid residue, allowed the recovery of chimeric VLPs but they were obtained, at least in some cases, in reduced amounts (43Rueda P. Hurtado A. del Barrio M. Martínez-Torrecuadrada J.L. Kamstrup S. Leclerc C. Casal J.I. Virology. 1999; 263: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Likewise, the capsids of the adeno-associated parvovirus were obtained in reduced yields and showed functional constraints when short peptides were inserted with the purpose to alter tissue tropism (45Wu P. Xiao W. Conlon T. Hughes J. Agbandje-McKenna M. Ferkol T. Flotte T. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8635-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 46Douar A.M. Poulard K. Danos O. Virology. 2003; 309: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reduced titers or fitness of virus chimeras, or low production of chimeric particles, have been repeatedly noted (e.g. Refs. 43Rueda P. Hurtado A. del Barrio M. Martínez-Torrecuadrada J.L. Kamstrup S. Leclerc C. Casal J.I. Virology. 1999; 263: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 47Murray M.G. Kuhn R.J. Arita M. Kawamura N. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 9: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the complex oligomeric nature of viral capsids, even the least disruptive peptide insertions could have negative effects on assembly and/or decrease capsid stability against dissociation. However, to our knowledge the effect on the thermostability of any viral capsid of peptide insertions has remained essentially untested to date. We have chosen the empty, VP2-only capsid of the parvovirus MVM as a model of icosahedral virus capsids and other macromolecular assemblies. Biochemical and biophysical techniques were used here to provide further insights on the in vitro stability and disassembly of one of the simplest viral capsids, and to analyze the effects on capsid stability against dissociation of rationally designed heterologous insertions in surface loops. Recombinant Plasmids—Plasmid pSVTK-VP1/VP2 included the VP1/VP2 gene of MVMp and was derived from a molecular clone of the MVMp genome (51Ramírez J.C. Santaren J.F. Almendral J.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The VP2-coding segment was amplified, using PCR and oligonucleotides with flanking BamHI and XhoI sites. The purified DNA segment and vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) were digested with BamHI and XhoI, re-purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The recombinant plasmid (pFB1-VP2) was obtained from transformed Escherichia coli DH5α, and the inserted VP2 gene and flanking segments were sequenced using an automated method. The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) was then used to construct a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) containing the VP2 gene, using pFB1-VP2 as the donor plasmid (52Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The manufacturer instructions were followed with minor modifications. The recombinant bacmid, BM-VP2, was isolated from a positive bacterial colony, and purified following a modified alkaline lysis procedure. The VP2 segment in BM-VP2 was also sequenced. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced in pFB1-VP2 and pSVTK-VP1/VP2 by the inverse PCR method using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Insertions were introduced by either of two methods: (i) a unique restriction site was created in pFB1-VP2 at the chosen insertion site on VP2. Partially overlapping oligonucleotides were used to obtain by PCR a DNA segment containing the sequence to be inserted, flanked at both ends by the appropriate restriction site. This DNA segment was purified, digested with the corresponding restriction endonuclease, and ligated with pFB1-VP2 previously digested with the same nuclease, dephosphorylated and purified (53Casal J.I. Rueda P. Hurtado A. Methods. 1999; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (ii) Alternatively, mutagenesis was by inverse PCR on pFB1-VP2 or pSVTK-VP1/VP2 using the QuikChange system, but following a modified procedure (54Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) optimized for long oligonucleotides. Each mutation introduced was confirmed by sequencing. Expression of VLPs in Insect Cells—About 3 × 105 H-5 cells from semiconfluent monolayers were resuspended in 2 ml of TC-100 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and adsorbed in a single well from a M6 tissue culture plate at 27 °C for 1 h. The medium was removed, the cells were washed with TC-100, and 1 ml of transfection mixture (20 μl of BM-VP2 DNA, 6 μl of Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) and 174 μl of TC-100, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and diluted with 800 μl of TC-100) was added. After further incubation at 27 °C for 5 h, the transfection mixture was removed and 2 ml of TC-100 + 5% fetal calf serum were added. The cells were incubated at 27 °C until nearly complete cytopathic effect (about 6 days). The cell suspension was collected and microcentrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at -70 °C as a source of recombinant baculovirus. Titration of baculovirus was carried out as described (55Carrascosa A.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 1078-1085PubMed Google Scholar); the titer obtained was around 1 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml. The cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for VP2 expression. The recombinant baculovirus obtained was used to infect 70% confluent H-5 monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of about 0.01–0.1 in 175-cm2 flasks, and the cells were incubated at 27 °C for 4 days, harvested, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at -70 °C as a source of recombinant baculovirus (titer around 2–4 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml). The cell pellet was resuspended in the same volume of PBS and centrifuged again. The washed pellet was then thoroughly resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EDTA), and frozen at -70 °C as a source of MVM capsids. For large scale capsid production, modifications included the use of 80% confluent H-5 cells, a multiplicity of infection around 1, and harvesting after complete cytopathic effect (3 days post-infection, a time when VP2 expression reached a maximum). Purification and Sedimentation Analysis of VLPs—The procedure was derived from that described in Ref. 26Hernando E. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Foces-Foces C. McKenna R. Portman I. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. Virology. 2000; 267: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Except where indicated, all steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Frozen infected cell extracts were thawed, sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 15 min). The supernatant was loaded in centrifuge tubes containing 1.6-ml density cushions (20% sucrose in PBS) and centrifuged at 10 °C in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) (16,000 rpm, 21.5 h). Each pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and microcentrifuged. For some preparations, the capsid was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate (53Casal J.I. Rueda P. Hurtado A. Methods. 1999; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) instead of centrifuged through a sucrose cushion. In either case, the concentrated capsid solution was loaded on a 12-ml density gradient (10–40% sucrose in PBS) and centrifuged at 5 °C in a SW40 rotor (30,000 rpm, 5.5 h). Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Those that contained capsids were pooled, extensively dialyzed against PBS and either kept at 4 °C or stored at -70 °C. For further purification, the capsids were centrifuged in a cesium chloride gradient in PBS (average density 1.38 g cm-3) for 29.5 h at 10 °C and 50,000 rpm in a TFT75.13 rotor (Kontron). Capsid-containing fractions (density 1.32 g cm-3) were pooled and extensively dialyzed against PBS. As a final step, capsids were subjected to size exclusion chromatography in Sephacryl S-500HR as described below, and capsid-containing fractions were pooled. When needed, VLP preparations were concentrated by ultrafiltration in Centricon 100 units (Amicon). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and UV spectrophotometry, and the capsid (monomer) concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm ϵ280 = 114,160 m-1 cm-1 (56Mach H. Volkin D.B. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Shirley B.A. Protein Folding and Stability: Theory and Practice. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 91-114Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD measurements were carried out using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a computer-operated Peltier temperature control unit. Purified VLP preparations at a protein (monomer) concentration of 5 μm in a 1-mm path length cell were used. The recorded far-UV spectra were the average of 3–5 scans obtained at a rate of 50 nm/min, a response time of 2 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The temperature was kept constant at 25 °C. Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out using the temperature scan mode and measuring the ellipticity in the far-UV at 215 nm. A temperature scan rate of 20 °C/h, a response time of 2 s, and a band width of 1 nm were used. Temperature was monitored by a thermocouple in the cuvette holder block. The temperature values were validated using a probe inside the cell. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A Varian Cary Eclipse luminescence spectrophotometer equipped with a computer-operated Peltier temperature control unit was used. Purified VLP solutions at a defined protein (monomer) concentration (usually 0.5 μm) in a 2-mm path length (2 × 10 mm) cell were irradiated with UV light using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. 5-nm excitation and emission slit widths were used, and emission spectra were collected from 310 to 400 nm. In thermal denaturation experiments, the temperature was continuously increased at a constant rate (6–60 °C/h depending on the experiment), and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm was determined at 1 °C (or 0.5 °C) intervals. The fluorescence intensity changes observed were fitted to sigmoidal, cooperative transitions using the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). Use of frozen instead of fresh samples did not significantly affect the Tm obtained. Actual temperatures inside the cuvette were determined by using a submerged probe, and the registered (block) temperature corrected accordingly. Equilibrium data corresponding to the reversible transition observed were fitted to a simple cooperative unimolecular process using the program Kaleidagraph and the equation, I=((IA+mAT)+(IB+mBT)exp(-(ΔHTm(1-T/Tm)+ΔCp(T-Tm-Tln(T/Tm)))/(RTm)))/(1+exp(-(ΔHTm(1-T/Tm)+ΔCp(T-Tm-Tln(T/Tm)))/(RTm))) where I is the fluorescence intensity value at any given absolute temperature T, IA, and IB are, respectively, the fluorescence intensity values of the initial or final state extrapolated at T = 0 K, mA and mB are the slopes of the baselines preceding or following the transition region, Tm is the transition temperature, ΔHT the enthalpy change at Tm, ΔCp the heat capacity change, and R the gas constant. Dissociation/denaturation data in 1.5 m GdmHCl were fitted to an irreversible first-order, two-state process using the equation, I=(IB+mBT)-[(IB+mBT)-(IA+mAT)]exp[-exp[Eapp(T-Tm)/(RTm2)]](Eq. 2) which was derived following the procedure described by Sánchez-Ruiz (57Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) for the temperature dependence of heat capacity. Eapp is the apparent activation energy for the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Kinetic measurements were performed at temperatures between 60 and 80 °C, and data were collected every second. The experimental kinetic data were fitted to a single exponential, first-order decay curve using the equation, I=I0exp(-kt)+If where I is the fluorescence intensity at time t, I0 is the fluorescence intensity at t = 0, k is the dissociation rate constant, and If is the fluorescence intensity at infinite time. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Measurements were performed using a Microcal MCS instrument. Samples were in PBS with or without 1.5 m GdmHCl and were maintained under an extra constant pressure of 2 atm to prevent degassing during the scan. The MCS Observer and Origin software packages were used for data acquisition and analysis. The excess heat capacity functions were obtained after baseline subtraction of the buffer-buffer baseline. Protein samples for DSC were extensively dialyzed against the appropriate buffer, and the buffer from the last dialysis step used in the reference cell of the calorimeter and for running the buffer-buffer baseline. The apparent fraction of denatured protein, Fapp, at a given temperature was calculated as the fraction of heat evolved at this temperature. Thermal denaturation curves in 1.5 m GdmHCl were theoretically described in terms of the two-state first-order irreversible model (57Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) using the following equation. Cpex(T)=[ΔHTmEapp/(RTm2)]exp[Eapp(T-Tm)/(RTm2)]exp[-exp[Eapp(T-Tm)/(RTm2)]](Eq. 4) Where CPex(T) is the excess heat capacity value at temperature T. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—Aliquots (100 μl) of native or heat- or GdmHCl-treated VLPs were applied to analytical Sephacryl S-500HR or Superdex 200 HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration columns (1 × 24 cm) equilibrated with the appropriate buffer and eluted at 0.5 or 1 ml/min, respectively. Trypsin Sensitivity Assays—VLPs (1.5 μm final protein monomer concentration) supplemented with trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche) at a 1:5 (w/w) trypsin:capsid protein ratio were subjected to thermal denaturation in the spectrofluorimeter as described above, but using a scan rate of 6 °C/h (that did not affect the Tm of the transition observed by fluorescence). Aliquots were taken at specified temperatures, and the relative amounts of intact and N-terminal-cleaved VP2 were determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometry of the stained bands. In these experiments trypsin was in great excess and no correction for trypsin activity loss was needed to be made up to about 60 °C. Control experiments using bovine serum albumin showed that, at moderate temperatures, trypsin:protein ratios of about 1:100 in PBS or 2:1 in 1.5 m GdmHCl led to complete protein digestion. Thus, for trypsin sensitivity experiments in the presence of 1.5 m GdmHCl, a ratio of about 2:1 was used. Hemagglutination Activity and Gel Electrophoresis Assays—Aliquots of VLP suspensions taken at specified temperatures were serially diluted with PBS for standard hemagglutination activity assays. The titer (in hemagglutination units) was given as the reciprocal limiting dilution that caused hemag"
https://openalex.org/W2050037298,"The ATP dependence of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters has led to the widespread acceptance that these systems are unidirectional. Interestingly, in the presence of an inwardly directed ethidium concentration gradient in ATP-depleted cells of Lactococcus lactis, the ABC multidrug transporter LmrA mediated the reverse transport (or uptake) of ethidium with an apparent Kt of 2.0 μm. This uptake reaction was competitively inhibited by the LmrA substrate vinblastine and was significantly reduced by an E314A substitution in the membrane domain of the transporter. Similar to efflux, LmrA-mediated ethidium uptake was inhibited by the E512Q replacement in the Walker B region of the nucleotide-binding domain of the protein, which strongly reduced its drug-stimulated ATPase activity, consistent with published observations for other ABC transporters. The notion that ethidium uptake is coupled to the catalytic cycle in LmrA was further corroborated by studies in LmrA-containing cells and proteoliposomes in which reverse transport of ethidium was associated with the net synthesis of ATP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the conformational changes required for drug transport by LmrA are (i) not too far from equilibrium under ATP-depleted conditions to be reversed by appropriate changes in ligand concentrations and (ii) not necessarily coupled to ATP hydrolysis, but associated with a reversible catalytic cycle. These findings and their thermodynamic implications shed new light on the mechanism of energy coupling in ABC transporters and have implications for the development of new modulators that could enable reverse transport-associated drug delivery in cells through their ability to uncouple ATP binding/hydrolysis from multidrug efflux.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MD, membrane domain; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; a.u., arbitrary units. transporters utilize the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to translocate a wide variety of molecules (e.g. lipids, polysaccharides, proteins, small nutrients) across cellular membranes. These molecular pumps are found in all phyla and form one of the largest protein families (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are central to many inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Zellweger syndrome, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (2Borst P. Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The ABC superfamily also includes multidrug efflux proteins such as the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (also termed ABCB1), the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP1 (also termed ABCC1), and the breast cancer resistance protein (also termed ABCG2), the overexpression of which is a cause of resistance of human tumors to anticancer drugs (3Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Homologs of human P-glycoprotein are found in prokaryotic organisms (4van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); and among these, LmrA in Lactococcus lactis represents a useful model for P-glycoprotein (5van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), as LmrA can functionally substitute for its medically important counterpart in human lung fibroblast cells (6van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are minimally composed of four domains: two hydrophobic integral membrane domains (MDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (7Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In the P-glycoprotein MDR1 gene, the four domains are encoded on a single polypeptide, whereas in lmrA, a single MD is fused to a single NBD. To comprise the four core domains, the half-transporter LmrA has been shown to function as a homodimer (8van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The NBDs in P-glycoprotein and dimeric LmrA bind and hydrolyze ATP in a catalytic reaction in which the highly conserved Walker A and B motifs and the ABC signature sequence are involved (9Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The MDs in these transporters contain multidrug-binding sites and provide a translocation pathway for drugs across the membrane (10van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press Ltd., London2003: 81-105Crossref Google Scholar). At present, the catalytic cycle at the NBDs is believed to involve the following partial reactions: (i) ATP binding, (ii) ATP hydrolysis and the formation of a transition state complex in which both ADP and Pi remain bound, (iii) release of Pi, and (iv) release of ADP (11Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The NBDs interact in catalysis and appear to form a single transition state complex involving liganding from catalytic side chains of both NBDs. Support for this view comes from (i) cross-linking, fluorescence energy transfer, and cryoelectron microscopy studies showing that the two NBDs in P-glycoprotein can be very close (12Urbatsch I.L.

Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) revealing nucleotide binding at the interface between the two NBDs. During the drug transport cycle, the MDs are thought to undergo a sequence of conformational changes during which their drug-binding sites alternately face the intracellular and extracellular sides of the plasma membrane with a change in binding affinity. In LmrA, the high and low affinity drug-binding sites are found on the inner and outer membrane surfaces, respectively (8van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein and LmrA both exhibit a basal rate of ATP hydrolysis, which is stimulated by up to 6-fold in different preparations by drugs and other transport substrates, indicating the occurrence of long-range conformational coupling between the catalytic cycle at the NBDs and the drug transport cycle at the MDs (10van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press Ltd., London2003: 81-105Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, secondary and tertiary structural changes induced by nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis and upon the binding of drugs have been detected in LmrA and P-glycoprotein by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (21Vigano C.

Although the detailed molecular mechanism of the conformational coupling between ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport in ABC transporters remains to be elucidated, various coupling models have been proposed (8van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Aside from differences in the mechanistic details, implicit in all models is the notion of unidirectional movement of substrate: upon ATP hydrolysis, substrates are either pumped out of or into the cell depending on the physiological role of the transporter as an exporter or importer, respectively. ATP is a “high energy” compound in that the equilibrium between ATP and ADP + Pi is on the side of ATP hydrolysis at the usual levels of ATP, ADP, and Pi in cells that generate metabolic energy. Thus, under these conditions, a reaction toward ATP hydrolysis tends to occur at the NBDs of ABC transporters, which is coupled to the movement of substrate from one side of the membrane to the other. However, like any chemical reaction, these reactions may, in principle, be reversible. Here, we summarize evidence that (i) LmrA is able to mediate the reverse transport (or uptake) of ethidium in ATP-depleted L. lactis cells in the presence of an inwardly directed ethidium concentration gradient and that (ii) the LmrA-mediated uptake of ethidium is coupled to the catalytic cycle in the direction of ATP synthesis. Construction of the E512Q Mutant lmrA Gene—The lmrA gene in pNHLmrA (31Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was ligated as an NcoI-SacI fragment into the E. coli vector pGEM-5Zf (Promega), yielding pGHLmrA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pGMHLmrA using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with primers 5′-GCTTGATCAAGCAACAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGTTGCTTGATCAAGC-3′ for E512Q. The mutant lmrA gene was then subcloned into pNZ8048 as an NcoI-XbaI fragment, yielding pNHLmrA-E512Q. The cloned PCR products were sequenced to ensure that only the intended changes were introduced. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—L. lactis strains NZ9000 and NZ9700 were grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 20 mm glucose (32de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) was added as required. Fresh media were inoculated with a 1:50 dilution of overnight cultures of L. lactis strain NZ9000 harboring the nisin A-inducible vectors pNHLmrA (31Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), pNHLmrA-E314A (33Venter H. Shilling R.A. Velamakanni S. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. Nature. 2003; 426: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), pNHLmrA-E512Q, or empty pNZ8048, encoding N-terminally His6-tagged wild-type LmrA, mutant LmrA with a glutamate-to-alanine substitution at position 314 or a glutamate-to-glutamine substitution at position 512, or no protein, respectively. The cells were grown at 30 °C to an A660 of 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was then induced for 1 h at the same temperature by the addition of 10 ng of nisin A/ml of culture or a 1:1000 dilution of the supernatant of the nisin A-producing L. lactis NZ9700 strain (32de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—The preparation of inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis was performed as described previously (34Reuter G. Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35193-35198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For the preparation of right-side-out membrane vesicles, a 1-liter culture of nisin-induced L. lactis cells containing pNHLmrA was harvested, washed with 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), and resuspended in 5 ml of the buffer with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The cell suspension was incubated with 10 mm MgSO4 and 10 mg/ml lysozyme at 30 °C for 1 h with mild shaking. While stirring, 4.8 ml of 0.75 m K2SO4 was added, and the cell suspension was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. Following the addition of 36 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) containing 10 μg/ml DNase and 10 μg/ml RNase and a further incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, 0.9 ml of 1 m K-EDTA (pH 7.0) was added. The lysed cells were then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C before the addition of 0.6 ml of 1 m MgSO4. The suspension was centrifuged at 48,200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 48 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) and 10 mm MgSO4 and centrifuged at 750 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove cell debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant was carefully removed and spun at 48,200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The right-side-out membrane vesicles in the pellet were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) containing 10% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen. The right-side-out orientation of the membrane vesicles was tested through the accessibility of the intracellular His6 tag at the amino terminus of LmrA by digestion with proteinase K. Membrane vesicles were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with proteinase K at a protein/protease ratio of 5:1. The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-pentahistidine antibody (QIAGEN Inc.). Ethidium Transport in ATP-depleted Cells—For ethidium uptake measurements, the cell pellet of 50 ml of culture of nisin-induced L. lactis cells was resuspended in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4. The cell suspension was then incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm dinitrophenol for 30 min at 30 °C to deprive the cells of metabolic energy. The cells were washed four times with 50 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4, resuspended in the same buffer to a final A660 of 5.0, and kept on ice. In each individual experiment, cells were diluted to a final A660 of 0.5 in 2 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4 in a 3-ml glass cuvette. The fluorescence was then followed at 30 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55B fluorimeter using excitation and emission wave-lengths of 500 and 580 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. After 60 s, ethidium bromide was added to the desired final concentration to each sample, as indicated in the figure legends; and the increase in ethidium fluorescence was followed over time. For kinetic analysis of the LmrA-mediated uptake of ethidium in ATP-depleted cells (see Figs. 2 and 3C), the uptake rate observed in control cells was subtracted from the rate measured in LmrA-expressing cells. To assess the effect of a competing substrate on ethidium transport in whole cells, vinblastine sulfate was included in the transport buffer at the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 3 after steady-state equilibrium had been reached after ∼1 h (Fig. 3A) or 60 s prior to the addition of ethidium bromide (see Fig. 3, B and C).Fig. 3Effect of vinblastine on ethidium transport in ATP-depleted L. lactis cells. A, competition between ethidium and vinblastine for ATP-dependent efflux by LmrA. At t = 0 s, 20 mm glucose and 5 μm vinblastine (VBL) were added to LmrA-expressing cells and non-expressing control cells that were pre-equilibrated for 1 h in the presence of 2 μm ethidium.

Basal fluorescence was followed for 60 s before the addition of ethidium bromide to a final concentration to 0.5 μm. The settings on the fluorimeter were as indicated under “Ethidium Transport in ATP-depleted Cells.” ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity was based on a colorimetric ascorbic acid/ammonium molybdate assay to measure the liberation of Pi from ATP as described (35Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Reuter G. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20645-20651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were used at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 5 mm NaATP. The assay mixtures were prepared on ice and contained ethidium at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 5A. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 mm ascorbic acid solution, after which the Pi concentration in each sample was determined at A690 using Pi standard solutions for calibration. The ATPase activity measurements in the presence of 1 mm orthovanadate were obtained in parallel and subtracted from the readings. Reconstitution of Purified LmrA in Proteoliposomes—The solubilization of His6-tagged LmrA with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, the purification of the solubilized protein on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, and the reconstitution of the purified protein were performed as described previously (34Reuter G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35193-35198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), except that Triton X-100 was used (up to 3 mm) to destabilize the liposomes instead of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside to obtain the unidirectional reconstitution of the protein in an inside-out orientation (33Venter H. Shilling R.A. Velamakanni S. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. Nature. 2003; 426: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes were resuspended to 10 mg of membrane protein/ml in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.0). Determination of ATP Synthesis—His6-LmrA-containing proteoliposomes (20 μg of protein) were pre-equilibrated for 60 min in the presence of 20 μm ethidium bromide and subsequently diluted 100-fold in a buffered mixture composed of (i) 100 μl of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 5 mm ADP and (ii) 100 μl of luciferase reagent (ATP bioluminescence assay kit HSII; Roche Applied Science). L. lactis cells were incubated in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 0.5 mm dinitrophenol and washed with the same buffer without dinitrophenol as described under “Ethidium Transport in ATP-depleted Cells.” One-ml aliquots of the cell suspension (A660 = 0.7) were then incubated with 20 μm ethidium for 5 min at 30 °C and lysed using the lysis solution supplied with the ATP bioluminescence assay kit. The amount of ATP present in the cell lysates or formed in proteoliposome suspensions over time was measured by bioluminescence in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. ATP standard solutions were used to convert arbitrary bioluminescence units into molarity of ATP. Bioluminescence was measured using a luminometer sample housing with 1-s integration time. The photon multiplier tube (modal no. 9899A) was supplied by Electron Tubes. A cooled housing (FACT50) maintained temperatures of the photon multiplier at -13 °C, and photon counts were processed by a CT2 counter time module (RS 232).

Where indicated, n refers to the number of independent observations with different cell batches and (proteo)liposome preparations. LmrA-mediated Ethidium Uptake—Ethidium transport in L. lactis cells can be measured by monitoring the fluorescence of the intracellular ethidium-polynucleotide complex. In previous work, we demonstrated that, in the presence of glucose, cells expressing LmrA exhibit an enhanced rate of ethidium efflux compared with non-expressing control cells, which is due to ATP-dependent extrusion of ethidium by LmrA (5van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 31Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the starvation of L. lactis cells in the presence of the protonophore dinitrophenol with a reduction of the intracellular ATP concentration from 9.0 ± 0.2 mm to 7.1 ± 0.9 μm (n = 3) allowed cells expressing LmrA to take up ethidium at an enhanced rate compared with non-expressing control cells when an inwardly directed ethidium concentration gradient was imposed (Fig. 1A). The cells and the recombinant LmrA protein were shown to be functional after the de-energization procedure, as the addition of glucose again elicited the characteristic ATP-dependent efflux of ethidium from LmrA-expressing cells and the passive membrane potential (interior negative)-driven ethidium uptake in the control (Figs. 1A and 5C) (5van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These data point to a role of LmrA in drug influx in ATP-depleted cells. Also, when an outwardly directed ethidium concentration gradient was imposed through a 100-fold dilution of ethidium-loaded cells in buffer without ethidium, ATP-depleted cells expressing LmrA exhibited an enhanced rate of ethidium efflux compared with non-expressing control cells (Fig. 1B). Hence, the downhill transport of ethidium was enhanced in both transport directions in ATP-depleted cells expressing LmrA compared with non-expressing control cells. To confirm that the enhanced ethidium accumulation in LmrA-expressing cells (Fig. 1A) was due to LmrA-mediated uptake of ethidium and binding to chromosomal DNA rather than binding to LmrA directly, the ethidium fluorescence was measured in LmrA-containing right-side-out membrane vesicles lacking intravesicular DNA. The orientation of the membrane vesicles was verified by testing the accessibility of the intracellular amino-terminal His6 tag of LmrA to digestion by proteinase K. The protease was unable to cleave the amino terminus of LmrA from the external side of the membrane vesicles, allowing the detection of the His6 tag by immunoblotting (data not shown). In contrast, in control experiments with inside-out membrane vesicles, an immunosignal was not obtained, as proteinase K was able to cleave the amino terminus of LmrA from the external side. However, the addition of ethidium to right-side-out membrane vesicles containing LmrA did not elicit the increase in ethidium fluorescence as observed in ATP-depleted cells expressing LmrA (data not shown). This result confirmed that the increased ethidium fluorescence in cells (Fig. 1A) was not due to the binding of ethidium to LmrA, but to the intercalation of ethidium in cellular DNA. Kinetic analysis of ethidium uptake in LmrA-expressing cells revealed (i) an LmrA-mediated uptake reaction, the rate of which increased as a function of the ethidium concentration in a saturable fashion with an apparent Kt of 2.0 ± 0.3 μm ethidium and an apparent Vmax of 0.23 ± 0.02 arbitrary units (a.u.)/min (n = 3) (Fig. 2), and, superimposed, (ii) a passive uptake reaction which, similar to ethidium uptake in the control cells, increased linearly with the ethidium concentration and exhibited no saturation in the micromolar concentration range (Fig. 2, inset). Only the passive ethidium uptake reaction was observed in non-expressing control cells (Fig. 2, inset). Interestingly, similar to the observations on LmrA-mediated uptake of ethidium, the rate of downhill LmrA-mediated ethidium efflux increased as a function of the ethidium concentration in a saturable fashion with an apparent Kt of 2.4 ± 0.2 μm ethidium and an apparent Vmax of 0.08 ± 0.02 a.u./min (n = 3) (Fig. 2). Hence, the kinetic parameters for LmrA-mediated ethidium efflux in ATP-depleted cells were in a similar range as those obtained for Lm"

In the current study, we report that incubation of cultured human umbilical vein or coronary artery endothelial cells with Lp(a) elicits a dramatic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton characterized by increased central stress fiber formation and redistribution of focal adhesions. These effects are mediated by the apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) component of Lp(a) since incubation of apo(a) with the cells evoked similar cytoskeletal rearrangements, while incubation with low density lipoprotein had no effect. Apo(a) also produced a time-dependent increase in transendothelial permeability. The cytoskeletal rearrangements evoked by apo(a) were abolished by C3 transferase, which inhibits Rho, and by Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho kinase. In addition to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, apo(a) was found to cause VE-cadherin disruption and focal adhesion molecule reorganization in a Rho- and Rho kinase-dependent manner. Cell-cell contacts were found to be regulated by Rho and Rac but not Cdc42. Apo(a) caused a transient increase in the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Finally apo(a) did not evoke increases in intracellular calcium levels, although the effects of apo(a) on the cytoskeleton were found to be calcium-dependent. We conclude that the apo(a) component of Lp(a) activates a Rho/Rho kinase-dependent intracellular signaling cascade that results in increased myosin light chain phosphorylation with attendant rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the resultant increase in endothelial permeability caused by Lp(a) may help explain the atherosclerotic risk posed by elevated concentrations of this lipoprotein.

We propose that the resultant increase in endothelial permeability caused by Lp(a) may help explain the atherosclerotic risk posed by elevated concentrations of this lipoprotein. The vascular endothelium acts as a pivotal regulator in vessel wall homeostasis by forming a selective barrier between components of the blood and extravascular tissues. Increasing evidence suggests that atypical endothelial function is a key event in the initial stages of atherosclerosis development. More specifically, enhanced endothelial cell permeability and the expression of a procoagulant, antifibrinolytic, and proinflammatory phenotype by the endothelium is thought to be a crucial event in the onset of this disease (1Poredos P. Clin. Appl. Thromb. Hemost. 2001; 7: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Various physiological agents have been identified that elicit some manifestations of endothelial dysfunction. These include growth factors, inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (2Wojciak-Stothard B. Entwistle A. Garg R. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), vasoactive substances such as thrombin (3Lum H. Ashner J.L. Phillips P.G. Fletcher P.W. Malik A.B. Am. J.

Many of these agents alter the permeability of the endothelium by stimulating cell contraction, thereby increasing the size of intercellular gaps and facilitating entry of inflammatory cells and atherogenic lipoproteins. The mechanism by which these agents are able to alter properties of the endothelium has received much attention. Endothelial cell contraction is mediated by interactions between actin filaments and non-muscle myosin II. The activity of non-muscle myosin II is largely regulated by phosphorylation of its regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) at Ser-19 (5Garcia J.G. Davis H.W. Patterson C.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). MLC phosphorylation activates myosin thus enabling it to associate with filamentous actin (F-actin), resulting in the assembly of stress fibers, the formation of mature focal adhesions, and cell contraction (6Goeckler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 7Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The MLC phosphorylation state is a function of the balance between MLC kinases (principally the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase) and phosphatases (principally type 1 myosin-associated protein phosphatase) (8Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L99-L108PubMed Google Scholar, 9Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Rho kinase, an effector of the small GTPase Rho, has both direct and indirect effects on MLC phosphorylation (10Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura M. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Rho kinase has been found to directly phosphorylate the MLC at Ser-19 albeit at a much lower rate than MLC kinase. In addition, Rho kinase effectively enhances MLC phosphorylation through inactivation of myosin phosphatase (11Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar, 12Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the ability of tumor necrosis factor-α and mildly oxidized LDL to elicit stress fiber formation, increase MLC phosphorylation, and promote retraction in cultured endothelial cells is mediated by a Rho- and Rho kinase-dependent signaling pathway (2Wojciak-Stothard B. Entwistle A. Garg R. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 4Essler M. Retzer M. Bauer M. Heemsker J.W. Aepfelbacher M. Seiss W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30361-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to Rho, the GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 also play central roles in controlling cytoskeletal reorganization. While Rho is the predominant regulator of actin stress fiber formation (13Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar), Rac and Cdc42 are involved in lamellipodia and filopodia formation, respectively, and promote the assembly of small, peripheral adhesion complexes (14Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Members of the Rho family of GTPases have also been found to regulate intercellular junctions and thus permeability (2Wojciak-Stothard B. Entwistle A. Garg R. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Wojciak-Stothard B. Potempa S. Eichholtz T. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both case-control and prospective studies have shown that lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (17Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 1999; 1: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Scanu A.M. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2003; 5: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lp(a) is similar to LDL in terms of lipid composition and the presence of the apolipoprotein B-100 moiety. However, Lp(a) is clearly distinguishable from LDL by the presence of the unique glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) that is covalently linked to apolipoprotein B-100 by a single disulfide bond (20Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Muller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Koschinsky M.L. Côté G.P. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19819-19825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo(a) shares extensive homology with the fibrinolytic zymogen plasminogen and contains multiple repeats of a sequence that is similar to plasminogen kringle IV as well as a single copy of sequences similar to the kringle V and protease regions of plasminogen (22McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E. Fless G. Scanu A. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Although Lp(a) has been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases, the nature of the role of Lp(a) in atherosclerosis remains unclear. Potential roles for Lp(a) in lipid deposition and smooth muscle cell proliferation in developing lesions and inhibition of fibrinolysis as well as stimulation of endothelial dysfunction have been documented (18Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the effect of Lp(a) on endothelial cell morphology and barrier function has yet to be assessed. In the present study, we have examined the role of the apo(a) component of Lp(a) in cultured endothelial cell cytoskeleton reorganization. Our findings indicate the following. (i) Apo(a) induces F-actin stress fiber formation, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) dispersion, and focal adhesion molecule reorganization in a Rho- and Rho kinase-dependent manner. (ii) Rho and Rac but not Cdc42 are implicated in apo(a)-mediated actin stress fiber formation and VE-cadherin disruption. (iii) Apo(a) induces a time-dependent increase in MLC phosphorylation that is regulated by Rho and Rho kinase. (iv) Apo(a) does not result in increases in cytosolic calcium levels, but its effects on cytoskeletal rearrangement are calcium-dependent. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which Lp(a) can promote endothelial cell dysfunction during atherogenesis. Purification of Proteins—Recombinant apo(a) containing 17 kringle IV-like domains and corresponding to a physiologically relevant isoform size (23Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was purified from conditioned medium harvested from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells stably transfected with the corresponding expression plasmid using lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (24Sangrar W. Gabel B.R. Boffa M.B. Walker J.B. Hancock M.A. Marcovina S.M. Horrevoets A.J.G. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10353-10363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Human plasminogen was purified from fresh-frozen plasma using lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (25Castellino F.J Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Human Lp(a) was purified from fresh plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (26Edelstein C. Hinman J. Marcovina S. Scanu A.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 288: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human LDL was purified from fresh plasma by sequential flotation as described previously (27Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were obtained from Clonetics and grown in endothelial growth medium EGM-2 (Clonetics), which contained 2% fetal calf serum unless otherwise indicated. Cells were fed every 2nd day and used at passages 2–5. Immunofluorescence—For double immunofluorescence studies, cells were plated onto gelatin-precoated (1 h, 0.1% gelatin (Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C) glass coverslips at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture dishes and grown to near confluence. Before treatment with apo(a) and Lp(a), cells were serum-starved for 15 min at 37 °C in physiological saline (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin). This solution was then replaced with fresh physiological saline containing 400 nm apo(a), 400 nm Lp(a), 100 μg/ml LDL, or 400 nm plasminogen, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for different time periods. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) or Y-27632 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). For C3 transferase, the enzyme was included in the complete culture medium at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for 24 h prior to the 15-min serum starvation. For Y-27632, the cells were serum-starved for 15 min as described above and then were treated for 30 min with Y-27632 at a final concentration of 10 μm in physiological saline; at this time, the solution was removed, and fresh solution containing apo(a) or Lp(a) was added. In other experiments, cells were serum-starved for 15 min and then pretreated with BAPTA-AM (Sigma) or ML-7 (Calbiochem) (25 μm, 1 h) prior to apo(a) treatment. Cells were then prepared for double immunofluorescence as follows. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, washed once with PBS, fixed and permeabilized with 1.4% formaldehyde containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 1.5 min, and then washed three times with PBS. For F-actin staining, cells were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin diluted 1:100 in saponin buffer (0.1% saponin, 20 mm KPO4, 10mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8). For vinculin staining, cells were first blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:300 in saponin buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, cells were stained for 1 h with 1:500-diluted goat anti-mouse Alexa488-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) and TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) in saponin buffer. For VE-cadherin staining, cells were treated as indicated for vinculin except using 1:350-diluted anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics). Coverslips were mounted to slides using an anti-fade mounting solution (Dako) and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a 40× oil immersion lens. Images were captured using a high sensitivity Cooke SensiCam and SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc.). Apoptosis Detection (TUNEL Assay)—HUVECs were grown on glass coverslips as described above. Apoptosis was examined using an in situ cell death assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a positive control, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I was added for 15 min at room temperature to non-starved cells that were previously fixed and permeabilized. Transendothelial Permeability Assay—HUVECs were seeded at a final concentration of 25,000 cells/ml onto Transwell inserts (3.0-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) precoated with 7 μg/ml fibronectin (1 h, 37 °C) and placed into 24-well Transwell companion plates (BD Biosciences) containing 600 μl of EGM-2 medium. Cells were grown for 3 days with one change of medium before the experiment. To evaluate the effect of apo(a) on endothelial permeability, medium in the top well was replaced with EGM-2 containing 400 nm apo(a) and 1 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (molecular weight, 40,000) in a final volume of 100 μl. The medium in the bottom well was replaced with 600 μl of fresh EGM-2. Control cells were treated identically but in the absence of apo(a). At specific time points, 50 μl of medium from the bottom well was removed and replaced with 50 μl of fresh EGM-2. The 50-μl sample was then diluted with 950 μl of PBS, and fluorescence intensity was evaluated with a fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B) using an excitation wavelength of 492 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. Transient Transfections—The expression plasmids pRK5mycN19RhoA (encoding a Myc-tagged, dominant negative RhoA), pRK5mycN17Rac (encoding a Myc-tagged, dominant negative Rac), pMT90mycN17Cdc-42 (encoding a Myc-tagged, dominant negative Cdc42), and pMT90V12-Cdc42 (encoding a constitutively active Cdc42) were the kind gifts of Dr. Alan Hall (University College, London). Each expression plasmid contains the cytomegalovirus promoter. HUVECs were seeded on 0.1% gelatin-precoated glass coverslips at 100,000–200,000 cells/ml. The following day, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of the respective plasmids using the LipofectAMINE Plus transfection kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 0.4 μg of plasmid and 2 μl of Plus reagent in a final volume of 25 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free EGM-2(-) medium and, separately, 1 μl of LipofectAMINE in a final volume of 25 μl of EGM-2(-) medium were incubated at room temperature for 15 min; the solutions were then combined and incubated for an additional 15 min. The final transfection reaction was added to a well of HUVECs grown in 200 μl of EGM-2(-) medium. Transfection proceeded for 3 h at 37 °C after which cells were washed three times with EGM-2(-) medium and fed complete EGM-2. The following day, cells were fixed and permeabilized as before. To detect transfected cells, HUVECs were stained with anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:300 in saponin buffer and washed three times using PBS. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h with 1:200-diluted goat anti-rabbit Alexa350 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—MLC phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 6-well culture dishes (precoated with 0.1% gelatin) and treated with 400 nm apo(a) for different times. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with C3 transferase or Y-27632 as described above prior to treatment with apo(a). The reactions were terminated by immediate addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were washed twice with water to remove residual trichloroacetic acid. Resulting pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS and then sonicated for 4–5 h. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.02% SDS). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder for 2 h at 4 °C, washed twice in Tween-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS; 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl), and probed for either phosphorylated MLC (Ser-19) with 1 μg/ml anti-phospho-MLC antibody (pS19, a generous gift from BIOSOURCE) or for total MLC with 1:100-diluted total MLC antibody (A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed three times with TTBS and incubated with 1:3000 dilutions of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) in 5% milk for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Blots were scanned using a flatbed laser scanner, and the density of the immunoreactive bands was determined using Corel Photopaint Version 8. The amount of phosphorylated MLC was normalized to the total MLC signal in the respective samples. Detection of Intracellular Calcium Transients—HUVECs were seeded on glass coverslips precoated with 0.1% gelatin (1 h, 37 °C) at 25,000 cells/ml and grown for 3 days. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C, washed five times, and incubated in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Coverslips were submerged in HEPES buffer contained in a heated mounting dish and maintained at 37 °C. Cells were allowed to equilibrate in the dish for 5 min. Calcium imaging was captured every 9 s using SlideBook software. Apo(a) was added at a final concentration of 400 nm after 18 s. As a positive control, 1 unit/ml thrombin was added at the end of the calcium imaging. Calcium-dependent fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted fluorescent microscope using excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Intracellular calcium concentration was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 510 nm corresponding to calcium bound (340 nm) and calcium unbound (380 nm) excitation wavelengths (ratio 340/380). Lp(a), through Its Apo(a) Moiety, Causes a Time-dependent Increase in F-actin Stress Fiber Formation and Transendothelial Permeability—Following a brief 15-min serum starvation, confluent HUVECs displayed few actin stress fibers (Fig. 1A). F-actin was concentrated along the cell borders and was generally absent in the central regions of the cell. Treatment with 400 nm apo(a) caused a dramatic increase in the number of F-actin stress fibers traversing the cells. Stress fiber formation was apparent within 5 min of stimulation and appeared to saturate between 10 and 20 min. Cell retraction, accompanied by increased gap formation between the cells, occurred as early as 2 min after apo(a) treatment. The effects of Lp(a) treatment on HUVEC F-actin organization were similar to that observed for apo(a). The appearance of stress fibers was observable after 2 min of stimulation. In addition, maximal stress fiber formation occurred between 5 and 10 min after which time the number of stress fibers appeared to diminish. Thus, Lp(a) appeared to be slightly more potent than apo(a) in eliciting actin stress fiber formation. The risk threshold for plasma concentrations of Lp(a) is taken to be 30 mg/dl or ∼40 nm for an Lp(a) isoform of the size utilized in these studies. Although plasma concentrations of Lp(a) of 400 nm are rare in the population (28Marcovina S.M. Albers J.J. Wijsman E. Zhang Z. Chapman N.H. Kennedy H. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2569-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have observed stress fiber stimulation in HUVECs by apo(a) concentrations as low as 25 nm (data not shown). To determine whether the LDL moiety of Lp(a) had an influence on stress fiber formation, HUVECs were treated with 100 μg/ml LDL for 5 min. LDL produced no detectable change in F-actin organization (Fig. 1B), an observation that is consistent with previous findings (4Essler M. Retzer M. Bauer M. Heemsker J.W. Aepfelbacher M. Seiss W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30361-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the moiety on Lp(a) that mediates the effects of this lipoprotein on actin cytoskeletal rearrangements is apo(a). Plasminogen (a kringle-containing protein homologous to apo(a)) was tested to examine whether the effects of apo(a) on the actin cytoskeleton were specific for the kringles in apo(a). Treatment of HUVECs with 400 nm plasminogen for 5 min produced no significant increase in stress fiber formation (Fig. 1B). Previous results have implicated Rho proteins in endothelial cell apoptotic cell death (29Hippenstiel S. Schmeck B. N′Guessan P.D. Seybold J. Krull M. Preissner K. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Suttorp N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L830-L838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In situ TUNEL staining was used to examine whether the Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes observed following apo(a) treatment were accompanied by the characteristic features of apoptosis. TUNEL staining showed that apo(a)-treated HUVECs displayed no signs of DNA fragmentation (data not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that neither the brief 15-min serum starvation nor the exposure for short periods of time to apo(a) caused apoptosis in HUVECs. We hypothesized that the increase in gap formation and loss of cell-cell contact following apo(a) exposure would lead to enhanced transendothelial permeability. Consistent with this hypothesis, HUVEC monolayers treated with 400 nm apo(a) displayed a time-dependent increase in transendothelial diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Fig. 2). HUVEC monolayers became ∼2-fold more permeable compared with controls. These results confirm that cytoskeletal changes elicited by apo(a) are correlated with increased cellular contractility sufficient to form intercellular gaps. Actin Stress Fiber Stimulation by Apo(a) Leads to Dispersion of VE-cadherin and Is Mediated by Rho and Rho Kinase—To determine whether apo(a)-induced stress fiber formation involves Rho and Rho kinase, HUVECs were pretreated with their respective inhibitors, C3 transferase and Y-27632. Preincubation with C3 transferase or Y-27632 had little or no effect on the F-actin distribution of control serum-starved HUVECs (data not shown) but completely abolished the increase in stress fiber formation induced by apo(a) (Fig. 3, A–D). These results strongly suggest that stimulation of actin stress fiber formation by apo(a) occurs through a Rho/Rho kinase-dependent pathway. Our previous results indicate that apo(a) treatment leads to increased cell contractility and subsequent endothelial permeability. We theorized that loss of cell-cell contacts would result in changes in distribution of the adhesion molecule VE-cadherin. VE-cadherin/cadherin-5 is a junctional protein that is unique to endothelial cells. This class of cadherin is present at sites of cell-cell contact and as such acts as a suitable marker for gap formation and ultimately increased vascular permeability (30Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Serum-starved control cells possessed VE-cadherin organized as slender lines along the margins of the cells (Fig. 3E). In contrast, HUVECs treated with apo(a) had a dispersed VE-cadherin appearance that occurred concomitantly with enhanced F-actin stress fiber formation (Fig. 3, B and F). Loss of VE-cadherin at sites of intercellular contact coincided with gap formation between endothelial cells (Fig. 3F). In addition, inhibition of Rho and its effector Rho kinase abolished the effects of apo(a) on VE-cadherin distribution (Fig. 3, G and H). Rho/Rho Kinase-mediated Changes in Focal Adhesion Molecule Organization by Apo(a)—Focal adhesions act as attachment sites for stress fibers and play an essential role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. We investigated the effects of apo(a) on the distribution of focal adhesions in HUVECs (Fig. 4) by immunofluorescence microscopy using the characteristic focal adhesion protein vinculin as a marker. In serum-starved cells, vinculin-containing adhesive structures were concentrated at the"

During apoptosis, caspase-mediated cleavage of p130cas generated a C-terminal 31-kDa fragment (31-kDa) and promoted morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of focal adhesions, cell rounding, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation. By contrast, a p130cas D748E mutant, which was unable to produce 31-kDa, attenuated the disassembly of focal adhesions at the bottom of the cell. 31-kDa contains a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain that shows greater sequence homology with Id proteins than with basic HLH proteins, which enabled heterodimerization with E2A. Once coupled to E2A, 31-kDa was translocated to the cell nucleus, where it inhibited E2A-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 transcription. Moreover, overexpression of 31-kDa led to cell death that could be inhibited by treatment with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketone or by ectopic expression of E2A or p21Waf1/Cip1. These data suggest that during etoposide-induced apoptosis, 31-kDa promotes caspase-mediated cell death by inhibiting E2A-mediated activation of p21Waf1/Cip1 transcription.

We previously showed that cleavage of p130cas by caspase yields an active 31-kDa C-terminal fragment (31-kDa) that is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and contributes to the disassembly of focal adhesion complexes, thereby interrupting survival signals from the ECM. Conversely, uncleavable p130cas mutant attenuates the disassembly of focal adhesion complexes and the progression of apoptosis (4Kook S. Shim S.R. Choi S.J. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Jung Y.K.

O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Einarson M.B. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), resulting in the generation of 3 fragments, among which the 28-kDa fragment is highly conserved among Cas family members. This fragment also contains a HLH domain that mediates dimerization with a limited number of basic (b) HLH proteins (20Law S.F. Zhang Y.Z. Fashena S.J. Toby G. Estojak J. Golemis E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contributes to the induction of apoptosis (19O'Neill G.M. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5094-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The bHLH family of transcription factors is crucially involved in such fundamental processes as cell growth, differentiation, development, and survival. These proteins can be divided into several classes based on their tissue distribution, DNA binding properties, and structural features (21Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed class A bHLH proteins, often referred to as E proteins, consist of E2-2, HEB, and E2A (21Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar), which serve as partners within heterodimers with tissue-specific classes of bHLH proteins (22Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). E2A encodes two alternatively spliced products, E12 and E47 (21Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, 23Sun X.H.

DNA binding by E2A proteins is abolished by the Id proteins (Id1-4), which serve as dominant-negative inhibitors (24Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Consequently, Id and E2A play opposing roles in regulating cell function (24Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that is mediated by up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 (31Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell.

Such E2A-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 transcription is inhibited by Id proteins due to formation of the aforementioned inactive heterodimers. Evidence suggests that E2A proteins protect cells against apoptosis (28Kee B.L. Rivera R.R. Murre C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Kee B.L. Bain, G. Murre C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For instance, ectopic expression of Id3, which abolishes E2A activity, leads to the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the absence of B-lineage cells in E2A-/- mice and indicates that at least one function of E2A is to maintain cell viability (35Bain G. Robanus Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S. Feeney A.J. van Roon M. Cell. 1994; 79: 885-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 36Zhuang Y. Soriano P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E2A suppresses activation of caspase-3 and protects cells from apoptosis induced by activation of alternative death pathways, such as those activated by death domain-containing proteins through a Bcl-2-independent mechanism (34Kee B.L. Bain, G. Murre C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At the present time, the number of caspase isoforms activated in the absence of E2A and the targets of E2A that mediate this anti-apoptotic effect are unknown. The fact that 31-kDa contains a HLH domain similar to that of Id proteins and the 28-kDa HEF1 fragment led us to examine whether, like those proteins, 31-kDa is capable of binding to bHLH transcription factors. Herein we demonstrate that 31-kDa interacts with E2A and promotes apoptosis by repressing E2A-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 expression.

FLAG-tagged Id2, comprised of a 0.5-kilobase BamHI/XhoI fragment from Id2 inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), was a gift from Hae Young Suh of Ajou University. The pcDNA3-p21Waf1/Cip1 plasmid has been described previously (38Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar), as were vectors for expressing p130cas (4Kook S. Shim S.R. Choi S.J. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Jung Y.K. Paik S.G. Song W.K. Mol. Biol.

The 31-kDa HLH double mutant (31H12) was generated from pcDNA3.0-p130cas using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Leu residues at positions 855 and 884 of rat p130cas were replaced with Pro. Two sets of primers (5′-GCC AAC CTG ACC ACA CCG ACA GAT GCG GTG GAC-3′ and 5′-GTC CAC CGC ATC TGT CGG TGT GGT CAG GTT GGC-3′ for the Leu855 mutation and 5′-AGC AAG TTT GTC ATT CCT AGT GCA CAC AAG CTT GTG-3′ and 5′-CAC AAG CTT GTG TGC ACT AGG AAT GAC AAA CTT GCT-3′ for the Leu884 mutation) were used to construct the mutant, after which the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Cells, Transfections, and Luciferase and Cell Death Assays—HeLa, Rat-1, and C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized by the addition of empty pcDNA3 vector. After transfection luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. To induce apoptosis, cells were exposed to 40 μm etoposide (Sigma) for selected time periods. After transient transfection, the incidence of cell death was determined by nuclear condensation, and fragmentation was observed under a fluorescence microscope after Hoechst staining. Calculated were the percentages of cells exhibiting a rounded, shrunken morphology in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketone. This assay was repeated three times. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—Fusion proteins constructed of GST and 31-kDa or its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by adsorption onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled E47 and E12 were generated by in vitro transcription and translation using a TNT kit (Promega). The radiolabeled translation mixture was incubated with 10 μg each of the GST fusion proteins bound to the beads in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). The beads were then washed extensively in the same buffer, after which the adsorbed proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared as described by Kook et al. (4Kook S. Shim S.R. Choi S.J. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Jung Y.K. Paik S.G. Song W.K. Mol. Biol.

Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 10% acrylamide gel, after which Western blots were probed with anti-Cas mAb, anti-FAK mAb, anti-paxillin mAb (Transduction Laboratories), anti-E47 polyAb, anti-lamin B polyAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG-M2 mAb, anti-tubulin mAb (Sigma), anti-GFP polyAb (Clontech), or anti-p21 mAb (Pharmingen). Primary antibodies were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—To detect interactions between 31-kDa and E47, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged 31-kDa and E47 or treated with 40 μm etoposide after transfection with E47. The cells were then lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of Triton X-100 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-Cas or anti-FLAG-M2 mAb. Co-precipitated E47 was detected using anti-E47 polyAb. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence studies, cells were co-transfected with the plasmid of interest and GFP-encoding plasmids, enabling localization of productively transfected cells. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Cas mAb, anti-paxillin mAb, anti-E47 polyAb, anti-p21 mAb, or anti-GFP polyAb at dilutions of 1:30 to 1:1000. To discriminate exogenous and endogenous expression of E47, different concentrations of the anti-E2A antibody were used; endogenous expression of E47 could be detected with a 1:50 dilution of antibody, whereas overexpressed E47 derived from the exogenous gene was detected with a 1:200 dilution of antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used to visualize the primary Abs. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides derived from the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter E-box consisting of the wild-type sequence 5′-GGTGTGAGCAGCTGCCGAAGTC-3′ (the E-box site is underlined) were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding E47 were prepared as described previously (22Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), after which they were mixed with selected doses of GST 31-kDa protein in a 10-μl final volume and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Binding and electrophoretic conditions were as described previously (27Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). 31-kDa Shows Higher Homology with Id Family Than bHLH Proteins—During etoposide-induced apoptosis, caspase-mediated cleavage of p130cas yields 31-kDa (4Kook S. Shim S.R. Choi S.J. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Jung Y.K. Paik S.G. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells 31-kDa was first detected after 12 h of etoposide treatment, after which its level continued to rise for an additional 36 h (Fig. 1A). In untreated control cells, by contrast, 31-kDa was barely detectable. The appearance of the p130cas cleavage product correlated well with reductions in the levels of two other caspase-3 substrates, FAK and lamin B (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence of 31-kDa is highly conserved among all members of the Cas protein family and contains an HLH domain that mediates homo- or heterodimerization with other HLH-containing proteins (19O'Neill G.M. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5094-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Law S.F. Zhang Y.Z. Fashena S.J. Toby G. Estojak J. Golemis E.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, however, sequence alignment of several HLH proteins indicated that 31-kDa possesses substantially greater sequence homology with Id family proteins than with bHLH proteins such as E2A (E12/E47) and MyoD (Fig. 1C). The lack of a basic region responsible for DNA binding suggests that, like Id proteins, 31-kDa antagonizes the activity of bHLH proteins by sequestering them into an inactive state. Translocation of 31-kDa from the Cytosol into the Nucleus—To determine the cellular distribution of 31-kDa, HeLa and Rat-1 cells were exposed to 40 μm etoposide and then stained with an anti-Cas mAb that recognizes 31-kDa. In control cells, p130cas was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and focal adhesion sites although nuclear staining was readily apparent in both etoposide-treated HeLa cells and apoptotic Rat-1 cells (Fig. 2A). The nuclear localization of 31-kDa was further confirmed using HeLa cells transiently transfected with a FLAG-tagged 31-kDa construct. Immunohistochemical labeling with anti-FLAG mAb showed the 31-kDa construct to be present in the nucleus 12 h after transfection, and it was still present there 48 h after transfection, by which time nuclear fragmentation consistent with cell death was apparent (Fig. 2B). This nuclear localization of 31-kDa led us to investigate whether the fragment interacts with transcription factors such as E2A. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays clearly showed that a GST-31-kDa fusion protein, but not GST alone, bound to in vitro-translated [35S]E47 and [35S]E12, yielding specific bands on autoradiography (Fig. 3A), which suggests 31-kDa interacts directly with both E47 and E12. To test whether 31-kDa interacts with E47 in vivo, FLAG-tagged 31-kDa and E47 were co-expressed in HeLa cells, after which the cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using selected doses of anti-FLAG mAb, and the resultant precipitate was visualized with anti-E47 Ab. That E47 was found to associate with FLAG-tagged 31-kDa (Fig. 3B) indicates 31-kDa directly interacts with E47 in vivo as well as in vitro. To assess the biological relevance of interaction between 31-kDa and E47, we evaluated the extent to which they interact during apoptosis. HeLa cells expressed only low levels of endogenous E47, and that expression remained constant during etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). HeLa cells transiently transfected with E47 alone were exposed to 40 μm etoposide for the indicated times, after which the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Cas mAb and then visualized using anti-E47 Ab. Notably, although E47 was barely detectable in the immune complexes from untreated control cells, its increased association with 31-kDa was readily apparent in etoposide-treated cells (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting that the interaction between 31-kDa and E47 mainly occurs during apoptosis. 31-kDa Represses E2A-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 Gene Transcription by Inhibiting DNA Binding of E2A—Given that 31-kDa and E2A co-localize in the nucleus, where they directly interact with one another, we next examined the extent to which 31-kDa affects E2A activity when co-expressed in cells. For these experiments, E2A and/or 31-kDa were co-transfected into either HeLa or C3H10T1/2 cells with (μE2-E5)4-luciferase (Fig. 4A) or p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter-luciferase (Fig. 4, B and C) reporter genes. As expected, cells expressing E2A (E47 or E12) generated high levels of (μE2-E5)4 luciferase activity. When E2A and 31-kDa were co-expressed, however, (μE2-E5)4 luciferase activity was dose-dependently repressed. A similar 31-kDa-dependent repression was observed in the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene assays, confirming that 31-kDa functions as an antagonist of E2A activity. To determine whether 31-kDa would also inhibit expression of endogenous p21Waf1/Cip1, HeLa cells were transfected with E47 alone or with 31-kDa or Id2, after which p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was examined by immunostaining (Fig. 4D). Transfection with E47 clearly induced endogenous p21Waf1/Cip1 expression, but that expression was abolished by co-transfection of either 31-kDa or Id2. Given its shared homology with Id family proteins, it seems likely that 31-kDa inhibited E2A activity by forming inactive heterodimers (E2A-31-kDa) incapable of binding to DNA. To test that hypothesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried using a 32P-labeled E-box probe of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter, nuclear extracts from the E47-transfected cells (E47 nuclear extracts), and a GST-31-kDa fusion protein (Fig. 4E). Incubation of the E47 nuclear extracts with the 32P-labeled E-box probe generated the predicted E47 homodimer that efficiently bound to the E-box site. No binding activity was observed when E47 nuclear extracts were co-incubated with Id2 proteins, however. Moreover, as increasing amounts of GST-31-kDa were added to the reaction mixture containing the 32P-labeled E-box probe and the E47 nuclear extract, the formation of DNA-bound E47 homodimeric complexes gradually declined. Thus, 31-kDa appears to repress E2A activity by combining with it to form inactive heterodimers incapable of binding to DNA. Inhibition of E47 Activity by 31-kDa Is Mediated by Its HLH Domain—To determine whether the 31-kDa HLH domain is necessary for its repressor activity, we first analyzed the ability of several 31-kDa deletion mutants to interact with E47 in vitro (Fig. 5, A and B). The full-length fragment (31WT) as well as fragments truncated at the N terminus and/or C terminus (31ΔN, 31ΔC, and 31HLH) were all able to interact with E47. Unfortunately, we were not able to evaluate the interaction between 31H12 (an HLH point mutant) and E47 because of the instability of GST-31H12 during protein purification. Still, deletion of the bHLH domain of E47 (E47ΔHLH) abolished its interaction with full-length 31-kDa. In addition, both the full-length fragment and the N and C terminus deletion mutants inhibited E47 transactivating activity, whereas 31H12 lacked the ability to inhibit E47 activity (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these findings indicate that 31-kDa interacts with E47 via its HLH domain and that the HLH domain is required for the inhibitory function of the fragment. The importance of the HLH domain for nuclear localization of 31-kDa was demonstrated by transfecting three fusion proteins, GFP-p130cas, GFP-31-kDa, and GFP-31H12, into HeLa cells. Subsequent immunostaining with anti-GFP Ab revealed that a point mutation within the HLH domain (31H12) significantly inhibited translocation of 31-kDa from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 5D). 31-kDa Is Sufficient to Induce Cell Death—To examine the effect of 31-kDa generation during etoposide-induced apoptosis, HeLa cells transfected with GFP constructs of either 31-kDa, p130cas (wild-type), or p130casD748E, which is an uncleavable p130cas point mutant (see Fig. 1B), were incubated with 40 μm etoposide for 24 h (Fig. 6A). Focal adhesions were observed at the bottoms of cells expressing p130casD748E but were lost from the bottoms of p130cas transfectants and were instead localized at the cell periphery. 31-kDa transfectants displayed a complete loss of focal adhesion, which led to cell rounding, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation were also apparent. These results suggest that generation of 31-kDa through cleavage of p130cas by caspase-3 may accelerate the disassembly of focal adhesions and the progression of etopos"

We demonstrate here that, when the inhibitory ρ1/GABA and the excitatory P2X2 receptor channels are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, activation of one channel reduces the currents mediated by the other one. This reciprocal inhibitory cross-talk is a receptor-mediated phenomenon independent of agonist cross-modulation, membrane potential, direction of ionic flux, or channel densities. Functional interaction is disrupted when the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of P2X2 is deleted or in competition experiments with minigenes coding for the C-terminal domain of P2X2 or the main intracellular loop of ρ1 subunits. We also show a physical interaction between P2X2 and ρ1 receptors expressed in oocytes and the co-clustering of these receptors in transfected hippocampal neurons. Co-expression with P2X2 induces retargeting and recruitment of mainly intracellular ρ1/GABA receptors to surface clusters. Therefore, molecular and functional cross-talk between inhibitory and excitatory ligand-gated channels may regulate synaptic strength both by activity-dependent current occlusion and synaptic receptors co-trafficking. γ-Aminobutyric-acid (GABA) and ATP ionotropic receptors represent two structurally and functionally different classes of neurotransmitter-gated channels involved in fast synaptic transmission.

Neuronal activity is regulated by a number of transmitters acting on different receptor types (1Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GABA receptor channels have been classified into two subtypes based on their pharmacological properties. GABAA receptors are inhibited by bicuculline, whereas GABAC receptors are insensitive to this antagonist (1Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged P2X2 subunits with either hexahistidine (His6)-tagged or enhanced YFP-tagged sequences and a C-terminal His6-tagged ρ1 subunit (ρ1-HIS) were obtained as described previously (28Lê K.T.

N-terminal GFP-tagged ρ1 subunit (ρ1-GFP) was generated by insertion of two enhanced GFPs in tandem into a unique BamHI restriction site. This artificial BamHI site was created at amino acids positions Gly49-Ala50 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). The intracellular C-terminal domain of P2X2 (P2X2-CT) and the main intracellular loop (IL2) of the ρ1 subunit were amplified by PCR using 5′- and 3′-primers incorporating an initiation methionine and a stop codon, respectively. All constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by automatic dideoxy DNA sequencing.Cell Culture—Oocytes were prepared as described previously (26Boué-Grabot E. Barajas-Lopez C.

Then the oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 and gentamycin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) at 19 °C for 1-5 days prior to electrophysiological recordings. For competition experiments, RNAs coding for minigenes were injected (50-60 ng of each to reach a 2:1 minigene/receptor ratio) independently, immediately after the injection of receptor RNA.Neuronal cultures were performed according to a modification of the procedure described by Goslin et al. (29Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi of rat embryos were dissected at day 18. Dissociation was achieved with a Pasteur pipette after trypsinization. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in complete Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) containing 1 mml-glutamine, penicillin G (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml). Four hours after plating, the coverslips were transferred to dishes containing conditioned medium obtained by incubating the complete medium described above on glial cultures (70-80% confluency) for 24 h. The medium was partially changed every 3-4 days.Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 7-8 days in vitro as follows. For each coverslip, a total of 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 50 μl of Neurobasal medium without B27 supplement. For cotransfection experiments, the proportions of each plasmid were first adjusted to reach similar levels of expression, and the plasmids were thoroughly mixed prior to the addition of 15 μl of Plus™ packaging reagent (Invitrogen). After 15 min of incubation, 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Neurobasal medium was added, and incubation was continued for another 30 min. After the addition of 150 μl of complete Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement, the mix was applied on the neuronal culture for 3 h at 37 °C. Expression was then conducted for 48 h in the original medium that was added back to the neurons. Under these conditions, 85-90% of transfected neurons were cotransfected with two plasmids.Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed using glass pipettes (1-2 megaohms) filled with 3 m KCl solution. Oocytes were perfused at a flow rate of 10-12 ml/min with Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2 or BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. Membrane currents were recorded through an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments) and digitized at 500 Hz. All drugs (purchased from Sigma) were dissolved in the perfusion solution and applied using a computer-driven valve system (BPS8, Ala Scientific). We compared the peak of actual responses to the peak of predicted additive responses obtained with Axograph software (Axon Instruments). All recordings were made at room temperature. Statistical differences between means were assessed using Student's t test. Dose-response curves were fitted to the Hill sigmoidal equation, and EC50 values were determined by a non-linear regression analysis test using Prism 2.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA).Co-purification and Western Blotting—Following the measurement of ρ1-GFP alone, P2X2-YFP alone, P2X2-YFP + ρ1-HIS, or P2X2-HIS + ρ1-GFP expression levels by electrophysiological recordings, batches of 15 oocytes were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES and 0.3 m sucrose and solubilized in 0.8% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Total proteins were incubated overnight with equilibrated nickel resin (Qiagen) under agitation at 4 °C. After several washes with 20 mm imidazole, bound His6-tagged proteins were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole solution and then loaded onto a 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunostainings of associated tagged receptors were performed with anti-GFP antibodies (1:2500; Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 2 h followed by 1 h of incubation with anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Groove, PA) for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed 9-10 days after plating and 2 days after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm MgCl2 (PBS+) at 37 °C and then fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) containing 4% sucrose at 37 °C in PBS+. Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed in 2% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal goat serum, 3% normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. As the intensity of anti-ρ1 labeling was dependent on Triton X-100 concentration, the detergent could not be completely omitted. However, we found that 0.002% Triton X-100 significantly enhanced anti-ρ1 immunostaining without labeling intracellular organelles. For external labeling, therefore, immunocytochemistry was performed on non-permeabilized cultures using 0.002% Triton X-100. However, because the intensity of anti-ρ1 immunolabeling decreased from 0.1 to 0.002% Triton X-100, the proportion of surface versus total receptors could not be quantified. Labeling was performed with affinity-purified anti-ρ1 (1:200) directed against the extracellular N-terminal sequence (16Boue-Grabot E. Roudbaraki M. Bascles L. Tramu G. Bloch B. Garret M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and revealed with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit for 1 h at room temperature (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Alexa Fluor® 488-phalloidin (1:3000 to 1:10,000 dilutions, Molecular Probes) staining was occasionally performed together with the secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence images were generated using a Leica laser-scanning confocal microscope. Contrast and brightness were chosen to ensure that all relevant pixels were within linear range.RESULTSReciprocal Cross-inhibition between GABAC and P2X2 Receptors—We co-expressed ρ1 and P2X2 RNAs in Xenopus oocytes to investigate receptor function by two-electrode voltage clamp recordings (Vh = -60 mV; Fig. 1A). Application of a saturating concentration of GABA (10 μm) induced non-desensitizing inward responses (IGABA = -1.8 ± 0.3 μA, n = 27). Similarly, application of a saturating concentration of ATP (100 μm) evoked slowly desensitizing responses (IATP = -2.7 ± 0.2 μA, n = 27). Kinetic profiles of individual responses are consistent with activation of GABAC and P2X2 receptors, suggesting that activation of one receptor is not modified by the presence of the other (Fig. 1A). If both receptors were functionally independent, we would expect that co-activation of both receptors evoked responses corresponding to the sum of individual responses. However, co-application of 10 μm GABA + 100 μm ATP evoked inward responses (denoted as Actual on Fig. 1A) significantly smaller (p < 0.0005) than the sum of individual responses (trace labeled Predicted on Fig. 1A is the arithmetic sum of IGABA and IATP traces). Amplitude of IATP+GABA represents 73.4 ± 3% of the predicted current (Fig. 1A; n = 27). When GABA was applied during application of ATP, and, conversely, when ATP was applied during GABA application, significant inhibition (p < 0.0005) of the responses was also observed (Fig. 1B). Amplitude of IATP and GABA was 73 ± 4.5% and IGABA and ATP was 77 ± 4% of the predicted current (n = 16).We showed previously, by recordings of oocytes expressing ρ1 GABAC receptors and 5-HT3A receptors, that co-activation by simultaneous application of GABA (10 μm) and 5-HT (100 μm) evoked responses (IGABA + 5-HT = -2.7 ± 0.6 μA) corresponding to the sum of IGABA = -1.2 ± 0.4 μA and I5 - HT = -1.5 ± 0.2 μA, demonstrating that responses mediated by these two independent receptors are additive under similar experimental conditions (26Boué-Grabot E. Barajas-Lopez C. Chakfe Y. Blais D. Bélanger D. Emerit M.B. Séguéla P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results showed that ρ1 and P2X2 channels do not function independently during co-activation and that the subunit-specific cross-talk induces rapid and reciprocal current occlusion.Current Occlusion Was Observed at Low Receptor Densities and Was Not Due to Cross-activation—To check if the cross-inhibition was dependent on the density of receptors, the expression level of both receptors was decreased while the ratio of P2X2/ρ1 subunits was kept constant. Co-application of ATP (100 μm) and GABA (10 μm) evoked currents with an amplitude (IATP + GABA = -0.4 ± 0.1 μA) that was significantly lower than the expected sum of currents evoked separately by ATP (IATP = -0.3 ± 0.1 μA) and by GABA (IGABA = -0.3 ± 0.1 μA; Fig. 2A). The amplitude of actual ATP + GABA responses represented 61.5 ± 2% of the predicted current (n = 8), indicating that current occlusion during co-activation of GABAC and P2X2 receptors was not related to artificially high receptor densities.Fig. 2Non-additivity at low channel densities and no cross-modulation or shift in agonist sensitivity in oocytes co-expressing P2X2 and GABAC channels. A, co-application of ATP + GABA induced currents (Actual) significantly smaller than the arithmetic sum (Predicted) of the individual ATP (100 μm) and GABA (10 μm) responses in oocytes expressing low levels of each receptor. B and C, superimposed current traces obtained with 10 μm of GABA, 100 μm of ATP, or a mixture of ATP and GABA from oocytes expressing P2X2 receptors alone (B) and homomeric ρ1 receptors (C).

Normalized GABA (10 μm) responses obtained from oocytes expressing ρ1 only and P2X2 + ρ1 are presented in the inset. Duration of application was 5 s. In panels D and E, mean peak currents were normalized to the maximal response (mean ± S.E.) from 5-7 oocytes. Vh = -60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oocytes injected with P2X2 RNA only did not respond to 10-100 μm application of GABA, and responses to 100 μm ATP (IATP = -4.6 ± 0.1 μA, n = 6) were not modulated by co-application of GABA (IATP + GABA = -4.65 ± 0.1μA, n = 6) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, in oocytes expressing ρ1 GABAC receptors only, the application of saturating concentration of ATP did not activate GABAC channels, and co-application of ATP + GABA-induced currents (IATP + GABA = -1.9 ± 0.4 μA, n = 5) were identical in kinetics and amplitude to GABA responses (IGABA = -1.9 ± 0.4 μA, n = 5; Fig. 2C). The ATP concentration-response curve of the P2X2 channel was not modified by co-expression with ρ1 receptors (EC50 for ATP was 2.6 ± 1.2 and 4.3 ± 1.3 μm, n = 7, respectively, for oocytes expressing P2X2 alone and the P2X2 + ρ1 subunit; Fig. 2D). Normalized ATP (100 μm) responses obtained from oocytes expressing P2X2 alone or ρ1 + P2X2 indicated that P2X2 channel kinetics were not affected by the presence of ρ1 receptors (Fig. 2D). Conversely, GABA concentration-response curves determined from oocytes expressing either ρ1 receptor alone or ρ1 + P2X2 (Fig. 2E) had similar EC50 (2.5 ± 1.9 and 1.7 ± 1.5 μm, respectively, n = 5). Kinetics of GABAC receptors were identical in the absence or presence of P2X2 receptors (Fig. 2E). These results showed that the cross-inhibition between GABAC and P2X2 receptor is not mediated by agonist cross-modulation or by a shift in agonist sensitivity and further indicated that functional cross-talk occurs only when both channels are co-activated.Voltage, Ionic Flux Direction, and Ca2+ Independence—To investigate a potential voltage-dependence of the cross-talk, we recorded responses obtained from the same oocyte expressing ρ1 and P2X2 channels after successive applications of ATP (100 μm), GABA (10 μm), and a mixture of both agonists at different holding potentials. Currents induced by co-application of ATP + GABA (actual) were significantly lower than the expected sum of individual ATP and GABA responses (prediction) at holding potential ranging from -80 to 20 mV (Fig. 3, A and B). Amplitude of IATP + GABA was 65 ± 6% at -80 mV, 70 ± 5% at -60 mV, 75 ± 4% at -40 and -20 mV, 60.3 ± 9% at 0 mV, and 52 ± 10% at 20 mV of the corresponding predicted current (n = 7).Fig. 3Current occlusion is not dependent on membrane potential or ion permeation. A, representative currents recorded from one oocyte co-expressing P2X2 and ρ1 channels elicited by successive applications of ATP (100 μm), GABA (10 μm), and ATP + GABA at different holding potentials ranging from -80 to 20 mV in 20-mV steps. Prediction (Predicted) represents the arithmetic sum of individual ATP and GABA responses at each potential.

The predicted current-voltage relationship of ρ1 + P2X2 channels is represented in black filled circles. Each point corresponds to the current amplitude mean ± S.E. obtained from 7 oocytes. Reversal potentials are indicated by arrows. D and E, superimposed currents induced by application of ATP (100 μm), GABA (10 μm), or a mixture of both agonists recorded from oocytes co-expressing P2X2 and GABAC receptors (n = 6).

Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), whereas ρ1 channels are mainly permeable to Cl- and display a linear I-V relationship with a reversal potential close to -20 mV from oocytes recorded in normal ringer solution (31Wotring V.E. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In oocytes co-expressing GABAC and P2X2 channels, the experimental current-voltage relationship for P2X2 was inwardly rectifying, whereas that for ρ1 channels was linear with reversal potential of +3.4 ± 1.3 mV for ATP and -19 ± 2 mV for GABA respectively (Fig. 3, A and C). Current-voltage relationship for actual and predicted ATP + GABA currents were linear with a slight inward rectification and displayed no difference in reversal potential (-6.7 ± 6 mV for actual and -7.6 ± 4 mV for predicted). These data indicated that both channels participated to inhibited ATP + GABA currents induced by co-application of ATP and GABA.It has been proposed that cross-inhibition between P2X and GABAA receptors expressed in DRG neurons was mainly due to action of Cl- efflux (generated by GABA inward currents) on P2X channels and by Ca2+ entry on GABA receptors (25Sokolova E. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4958-4968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed P2X2 and ρ1 in order to obtain outward currents with similar amplitudes. In these conditions, at 30-mV holding potential, we obtained similar responses to each"
https://openalex.org/W2075299561,"Filamin-A (filamin-1) is an actin-binding protein involved in the organization of actin networks. Our previous study shows that filamin-A interacts with BRCA2, and lack of filamin-A expression results in increased cellular sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents in melanoma cells (Yuan, Y., and Shen, Z. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48318-48324), suggesting a role of filamin-A in DNA damage response. In this report, we demonstrated that deficiency of filamin-A results in an 8-h delay in the recovery from G2 arrest in response to ionizing radiation. However, filamin-A deficiency does not affect the initial activation of the G2/M checkpoint. We also found that filamin-A deficiency results in sustained activation of Chk1 and Chk2 after irradiation. This in turn causes a delay in the dephosphorylation of phospho-Cdc2, which is inhibitory to the G2/M transition. In addition, filamin-A-deficient M2 cells undergo mitotic catastrophe-related nuclear fragmentation after they are released from the G2 arrest. Together, these data suggest a functional role of filamin-A in the recovery from G2 arrest and subsequent mitotic cell death after DNA damage.

In response to DNA damage, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to delay or block the progression of the cell cycle. This may prevent damaged cells from progressing into the next phase of the cell cycle, thus facilitating the maintenance of genomic stability (1Paulovich A.G. Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H.

Studies in yeast suggest that the transition from cell cycle arrest to cell cycle progression is not simply a passive response to the removal of DNA damage. It appears to be an active process in which cells can adapt to prolonged cell cycle arrest even when the DNA damage has not been completely repaired (5Toczyski D.P. Galgoczy D.J. Hartwell L.H.

Our previous study has shown that an actin-binding protein filamin-A (filamin-1, FLNa, 1The abbreviations used are: FLNanonmuscle filamin-A (filamin-1, or actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280))shRNAshort hairpin RNAUCN-017-hydroxystaurosporineDAPI4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. or ABP-280) interacts with BRCA2, and deficiency of filamin-A renders melanoma cells more sensitive to γ-rays, bleomycin, and UV irradiation (9Yuan Y. Shen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48318-48324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the role of filamin-A in cell cycle regulation using a filamin-A-deficient melanoma cell line (M2) and a C8161 melanoma cell line in which filamin-A expression was knocked down by RNA interference. We found that filamin-A deficiency correlated with an approximate 8-h delay in the recovery from G2 arrest after irradiation. However, filamin-A deficiency had little effect on the initiation of G2 arrest, indicating intact activation of the G2/M checkpoint. The delayed G2 recovery correlated with delayed dephosphorylation of the phospho-Cdc2 protein and sustained activation of the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases. Furthermore, we found that deficiency of filamin-A renders cells more prone to mitotic cell death. These data provide the first evidence that filamin-A plays a significant role in the recovery from radiation-induced G2 arrest and mitotic cell death in mammalian cells. nonmuscle filamin-A (filamin-1, or actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280)) short hairpin RNA 7-hydroxystaurosporine 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dimethyl sulfoxide terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. Cell Culture—Human A7 and M2 melanoma cells were kindly provided by Drs. T. P. Stossel and Y. Ohta (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School). The M2 is a human melanoma cell line lacking filamin-A expression. The A7 cell line was derived from M2 through the stable transfection of a plasmid expressing full-length filamin-A (10Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). A7 and M2 cells were subcultured twice a week in minimum essential medium with Earle's salt (EMEM) (M2) or EMEM with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (A7). The C8161 melanoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. D. R. Welch (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To induce DNA damage, cells were irradiated with γ-rays (137Cs, 0.938 Gy/min) at room temperature and immediately returned to a 37 °C incubator. To inhibit Chk1 and Chk2 activities, 100 nm UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine, National Cancer Institute) was added to the cell culture 30 min before the cells were exposed to radiation and was maintained in the media until the cells were collected. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Filamin-A was detected with an anti-filamin-A antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Cdc2 was detected with an anti-Cdc2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Tyr-15 phosphorylated Cdc2 was detected with an anti-phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody (Cell Signal Technology, Beverly, MA). Activated Chk1 and Chk2 kinases were detected with antibodies specific to Ser-345-phosphorylated Chk1 and Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2, respectively (Cell Signal Technology, Beverly, MA). β-Actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to confirm that an equal amount of protein was loaded in each sample. Construction of pPUR/U6 Vector for Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Expression and to Confer Puromycin Resistance—The BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragment of pBS/U6 (a gift from Y. Shi, Harvard Medical School of Medicine, Boston, MA) that contains the U6 promoter for short hairpin RNA expression was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pPUR vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This resulted in a new vector pPUR/U6 to express the short hairpin RNA and to confer puromycin resistance in mammalian cells. The strategy to construct an shRNA expression vector was described by Sui et al. (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Briefly, two inverted sequences of 21 bases (5′GGG CTG ACA ACA GTG TGG TGC3′) of the filamin-A cDNA were linked by a 9-base linker sequence and cloned downstream of the U6 promoter, resulting in the RNA interference vector pPUR/U6/filamin-A. This vector directs the synthesis of a filamin-A-specific shRNA in vivo. Vacant vector was used as the negative control. Analysis of DNA Content by Flow Cytometry—Cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were then pelleted, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 200 μl of citrate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.05% Me2SO, 40 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.6). Nine hundred μl of Solution A (0.003% trypsin in stock buffer (3.4 mm trisodium citrate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.5 mm Trizma, pH 7.6)) were added to the cells. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 5-6 vortexes during the incubation. Afterward, 750 μl of Solution B (0.025% trypsin inhibitor, 0.01% ribonuclease A in stock buffer) was added for another incubation of 10 min at room temperature with two vortexes during the incubation. Then, 750 μl of Solution C (0.0416% propidium iodide, 3.3 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride in stock buffer) was added to the cells on ice. Afterward, the cells were covered with aluminum foil and were ready for flow cytometry analysis. In each flow cytometry assay, 20,000 cells were collected using FACScan (BD Biosciences) (12Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Mitotic Index Assay—The cells were continuously treated with 1 μg/ml nocodazole for various time periods. Then the cells were harvested, swollen hypotonically for 5 min in 75 mm KCl, gently pelleted, and fixed in 0.5 ml of Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid, v/v) for 5 min. Subsequently, the cells were dropped on pre-wetted slides and allowed to air dry. Fixed cells were stained with DAPI, and mitotic cells were counted with fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2) as described previously (13Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar). For each sample, the percentage of mitotic cells was determined from 200-300 cells counted, and the experiment was repeated three to four times. Visualization of Nuclear Fragmentation—To demonstrate fragmentation of the nucleus, cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min at -20 °C. The cells were then stained with rabbit anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) and visualized by Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). DAPI was used to visualize the nucleus. Delayed Recovery from G2Arrest in Filamin-A-deficient M2 Melanoma Cells—The M2 melanoma cell line does not express filamin-A, whereas the A7 cell line is an isogenic cell line derived from M2 in which filamin-A expression is restored to its normal level (10Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To investigate whether absence of filamin-A in M2 cells affects DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation, we studied the cell cycle profiles of A7 and M2 cells after irradiation. Specifically, asynchronized populations of A7 and M2 cells in the exponential growth phase were irradiated with 8 Gy of γ-rays, and their cell cycle profiles were analyzed at various time points from 4-24 h after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1, nonirradiated control A7 and M2 cells displayed a similar pattern of heterogeneous log phase distribution throughout the 24-h period. When the cells were irradiated with γ-rays, both the A7 and M2 cells started to accumulate into the G2 phase at 4 h and peaked at 16 h. At 24 h, the percentage of A7 cells in the G2 phase decreased significantly, suggesting a release from G2 arrest. However, the percentage of M2 cells in G2 was still high at 24 h, suggesting a slower release from the G2 phase. Our previous study showed that M2 cells are ∼10 times more sensitive to irradiation than A7 cells as measured by a clonogenic survival assay (9Yuan Y. Shen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48318-48324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2A). It is possible that the delayed release from G2 arrest in the M2 cell line is because of their higher sensitivity to radiation. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the cell cycle distribution of A7 and M2 cells at the same survival rate, namely 8 Gy for A7 and 6 Gy for M2 (pair I), as well as 12 Gy for A7 and 8 Gy for M2 (pair II) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, M2 cells again displayed a much higher percentage in the G2 phase at 24 h for both pairs of iso-survival doses. This further supports the notion that the lack of filamin-A expression in M2 cells results in a slower recovery from G2 arrest, which is not necessarily because of the reduced survival in M2 cells. To determine the difference in G2 arrest recovery between A7 and M2 cells, we conducted a nocodazole-trapping assay. Briefly, the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole was added to cells immediately after irradiation to block cells at the anaphase of mitosis. The accumulation of mitotic cells was determined by counting the cells that had condensed chromosomes. Under normal conditions, the mitotic index increases immediately after nocodazole treatment. However, a delayed accumulation of mitotic cells is expected if the G2/M checkpoint is activated to arrest the cells in the G2 phase. The mitotic index will increase if the G2-arrested cells recover from this arrest. As shown in Fig. 3, the mitotic indices of both A7 and M2 cells accumulated in a similar pattern as time progressed in the control groups (0 Gy), indicating that filamin-A is not necessary for normal progression of G2 cells into the M phase. However, after a prolonged mitotic blockage by nocodazole, the percentage of mitotic cells tended to decline. This might reflect an escape of mitotic cells from the nocodazole blockage, which is not unusual for many tumor cell lines. There was no mitotic accumulation in the A7 cells during the first 8 h. The mitotic index started to increase between 8-16 h post-irradiation, indicating that the G2/M checkpoint was activated upon irradiation in the A7 cells and lasted for ∼8 h. However, the mitotic index in the M2 cells remained low during the first 16 h post-irradiation. It started to increase at 16-24 h, suggesting that there was normal activation of the G2/M checkpoint in the M2 cells, but the G2 arrest lasted for at least 16 h, ∼8 h longer than that of the A7 cells. Therefore, data here are consistent with the data in Figs. 1 and 2. Together, these data demonstrated that a lack of filamin-A expression in M2 cells results in an ∼8-h delay in the recovery from G2 arrest after irradiation. Delayed Recovery from G2Arrest in C8161 Melanoma Cells with Filamin-A Knockdown Using RNA Interference—To confirm the results obtained with the M2/A7 cell lines (Figs. 1, 2, 3), the filamin-A expression in the melanoma cell line C8161 was knocked down using RNA interference, resulting in the cell line C8161/FLNa-KD (Fig. 4A). The mitotic index assay was carried out using this cell line, and its parental cell line C8161 transfected with an empty vector as the control. As shown in Fig. 4B, in the absence of irradiation, a similar accumulation of mitotic cells was observed in C8161 and C8161/FLNa-KD after nocodazole block. When the cells were irradiated, both cell lines displayed a delayed accumulation of mitotic cells when compared with nonirradiated cells, indicating an activation of the G2/M checkpoint and subsequent G2 arrest. Recovery from G2 arrest in C8161/FLNa-KD was about 8 h longer than that observed in the C8161 parental cells. These data confirmed that the delayed recovery from G2 arrest in the M2 cells was because of the lack of filamin-A expression (Fig. 3). It is of interest to note that in the absence of irradiation, the percentage of mitotic cells decreased after 16 h of blockage with nocodazole. This is consistent with the observation that in the absence of irradiation, the percentage of mitotic A7 and M2 cells decreased 24-32 h after nocodazole blockage (Fig. 3). The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not clear, but it is not unusual for some tumor cells to escape nocodazole-induced mitotic blockage, and it may reflect a defect of the spindle checkpoint in these cells. Delayed Recovery from G2Arrest in Filamin-A-deficient Cells Correlates with Slower Dephosphorylation of Phospho-Cdc2—It is well established that the onset of mitosis is triggered by the activation of cyclin B/Cdc2 and that the activation of cyclin B/Cdc2 is absolutely required for the transition of G2 cells into the M phase (4O'Connor P.M.

Generally, cyclin B/Cdc2 is inactivated by phosphorylations of the Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues during the G2 phase (4O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar, 15O'Connell M.J.

When the cells are ready to enter mitosis, the mitosis-promoting phosphatase Cdc25C dephosphorylates Cdc2 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (4O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar, 15O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Rhind N. Furnari B.

To determine whether filamin-A-mediated recovery from G2 arrest is regulated by Cdc2 dephosphorylation, we measured the status of Cdc2 phosphorylation in the A7 and M2 cells from 4 to 48 h after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5, the Cdc2 triplet band (from top to bottom, panels A and C) represents double-phosphorylated, single-phosphorylated, and nonphosphorylated Cdc2, respectively. The double-phosphorylated Cdc2 is the form that sustains G2 arrest. We confirmed that the top band in the triplet contained Tyr-15-phosphorylated Cdc2 using an antiphospho-Tyr-15-Cdc2 antibody (see Fig. 6C). In irradiated A7 cells (Fig. 5A), the relative abundance of double-phosphorylated Cdc2 (as compared with the other two forms) remained high from 8 to 16 h and started to decline after 16 h. These data are in agreement with those in Fig. 3, where the recovery from G2-arrested A7 cells started at 8-16 h after irradiation. However, the relative abundance of the double-phosphorylated Cdc2 in M2 cells remained high during the first 24 h and declined slowly afterward. This delayed dephosphorylation of Cdc2 in M2 cells is consistent with the data in Fig. 3, where the recovery from G2 arrest started 16-24 h after irradiation. Thus, the dephosphorylation of the double-phosphorylated Cdc2 (Fig. 5) coincides with the recovery from G2-arrested cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that the filamin-A-dependent recovery from G2 arrest is most likely related to the Cdc2-mediated G2/M control mechanism.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of Chk1, Chk2, and Cdc2 upon irradiation. A7 and M2 cells were irradiated with 8 Gy γ-rays. At various time points after the irradiation, Western blots were performed to detect the phosphorylated forms of Chk1, Chk2, and Cdc2. Phospho-Chk1(Ser-345) (A)-, phospho-Chk2(Thr-68) (B)-, and phospho-Cdc2(Tyr-15) (C)-specific antibodies were used. The type of cell lines, radiation doses, and time after irradiation are labeled on the top. The protein sample of nonirradiated cells at 32 h was not loaded because of a limitation of gel space (only 14 specimens can be loaded on the same gel). β-Actin was used as a loading control (D). IR, irradiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Slower Dephosphorylation of Cdc2 in M2 Cells Is Attributed to the Sustained Activation of Chk1 and Chk2 Kinases—Activation of Chk1 and Chk2 is the upstream event that leads to the increased phosphorylation of Tyr-15 on Cdc2. Chk1 and Chk2 (also named hCds1) are the human homologues of the fission yeast checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Cds1, respectively. Chk2 is activated mainly in response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and requires phosphorylation on its Thr-68 residue by ATM kinase (20Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 21Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, Chk1 activation requires phosphorylation at Ser-345 by ATR kinase and is primarily elicited by DNA replication blocking agents such as hydroxyurea or nonionizing radiation such as UV light (22Capasso H. Palermo C. Wan S. Rao H. John U.P. O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4555-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D.

Baber B.A. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11289-11294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the ATR/Chk1 pathway can also be activated by ionizing radiation to elicit G2 arrest in the absence of ATM (25Wang X. Khadpe J. Hu B. Iliakis G. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30869-30874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways probably overlap and cooperate after DNA damage. Both activated Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate Cdc25C at Ser-216, preventing Cdc25C from dephosphorylating Cdc2 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (26Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 in the A7 and M2 cells following irradiation to determine whether the delayed G2 recovery in the M2 cells is mediated by these upstream kinases. As shown in Fig. 6A, the Ser-345-phosphorylated Chk1 (Chk1 (Ser-345-P)) level was low in both the A7 and M2 cells in the absence of irradiation. Irradiation significantly increased Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-345 in both cell lines. In the A7 cells, the level of Ser-345-phosphorylated Chk1 peaked at 16 h and returned to normal by 24 h. However, in the M2 cells the level of phosphorylated Chk1 peaked at 8 h and returned to normal at 32 h. This suggests a more sustained phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-345 in M2 cells than in A7 cells. Chk2 was also activated by irradiation in both cell lines as shown in Fig. 6B. However, the activation was greater in M2 cells than in A7 cells (Fig. 6C). Prolonged phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 in M2 cells agrees with the observed change of Tyr-15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Figs. 5 and 6C) and the recovery from G2 arrest shown in Fig. 3. These data suggest that the delayed recovery from G2 arrest in filamin-A-deficient M2 cells is because of the sustained activation of the G2/M checkpoint pathway involving the Chk1/Chk2-dependent signal transduction cascades. To further confirm this notion, a Chk1 and Chk2 inhibitor, UCN-01, was used. UCN-01 was originally identified as an inhibitor of Chk1 (27Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 28Graves P.R. Yu L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but it also inhibits the Chk2 kinase activity as shown recently (29Yu Q. La Rose J. Zhang H. Takemura H. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5743-5748PubMed Google Scholar). Because sustained activation of both Chk1 and Chk2 was observed in the filamin-A-deficient M2 cells after irradiation, we anticipated that inhibition of Chk1 and Chk2 by UCN-01 would abolish the delayed dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr-15. In other words, the abnormally high level of Tyr-15-phosphorylated Cdc2 in M2 cells would be reduced to a level comparable with that observed in A7 cells. To examine this possibility, 100 nm UCN-01 or Me2SO (as a control) was added to the cells 30 min before irradiation and kept in the medium until the cells were harvested. Twenty-four h after irradiation, the cells were harvested to measure the level of Tyr-15-phosphorylated Cdc2. As expected, UCN-01 treatment did not change the level of Tyr-15-phosphorylated Cdc2 in nonirradiated A7 (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2) and M2 (Fig. 7A, lanes 5 and 6) cells. However, the radiation-induced Tyr-15 phosphorylation on Cdc2 in A7 (Fig. 7A, lane 3) and M2 (Fig. 7A, lane 7) cells was reduced to the level of nonirradiated A7 and M2 cells after UCN-01 treatment (lanes 4 and 8). This suggests that Chk1 and Chk2 are responsible for the sustained Tyr-15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 at 24 h after irradiation in the M2 cells (Figs. 5 and 6). In addition, the nocodazole-trapping assay was carried out to demonstrate that inhibition of Chk1 and Chk2 also abolishes G2 arrest in M2 cells. Briefly, 100 nm UCN-01 was added to the cell culture and maintained in medium until the cells were collected. Cells were then irradiated, and 1 μg/ml nocodazole was added immediately. As seen in Fig. 3, the biggest difference in mitotic indices between A7 and M2 cells occurred at 24 h after irradiation. Therefore, the mitotic cells were scored at 24 h, and the mitotic index of each group was calculated. As expected (Fig. 7B), the addition of UCN-01 did not affect the mitotic indices of the A7 cells and nonirradiated M2 cells. As shown previously, in irradiated M2 cells there was a significant decrease in the percentage of mitotic cells (Fig. 7B), reflecting a delayed release of G2-arrested cells into mitosis as shown in Fig. 3. This delayed release was abolished by the addition of UCN-01 (Fig. 7B). These data further demonstrate that the G2 arrest in M2 cells is controlled by the pathway involving Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, which are upstream effectors of Cdc25C and Cdc2. Mitotic Catastrophe Followed the Delayed Recovery from G2Arrest in Filamin-A-deficient M2 Cells after Irradiation—When mammalian cells cannot repair their DNA damage, they can execute two major cell death pathways, apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe (30Hendry J.H.

If apoptosis is the major cause of cell death, a sub-G1 population of cells would be observed in a DNA content-based cell cycle analysis. Our data in Figs. 1 and 2 did not exhibit a sub-G1 population of M2 cells, suggesting that apoptosis was not the cause of increased cell death. In addition, we used terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay to visualize potential apoptotic cells, but no positive TUNEL staining was observed (data not shown). Therefore, apoptotic response to radiation is unlikely to be the cause of enhanced toxicity in M2 cells. This observation is consistent with a recent report that a defect of filamin-A did not enhance the apoptotic response in M2 cells but rather that filamin-A might be a caspase substrate and is cleaved directly by protease granzyme B during apoptosis (35Browne K.A.

During cell division chromosomes are duplicated and segregated into daughter cells. After DNA replication sister chromatids are held together by protein complexes known as cohesins. This cohesion allows chromatids to be aligned on the mitotic spindle in metaphase until they are pulled to opposite spindle poles by microtubules at the onset of anaphase. In budding yeast, cohesin complexes are formed by four core subunits, two structural maintenance of chromosome proteins (Smc1 and Smc3), and two sister chromatid cohesion proteins (Scc1 and Scc3) (1Nasmyth K. Science. 2002; 297: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In vertebrates two Scc3 homologues have been described (STAG1 and STAG2), which integrate independent cohesin complexes (2Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cohesins form a ring around the sister DNA molecules, with Smc1 and Smc3 forming a V-shaped heterodimer bridged by Scc1 (3Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K.

Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). At the metaphase-anaphase transition, the anaphase promoting complex triggers the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of securin, activating the endopeptidase separase, which cleaves Scc1, leading to chromatid segregation (1Nasmyth K. Science. 2002; 297: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 5Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Scc1 cleavage is enhanced after its phosphorylation by Polo-like kinases (6Alexandru G. Uhlmann F. Mechtler K. Poupart M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2001; 105: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In vertebrates removal of cohesins from the chromosomes is achieved through two steps. The bulk of cohesin is released from chromosomes at prophase by a mechanism involving cohesin phosphorylation by Polo-like kinases without cleavage of Scc1/Rad21 (7Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Stukenberg P.T. Kelm O. Redemann N. Nigg E.A. Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). At the onset of anaphase, the residual amount of cohesins, mainly located at the centromeric heterochromatin, are removed from chromosomes by Scc1/Rad21 cleavage, and sister chromatids are then separated (8Hauf S. Waizenegger I. Peters J.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The persistent localization of cohesins at the centromeric region prevents precocious chromatid separation and is mediated by Swi6, a conserved heterochromatin protein (9Bernard P. Maure J.F. Partridge J.F. Genier S. Javerzat J.P. Allshire R.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2539-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Swi6 is able to interact with Scc3, suggesting that recruitment of the cohesin complex is mediated through this interaction (10Nonaka N. Kitajima T. Yokobayashi S. Xiao G. Yamamoto M. Grewal S.I. Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, cohesin is also recruited to other DNA regions to which Swi6 binds. Although previous work on cohesins has been mainly focused on chromatid cohesion and segregation, certain cohesins have been implicated in different cellular processes (11Hagstrom K.A. Meyer B.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 520-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this regard caspase proteolysis of Rad21 can be observed in cells undergoing apoptosis in response to diverse stimuli, preceding chromatin condensation and amplifying the death signal (12Pati D. Zhang N. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8267-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Chen F. Kamradt M. Mulcahy M. Byun Y. Xu H. McKay M.J. Cryns V.L. J. Biol.

On the other hand, a post-translationally modified form of Smc3 carrying chondroitin sulfate chains is overexpressed and secreted in colon carcinomas (14Ghiselli G. Iozzo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cohesin function is also essential for DNA repair (15Sjogren C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 991-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In this context Smc1 is an effector of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Nijmegen breakage syndrome pathway and forms part of the DNA damage response network (16Kim S.-T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 17Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and Rad21 depletion is associated with increased radiation sensitivity (18Sonoda E. Matsuaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P.

The possible function of Scc3/STAG, however, is not completely understood. Whereas depletion of Rad21 in Drosophila melanogaster cells results in premature sister chromatid separation and mitosis delay, much milder effects are observed in STAG-depleted cells (19Vass S.

These results suggest that Scc3/STAG may be involved in other processes besides chromatid cohesion. Herein, we provide evidences suggesting that Scc3/STAG functions as a transcriptional co-activator by a mechanism involving protein-protein interactions with transcription factors.

The pSTAG2 vectors derive from pCDNA3.1 and express the full-length (1-1162) and mutant STAG2 proteins under the control of the CMV 1The abbreviations used are: CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase. promoter. pSTAG2-ΔE (127-1162), pSTAG2-EEV (127-815), and pSTAG2-XX (415-1162) bear different deletions of the STAG2 protein. pSTAG2-m1, pSTAG2-m2, and pSTAG2-m12 were generated by directed mutagenesis of the LXXLL sites at amino acids 502 (m1), 540 (m2), or both (m12) in which the last two Leu were replaced by two Ala. pGFP-STAG2, pGFP-STAGm1, and pGFP-STAGm2 carry the same constructs linked to the C-terminal domain of the GFP. pCMV-Tat, pSTAG1, and pCMV2N3T-CBP are expression vectors for Tat, STAG1, and CBP, respectively. The reporter constructs pTNFα-Luc, pAIM-Luc, and pHIV-LTR-Luc bear the TNFα promoter (-600), the CD69 promoter (-1400), and the HIV-long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, respectively, upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. pLTR-ΔκB-Luc carries the HIV-LTR with a deletion of the NF-κB site. The reporter plasmids KBF-Luc and Gal4-Luc carry multimeric copies of responsive sites for the transcription factors NF-κB and Gal4, respectively. pGal4-p65, pGal4-p65mut, pGal4-cRel, and pGal4-Sp1 express chimerical constructs bearing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 linked to the transcription activation domains of p65, p65mut (carrying a double mutation Ser → Ala at 529/536), cRel, and Sp1, respectively. The reporter plasmid pRL-null bears the Renilla luciferase gene preceded by no promoter and was co-transfected in all points (0.5 μg) and used to normalize all the firefly luciferase values obtained. pGST-Tat, pGST-p65, and pGST-STAG2 express the glutathione S-transferase linked to Tat, p65, or STAG2-ΔE, respectively. Cells and Transfections—The lymphoblastoid T cell line Jurkat, the erythroleukemic K562, the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2, and the kidney embryonic 293 cells were maintained in RPMI (Jurkat and K562) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HepG2 and 293) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Stag2 KO cells were obtained from 129 Sv mouse embryonic stem cells to generate Stag2 KO mice. 2E. Lara-Pezzi, N. Pezzi, I. Prieto, I. Barthelemy, C. Carreiro, A. Martínez, A. Maldonado-Rodríguez, M. López-Cabrera, and J. L. Barbero, unpublished results. Loss of STAG2 expression in KO cells was confirmed by Western blot (inset, Fig. 3D). Jurkat cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 0.2 μg of the reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pCDNA3.1, and the indicated amount of pSTAG2 using 4.5 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen). HepG2, 129Sv wild type, and Stag2 KO cells were transfected with the same amount of DNA using DOSPER (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 6 h the medium was replaced, the cells were incubated for additional 18 h and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. Pull-down Assays—Pull-down experiments were carried out as previously described (21Carretero M. Gómez-Gonzalo M. Lara-Pezzi E. Benedicto I. Aramburu J. Martínez-Martínez S. Redondo J.M.

Briefly, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 30 min. The cells were lysed in EBC buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol) 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells stimulated for 60 min with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 0.5 μm calcium ionophore were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of purified GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. After washing, bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear pellets of Jurkat cells was extracted for 1 h on ice in buffer containing 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation experiments 100 μl of nuclear extract were mixed with 100 μl of nuclear extraction buffer and Nonidet NP 1/1000. STAG2 Co-activates Transcription—To unveil the possible role of STAG2, the main Scc3 isoform in human tissue culture cells (2Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we searched for short sequence homology with other proteins. Analysis of the STAG2 sequence revealed a glutamine-rich region in its C-terminal domain that is also present in transcriptional co-activators of the p160 family (SRC1, TIF-2, and RAC3) (Fig. 1). In addition, STAG2 presented three LXXLL motives, which are found in transcriptional co-activators, including CBP, p300, and the p160 family, and are necessary for their co-activation function (22Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). To study whether STAG2 could act as a transcriptional coactivator, we analyzed the effect of STAG2 on the activity of three different reporter constructs bearing the proximal regions of the CD69 and TNFα promoters and the HIV LTR, which acts as a viral promoter, driving transcription of the HIV RNA. When the constructs containing the HIV-LTR or the CD69 promoter were co-transfected into the T-cell line Jurkat along with the expression vector pSTAG2, a STAG2-mediated up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of HIV-LTR, but not of CD69 promoter, was observed (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when co-transfections were performed in the erythroleukemia cell line K562, overexpression of STAG2 resulted in the activation of both CD69 and TNFα promoters (Fig. 2B). Given that the activity of CD69 and TNFα promoters is regulated by members of the NF-κB family in myeloid but not in lymphoid cells, these results suggested that the co-activation function of STAG2 was achieved through NF-κB elements of these promoters. To rule out the possibility that an increase in STAG2 expression may result in reduced cell viability we included in the co-transfection experiments the non-inducible reporter plasmid pRL-null. Analysis of the Renilla luciferase activity showed similar results in the presence of different amounts of pSTAG2 up to 1 μg, indicating that the increased STAG2 expression was not interfering with cell viability (data not shown). We performed similar experiments transfecting expression vectors for the cohesin STAG1 and the co-activator CBP. Both STAG1 and CBP showed similar co-activation activity in Jurkat cells as STAG2 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the ability of the latter to enhance the activity of the HIV-LTR transcription was conserved in its homologue STAG1 and was quantitatively similar to that exhibited by other co-activators like CBP. The activity of the HIV-LTR promoter is dependent on the presence of both the NF-κB-responsive element and the transactivation response (region) site, which is recognized by the viral transactivator Tat to induce HIV transcription (23Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Baldassarre F. Ambrosino C. Scala G. Quinto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 271: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether Tat activity was necessary for the enhancement of the HIV-LTR activity by STAG2 we transfected Jurkat cells with the HIV-LTR reporter plasmid and pSTAG2 in the absence (Fig. 3A) or presence (Fig. 3B) of a Tat expression vector. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, induction of the HIV-LTR activity by STAG2 was increased in the presence of Tat. Deletion of the NF-κB-responsive element in the viral LTR (HIV-LTR-ΔκB) resulted in a decrease in the ability of STAG2 to enhance the promoter activity, suggesting that STAG2 could act as a co-activator for this transcription factor. To study whether STAG2 could contribute to the induction of the HIV-LTR by Tat, we transfected Jurkat cells with the HIV-LTR reporter plasmid along with Tat and/or STAG2 expression vectors. We observed that the ability of Tat to activate the HIV-LTR was increased in the presence of STAG2 (Fig. 3C). In addition, the activation of the HIV-LTR by Tat was higher in the wild type Stag-expressing cells than in the Stag2 knockout cells (Fig. 3D). To further investigate the involvement of STAG2 in HIV transcription, we performed pull-down assays with GST-Tat. As shown in Fig. 3E, STAG2 interacted with Tat in Jurkat cell extracts. All these data strongly suggest that STAG2 enhances the ability of Tat to induce the HIV promoter. STAG2 Co-activates the NF-κB Transcription Factor—Because the NF-κB-responsive elements appeared to be necessary for the induction of HIV-LTR as well as the CD69 and TNFα promoters, we studied whether STAG2 could enhance NF-κB-driven transcription in an independent promoter context. We transfected Jurkat cells with a reporter construct bearing three tandem NF-κB-responsive elements (pKBF-Luc) along with pSTAG2. Analysis of the reporter construct showed an induction of NF-κB-driven transcription in the presence of increased STAG2 expression (Fig. 4A). To find out whether the effect of STAG2 on NF-κB-mediated transcription was specific to the cell type employed, we transfected the hepatic cell line HepG2 with pKBF-Luc in the presence or absence of pSTAG2, obtaining similar results. We confirmed the co-activation of NF-κB by STAG2 using the Gal4 transcription system, which allows the study of transcription factor activities independently of endogenous factors. Jurkat cells were transfected with a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is driven by four tandem copies of the responsive element for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (pGal4-Luc) along with expression vectors containing chimeras of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 linked to the transcription activation domain of the NF-κB subunits p65, cRel, or the unrelated transcription factor Sp1. These constructs are constitutively active and are not regulated by the signaling pathways that govern the activation of the endogenous transcription factors. Co-transfection of the STAG2 expression vector increased the activation mediated by Gal4-p65 but not by a mutant Gal4-p65 form, in which the transcriptional activity has been abolished (Fig. 4B). In addition, STAG2 co-activated the transcription mediated by Gal4-cRel but not by Gal4-Sp1. These results demonstrate that STAG2 selectively enhances NF-κB-mediated transcription independently of other stimuli. To determine whether STAG2 could interact with the transcription machinery components, we performed pull-down assays using nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells and a GST-p65 chimera in which the p65 transcription activation domain is linked to the glutathione S-transferase. As shown in Fig. 5A, STAG2 co-precipitated with GST-p65 but not with GST alone, suggesting that STAG2 and p65 could form part of the same transcriptional complexes. The co-activator p300 was used as a positive control. Accordingly, when we analyzed the ability of the two proteins to interact with each other endogenously, we observed that STAG2 interacted with p65, as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 5B). One of the LXXLL Motives of STAG2 Is Necessary for Its Co-activation Activity—To study the contribution of the different domains of STAG2 to its co-activation activities, we transfected Jurkat cells with the reporter construct pGal4-Luc, pGal4-p65, and expression vectors bearing different deletions or point mutations of the STAG2 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 6A, deletion of the first N-terminal 127 amino acids (pSTAG2-ΔE) and the last 348 amino acids (pSTAG2-EEV) had no effect on the co-activation of p65 by STAG2. In addition, a construct lacking the first 415 amino acids of STAG2 (pSTAG2-XX) showed the same co-activation capacity as the wild type form. The region spanning amino acids 415-815 carries two LXXLL motifs (amino acids 502-506 and 540-544), which are essential for the activity of other co-activators, including SRC1, TIF-2, or p300 (22Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of these LXXLL motives to the co-activation activity of STAG2, we mutated these motives separately (pSTAG2-m1 and pSTAG2-m2) or together (pSTAG2-m12). Whereas mutation of the LPQLL motif (m1, amino acids 502-506) showed no effect, mutation of the LDALL motif (m2, amino acids 540-544) either alone or together with LPQLL (m12) resulted in a strong decrease in the co-activation activity of STAG2 (Fig. 6A). To rule out the possibility that the STAG2-m2 construct could be deficiently expressed or have decreased stability, we transfected Jurkat cells with pGal4-Luc, pGal4-p65, and expression vectors bearing the STAG2 cDNA linked to the GFP. Again pGFP-STAG2-m2 showed less co-activation efficiency than the wild type and the pGFP-STAG2-m1 constructs (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis of 293 cells transfected with the different constructs showed similar expression levels of all the GFP-STAG2 fusion proteins (Fig. 6C), indicating that the decrease of transcription enhancement observed in the presence of the mutated LDALL motif was due to a loss of the co-activation function rather than to a loss of expression of STAG2. Transcriptional co-activators are multifunctional complexes that are recruited by sequence-specific transcription factors and enhance transcriptional activation of target genes (24Näär A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The p160 family of co-activators (SRC1, TIF-2, and RAC3) was initially identified as nuclear receptor-interacting proteins that were able to enhance receptor-mediated transcriptional activation (25Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p160 co-activators potentiate transcription of the HIV-LTR promoter stimulated by the viral transactivator Tat (26Kino T. Slobodskaya O. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2396-2405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ability of p160 proteins to enhance the HIV-LTR activity is dependent on the presence of the transcription factor NF-κB and is mediated by some of the LXXLL motives of the co-activator (26Kino T. Slobodskaya O. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2396-2405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, STAG2 is able to enhance the Tat-stimulated activity of the HIV-LTR promoter in a NF-κB-dependent manner and to interact with the viral transactivator. This cohesin also enhanced the activity of two other promoters, CD69 and TNFα, in K562 cells, where their activity is dependent on NF-κB (27López-Cabrera Muñoz E. Blázquez M.V. Ursa M.A. Santís A.G. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21545-21551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, STAG2 did not enhance the CD69 promoter activity in Jurkat cells, in which the promoter is rather dependent on Egr, ATF/CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), and AP-1 transcription factors (28Castellanos M.C. López-Giral S. López-Cabrera M. Landázuri M.O.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3108-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), supporting the idea of specific co-activation of NF-κB by STAG2. In addition, STAG2 co-activates NF-κB-mediated transcription through one of its LXXLL motives and is able to interact with this transcription factor. LXXLL co-activation motives are also present in the other two human homologues of Scc3 (STAG1 and STAG3) but not in other mitotic cohesins Rad21, SMC1, and SMC3 (Fig. 7A). In addition, the positions of the three LXXLL co-activation motives found in human STAG2 are conserved in other vertebrate STAG2 proteins, and LXXLL motives can be found in the Scc3/STAG isoforms of different organisms ranging from yeast to plants or insects (Fig. 7B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the 540 LXXLL co-activation motif is essential for the enhancement of transcription mediated by STAG2 and suggests that this conserved motif may have a key role in other Scc3/STAG2 activities. This is the first description of a role of a cohesin in transcriptional regulation. Although alternative activities had been reported for cohesins Smc1, Smc3, and Rad21 aside from chromatid cohesion (12Pati D. Zhang N. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8267-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Chen F. Kamradt M. Mulcahy M. Byun Y. Xu H. McKay M.J. Cryns V.L. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the possible function of Scc3/STAG remained elusive. Here we propose a possible function for Scc3/STAG as a transcriptional co-activator. It has recently been suggested that the cohesin regulatory factor Scc2 might facilitate communication between enhancer and promoters (11Hagstrom K.A. Meyer B.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 520-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our results support this idea and propose a possible mechanism for the regulation of gene transcription by cohesins. The interaction between STAG2 and the NF-κB subunit p65 may help to recruit other components of the transcriptional co-activator complexes. In this regard, although STAG2 did not exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity (data not shown), it has been described to interact with other acetyltransferases like EcoI, a conserved protein necessary for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase in budding yeast (29Ivanov D. Schleifer A. Eisenhaber F. Mechtler K. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because acetylation of p65 controls its transcriptional activity (30Chen L.F. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that STAG2 might regulate NF-κB-driven transcription by recruiting acetyltransferases. Our findings are consistent with recent results which show that chromatin-remodeling complexes can load cohesins onto DNA, correlating with histone modification (31Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G. Speicher D.W. Yokomori K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2002; 418: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, Scc3/STAG can be recruited by Swi6/heterochromatin protein 1 (10Nonaka N. Kitajima T. Yokobayashi S. Xiao G. Yamamoto M. Grewal S.I. Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) to centromeric regions. Heterochromatin protein 1 is a conserved heterochromatic adaptor molecule involved in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure (32Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7466) Google Scholar). However, heterochromatin protein 1 has recently been involved in inducing gene expression in euchromatin (33Piacentini L. Fanti L. Berloco M. Perrini B. Pimpinelli S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the association of STAG2 with Swi6/heterochromatin protein 1 could enhance gene transcription. Swi6 forms part of transcriptional complexes that regulate many genes at the G1-S transition (34Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because cohesins are loaded onto DNA at the S phase, the co-activation activity of STAG2 could help to control the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. The ability to interact with transcription factors and enhance their transcriptional activity represents a new feature of cohesins and will help us to gain sight into the function of this intriguing complex.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yernool D.A. McCarthy J.K. Eveleigh D.E. Bok J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With optimal activity at 85 °C and low affinity for cellobiose (its preferred substrate is cellotetraose), GghA is an excellent target for a directed evolution effort. By “redesigning” GghA as a thermostable cellobiase with increased catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for cellobiose hydrolysis, the modified enzyme could play a significant role in a high temperature model cellulase system. Directed molecular evolution, a widely used, dynamic tool for protein engineering (16Farinas E.T. Bulter T. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Chockalingam K. Chen Z. Curr. Opin. Biotechol. 2002; 13: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), draws its power from iterative cycles of random nucleotide-sequence mutagenesis, colony expression, and screening of mutants (18Leung D.C. Goeddel D.V. Technique J. Methods Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar, 19Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Its feasibility depends on a dynamic screening assay to identify enhanced mutant clones against a background of (tens of) thousands of normal and null clones. To screen for an evolved β-glucosidase (GghA) with increased activity toward a native substrate, cellobiose, we developed a thermostable (85 °C) coupled enzyme assay with glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although β-glucosidase activity is rapidly and routinely assayed with chromogenic substrates such as various p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glycosides, using the pNP-β-d-glucoside (pNPG) analog in determining increased hydrolysis of cellobiose by GghA mutants might have resulted in evolving an “improved” enzyme that lacked a useful industrial application. As pNPG has both glycone and aglycone moieties, greater mutant enzyme activity might indicate that an amino acid substitution had occurred in a residue responsible for aglycone recognition or binding. Such substitutions might have a wholly different effect on cellobiose that lacks the steric and electrostatic characteristics of the aglycone moiety. The first step in the directed evolution of GghA, expressed in Escherichia coli, has produced an enzyme with β-glucosidase-like character. The GghA mutant, based on a single amino acid substitution six positions from the catalytic residues conserved in all family 1 β-glucosidases, has a Vmax for cellobiose 31% higher than its wild type parent and shows a 31% increase in catalytic efficiency when assayed at 85 °C, the temperature optimum of the wild type enzyme. In the absence of a published crystal structure for WT GghA, a three-dimensional molecular model, based on sequence homology to Paenibacillus polymyxa (21Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was derived for both wild type (WT) and mutant GghA proteins. Our analysis of the parent and mutant apoenzymes was facilitated by the breadth of structural data available for family 1 glycosyl hydrolases (22Davies G. Henrissat B.

Comparing the enhanced GghA apoenzyme to known family 1 structures enabled us to suggest how its single amino acid substitution produces the observed functional improvement. pTNGghA1 Expression System—Isolation, purification, and kinetic characterization of WT T. neapolitana GghA from E. coli have been described previously (15Yernool D.A. McCarthy J.K. Eveleigh D.E. Bok J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTNGghA1, constructed from a pET-24d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), contains the gghA gene under the control of an inducible T7lac promoter and includes a His6 sequence tag at the C terminus of the gene. Plasmids were harvested with the QIAfilter plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA was run on the gel with 1 kb and supercoiled DNA ladders (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to provide concentration estimates. The WT library was grown from a single colony in 96-well microtiter plates with each well containing Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (200 μl) with kanamycin selection (30 μg/μl). Vector Preparation—A pET-24d vector was constructed with a 900-bp spacer sequence flanked with HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends inserted into the multiple cloning site of the vector. The construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells, plated on LB agar with 30 μg/ml kanamycin selection. A single colony from the plate, grown overnight (37 °C), was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB broth (as above) (500 ml flask, shaking, 37 °C). One ml of the overnight broth culture was removed for glycerol stocks; from the remainder, the pET-spacer plasmid was harvested using a QIAfilter plasmid purification kit. As needed, the pET-spacer plasmid was double digested with NheI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The linear vector DNA was gel purified, cleaned up with the GeneClean Spin kit Qbiogene (Bio 101 Systems, Carlsbad, CA) and concentrated by SpeedVac vacuum centrifugation (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). Random Mutagenesis—Primers, 5′-GAAGGAGATATACCATGGCTAGCGTGAAAAAG and 3′-GTGGTGCTCGAGTCCGTTGTTTTTG, were designed for error-prone PCR amplification (18Leung D.C. Goeddel D.V. Technique J.

Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) of the gghA gene (1335 bp) in pTNGghA1 to include regions of the vector upstream and downstream of the original NheI-XhoI gghA insertion. The increase in the gghA amplicon to 1378 bases allows for the random mutagenesis of the gghA open reading frame and for the re-ligation of the subsequent mutant amplicon library back into the same plasmid with the His6 sequence tag in-frame. A 500-μl error-prone PCR mixture of mutagenic buffer (7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.01% gelatin (w/v)), an asymmetrical mixture of dNTPs (0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 1.0 mm dCTP, and 1.0 mm dTTP), 250 pmol of each primer, 500 ng of pTNGghA1 template DNA, and a range of MnCl2 (0.075–0.15 mm final concentration) was aliquoted in 10 50-μl reactions. After denaturation for 3 min at 96 °C, all PCR mixtures were amplified for 20 cycles: 6 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 61 °C, and 1.45 min at 72 °C with 0.7 units/50 μl of reaction of recombinant Taq polymerase (31Desai U.J. Pfaffle P.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 780-782PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the appropriate mutation frequency, 3 parallel 500-μl reactions were set up with different MnCl2 concentrations, and amplified, producing 3 libraries of mutants. Ligation and Transformation—PCR products were cleaned up with the GeneClean spin kit, quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and double digested with NheI and XhoI. Amplicon digests were also cleaned up, then concentrated (as above). Variant library sequences were ligated into the linear vector (described above) using rapid DNA ligation (Roche Applied Science) and transformed, using standard protocols (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), into commercially available E. coli non-expression host strains with high transformation efficiencies. Each transformant library was plated out as follows: 75 μl in one plate and the remaining volume (∼225 μl) of the transformation reaction in a second plate. Transformed cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Transformation efficiencies were determined by comparing colony numbers on a 75-μl mutant library plate and on a 75-μl negative control plate (no insert). To harvest the library, 1.5 ml of LB was added to each mutant plate. Colonies were gently removed with a cell scraper, collected, and combined. Plasmid preparations were made from each mutant library. Ten nanograms of mutant library plasmid DNA was used to transform chemically competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. A portion (140 μl) of each BL21(DE3) transformation was plated out on 22-cm2 bioassay trays (Genetix, New Milton, UK) with the addition of 250 μl of SOC (rich broth medium) to aid in spreading. Clones were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Harvesting Mutant Clones—Microtiter plates were prepared with 200 μl of LB including kanamycin selection (30 μg/ml) per well. Transformants of the mutant libraries were picked from the bioassay trays using a Genetix Qpix robotic colony picker. The picking head inoculated 96 wells of a microtiter plate with 96 individual clones. Clones in 96-well plates were grown overnight at 28 °C, shaken on a Pulsating Vortexer (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN). In fresh 96-well plates, individual wells were inoculated with 2.5 μl from each unique well of the overnight culture. During transfer from overnight growth to expression plates, two wells on each new plate were left un-inoculated and were designated as reference wells. One of the reference wells was then inoculated with WT culture; the other was left un-inoculated as a blank. Microtiter cultures were allowed to grow (shaking, 37 °C) to an A of 0.9–1.0 at 595 nm. Absorbances, adjusted to a cell free reference well, were measured on a Sunrise Absorbance Reader (Tecan USA, Research Triangle Park, NC). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm/per well), followed by 4 additional hours of growth. Heat-labile host proteins were denatured by heating plates at 75 °C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, cells were lysed by the addition of lysozyme (with shaking, 20 min). Disintegrated cells from each unique well were transferred to a 96-well MultiScreen-BV 1.2-μm filter plate atop a vacuum manifold (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filtrates of heat-treated, partially purified protein were collected in fresh plates, by applying a vacuum (18 p.s.i.) sustained by a pump, and were stored at 4 °C until assayed. The protein concentrations of the filtrates were estimated by the Bradford dye binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Control experiments using gel loading dye indicated the revolutions/min at which there was no well to well contamination during shaking. Screening for Increased GghA Activity—Wild type and mutant clones were screened for activity in 96-well plates at 85 °C using a coupled enzyme assay derived from T. maritima (20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The coupled assay, linking the formation of NADPH (measured at 340 nm) to the hydrolysis of cellobiose by GghA or GghA mutants (20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was scaled down to a 200-μl reaction. Thermostable glucokinase (1 unit ml-1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.4 units ml-1) in triethanolamine (TEA) buffer (80 mm TEA, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8) were aliquoted into assay plate wells; the cell filtrate of individual clones (15 μl) was transferred column-wise to the assay plate bringing the volume in each well to 90 μl. Filtrate volume in the assay was arrived at empirically. Plates were then placed on a heatblock designed for microtiter plates and heated (85 °C, 3 min). Prior to use, cellobiose was dissolved in phosphate citrate buffer (pH 5.2) (for the 1-ml cuvette assay for WT and mutant GghA, the cellobiose was prepared in 50 mm NaAcO buffer, pH 5.2), and incubated with glucose oxidase. Because of the sensitivity of the coupled assay, all cellobiose had to be pretreated with glucose oxidase to remove glucose impurities (20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The pH of the cellobiose preparation was then adjusted with TEA base to pH 7.3. To start the reaction, 90 μl of pre-heated (85 °C) substrate/cofactor mixture (cellobiose, 20 mm; ATP, 3.5 mm; and NADP, 1 mm) in TEA buffer was added with a multichannel pipettor to the hot assay plate on the heatblock. To prevent condensation on the lid of the plate during preheating and the assay, a second heat block (85 °C) was inverted and placed on top of the assay plate lid. The reaction was stopped after 3 min by the addition of 25 μl of ice-cold stop buffer (50% assay buffer, 50% ethanol (95%)). In a control experiment, the stop buffer showed no distortion of absorbance at 340 nm. After the addition of the stop buffer, plates were allowed to cool (1 min). Changes in absorbance (A340) because of differential NADPH concentrations were measured against an enzyme-free reference well. To ensure that increases in activity were based on random mutagenesis effects, and not on media evaporation/condensation or well to well cross-talk, potential positive mutants were re-grown and re-screened in the range of column/row arrangements; un-inoculated columns separated the WT wells from potential positives. Re-screened positive mutants were streaked on LB kanamycin plates and single colonies were grown overnight (3 ml of LB, as above) for glycerol stocks and plasmid purification. Sequencing and Analysis—The nucleotide sequences of recombinant gghA and gghA mutants produced by random mutagenesis were determined using fluorescent dye terminator sequencing chemistry on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nucleotide sequence alignment and analysis was performed using Vector NTI 7.1 (Informax Inc., North Bethesda, MD). Primary structure comparisons were made using WU-BLAST (33Gish W. States D.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) and MView (34Brown N.P. Leroy C. Sander C. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Secondary structure estimations were provided by PredictProtein from the EMBL. 2www.emblheidelberg.de. Purification of Wild Type and Mutant Glucan Glucohydrolase—The growth, expression, and purification of recombinant, wild type GghA from Thermotoga sp. has been described previously (15Yernool D.A. McCarthy J.K. Eveleigh D.E. Bok J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal.

Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The same protocols were followed for GghA mutants. Briefly, a loopful of glycerol stock was inoculated into 3 ml of LB containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and grown to an A of 0.5 at 595 nm. The 3-ml culture was used to inoculate 500-ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and allowed to grow to an A of 0.9–1.0 (Fernbach flask, shaking, 37 °C); protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration), and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Whole cells were lysed with lysozyme (4 mg ml-1 of resuspension buffer) and shaken (room temperature, 15 min), cell lysates were heat treated (75 °C, 15 min) to denature heat-labile proteins, then sonicated on ice (4 bursts, 45 s). Supernatants were recovered after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), equilibrated with 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm imidazole, and loaded onto a Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted by a linear imidazole gradient (10–500 mm imidazole). Peak fractions were assayed for activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Blue. Concentrations of pure protein were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ GghA = 11.9 × 104 m-1 cm-1) (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Assays of purified, wild type and mutant GghA were performed at 85 °C, the temperature optimum was previously established for the wild type (15Yernool D.A. McCarthy J.K. Eveleigh D.E. Bok J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), using a Shimadzu UV-265 spectrophotometer. Assay temperature was maintained in the cuvette by a thermostatically controlled circulating water bath connected to the cuvette holder and monitored with a traceable temperature probe (VWR, West Chester, PA) placed in the cuvette. Cellobiose from 1.5 to 200 mm (pretreated as described above), 3.5 mm ATP, and 1 mm NADP in TEA assay buffer (as described above) were added to the cuvette and allowed to reach 85 °C (2 min). The purified enzymes, GghA (0.2 unit), glucokinase (1 unit ml-1), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.4 unit ml-1) were injected together into the cuvette and immediately mixed by pipetting. Rates, measured by continuous coupled enzyme assay monitoring formation of NADPH at 340 nm, were determined from the slope of the linear segment of the time course curve observed at the start of the reaction (5–15 s). For the substrate, cellobiose, 1 unit of GghA activity corresponds to 2 μmol of glucose produced per minute at 85 °C. All coupled assays were done in triplicate. Qualitative arylglycoside activity was evaluated in 96-well plate assays using pNPG at 5 mm final concentration in a 5-min assay at 85 °C (38Wood T.M. Bhat K.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 160: 87-112Crossref Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 100 mm phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 6.8) using 2.5 μl of cell filtrate. Kinetic Comparison of Wild Type and Mutant GghA—Kinetic parameters for wild type and mutant GghA were determined by measuring enzyme activity over a range of cellobiose concentrations (see above), using the coupled enzyme assay. Standard error was calculated and ranged from 2.5 to 9%. The Km and Vmax were derived using the non-linear regression program of SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL) based on the Michaelis-Menten model equation; the resulting curves represent best-fit values for the data. The proteins were assayed side by side under identical conditions. Molecular Modeling and Analysis—Structural models of WT and mutant GghA proteins were based on the sequence homology of the protein to the reported crystal structure of native β-glucosidase from Bacillus (now Paenibacillus) polymyxa from the Protein Data Bank. A protein-protein BLAST (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70731) Google Scholar) comparison showed 46% sequence identity between T. neapolitana GghA and the P. polymyxa enzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1BGA). Structural models were constructed using Modeler version 1.5 version 1 (40Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10562) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics model O2 computer running IRIX 6.4. The model structures were analyzed using Insight 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA); their stereochemical qualities were assessed using the Biotech Validation Suite for Protein Structures. 3http://biotech.ebi.ac.uk:8400. The application suite provides the following checks PROCHECK V3.5, PROVE V2.3 (41Pontius J. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and WHAT IF V4.99. Ramachandran plot data derived in PROCHECK (42Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) provided verification of the acceptability of the models. The physicochemical environment of both WT Ile-170 and mutant Thr-170 within the molecule with regard to the neighboring active site cleft was determined. Initially, both protein models were run with H-STRIP (software application authored by P. C. Kahn); solvent-accessible surface areas and volumes were then calculated by the method of Lee and Richards (43Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) using the programs ACCESS and VOLUME. Substrates, Enzymes and Cofactors—Cellobiose, NADP, ATP, pNPG, lysozyme, and glucose oxidase (Aspergillus niger) were obtained from Sigma. Glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from T. maritima were produced in our laboratory (20McCarthy J.K. O'Brien C.E. Eveleigh D.E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Directed Evolution: Mutagenesis and Screening—Prior to the first round of mutagenesis, a WT gghA library (Fig. 1A) was constructed in 96-well microtiter plates from E. coli BL21(DE3) glycerol stocks containing the pTNGghA1 plasmid. The library was used to establish standard conditions for culture growth, gghA expression, and screening in 96-well plates. In Fig. 1A, the shape of the graph is characteristic of WT profiles in other directed evolution experiments (44Arnold F.H. Moore J.C. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1997; 58: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). Cell filtrate preparations and assay conditions including: filtrate clarity/turbidity, well loading with electronic pipetting, maintenance of reagent, and enzyme temperatures during preheating and assaying, were standardized to be straightforward and reproducible. Three first generation gghA libraries were constructed to determine which mutagenic PCR conditions would produce the desired mutation frequency (number of base shifts per gene). For screening a small library (≤2000 clones), the desired mutation frequency for a gene the length of gghA (1335 bases) was 0.2–0.3%, i.e. 3–4 base shifts over the course of the sequence (45Moore J.C. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that mutation fr"

We investigated the role of the PEST-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 in the regulation of HER2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of RTKs. Here we demonstrate that HER2 signaling is highly sensitive to BDP1 activity. Overexpression of BDP1 inhibited ligand-induced activation of HER2 but not that of the closely related EGFR. On the other hand, suppression of endogenous BDP1 expression increased the phosphorylation state of HER2. In addition, BDP1 was able to interfere with downstream signaling events by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Gab1 and reducing mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Supported by the finding that BDP1 is coexpressed with HER2 in breast cancer cells, we suggest that BDP1 is an important regulator of HER2 activity and thus the first protein-tyrosine phosphatase shown to be involved in HER2 signal attenuation.

The common architecture of all EGFR family members comprises a ligand-binding extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of the receptors results from binding of a ligand of the EGF-like peptide growth factor family, which leads to the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

The subsequent activation of the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase triggers autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain. These phosphorylation sites then serve as a docking platform for adaptor molecules like Grb2, Shc, or Gab1 and form the starting point for a variety of signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival (2Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Within the EGFR family of RTKs, HER2 has an outstanding role since it does not bind any known growth factor with high affinity. Instead of being activated by direct ligand binding, HER2 seems to be the preferred heterodimerization partner for other EGFR family members that define ligand specificity (4Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression, HER2 also occurs as an active homodimer even in the absence of any ligand or heterodimerization partner. These constitutively active HER2 homodimers evade down-regulation mechanisms and cause transformation of immortalized cells (5Hudziak R.M. Lewis G.D. Winget M. Fendly B.M. Shepard H.M. Ullrich A.

New Biol. 1990; 2: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar). According to this oncogenic potential, deregulation of HER2 as well as other EGFR family members is a hallmark of a variety of human cancers (7Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example, amplification of the HER2 gene is found in 20–30% of early stage breast cancers and the consequential overexpression of the HER2 protein correlates with poor clinical prognosis and reduced survival of the patients (8Slamon D.J.

Based on the discovery of the importance of aberrant HER2 activity in breast cancer, the monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was developed representing the first genomics-based drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (5Hudziak R.M.

Med. 2001; 7: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The wide range of normal cellular functions governed by EGFR family members and the pathophysiological significance of unrestrained kinase activity underscore the requirement of a tight and finely tuned regulation of RTK signaling. Various mechanisms have been shown to act in concert in order to ensure an appropriate duration and magnitude of receptor signaling, which will ultimately determine cell fate. In the case of the EGFR, several ways of receptor down-regulation have been identified (12Fiorini M. Alimandi M. Fiorentino L. Sala G. Segatto O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These include ligand-induced endocytosis (13Wiley H.S. Burke P.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery (14de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), as well as transcriptional induction of inhibitory proteins that counteract downstream signaling (16Hackel P.O. Gishizky M.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5199-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that an important way of regulating receptor activity is the control of its phosphorylation state. Several protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) were shown to be able to counteract EGFR activity by abrogating receptor autophosphorylation and thereby blocking downstream signaling (19Ostman A. Bohmer F.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 20Tiganis T. IUBMB Life. 2002; 53: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For example, PTP1B was implicated in EGFR regulation in an overexpression study by Lammers et al. (21Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report (22Haj F.G. Markova B. Klaman L.D. Bohmer F.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 739-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) confirming these findings showed that in fibroblasts from PTP1B-deficient mice, the phosphorylation of the EGFR is increased and sustained after growth factor treatment. Another example for an EGFR-regulating PTP is the receptor-like phosphatase RPTPσ, which was reported to impair EGFR activation, substrate phosphorylation, and signaling (23Suarez Pestana E. Tenev T. Gross S. Stoyanov B. Ogata M. Bohmer F.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4069-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the biology and pathology of HER2 has been under extensive investigation since its discovery in 1984 (24Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H.

In our effort to identify new substrates of PTPs, we found that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 might be involved in the control of HER2 activity. BDP1 (also known as PTP20 (26Aoki N.

Leibman N. Lemischka I.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 4510-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) belongs to the family of PEST-containing PTPs, which also includes PTP-PEST and PEP (30Matthews R.J. Bowne D.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BDP1, PTP-PEST, and PEP share a common structure composed of a N-terminal catalytic domain and a non-catalytic C-terminal sequence that comprises the eponymous proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-enriched PEST sequences.

Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), BDP1 has already been implicated in the regulation of tyrosine kinases. Here we show that BDP1 is able to negatively affect HER2 activation as well as downstream signaling events. Furthermore, BDP1 is shown to be coexpressed with HER2 in breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results point toward BDP1 as an important negative regulator of HER2-mediated signaling and therefore support a role of this PTP as a tumor suppressor. Antibodies and Reagents—For generation of BDP1 antibody, cDNA encoding amino acids 295–436 of BDP1 were cloned into a pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize rabbits. A monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and the polyclonal anti-HER2-CT for Western blot analysis (34Lee J. Dull T.J. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The monoclonal HER2 blocking antibody 2C4 was described previously (35Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR was precipitated with monoclonal antibody anti-EGFR 108.1 (36Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D.

Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) have been described before. Anti-Gab1 (H-198) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-hemagglutinin (HA.11) was from Babco. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for ERK2 and JNK were from New England Biolabs. Phosphotyrosines were detected with the 4G10 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Bio-Rad; goat anti-mouse antibody was from Sigma, and rabbit anti-sheep was from Dianova. Chemiluminescence reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. EGF was supplied by Invitrogen and heregulin-β1 and IGF1 by Sigma. The nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schüll. All of the other reagents were obtained from Merck. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The expression construct for wild type BDP1 was described previously (32Kim Y.W. Wang H. Sures I. Lammers R. Martell K.J. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2275-2279PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytically impaired C/S mutant of BDP1 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis replacing cysteine 229 by serine and the substrate trapping D/A mutant by replacing aspartic acid 197 by alanine. N-terminally HA-tagged BDP1 and HE-PTP were generated by PCR. GST fusion constructs were obtained by cloning wild type BDP1, BDP1 C/S, and BDP1 D/A, respectively, into the pGEX5x vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the GST gene. All of the GST fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21 DE3 codon+ (Stratagene) and purified with GSH-Sepharose beads. To target BDP1 protein for down-regulation by siRNA, we generated the pSuperRetro-BDP1 (pSR-BDP1) construct according to supplier′s instructions (OligoEngine). The 19-nucleotide BDP1 target sequences was GAGGGACACAGCGACTACA. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cell lines were obtained from either the German or American Tissue Culture Collection DSMZ and ATCC, respectively, and cultivated following the supplier's instructions. The cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA/ml of medium by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (39Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were transferred to serum starvation medium and cultured for another 24 h before stimulation and lysis. Retroviral Infection—Amphotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transfection of phoenix packaging cells (kindly provided by G. Nolan, Stanford) by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (40Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, the tissue culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral supernatant was used for infection of T47D cells after addition of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were infected three times for at least 4 h and allowed to recover for 24 h with fresh medium. Cells were starved in serum-free medium 24 h before stimulation and lysis.

Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5% aprotinin). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The cell cultures were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerine, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5% aprotinin). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, whole cell lysates were combined with antibody and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The samples were incubated for 3 h on a rotation wheel at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerin, and 10 mm Na4P2O7), suspended in 3× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. If quantification was necessary, the filters were exposed to the LAS1000 chemiluminescence camera (Fujifilm) and analyzed with the program ImageGauge 3.3 (Fujifilm). In Vitro Binding Study—Prior to lysis, SkBr3 cells were treated with 50 mm pervanadate for 20 min. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine). Additionally, the lysis buffer also contained 5 mm iodoacetic acid to irreversibly inhibit cellular PTPs. After incubation on ice for 5 min, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to inactivate excess iodoacetic acid. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates were incubated with 100 ng of fusion protein of GST and wild type BDP1, the catalytically inactive C/S mutant, or the substrate-trapping D/A mutant. After addition of 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads, the lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Samples were dissolved in 3× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Expression Profile of BDP1, HER2, and EGFR in Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Mouse Mammary Tumors—To address the question whether BDP1 might be involved in the negative regulation of EGFR family kinase signaling, we examined 17 breast cancer cell lines and 1 normal breast epithelial cell line for BDP1 as well as HER2 and EGFR expression. To this end, crude cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Fig. 1A shows that all cell lines expressing HER2 also show expression of BDP1. In particular BT474 and SkBr3 breast cancer cells, which are known to overexpress HER2 due to gene amplification (46Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), also contain high amounts of the phosphatase. On the other hand, in most cell lines with low or even no detectable HER2 expression, BDP1 levels were also substantially lower. In contrast to HER2, the protein levels of the EGFR did not correlate well with the expression of BDP1. Next we compared the protein level of BDP1 in breast tumors from transgenic mice expressing HER2 or other oncogenes under the control of gene promoters, which restrict oncogene expression to the mammary alveolar epithelium (41Muller W.J. Sinn E. Pattengale P.K. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 42Humphreys R.C. Hennighausen L.

Although BDP1 was readily detected in all samples tested, its expression was maximal in the HER2-overexpressing tumor (Fig. 1B). BDP1 Overexpression Reduces HER2 Phosphorylation in HEK 293 Cells—To investigate whether BDP1 would be able to interfere with HER2-mediated signaling, we examined the impact of BDP1 overexpression on the phosphorylation of the endogenous HER2 receptor in HEK 293 cells. In control cells transfected with empty vector, tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 was rapidly induced by stimulation with EGF, reaching its maximum within 1 min (Fig. 2, A and B). In cells overexpressing BDP1, activation of HER2 was strongly reduced and also slightly retarded. The effect of BDP1 on HER2 phosphorylation was dependent on its enzymatic phosphatase activity, because exogenous expression of a catalytically inactive C/S mutant did not counteract the phosphorylation of HER2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, a slight increase in HER2 phosphorylation could be observed. Positive effects of C/S mutants of phosphatases have been reported before (33Cong F. Spencer S. Cote J.F. Wu Y. Tremblay M.L. Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and likely reflect a competition with endogenous phosphatases resulting in “dominantpositive” effects. Whereas activation of HER2 by EGF stimulation is triggered by heterodimer formation of HER2 with the EGFR, we next used heregulin-β1 to induce and activate HER2-HER3 dimers. As demonstrated in Fig. 2D, exogenous expression of the phosphatase diminished HER2 activation after heregulin-β1 stimulation as well. This indicated that the ability of BDP1 to impair HER2 phosphorylation is independent of the HER2 binding partner in the dimeric receptor complex. The potential of exogenous BDP1 to diminish the phosphorylation of HER2 raised the question as to whether HER2 and BDP1 would directly interact. To address this point, we performed an in vitro binding study using purified fusion proteins of GST and either the wild type form, the catalytically inactive C/S mutant, or the substrate-trapping D/A mutant form of BDP1. HER2-overexpressing SkBr3 breast cancer cells were treated with the unspecific phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate to induce maximal cellular phosphorylation and subsequently lysed. As Fig. 2E shows, the substrate-trapping mutant of BDP1 precipitated a single tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which could be identified as HER2 by immunoblotting. Negative Regulatory Effect of BDP1 Is Specific for HER2 in HEK 293 Cells—Because HER2 belongs to the family of EGFR-related receptors, we investigated whether BDP1 expression generally counteracts the signaling of RTKs of the EGFR family or if this effect is specific for the HER2 receptor. For this reason, the activation level of the EGFR was analyzed in HEK 293 cells transfected with BDP1 constructs. In contrast to the strong reduction of HER2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2), EGF-mediated EGFR activation was only marginally affected by overexpression of wild type BDP1 or the inactive C/S mutant (Fig. 3A). Likewise, phosphorylation of the unrelated RTK insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) upon stimulation with its ligand IGF1 was not affected by the presence of exogenous BDP1 (Fig. 3B). The specificity of BDP1 for HER2 was further exemplified by the observation that overexpression of the unrelated cytoplasmic phosphatase HePTP did not influence EGF-induced HER2 activation at all (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of BDP1 Interferes with EGF-mediated Signaling Events—Activated RTKs recruit and phosphorylate a set of adaptor proteins, thereby initiating signaling cascades leading to specific cellular responses (47Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar). To test whether BDP1 would be able to affect downstream events of HER2, we analyzed the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Shc and Gab1 adaptor proteins in the presence and absence of exogenous BDP1 in HEK 293 cells. Whereas neither the 46- nor the 52-kDa isoform of Shc was affected by overexpression of BDP1 (Fig. 4A), phosphorylation of Gab1 was almost completely abolished (Fig. 4B). A longer exposure of the same immunoblot further showed that the C/S mutant form of BDP1 had the potential to enhance the phosphorylation of Gab1 in unstimulated cells (data not shown). Recently, Gab1 has been implicated in EGF-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (48Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if the activation of ERK2 and JNK1, two members of the MAPK family, would be perturbed in cells overexpressing BDP1. MAPK activity was assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies that specifically recognize the activated form of the respective MAPK. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, EGF stimulation of cells resulted in a strong increase of ERK2 activity and a less pronounced JNK1 activation, respectively. Activation of both kinases was reduced to 50% in cells expressing wild type BDP1. The catalytically impaired C/S mutant of the phosphatase did not affect the activation of either MAPK. To test whether the lack of Gab1 and MAPK phosphorylation in BDP1-overexpressing cells treated with EGF reflects an event downstream of HER2 as opposed to the EGFR, we inhibited HER2 activation by an alternative mechanism. Prior stimulation, cells were preincubated with the monoclonal HER2-specific blocking antibody 2C4 (35Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar, 49Agus D.B. Akita R.W. Fox W.D. Lewis G.D. Higgins B. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Tindell C. Evans D.P. Maiese K. Scher H.I. Sliwkowski M.X. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4E, pretreatment of HEK 293 cells with 2C4 strongly reduced EGF-induced phosphorylation of HER2 and Gab1, whereas Shc phosphorylation was not affected. Similar to exogenous expression of BDP1, inhibition of HER2 by the blocking antibody resulted in an decrease of EGF-induced ERK1/2 activity. Taken together, these results show that BDP1 is not only able to decrease phosphorylation of HER2 but also its downstream signaling events. Down-regulation of Endogenous BDP1 by siRNA Enhances Her2 Phosphorylation in T47D Breast Cancer Cells—By having established that increased BDP1 activity, in terms of overexpression, results in a reduction of HER2 signaling, we used an RNA interference approach to conduct the converse experiment. The level of endogenous BDP1 in T47D breast cancer cells was reduced by infection with a retroviral expression construct for a BDP1-specific small interfering RNA (Fig. 5). The cells were then stimulated with heregulin-β1, and the level of HER2 activation was examined. In accordance with the experiments using the overexpressed phosphatase (Fig. 2), a decrease of the endogenous BDP1 protein level reproducibly leads to an apparent increase of HER2 phosphorylation, which further supports the proposed role of BDP1 in the regulation of HER2-mediated signaling. Signaling through RTKs is a major mechanism for intercellular communication during development and in the adult organism as well as in disease-associated processes (47Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status and signaling activity of RTKs is determined not only by the kinase activity of the RTK but equally by the activities of negatively regulating PTPs. Since their discovery in 1988 (50Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

Despite extensive investigations, only little evidence has emerged that supports that hypothesis. A recent publication by Jandt et al. (52Jandt E. Denner K. Kovalenko M. Ostman A. Bohmer F.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4175-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), for example, relates the ability of DEP-1 to modulate growth factor-stimulated cell migration and cell-matrix adhesion to the function of DEP-1 as a tumor suppressor. To date, several phosphatases have been implicated in the negative regulation of EGFR activity and its downstream signaling. Among these are the receptor phosphatases RPTPσ and LAR (23Suarez Pestana E. Tenev T. Gross S. Stoyanov B. Ogata M. Bohmer F.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4069-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 53Kulas D.T. Goldstein B.J. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 748-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as well as the cytoplasmic phosphatases SHP-1, PTP1B, and TCPTP (54Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 55Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no phosphatase responsible for the inactivation of HER2 had been identified so far. Here we report that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase BDP-1 is able to regulate HER2 signaling. The phosphorylation and signaling potential of HER2 was highly sensitive to the catalytic activity of BDP1. Enhancing BDP1 activity in terms of overexpression potently diminished inducible HER2 activity. On the other hand, reducing the level of BDP1 in T47D breast cancer cells with siRNAs resulted in increased HER2 phosphorylation. These observations suggest that BDP1 is responsible for the attenuation of ligand-induced HER2 signal. In vivo, however, the regulation of HER2 can be expected to be much more complex as is the case for its closest homologue the EGFR. It is thus conceivable that rather than BDP1 alone numerous phosphatases act in concert in order to provide a tight and finely tuned regulation of the HER2 signal. PTPs are highly specific enzymes dephosphorylating very selective phosphotyrosine proteins (57Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The specificity of BDP1 for HER2 is exemplified by its inability to counteract neither EGFR nor IGFR phosphorylation. Nevertheless, a minor decrease in EGFR phosphorylation was occasionally observed in the presence of exogenous BDP1. This might reflect the indirect influence of BDP1 on the particular fraction of EGFRs that is engaged in HER2-EGFR heterodimers and is thus transphosphorylated to a lesser extent by the inhibited binding partner. A consequence of impaired RTK activation is the failure to induce the early events of downstream signaling cascades, namely recruitment and phosphorylation of signaling molecules (58Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Shc has been shown to bind to and to be phosphorylated by activated HER2 (59Segatto O. Pelicci G. Giuli S. Digiesi G. Di Fiore P.P. McGlade J. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2105-2112PubMed Google Scholar) and to play a role in HER2-mediated tumorigenesis (60Dankort D. Jeyabalan N. Jones N. Dumont D.J. Muller W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38921-38928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells, overexpression of BDP1 did not affect Shc phosphorylation after EGF stimulation. This observation suggests that in this system, EGF-induced Shc phosphorylation does predominantly occur downstream of the EGFR, which was not influenced by exogenously expressed BDP1. In contrast to Shc, phosphorylation of Gab1 was severely reduced by inhibition of HER2 activation by overexpression of BDP1 or by treatment of cells with the specific blocking antibody 2C4. Although direct binding of Gab1 to and phosphorylation by HER2 has not been shown so far, recent reports described the identification of Gab1 as a downstream effector of HER2 (61Settle M. Gordon M.D. Nadella M. Dankort D. Muller W. Jacobs J.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and provided evidence for the requirement of Gab1 for HER2-driven transformation (62Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that upon stimulation of HEK 293 cells with EGF, Gab1 is mainly activated downstream of HER2-containing heterodimers, whose inhibition is reflected in impaired Gab1 phosphorylation. After dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation, RTKs like HER2 and the EGFR induce the activation of MAPKs, which transduce the signal to the nucleus and there regulate the expression of effector genes (63Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). The best known pathway leading to the activation of MAPKs involves the Shc adaptor protein, recruitment of the Grb2/Sos complex, and activation of the small GTPase Ras (10Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition to this Shc-involving pathway, Gab1 was identified as another signal transducer linking RTKs to MAPK activation (48Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 62Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have shown that BDP1 was able to reduce the activation of two MAPKs, ERK2 and JNK, by about 50%. Having demonstrated before that BDP1 blocks Gab1 but not Shc phosphorylation, this partial reduction of MAPK activity presumably reflects the loss of signal transduction through Gab1 leaving only the Shc-dependent pathway intact. We could show that BDP1 down-regulates the phosphorylation of HER2 protein itself as well as downstream signaling events, but how this is accomplished by BDP1 remains elusive. In light of the fact that BDP1 was able to bind to HER2, the most obvious explanation would be that BDP1 could be recruited to activated receptor complexes and that phosphorylated HER2 would be a direct substrate for BDP1. Although the demonstrated reduction of Gab1 phosphorylation is most likely a consequence of HER2 being dephosphorylated and inactivated, we cannot exclude the possibility that Gab1 itself might serve as a substrate for BDP1 as well. Interestingly, Gab1 mediates a positive feedback loop that was shown to enhance the initial signal from activated EGFR (48Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). If Gab1 possesses a similar function in HER2 signaling, BDP1 might be able to regulate or even to abrogate such a positive feedback loop by controlling the phosphorylation state of Gab1. The question whether BDP1 would be able to influence the tumorigenic potential of HER2 in vivo remains to be addressed by ongoing research. We thank Dr. Lothar Hennighausen for helpful discussions and for providing the mouse tumor samples. We also thank Dr. Yeon Woong Kim for providing BDP1 expression constructs."

Asparagine substitution (D345N) resulted in near normal transporter expression on the cell surface but caused extremely low Vmax and Km values for DA uptake, converted the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on DA uptake to a stimulatory one, and eliminated reverse transport. The cocaine-like inhibitor 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane or the selective DA transporter inhibitor GBR12935 bound to D345N with a normal affinity and still inhibited DA uptake potently. However, the mutation reduced the binding capacity of the surface transporter for these two inhibitors by 90% or more. Moreover, the binding activity of D345N can be significantly improved by Zn2+ but not by Na+. These results are consistent with a defect in reorientation of the substrate-binding site to the extracellular side, leading to a loss of the outward-facing conformational state where external DA binds to initiate uptake and the inhibitors bind to initiate uptake inhibition. Alanine or glutamate substitution produced a similar phenotype, suggesting that both the negative charge and the residue volume at position 345 are vital. Furthermore, in intact cells, cocaine potentiated the reaction of the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium with the extracellularly located endogenous cysteines of D345N but not those of wild type, and this potentiation was blocked upon K+ substitution for Na+. Thus, cocaine binding to D345N likely induces a different and Na+-dependent conformational change, which may contribute to its Na+-dependent uptake inhibitory activity.

Vaughan R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. Pickel V.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 436-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the DA concentration in the extracellular space by DAT-mediated uptake and release of DA is an important component of dopaminergic transmission (2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 3Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar, 4Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interaction with the DAT has been suggested to be one of the major action mechanisms for psycho-stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine, neurotoxins, and to a lesser degree, antidepressants and ethanol (for a recent review, see Ref. 5Chen N. Reith M.E.A. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The transporter has been characterized in vitro for its pharmacological selectivity. Many of the substrates for DAT are phenethylamine derivatives with minor differences in substitutions for the hydrogen atom in the backbone of phenethylamine (6Ross S.B. Paton D.M. The Mechanism of Neuronal and Extraneuronal Transport of Catecholamines. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1976: 49-66Google Scholar, 7Chen N. Justice Jr., J.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Compounds capable of binding at the DAT and of inhibiting DA uptake display remarkable variations in structures (8Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Mascarella S.W. Reith M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporter: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 381-432Google Scholar), in which cocaine analogs, benztropine, mazindol, and methylphenidate also inhibit other monoamine transporters, whereas GBR analogs mainly inhibit DAT (9Tatsumi M. Groshan K. Blakely R.D. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 10Eshleman A.J. Carmolli M. Cumbay M. Martens C.R. Neve K.A. Janowsky A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 877-885PubMed Google Scholar).The DAT belongs to a large family of Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters, along with transporters for norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid (2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Like other members of this family, hydrophobicity analysis of the DAT protein predicted the presence of 12 transmembrane segments connected by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops with the N and C termini in the cytosol (11Kilty J.E. Lorang D. Amara S.G. Science. 1991; 254: 578-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12Shimada S. Kitayama S. Lin C.-L. Patel A. Nanthakumar E. Gregor P. Kuhar M. Uhl G.

Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently explored the role of tryptophan and acidic residues that are conserved in all members of the Na+/Cl--dependent transporter family in the function of the human DAT by site-directed mutagenesis (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Strikingly, replacement of Asp-345 with asparagine (D345N) in the third intracellular loop allowed considerable [3H]DA uptake but caused undetectable binding of a cocaine analog, [3H]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane ([3H]CFT). Furthermore, the mutated protein, although appreciably expressed on the cell surface, could not be photoaffinity-labeled with the cocaine analog 125I-labeled 3β-(p-chlorophenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid. However, at D345N, cocaine analogs remained potent inhibitors of [3H]DA uptake, albeit with an altered kinetic inhibition profile (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consequently, we speculated that mutation of Asp-345 converts the DAT to a partially active state, which alters the interactions of cocaine analogs with the transporter. In addition to Asp-345, the third intracellular loop contains other residues involved in conformational changes. Tyr-335 is suggested to play a role in regulating the distribution between different conformational states during the transport cycle (15Loland C.J. Nørregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); Cys-342 displays transport-dependent reactivity with sulfhydryl reagents (16Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The polar sequence at the junction of transmembrane segment 7 and intracellular loop 3 of the DAT (positions 342–345), CYRD, is completely conserved in the mammalian catecholamine transporters (17Chen N. Reith M.E.A. Reith M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporter: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 53-110Google Scholar) and highly conserved in other members of the family of Na+/Cl--dependent transporters (18Deken S.L. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Quick M.W. Reith M.E.A Neurotransmitter Transporter: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 193-234Google Scholar), implying functional importance. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the third intracellular loop plays an important role in conformational transitions of DAT.The present study further elucidates the role of Asp-345 in the function of the DAT. A series of conservative and nonconservative substitutions at each residue of the YRD motif was performed to address whether the effect of D345N is due to introduction of the substitute amino acid, loss of the aspartate, or disruption of its interaction with the neighboring residues. The pharmacological selectivity of Asp-345 mutants was examined using phenethylamine substrates with widely varying affinities as well as various inhibitors with structural diversity. The conformational status of Asp-345 mutants was investigated by assessing the characteristics of inward and outward transport, the effect of Zn2+, and the reactivity of endogenous cysteines with the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The pCIN4 vector and the pCIN4-synthetic human DAT construct (pCIN4-DAT) were generous gifts from Dr. Jonathan A. Javitch of Columbia University. [3H]CFT (84.5 Ci/mmol), [3H](1-(2-[diphenylmethoxy]ethy)-4-[3-phenylpropyl]piperazine ([3H]GBR 12935; 47.5 Ci/mmol), and [3H]DA (60 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([3H]CIT; 64.7 Ci/mmol) was from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, UK). Unlabeled CFT was from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Cocaine, GBR12935, benztropine, methylphenidate, DA, m-tyramine, β-phenethylamine, d-amphetamine, norepinephrine, trans-(E)-flupentixol dihydrochloride, and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine were from Sigma. MTSET was from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, NeutrAvidin Plus, mammalian protein extraction reagents, protein inhibitor mixture, and goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were from Pierce. Rabbit anti-human DAT polyclonal antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). ChemGlow chemiluminescence substrate solution was from Alpha Innotech (San Leandro, CA). Other chemicals and molecular biology reagents were provided by commercial sources.Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Wild-type and Mutant DATs—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type pCIN4-DAT construct as described previously (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mutated regions were excised by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned individually or together (double mutant) back into the original pCIN4-DAT construct. All mutations were screened by restriction mapping, and confirmed in both directions by dye terminator cycle sequencing the subcloning region (Research Resource Center, University of Illinois). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293, ATCC CRL 1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For stable transfection, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to grow to 60% confluence. Then each well of cells was transfected with 4 μg of the pCIN4-DAT construct or pCIN4 vector using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of serum-free growth medium. Stable pools of HEK-293 cells expressing DATs were selected with geneticin as described previously (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0) and incubated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (1 mg/1 ml) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 10 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min. Biotinylated cells were washed with PBS and lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagents supplemented with protein inhibitor mixture for 5 min with gentle shaking. The lysate samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The cleared cell lysates were incubated with NeutrAvidin Plus (100 μl of 50% resins per 100 μg of protein) with end-to-end mixing for 1 h. The resins were extensively washed with PBS, and the biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The bean eluates (from 74 μg of total cell lysates) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The separate proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. DAT proteins were detected using the rabbit anti-human DAT polyclonal antibody at 0.5 μg/ml followed by the secondary goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at 0.04 μg/ml. The transporter signal was visualized by using ChemGlow chemiluminescence substrate solution. The images were captured using FluorChem 8800 Image System (Alpha Innotech).[3H]DA Uptake—Cell suspensions were prepared as described previously (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 10 nm [3H]DA for 5 min at 25 °C in 200 μl of uptake buffer (in mm: 10 HEPES, ∼5 Tris base, 130 NaCl unless otherwise stated, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 0.1 tropolone, and 1 ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). In studies determining the Na+ dependence, the Na+ concentration in assay was varied by isotonically replacing NaCl with N-methyl-d-glucamine-chloride (NMDG-Cl). For saturation or competition analysis, appropriate concentrations of nonradioactive compounds were included in the assay. DAT inhibitors were added 5 min earlier than [3H]DA, and DAT substrates were added simultaneously with [3H]DA. The uptake reaction was terminated by filtration followed by 5 washes with ice-cold saline on 0.1% polythyleneimine pre-soaked Wallac B filtermats (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) with a 96-well Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). The radioactivity was counted in a 1405 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (Wallac) after adding 10 ml of Betaplate Scint to each filter mat. Cells transfected with vector alone were tested in parallel and used to define nonspecific uptake. The half-saturation concentration (Km) and the maximal transport velocity (Vmax) for DA uptake were estimated by nonlinear regression fitting of data using LIGAND software (KELL program, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The halfinhibition concentration (IC50) for a compound to inhibit DA uptakes was estimated by logistic fitting of data using ORIGIN software (OriginLab Co., Northampton, MA). IC50 values for various DAT ligands were converted to Ki values with the Cheng-Prusoff equation.[3H]CFT Binding to Cells—Cells were incubated with 4 nm [3H]CFT for 20 min at 25 °C in 200 μl of uptake buffer containing the indicated concentrations of Na+. For saturation analysis, increasing concentrations of nonradioactive CFT (1–300 nm) were included in the assay. The other procedures were the same as described for uptake assays, except that the binding reactions were terminated and washed on the harvester under higher pressure. Cells transfected with vector alone were tested in parallel and used to define nonspecific binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) were estimated by nonlinear regression fitting of data using LIGAND software.Radioligand Binding to Membranes—Cells were lysed, and cell membranes were prepared as described previously (19Chen N. Sun L. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 25 °C. For binding of cocaine analogs, membranes were incubated with 4 nm [3H]CFT for 20 min in 200 μl of HEPES-Tris buffer (10 mm, adjusted to pH 7.4 with ∼5 mm Tris) containing 130 mm NaCl, or with 0.5 nm [3H]CIT for 1 h in 600 μl of HEPES-Tris-NaCl buffer. For binding of GBR12935, membranes were incubated with either 0.5 nm or increasing concentrations (0.26–15 nm, for saturation analysis) of [3H]GBR12935 for 1 h in 600 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (5 mm, pH 7.4) containing 130 mm NaCl, 0.01% BSA, and 750 nm trans-(E)-flupentixol (to block binding to cytochrome P-450IID) (20Richfield E.K. Brain Res. 1991; 540: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For studies involving Na+ dependence, the NaCl concentration was varied in the corresponding buffer. Membranes prepared from the mock-transfected cells were tested in parallel and used to define nonspecific binding. The other procedures were the same as for cell binding assays.Measurement of Transport by Rotating Disk Electrode Voltammetry—All experiments were done at 37 °C. The DAT-expressing cells were suspended in 300 μl of uptake buffer (without tropolone and ascorbic acid). Transport assays (DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux) with rotating disk electrode voltammetry (RDEV) were performed as described previously (7Chen N. Justice Jr., J.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, after cell suspensions were placed into the electrochemical cell, a Teflon-shielded glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (1.3 mm diameter, Pine Instrument Co., Grove City, PA) was introduced just below the surface of the solution and rotated with an AFMSRX Analytical Rotator System (Pine Instrument Co.) at 4000 rpm. A potential of 350 mV relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was applied to the working electrode with a Petit Ampere LC-3D potentiostat (Bioanalytical System, Inc., West Lafayette, IN), and the output of the signal was amplified. Voltammetric signals were acquired at a frequency of 4 Hz on a computer through a PCI-MIO-16XE-50 DAQ interface board controlled by the custom programmed LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The acquired data were imported into Origin software (OriginLab Co., Northampton, MA) for further analysis. Initial transport rates were obtained from linear regression analysis of the change in medium DA concentration versus time over the first 5–10 s (DA uptake) or the first 30 s (DA efflux) after an addition of a substrate. For saturation analysis of DA uptake, increasing concentrations of DA (0.25–8 μm) were added to cell suspensions. Zn2+ was added 1 min before the addition of dopamine unless otherwise stated. After each experiment involving Zn2+, the electrochemical cell was rinsed first with 10 μmN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (a Zn2+ chelator) to remove residual Zn2+ and then with the uptake buffer.MTSET Application—MTSET were dissolved in water as a 50-fold concentrated stock and placed on ice prior to use. Intact cells were suspended in KRH or the Na+-free and K+-substituted KRH at ∼1 mg of cell protein/ml and preincubated with 100 μm DA or 10 μm cocaine or vehicle for 2 min at 25 °C. Afterward, MTSET (at a final concentration of 3 mm) or vehicle was added, and the incubation was continued for another 10 min. Reactions were terminated by a 10-fold dilution with the corresponding KRH, and all reagents were removed by centrifugation. The MTSET-treated cells were then washed twice with KRH (10 min each) and used for [3H]CFT binding and [3H]DA uptake assays. The effect of the MTSET is expressed as percentage of control. The control group was water for MTSET alone, and DA or cocaine alone for MTSET plus DA or cocaine.RESULTSSurface Expression of Mutated Transporters—To test whether the conserved YRD motif plays a role in transport activity, we introduced several mutations at each of these positions. The neighboring conserved residue, Cys-342, has been found to be important for DAT function (16Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For comparison purpose, Cys-342 was also mutated to alanine (C342A). All constructs including the previously generated D345N were transfected using twice the DNA amount reported previously (14Chen N. Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1116-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to avoid low surface expression. Cell surface biotinylation followed by Western blot was performed to determine whether the mutants are properly expressed at the cell surface. In biotinylated samples of both WT and the mutants, the antibody against the C terminus of the human DAT primarily labeled a diffuse protein band at 75 kDa (Fig. 1). All mutants appeared to be efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane with a level equivalent to or slightly lower than the wild-type (WT) DAT (Fig. 1). No band was detected in the cell line expressing the pCIN4 vector alone (data not shown). The efficiency for separation of surface proteins from intracellular proteins was verified by the lack of immunoreactivity in biotinylated samples after re-probing the same blot with the antibody against the intracellular protein calnexin (data not shown).Mutation of Asp-345 or the Neighboring Residues Alters Kinetic Characteristics of DA Uptake—The uptake of 10 nm [3H]DA was initially examined in each of the mutants (Fig. 2A). As can be seen, replacement of each residue caused a reduction in [3H]DA uptake. At positions 343, nonconservative substitution of the polar tyrosine with the smaller size alanine (Y343A) or the hydrophobic leucine (Y343L) decreased the transport activity by ∼50%, and conservative substitution with phenylalanine (Y343F) did also. At position 344, replacement of the positively charged arginine by the neutral alanine (R344A) or by the positively charged lysine (R344K) reduced the transport activity to a similar degree, whereas replacement by glutamine (R344Q), an amino acid containing an uncharged polar side chain, affected DA uptake more. A pronounced drop in DA uptake was observed upon mutation at position 345. Removal of the negatively charged aspartate at position 345 with alanine substitution (D345A) reduced DA uptake by 70%. Neutral conservative substitution with asparagine (D345N), which retains both the residue size and carbonyl oxygen, did not significantly attenuate the uptake reduction. The replacement of Asp-345 with glutamate (D345E), which retains the carboxylate functional group but as part of a bulkier side chain, also did not restore transporter activity. Introduction of the R344A mutation into D345A (R344A/D345A) did not show any additional effect on the DA uptake (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Uptake and binding activities upon conservative and nonconservative substitutions at positions 342–345.A, [3H]DA uptake (10 nm); B, [3H]CFT binding to intact cells (4 nm). Shown are means ± S.E. of 4–8 experiments performed in triplicate. Uptake and binding activities in all mutants are significantly different from that in WT (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Saturation analysis of the DA uptake revealed a decline in the Km value upon alanine substitution between positions 342 and 345, which was moderate at R344A but progressively decreased from C342A to Y343A to D345A (Fig. 3). With a similar pattern, the Vmax also declined progressively from C342A to Y343A to D345A (Fig. 3). In general, these mutants were similarly expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 1), and the decline in Vmax appears to be primarily due to a reduction in transport activity. The close correlation between Km and Vmax among all the alanine-substituted mutants (Fig. 3) indicates that mutations at these positions may alter the two parameters primarily via a single mechanism. D345E and D345N mutation reduced the Km and Vmax values to a level similar to that caused by D345A mutation (Fig. 3). Again, introduction of the R344A mutation into D345A had little impact (Fig. 3). To gain further insights into the effect of the mutations at position 345 on interactions with substrates, we measured the Ki for various substrates in competing for [3H]DA uptake. The Ki value for a substrate determined from inhibition of transport is thought to reflect the Km value for the substrate to transport (21Bönisch H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Like DA, the DAT substrates m-tyramine, β-phenethylamine, and amphetamine displayed a considerably small Ki value for the mutants (8–20-fold lower than WT, Table I). A 10–20-fold reduction in Ki was also observed with norepinephrine, a selective substrate for the norepinephrine but a poor one for the DAT (Table I). These effects were generally independent of the properties of the substituted amino acid at position 345 (Table I).Fig. 3Kinetic characteristics of DA uptake upon mutation at positions 342–345. There is a correlation between values for Km and Vmax in mutants with alanine substituted at positions 342–345. The straight line is a linear regression fit to the data points for alanine-substituted mutants. Shown are means ± S.E. of 3–8 experiments performed in triplicate. The horizontal error bar represents S.E. for Vmax, and the vertical error bar represents S.E. for Km. Except for R344A, the Km and Vmax values for the mutants are significantly smaller than WT (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPotency for inhibitors and substrates in inhibiting [3H]DA uptake upon mutation of Asp-345 Shown are means ± S.E. for 3–8 experiments.WTD345AD345ED345NR344A/D345AInhibitors, nm CFT38 ± 5123 ± 15ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)73 ± 7ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)52 ± 583 ± 14ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test) Cocaine247 ± 23594 ± 45ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)851 ± 110ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)557 ± 83ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)345 ± 21 GBR12935229 ± 28200 ± 30196 ± 38216 ± 32209 ± 39 Benztropine287 ± 34528 ± 124493 ± 54340 ± 44411 ± 34 Methylphenidate41 ± 3110 ± 15ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)132 ± 11ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)76 ± 992 ± 13ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)Substrates, nm Dopamine (Km)622 ± 6242 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)28.3 ± 2.3ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)63 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)34 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test) m-Tyramine450 ± 7733 ± 4ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)42 ± 7ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)66 ± 17ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)40 ± 1ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test) β-Phenethylamine1466 ± 23450 ± 9ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)84 ± 8ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)100 ± 16ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)58 ± 18ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test) d-Amphetamine132 ± 2611.8 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)14.0 ± 2.6ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)17 ± 3ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)15 ± 3ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)Norepinephrine6380 ± 1095311 ± 62ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)532 ± 103ap < 0.05 versus wild type (Dunnett's test)751 ± 163ap < 0"
https://openalex.org/W2014758962,"The structure of mitotic chromosomes is still poorly understood. Here we describe the use of a novel approach based on elasticity measurements of a single chromosome for studying the organization of these objects. The data reveal that mitotic chromosomes exhibit a non-homogenous structure consisting of rigid elastic axes surrounded by a soft chromatin envelope. The chemical continuity of DNA, but not RNA, was required for the maintenance of these axes. The axes show a modular structure, and the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins participate in their organization. Topoisomerase II was not involved in either the organization of the axes or the maintenance of the mitotic chromosomes. A model for the assembly and the structure of the mitotic chromosome is proposed. According this model, the chromosome axes are dynamic structures that assemble at the onset and disassemble the end of mitosis, respectively. The SMC proteins, in addition to maintaining axis elasticity, are essential for the determination of the rod-like chromosome shape. The extreme compaction of mitotic chromosomes is determined mainly by the high amount of bivalent ions bound to DNA at mitosis. The structure of mitotic chromosomes is still poorly understood.

The SMC proteins, in addition to maintaining axis elasticity, are essential for the determination of the rod-like chromosome shape. The extreme compaction of mitotic chromosomes is determined mainly by the high amount of bivalent ions bound to DNA at mitosis. DNA is highly compacted ∼ 10,000–20,000 times in the mitotic chromosomes of a typical vertebrate cell. It is far from clear how this folding is accomplished. The 30-nm chromatin fiber accounts only for 40:1 of the compaction ratio, and the remaining ∼ 500-fold compaction is achieved through a largely unknown mechanism (1Woodcock C.L. Dimitrov S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Nasmyth K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The complexity of the mitotic chromosome structure has both fascinated and frustrated scientists for many decades. Structural analysis of mitotic chromosomes has been very difficult because of the extreme compaction of the chromatin fibers. A number of models for the chromosome structure have been proposed, ranging from a hierarchical folding of chromatin (3Manueledis L. Science. 1990; 250: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) to spaghetti-like disorder (4DuPraw E.J. Nature. 1966; 209: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The favored textbook model describes the structure of the mitotic chromosome as an assembly of chromatin loop domains attached to a central protein scaffold (5Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). This scaffold showed the same shape as the mitotic chromosomes, and this shape was preserved even upon removal of >95% of the chromosomal proteins and 99% of the DNA and RNA (5Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 6Adolph K.W. Cheng S.M.

About 70% of the total amount of topoisomerase II was found in the mitotic chromosome scaffold fraction (7Earnshaw W.C. Halligan B. Cooke C.A. Heck M.M.S. Liu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that this enzyme might occupy discrete foci that could correspond to the base of the chromatin loop domains (7Earnshaw W.C. Halligan B. Cooke C.A. Heck M.M.S. Liu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 8Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 613-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It was proposed that topoisomerase II, in addition to its important enzymatic function in chromosome assembly, was a part of the structural framework of the mitotic chromosome (7Earnshaw W.C. Halligan B. Cooke C.A. Heck M.M.S. Liu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 8Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 613-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar).The SMC proteins exist in the cell as high molecular mass complexes, one class of which is termed condensins (9Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The biochemical manipulations of extracts isolated from Xenopus eggs have identified two forms of condensins, 8 S and 13 S. The active form of condensin, 13 S condensin, consists of two SMC subunits (XCAP-C and -E) and three non-SMC subunits (XCAP-D2, -G, and -H). Depletion and rescue experiments in Xenopus egg extracts have demonstrated that 13 S condensin is required for both assembly and maintenance of mitotic chromosomes (9Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).The models reported in the literature are derived mainly from experiments using microscopy techniques. Recently, a novel and complementary approach via monitoring the changes in the elastic response was applied to study the organization of mitotic chromosomes (10Houchmandzadeh B. Marko J.F. Chatenay D. Libchaber A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Poirier M. Eroglu S. Chatenay D. Marko J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Poirier M.G. Eroglu S. Marko J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The elasticity is determined by the underlying structure of the studied materials and reflects the interactions holding them together. The knowledge of the elasticity properties of the studied object allowed its structure to be properly modeled. For example, the measurements of the bending rigidity and the force-extension curve showed that chromosomes assembled in Xenopus egg extract display a strong anomaly in their elastic response, i.e. their flexibility was found to be 2000 times higher than what could be expected from the measurement of their longitudinal deformability (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests the presence of thin rigid axes inside these chromosomes, the diameter of which can be estimated, from elasticity calculation, to be <20 nm (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The axes are surrounded by a soft chromatin envelope (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, no direct data for such organization are yet available.In this work, we report a detailed study on the structural organization of mitotic chromosomes assembled in Xenopus egg extract by using new approaches for investigating their elasticity. It is shown that chemical continuity of chromosomal DNA is essential for the maintenance of mitotic chromosomes. Direct experimental evidence is presented showing that the structure of the mitotic chromosome is heterogeneous and consists of a soft chromatin envelope and rigid elastic axes. SMC proteins, but not topoisomerase II, are involved in the organization of these axes. Interestingly, topoisomerase II was not found to contribute to the stiffness of the whole chromosome. The data are summarized in a model of the mitotic chromosome that explains their main structural and functional properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Mitotic Extracts—Xenopus egg extracts were prepared mainly by using the protocol of Losada et al. (14Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, after removal of the jelly by cysteine treatment, the eggs were resuspended in XBE2 buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.7, 5 mm potassium EGTA, and 0.05 m sucrose) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml of leupeptin and apoprotin) and 100 μg/ml of cytochalasin D. The eggs were crushed by centrifugation at 16 °C (20 min at 15,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor; Beckman Instruments). The cytoplasmatic fraction was collected by puncturing the side of the tube with a 1-ml syringe, and leupeptin, apoprotin, cytochalasin D (at final concentration of 10 μg/ml), and one-twentieth volume of 20× energy mix (20 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP, and 5 μg/ml creatine kinase; final concentration) were added to it. Then the crude extract was transferred to 2-ml tubes used for a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) and spun at 52,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The lipid layer was removed carefully with a help of a vacuum, and the golden layer fraction was recentrifuged under the same conditions for 45 min. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted in 25-μl fractions, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The extract was stored at –80 °C.Isolation of Demembranated Xenopus Sperm Nuclei and Chromosome Assembly—Xenopus demembranated sperm nuclei were prepared as described (15de la Barre A.-E. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). The demembranated sperm was stored at –80 °C and thawed immediately before use. The assembly of mitotic chromosomes was performed according to the described protocol (16de la Barre A.-E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Chromosome Micromanipulations—The chromosome micromanipulations were carried out using the device described previously (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After completion of the chromosome assembly reaction, 5 μl of the reaction were transferred in a small reservoir containing 300 μl of EB (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; in some experiments the MgCl2 was omitted). Then, the ends of a single chromosome were grabbed by two pipettes either through aspiration or by antibody adhesion. The micropipettes used had an inner diameter of 1 μm and were prepared by using a puller (Sutter P-97). One of the pipettes was fixed, and a motion was imposed on the second pipette. The simultaneous measurements of the end-to-end distance between the pipettes (the length of the extended chromosome) and the deflection of the fixed pipette allowed the determination of the stretch modulus, i.e. the force necessary to stretch the chromosome twice its initial length (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Three different antibodies were used for the pipette's coating, namely anti-histone antibody (panhistone antibody, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), immunopurified anti-XCAP-E antibody generated against the C terminus peptide of XCAP-E (9Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and immunopurified polyclonal anti-Xenopus topoisomerase II antibody (17Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The pipettes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of phospate-buffered saline and 0.02% NaN3 containing the respective antibody. The concentration of the antibodies in the different experiment was usually 1 μg/ml. It should be noted, however, that the same results were obtained when the concentration of the antibodies used for pipette coating was within the interval 0.1–20 μg/ml, i.e. the elasticity chromosome data did not depend on the concentration of the antibodies within more than two orders of magnitude. The specificity of the anchorage of the chromosome to the antibody-coated pipettes was tested by using either non-antibody-coated, anti-nucleoplasmin antibody-coated (nucleoplasmin is a very abundant protein present in the extract that does not associate with the mitotic chromosomes), or bovine serum albumin-coated pipettes. In all three cases, no attachment of the chromosomes to the pipettes was observed. We would like to note that the addition of either one of the antibodies used for pipette coating to the assembled chromosomes in the egg extract does not change their morphology and physicochemical properties.Topoisomerase II Depletion of Mitotic Chromosomes—The topoisomerase II depletion of the in vitro assembled mitotic chromosomes was carried out as described by Hirano and Mitchison (17Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After completion of the chromosome assembly reaction, 5 μl of the reaction was transferred to the chromosome-stretching chamber, which contained 300 μl of EB solution and 150 mm NaCl, and the stretching was carried out. To test if the increase of the ionic strength removes topoisomerase II, a chromosome assembly reaction was brought to 100–200 mm NaCl, and the chromosomes were pelleted by centrifugation on a bench-top centrifuge. The pellet was washed with EB containing NaCl at 100–200 mm concentration and used for immunoblotting. The immunoblotting was carried out following a previously described procedure (16de la Barre A.-E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and using an immunopurified anti-Xenopus topoisomerase II antibody (17Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Enzymatic/Micromechanical Experiments—To study the role of nucleic acids or proteins in the maintenance of the mitotic chromosome structure, a series of combined enzymatic/micromechanical experiments was carried out. A typical experiment was performed as follows. A single chromosome was caught by the two pipettes through aspiration, and a small tension was applied. Then a third micropipette, which contained the enzyme, was moved near the chromosome, and the enzyme solution was sprayed onto it while maintaining the tension. Phase contrast and fluorescence images were acquired through a CCD camera and recorded on a VCR. In some experiments the elastic response of both the intact (before injection of the enzyme) and the digested chromosome was measured.Four different enzymes, namely DNase I (10 units/μl; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), RNase A (500 μg/ml; Sigma), proteinase K (1 mg/ml; Sigma), and trypsin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) were used for spraying. It should be noted that the actual concentration of the sprayed enzyme on the chromosome was decreased by a factor of roughly 2–3 in comparison with that within the pipette as judged by experiments with fluorescent dyes (data not shown). When the spraying onto the chromosome was stopped, the enzymatic reaction arrests immediately due to the diffusion-mediated dissipation of the enzyme. In the case of the spraying of trypsin, the changes in the morphology and the elastic response of the chromosome due to the trypsin digestion were correlated with the SMC protein cleavage. Because it was not possible to visualize the degree of protein cleavage on a single chromosome, the digestion of a multitude of chromosomes by trypsin in conditions similar to those for a single chromosome was studied. Briefly, a chromosome assembly reaction was appropriately diluted with EB (see the section above titled “Chromosome Micromanipulations”), trypsin was added at concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for the appropriate time at room temperature. The chromosomes were then pelleted for 30 s on a bench top centrifuge, and the pellet was washed very quickly with ice-cold EB and recentrifuged for 15 s. After removal of the EB solution, the trypsin-digested chromosomes were immediately resuspended in SDS electrophoresis loading buffer and heated at 96 °C for 5 min. The chromosomal proteins were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. The immunoblotting was carried out by using immunopurified anti-SMC protein (anti-XCAP-E; Ref. 9Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) antibody. It should be noted that, in the different trypsin digestion experiments, a complete cleavage of the SMC proteins was observed 2–4 min after the onset of digestion reaction.RESULTSThe Chemical Continuity of DNA Is Crucial for the Maintenance of Mitotic Chromosome Structure—Elasticity studies have shown that native (10Houchmandzadeh B. Marko J.F. Chatenay D. Libchaber A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or in vitro assembled (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) chromosomes could be elongated by close to two orders of magnitude of their initial length without breaking. This demonstrates that a mitotic chromosome contains a very large reservoir of length, which is released gradually as a function of the applied tension. It is difficult to imagine that this peculiar property could be determined by the chromosomal proteins only. Thus, DNA and some nucleoprotein structures should be involved in these specific properties of mitotic chromosomes. If this is correct, one could expect the continuity of DNA to be essential for the maintenance of the elastic properties of the chromosomes. Hence, cleavage of chromatin DNA by nucleases would result in perturbation of the overall structure of the mitotic chromosome and loss of its stability. Moreover, the application of a small tension on the cleaved chromosome should lead to its dissolution.To test this hypothesis, a single in vitro assembled chromosome was digested with deoxyribonuclease I, and the morphological changes resulting from the enzyme cutting of chromosomal DNA were observed. The experimental approach used is described on Fig. 1A. Briefly, demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei were incubated in extracts isolated from Xenopus eggs. After ∼150 min of incubation, well separated mitotic chromosomes were formed (Fig. 1B). Because these chromosomes are free in the extract solution, they can be easily manipulated. Initially, one end of the chromosome was aspirated and fixed to a pipette. Then, the other chromosome end was fixed to an another pipette also by aspiration, and some small tension was applied to the chromosome (Fig. 1C). Next, a solution of DNase I was injected through a third pipette, and the structural alterations of the chromosome were visualized by both phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). After some initial decrease of the overall diameter, the chromosome breaks into two halves (Fig. 1C). When a buffer solution alone was injected, no changes in the chromosome structure were observed (not shown, but see also Fig. 1E). This demonstrates that the chromosome integrity depends on the intactness of DNA.Chromosomal Proteins, but Not RNA, Participate in the Maintenance of Mitotic Chromosome Structure—It is accepted that the chromosomal proteins are important players in maintaining the mitotic chromosome structure. To investigate the degree of protein contribution in the maintenance of the structural integrity of mitotic chromosomes, an experiment similar to the one described above was carried out, substituting proteinase K for DNase I (Fig. 1D). After some initial decondensation, the chromosome “melts” and, after 25 s of digestion, completely disintegrates. The melted chromosome did not exhibit any detectable elastic response (not shown). Thus, as expected, the presence of chromosomal proteins is crucial for chromosome structural organization.Recent data have suggested a role for RNA in the maintenance of condensed heterochromatin (18Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In addition, the high molecular mass Xist RNA is involved in the maintenance of the highly compact inactive X chromosome (19Clerc P. Avner P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests a function for RNA in stabilizing the structure of interphase chromosomes. To test if RNA plays some role in the organization of mitotic chromosomes, we treated a single chromosome with RNase in an experiment similar to that with DNase I or proteinase K. In contrast to both proteinase K or DNase I, the injection of high concentration RNase for more than 30 min did not affect the integrity of the chromosome (Fig. 1E, and results not shown). We conclude that RNA is unlikely to participate in the organization of mitotic chromosomes.Mitotic Chromosomes Exhibit a Non-homogenous Structure— The above data demonstrate that both the DNA and chromosomal proteins are key factors in chromosome organization and structure. The chromosomal proteins and DNA might be assembled into a chromosome in different ways, thus forming either a non-homogenous or a homogenous structure. Most of the available models suggest that the chromosome exhibited a non-homogenous structure. However, recent elasticity experiments have modeled the chromosomes isolated from newt as solid, elastic rods (13Poirier M.G. Eroglu S. Marko J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data indicate an essentially homogenous structure in its connectivity across the chromosome cross-section (13Poirier M.G. Eroglu S. Marko J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Poirier M.G. Marko J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15393-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our studies on the elastic properties of in vitro assembled chromosomes fitted well with a model of chromosome exhibiting a non-homogenous structure formed of few rigid axes surrounded by a soft envelope of chromatin (11Houchmandzadeh B. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence, a controversy exists in the literature. To clarify this controversy, we developed a new antibody-based micropipette technique to stretch a single chromosome and investigate its elasticity. The classical approach uses aspiration to fix both ends of the chromosome to two micropipettes with different rigidity (Fig. 2A; see also Ref. 10Houchmandzadeh B. Marko J.F. Chatenay D. Libchaber A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Once the chromosomal ends are fixed, the chromosome is stretched by moving one of the pipettes (Fig. 2B). The aspiration technique allows us to study the elastic properties of the whole chromosome. From the force-relative extension dependence, the stretch modulus (the force necessary to elongate the chromosome twice its initial length, i.e. the slope of the force-relative extension curve) can be measured. The stretch modulus is a characteristic of the underlying structure of the object. A high stretch modulus reflects the fact that a high force is needed to elongate the object.Fig. 2A, schematic presentation of the two techniques used for catching an individual chromosome. The aspiration technique (diagram 1) allows us to catch the whole chromosome and, respectively, to measure the elasticity of the chromosome as a whole, whereas by antibody adhesion (diagram 2) the elasticity response of specific chromosomal domains containing the protein of interest can be studied. B, a typical force-extension cycle for a single chromosome. The ends of the chromosome were caught by aspiration using two different micropipettes. The upper pipette was flexible (with a spring constant within the pN · μm–1 range) and immobile, whereas the lower one was rigid (spring constant within the nN · μm–1 range) and mobile. The chromosome was stretched by moving the lower pipette to obtain the desired extension, and, after a pause of few seconds, the constraint was relaxed with the same velocity. Deflection of the upper pipette provoked by the motion of the lower one yielded the force applied on the chromosome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The new technique uses antibody-coated pipettes, and the “catching” of the chromosome is carried out through an antibody (Fig. 2A). Because an antibody against specific proteins can be used, this technique allows us to study selectively the elastic properties of mitotic chromosome domains that are associated with these proteins. If the chromosome structure is non-homogenous, one might expect different elastic responses when different antibodies (raised against proteins associated with different chromosomal domains) are used. In addition, the elastic response of the whole chromosome (when caught by aspiration) might also differ from the elastic responses of the different domains.To study the elastic response of chromatin, we used highly specific anti-histone antibodies that allowed us to fix the chromatin fibers to the pipettes. A typical force-extension dependence is shown on Fig. 3A. As shown, the slope (the stretch modulus) of this curve is several times smaller than the slope of the force extension curve for the whole chromosome that is obtained when aspiration is used to fix the chromosomal ends to the pipettes (Fig. 3A). Histograms, presenting a summary of the stretching of 18 chromosomes with anti-histone antibodies and 11 chromosomes through aspiration, are presented on Fig. 3, B and C. The data show a peak of the stretch modulus of ∼30 pN when chromosome stretching was performed through the anti-histone antibodies (Fig. 3C). However, stretching through aspiration gave an average of the stretch modulus of ∼120 pN (Fig. 3B). Hence, higher forces are necessary to elongate the chromosome when it is fixed through aspiration to the micropipettes compared with the forces needed to stretch the chromosome when the fixation is carried out through the chromatin fibers. Therefore, the chromosomes exhibit a non-homogenous organization with a lower elastic response for the chromatin entity, i.e. mitotic chromatin shows a relatively soft structure. Bearing this in mind, one should expect the existence of chromosomal structures that are more rigid and show higher elastic response. The available data suggest that topoisomerase II and, more particularly, the SMC family of proteins might be associated with such structures (5Paulson J.R.

Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were plated in 12-well plates 18 h prior to transfection. Just prior to transfection, cells were transferred into Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and exposed to 100 ng of FLAG-Rap1GAP DNA, 50 ng of GSK3βS9A DNA (or empty vector), and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I.

Rap1GAP was immunoprecipitated from WRT cells, and the immune complexes were washed with RIPA and then kinase (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) buffers. Kinase reactions were carried out in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 μl of rabbit GSK3β (500,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 25 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated on 8% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, exposed to film, and blotted with anti-Rap1GAP serum. TSH Regulates Rap1GAP Protein Stability—Immunoblotting using a peptide-directed Rap1GAP serum demonstrated a prominent 95-kDa band and a spectrum of faster migrating protein species in lysates prepared from growing WRT cells (Fig. 1A, 3H). A similar pattern has been reported previously in other cells (10Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When lysates prepared from cells transferred to growth factor-free basal medium were analyzed, the Rap1GAP serum detected reduced levels of a discrete upshifted protein species (Fig. 1A, basal). Remarkably, the inclusion of either TSH or forskolin in basal medium prevented the upshift and decrease in Rap1GAP expression. A time course experiment was performed to examine the kinetics over which these changes took place. Cells growing in 3H were transferred to basal medium for times ranging from 15 min to 24 h, and Rap1GAP expression was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Within 1 h following transfer to basal medium, Rap1GAP migration was upshifted. This was followed by a rapid decline in the abundance of faster migrating Rap1GAP species, which were absent from cells transferred to basal medium for as little as 4 h. Thus, total Rap1GAP levels were significantly decreased upon TSH withdrawal for as little as 4 h. Rap1GAP is a substrate for phosphorylation (10Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Proc.

To examine whether phosphorylation contributed to the Rap1GAP upshift seen upon TSH withdrawal, lysates prepared from cells in basal medium were subjected to in vitro alkaline phosphatase treatment. Phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C, lane 5) converted the upshifted Rap1GAP species observed in starved cells (lane 2) to the diffuse species typical of growing cells (lane 1). In contrast, exposure to a protein tyrosine phosphatase had no effect (compare lanes 3 and 6). These results suggest that TSH withdrawal results in a net increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of Rap1GAP followed by a decline in Rap1GAP expression. Similar results were obtained in two other rat thyroid cell lines, PC-Cl3 and FRTL-5,2 indicating that regulation of Rap1GAP is a conserved feature in thyroid cells. To explore the mechanism through which TSH regulates Rap1GAP expression, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine in TSH-supplemented medium for 2 h and then chased in the presence or absence of TSH for various times. Rap1GAP was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. Rap1GAP levels decreased by 50% within 5 h of TSH withdrawal (Fig. 2, open circles). In the presence of TSH, Rap1GAP levels decreased by only 10% over the same time period (closed squares). Not only did TSH stabilize Rap1GAP, it also prevented the upshift in the migration of Rap1GAP (Fig. 2). Together, these results suggest that TSH regulates the phosphorylation status of Rap1GAP, resulting in the stabilization of Rap1GAP protein levels. As phosphorylation triggers the proteasomal degradation of many proteins (reviewed in Refs. 28Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar and 29Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), experiments to determine whether Rap1GAP is a target for proteasome-mediated turnover were performed. Rap1GAP Is a Target for Proteasomal Degradation—Proteasome inhibitors were used in pulse-chase experiments to assess whether inhibition of the proteasome stabilized Rap1GAP. Cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h in TSH-supplemented basal medium in the absence or presence of MG132 (30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 31Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 739-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and then chased in basal medium without TSH in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor. As seen before (Fig. 1B), Rap1GAP was upshifted within 2 h following TSH withdrawal and its abundance declined over the next 4 h (Fig. 3A). Although inclusion of MG132 did not prevent the Rap1GAP upshift, it markedly delayed the decline in Rap1GAP (Fig. 3B, open circles). Two additional proteasome inhibitors, MG115 and lactacystin, also increased Rap1GAP protein levels.2 These results support the idea that Rap1GAP is a substrate for proteasome-mediated degradation. An analysis of the primary structure of Rap1GAP revealed 56 potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Within these sites, there were two DSGXXS destruction box motifs analogous to one found in β-catenin (Fig. 4A) (32Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine residues within this motif by GSK3β triggers the recognition of β-catenin by the F-box protein βTrCP, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation (reviewed in Ref. 33Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rap1GAP was a GSK3β substrate, Rap1GAP was immunoprecipitated from growing WRT cells and used as a substrate for recombinant GSK3β in an immune complex kinase assay. The data shown in Fig. 4B demonstrate that GSK3β phosphorylates Rap1GAP in vitro. To determine whether GSK3β phosphorylates endogenous Rap1GAP, WRT cells were transferred to basal medium in the presence or absence of LiCl, a well characterized inhibitor of GSK3β activity (24Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 5-40 mm LiCl prevented the upshift and attenuated the loss of faster migrating Rap1GAP species (Fig. 4C). This was not due to changes in osmolarity, because the transfer to NaCl-supplemented basal medium did not alter Rap1GAP mobility or expression. Furthermore, the effects of LiCl on Rap1GAP were reproduced by kenpaullone, an alternative GSK3β inhibitor (Fig. 4D) (34Leost M. Schultz C. Link A. Wu Y.Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Kunick C. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5983-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). When used independently, these inhibitors are highly specific for GSK3β (35Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data provide strong support for the role for GSK3β in targeting Rap1GAP for proteasome-mediated degradation. GSK3β Regulates Rap1GAP Protein Levels—To prove that GSK3β can regulate Rap1GAP stability, transient overexpression studies were performed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, which exhibit significantly higher transfection efficiencies than thyroid cells. FLAG-tagged Rap1GAP was co-expressed with GSK3β and Rap1GAP protein levels assessed by Western blotting 24 h post-transfection. We used human GSK3βS9A, which contains a serine to alanine substitution at position 9 to prevent the inactivating phosphorylation of GSK3β at this site (36Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 37Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rap1GAP levels were decreased by co-expression of GSK3βS9A but not by empty vector (Fig. 5A). Mutation of a serine residue within the destruction box (S33Y) stabilizes β-catenin protein by preventing GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation (38Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z.

Therefore, Rap1GAP mutants were constructed in which the first serine in each destruction box motif was changed to isoleucine, N-terminal Rap1GAPS525I (NRap1GAP) and C-terminal Rap1GAPS606I (C-Rap1GAP). A double mutant, N- and C-terminal Rap1GAPS525/606I (NCRap1GAP), was also constructed. Unlike wild-type Rap1GAP, N-Rap1GAP was stable in the presence of GSK3βS9A. Additionally, N-Rap1GAP was consistently expressed at higher levels than was C-Rap1GAP, whose expression was decreased by GSK3βS9A. As expected, the mutation of both serine residues abolished down-regulation of Rap1GAP by GSK3βS9A. The ability of GSK3βS9A to decrease Rap1GAP expression was impaired by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Rap1GAP can be targeted for proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation of serine 525 by GSK3β. Rap1GAP Impairs Cell Proliferation and p70S6 Kinase— The ability of TSH to stabilize Rap1GAP implied an important role for Rap1GAP in mediating TSH effects in thyroid cells. To explore this possibility, WRT cells stably overexpressing Rap1GAP were isolated. Of 12 cell lines screened, only two overexpressed Rap1GAP compared with parental cells and the level of overexpression was modest (Fig. 6A). Nonetheless, modest overexpression of Rap1GAP was sufficient to impair Rap1 activation by TSH (Fig. 6B) and forskolin.2 Rap1GAP expression was regulated similarly in the overexpressing cells as in parental cells. Upon removal of TSH, Rap1GAP was upshifted and its expression decreased (Fig. 6A, basal or B). Intriguingly, Rap1GAP-overexpressing cells grew more slowly than parental cells (Fig. 6C). To ensure that this was not attributed to secondary changes associated with the isolation of stable cell lines, the effects of transient overexpression of Rap1GAP on DNA synthesis were investigated. Both basal and TSH/serum-stimulated DNA synthesis were impaired in Rap1GAP-transfected cells (Fig. 6D). These results are strikingly similar to those reported for tuberin where overexpression slowed cell proliferation (42Soucek T. Pusch O. Wienecke R. DeClue J.E. Hengstschlager M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29301-29308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 43Soucek T. Holzl G. Bernaschek G. Hengstschlager M.

However, in this case, inhibition was specific for cAMP-elevating agents. Fig. 7 demonstrates that the ability of TSH and forskolin to stimulate the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein, a substrate of p70S6K, was markedly impaired in Rap1GAP-overexpressing cells. p70S6K activity is regulated by multi-site phosphorylation including phosphorylation on threonine 389 by mTOR (46Burnett P.E.

Consistent with its effects on S6 phosphorylation, Rap1GAP overexpression attenuated the effects of TSH and forskolin on mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6K (Fig. 7, lower panel). Insulin- and serum-stimulated p70S6K activities assessed by S6 or p70S6K protein phosphorylation were only modestly decreased by Rap1GAP overexpression (Fig. 7). Because p70S6K activity is required for thyroid cell proliferation (48Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2029025255,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) is a critical mediator of interleukin-12 (IL-12)-stimulated inflammatory immune responses. Despite extensive analysis of the immune responses of STAT4-deficient mice, there is still very little understood about STAT4-dependent gene induction. IL-12 stimulated increases in IL-2 receptor α chain gene (CD25) mRNA levels and surface expression require STAT4. In this report, we utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to analyze IL-12-stimulated and STAT4-dependent changes in chromatin remodeling of the CD25 gene. Gene activation requires binding of STAT4 to the PRRIII upstream regulatory element, the recruitment of the CREB-binding protein (CBP), and chromatin remodeling including increased acetylation and decreased methylation of histones within the CD25 promoter. Evidence suggests that STAT4 also facilitates binding of other factors to the CD25 promoter including c-Jun. Thus, these results provide a model for STAT4-dependent gene induction and a mechanism for cytokine-induced expression of the CD25 gene."

Stringent control over ET-1 expression is achieved through a highly regulated promoter and rapid mRNA turnover. Since little is known about mechanisms governing ET-1 post-transcriptional regulation, and changes in ET-1 mRNA stability are implicated in disease processes, we characterized these pathways using a variety of functional approaches. We expressed human ET-1 and luciferase transcripts with or without a wild type ET-1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and found that the 3′-UTR had potent mRNA destabilizing activity. Deletion analysis localized this activity to two domains of the 3′-UTR we have termed destabilizing elements 1 and 2 (DE1 and DE2). Mutational studies revealed that DE1 functions as an AU-rich element (ARE) dependent on a 100-nucleotide region. This activity was further localized to a 10-nucleotide region at position 978–987 of the 3′-UTR. Depletion of AUF1 by RNA interference up-regulated ET-1 in endothelial cells suggesting AUF1-dependent regulation. Since AUF1 functions through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we disrupted this pathway with heat shock and proteasome inhibitor in endothelial cells and observed stabilization of endogenous ET-1 mRNA. Chimeric transcripts bearing wild type ET-1 3′-UTRs were also stabilized in response to proteasome inhibition whereas DE1 mutants failed to respond. Taken together, these findings suggest a complex model of ARE-mediated mRNA turnover dependent on two 3′-UTR domains, DE1 and DE2.

Furthermore, under conditions of cellular heat shock AUF1 associates with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which itself possesses ARE binding activity (27Henics T. Nagy E. Oh H.J.

Given the important role of ET-1 in the vascular endothelium, we chose to study ET-1 as a model labile mRNA. We present evidence that the 3′-UTR constitutively destabilizes the ET-1 transcript through two destabilizing elements, DE1 and DE2, and that DE1 functions through a conserved ARE by the AUF1-proteasome pathway. We also provide evidence for a physiologically relevant pathway of ET-1 mRNA stabilization by the heat shock pathway. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Roche Diagnostics (Laval, QC). PCR amplifications were carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). DNA constructs were sequenced using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (ABI, Foster City, CA). All plasmid constructs were generated using standard recombinant DNA methodologies. The firefly luciferase open reading frame was excised from pSP-luc+ (Promega, Madison, WI) with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into identical sites within pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pLuc-Ctrl. Wild type and mutant 3′-UTRs were excised from pCRII-based plasmids (see below) by complete or partial EcoRI digestion and ligated into the EcoRI site of pLuc-Ctrl immediately downstream of the luciferase ORF. ET-1 3′-UTR reagents are numbered relative to the first nucleotide of the 3′-UTR (GenBank™ accession number J05008 (14Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR using human genomic DNA as a template and primer set ET1-UTR1-S (5′-CAGACCTTCGGGGCCTGT-3′)/ET1-UTR-hexAS (5′-TTTCTAAAGTCATTACCTTGACAGGCA-3′), and subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) to generate pET1–3′UTR. Ligation into the EcoRI site of pLuc-Ctrl, immediately downstream of the luciferase open reading frame, generated pLuc-ET1WT. Deletion mutants were generated by strategic use of restriction enzyme sites in 3′-UTR-containing plasmids. Briefly, pLuc-Δ1–272, pLuc-Δ1–603 and pLuc-Δ1–924 were generated by partial or complete excision from pET1–3′UTR and ligated into the EcoRI site of pLuc-Ctrl. pLuc-Δ272–570, pLuc-Δ571–935, pLuc-Δ573–1109 and pLuc-Δ935–1109 were constructed using appropriate restrictions enzyme digestions and self-ligation to generate 3′-UTR internal deletions, followed by excision and ligation into the EcoRI site of pLuc-Ctrl. Linker-scanning mutants were created as previously described (35Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S.L. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G.K. Miller T.L. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, using pET1–3′UTR as a template, two adjacent but slightly overlapping amplicons were created corresponding to upstream (amplicon A) and downstream (amplicon B) regions of the 3′-UTR relative to the mutation target site. The sense primer of amplicon A and antisense primer of amplicon B were specific to regions on the host vector outside of the 3′-UTR. The mutagenic antisense primer for A and mutagenic sense primer for B each contained 20 nt of 3′-UTR-specific sequences and an additional common 10-nt mutant sequence (5′-CAGGATCCAT-3′) creating a 10-nt overlap region between amplicons A and B. Amplicons A and B were restriction-digested with BamHI/AccI or BamHI/XhoI, respectively, and 3-way-ligated into AccI/XhoI-digested pET1–3′UTR, thereby regenerating the complete 3′-UTR with a 10-nt mutation at the site of BamHI recombination. This procedure generated pCRII-based plasmids from which mutant 3′-UTRs were excised by partial EcoRI digestion and ligated into pLuc-Ctrl to generate pLuc-M613, pLuc-M761, pLuc-M938, pLuc-M952, pLuc-M968, pLuc-M978, and pLuc-M1028. Deletion mutant pLuc-Δ938–1037 was generated from recombination of the A fragment of M938 and the B fragment of pM1028 in the context of pET1–3′UTR and insertion into the EcoRI site of pLuc-Ctrl. pLuc-Multi was generated by the synthesis of a double-stranded 90-mer oligo with BamHI overhangs and the sequence 5′-CAGGATCCAT-3′ in place of wild type AU motifs. The oligo was ligated into the BamHI site of pLuc-Δ938–1037 to regenerate a full-length mutant 3′-UTR. The GM-CSF 3′-UTR (GenBank™ accession number NM_000758) was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using primer set GMCSF-UTR1-S (5′-AATAATTATTACGGTAAAAC-3′)/GMCSF-UTRΔhexAS (5′-CTGGCCGGTCTACTCCGACCGG-3′), subcloned into pCRII, EcoRI excised and ligated into pLuc-Ctrl to give pLuc-WTGMCSF. The GM-CSF linker-scanning mutant pLuc-MutGMCSF (10-nt mutation at position 234 of the 3′-UTR) was generated using a similar strategy as with ET-1 mutants. ET-1 cDNAs are numbered according to the spliced sequence arising from human ET-1 genomic sequences (GenBank™ accession number J05008 (14Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Two PCR products corresponding to nucleotides 1–544 and 425–1309 of the ET-1 cDNA were amplified from reverse-transcribed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) total cellular RNA using primer sets ET1–1S (5′-AGACGCGCCTCTGCATCTGC-3′)/ET1–544AS (5′-TCTCTTGGACCTAGGGCTTC-3′) and ET1–425S (5′-TGCTCCTGCTCGTCCCTGAT-3′)/ET1–1309AS (5′-GGAGTTTCTCCCTGAAATGT-3′), respectively. Subcloning of PCR amplicons into pCRII generated phuET1FL5′ and phuET1FL3′. XhoI/AccI (from phuET1FL5′) and AccI/BstBI (from phuET1FL3′) fragments were ligated into the XhoI/BstBI site of pET1–3′UTR to generate a full-length human ET-1 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–2010 (pCRII-huET1FL). ET-1 cDNAs were excised from pCRII-huET1FL by partial EcoRI digestion (wild type) or partial EcoRI/HaeIII digestion (3′-UTR deletion), blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment and ligated into pcDNA3 to generate pET1-WT and pET1-ΔUTR, respectively. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated. Primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated from calf aortas, cultured on 0.2% gelatin and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% bovine calf serum and antibiotics, as previously described (9Marsden P.A. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C854-C861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BAEC were utilized at passages 3–7. HUVEC were isolated from umbilical cords, cultured in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) and antibiotics, as previously described (36Marsden P.A. Schappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M. Sundell C.L. Wilcox J.N. Lamas S. Michel T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). HUVEC were utilized at passages 3–5. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were obtained from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and maintained in EGM-MV supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and EGM2 supplements (Cambrex). HeLa (human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MG132 and actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON) treatments were carried out as indicated in figure legends. Plasmids utilized in DNA transfections were purified by two rounds of cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. DNA concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry and confirmed by analytical agarose gel electrophoresis. For transient transfections, cell cultures were seeded and grown to 50–80% confluence for 24 h prior to transfection. For 60-mm dishes, cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA per dish (1 μg of test plasmid, 0.05 μg of pRL-SV40 encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega) and pBluescript II SK(–) to a total of 3 μg) with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) at a 2:1 to 3:1 Lipofectin:DNA mass ratio (depending on cell type). For steady-state experiments, cellular protein and/or RNA was harvested 40–48 h post-transfection. For stable transfections, HepG2 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 9 μg of linearized test plasmid. Cells were cultured for 48 h, trypsinized and then cultured in media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for selection. G418-resistant colonies (greater than 250 per cell line) were pooled and maintained in media supplemented with 0.8 mg/ml G418. Three independent transfection studies were performed. For RNA interference studies, 100 nm of dsRNA duplexes were transfected into 100-mm dishes of HUVEC (80% confluence) with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s directions. The target sequences for duplexes were Scramble II, 5′-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3′; Lamin A/C, 5′-CTGGACTTCCAGAAGAACA-3′; AUF1, equimolar mixture of 5′-CAAATTTGGTGAAGTTGTA-3′, 5′-GGAAGGTGATTGATCCTAA-3′, 5′-AGACTGCACTCTGAAGTTA-3′, 5′-CGTGGGTTCTGCTTTATTA-3′ (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Luciferase Assays—Triplicate samples were extracted and luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). For transient transfection assays, Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. For stably transfected cells, Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to protein content. Northern Blot—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed as described (16Bitzan M.M. Wang Y. Lin J. Marsden P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using UltraHyb hybridization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). Gel-purified cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a minimum specific activity of 109 dpm/μg by random primer labeling methods (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d’Urfe, QC). For Northern blot analysis of RNA from transient transfection assays, Firefly luciferase or human ET-1 signals were normalized to signals from the neomycin resistance gene (neoR or aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase) to correct for transfection efficiency. neoR is expressed from all pLuc and pET-1 series plasmids based on pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). cDNA probe templates were as follows: luciferase, 1.7-kb HindIII/XhoI fragment from pLuc-Ctrl containing the full luciferase ORF; human ET-1, 0.54-kb EcoRI fragment from pCRII-huET1FL5′ spanning the 5′-UTR and partial ORF; neoR, 0.14 kb EcoRI fragment of pCRII-neoR140 specific to the ORF. The human-specific ET-1 probe detects human ET-1 mRNA and does not detect endogenous bovine ET-1 in BAEC. Radioactive signals were detected with a Storm PhosphorImager and quantified with ImageQuant 2 for Mac (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Real-time RT-PCR—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μgof DNase-treated total cellular RNA using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time PCR assays were performed with 100 ng of RNA equivalent cDNA in triplicate on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System and analyzed with SDS2.1 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.). PCR was carried out under the following conditions: 95 °C, 10 min; 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. SYBR Green or TaqMan formulations were utilized according to manufacturer’s protocols (Applied Biosystems Inc.). All real-time PCR assays were performed in the presence of serial dilutions of reference plasmids for determination of template copy number. Primer pairs and probes for ET-1 and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) real-time PCR analysis cross-exon boundaries. ET-1 TaqMan assays were performed with primer set huET1RT-S (5′-TGGACATCATTTGGGTCAACA-3′)/huET1RT-AS (5′-TCTCTTGGACCTAGGGCTTCC-3′) and detected with huET1RT-Probe (5′-(FAM)CCCGAGCACGTTGTTCCGTATGGAC(TAMRA)-3′) (38Gan L.M. Selin-Sjogren L. Doroudi R. Jern S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). eNOS TaqMan assays were performed with primer set hueNOSRT-S (5′-GGCATCACCAGGAAGAAGACC-3′)/hueNOSRT-AS (5′-TCACTCGCTTCGCCATCAC-3′) and detected with hueNOSRT-Probe (5′-(FAM-)CCAACGCCGTGAAGATCTCCGC(TAMRA)-3′). 18S SYBR Green assays were performed with primer set 18SF (5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA-3′)/18SR (5′-AGGAATTGACGGAAGGGCAC-3′). Luciferase SYBR Green assays were performed with primer set Luc590S (5′-ACTCCTCTGGATCTACTGGTC-3′)/Luc840AS (5′-GTAATCCTGAAGGCTCCTCA-3′). Western Blot—HUVEC monolayers were lysed with boiling sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell lysates were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, cellular supernatant collected, and protein concentration determined by the Bradford method (Protein Assay Dye Reagent, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON). Protein samples were electrophoresed in denaturing 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Coomassie Blue staining of duplicate gels confirmed equivalent loading of samples. AUF1 immunoblots were incubated with anti-human AUF1 polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:12,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences). Lamin immunoblots were incubated with anti-human lamin monoclonal antibody (0.2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:12,000 dilution, Pierce Biotechnology). Chemiluminescent reactions were carried out using the Supersignal West Pico substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) and detected using a Fluor-S Max Multimager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Statistics—All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of multiple independent experiments. Statistically significant differences for data points, half-life values, and half-life curves represent p < 0.05 and calculated using either the unpaired t test or analysis of variance (Dunnet or Bonferroni post-tests). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The ET-1 3′-UTR Is a Potent Regulator of Human ET-1 mRNA Stability—Steady-state ET-1 mRNA levels in the vascular endothelium are a function of both promoter activity and mRNA turnover. However, very little is currently known about the post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating ET-1. To characterize these pathways, we expressed human ET-1 transcripts in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with or without the 3′-UTR (ET1-WT or ET1-ΔUTR, respectively, Fig. 1A). Northern blot analysis of RNA from transfected cells revealed that removal of the 3′-UTR resulted in a significant increase in steady-state ET-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Half-life studies with actinomycin D-mediated transcriptional arrest demonstrated that removal of the 3′-UTR significantly increased mRNA half-life (Fig. 1C). We also tested the ability of the 3′-UTR to transfer mRNA destabilizing activity to a reporter transcript. Chimeric luciferase transcripts with control or ET-1 3′-UTRs were expressed in endothelial cells (Luc-Ctrl and Luc-ET1-WT, respectively, Fig. 2A). Luciferase activity, steady-state mRNA levels, and mRNA half-life were all decreased in the presence of the ET-1 3′-UTR. (Fig. 2, B–D). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ET-1 3′-UTR possesses potent mRNA destabilizing activity and is necessary for the lability of ET-1 mRNA.Fig. 2The ET-1 3′-UTR destabilizes a reporter mRNA. BAEC were transiently transfected with chimeric luciferase expression plasmids"

A mutant of the muscarinic M3 receptor in which most of the third intracellular (i3) loop had been deleted (M3-short) completely lost the ability to stimulate the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells. This loss was evident despite the fact that the receptor was able to couple efficiently to the phospholipase C second messenger pathway. In co-transfected cells, M3-short greatly reduced the ability of M3 to activate ERK1/2. In another set of experiments we tested the ability of a mutant M3/M2(16aa) receptor, in which the first 16 amino acids of the i3 loop of the M3 receptor were replaced with the corresponding segment of the muscarinic M2 receptor to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This mutant is not coupled to Gαq, but it is weakly coupled to Gαi. Despite its coupling modification this receptor was able to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Again, M3-short greatly reduced the ability of M3/M2(16aa) to activate ERK1/2 in co-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained in stable-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lines. In CHO M3 cells carbachol induced a biphasic increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation; a first increase at doses as low as 0.1 μm and a second increase starting from 10 μm. In CHO M3-short and in double-transfected CHO M3/M3-short cells we observed only the lower doses increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation; no further increase was observed up to 1 mm carbachol. This suggests that in double-transfected CHO cells M3-short prevents the effect of the higher doses of carbachol on the M3 receptor. In a final experiment we tested the ability of co-transfected chimeric α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors to activate the ERK1/2 pathway. When given alone, carbachol and, to a lesser extent, clonidine, stimulated the coupling of the co-transfected chimeric receptors to the phospholipase C second messenger pathway, but they were unable to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. On the contrary, a strong stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed when the two agonists were given together despite the fact that the overall increase in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was not dissimilar from that observed in cells treated with carbachol alone. Our data suggest that the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway requires the coincident activation of the two components of a receptor dimer.

Over the past several years it has become increasingly apparent that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; aa, amino acid; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NMS, methylscopolamine. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; aa, amino acid; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NMS, methylscopolamine. interact with one another to form dimers (or heterodimers) or larger oligomeric complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bouvier M.

Despite the large number of studies that have been published on receptor dimerization, it is not obvious whether the paired activation of the two halves (receptor monomers) of the dimer is required or not for a specific receptor response. In most cases it seems that the individual ability of a given receptor to couple with selective G-proteins is not impaired by heterodimerization, and a single agonist is often sufficient to give a full receptor response (3Ginés S.

This suggests that the paired activation of the two receptors constituting the homo- or heterodimers is not strictly required for proper G-protein coupling. This concept can also be substantiated by the fact that the activity of non-functional GPCRs can be rescued by truncated receptors. For instance, a non-functional chimeric M3/M2 muscarinic receptor, in which the corresponding region of M2 has replaced the N-terminal i3 loop, can be re-activated by co-transfection with a truncated muscarinic M3 receptor bearing the correct N-terminal i3 loop sequence. In this case the dimer is formed by a full-length receptor and a per se inactive fragment, suggesting that only one-half of the dimer is sufficient for the G-protein coupling (8Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signals mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 can be initiated by both receptor-tyrosine kinases and by GPCRs. Recent data suggest that, besides their well characterized roles in GPCR desensitization and sequestration, β-arrestin may contribute to GPCR activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by functioning as adaptors or scaffolding for the recruitment of these signaling molecules into a complex with agonist-occupied receptors (for review, see Ref. 9Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The first evidence of this is reported in the work of Luttrell et al. (10Luttrell L.M.

Subsequent reports showed that β-arrestins can also interact directly with component kinases of the ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. β-Arrestins have been shown to form complexes with angiotensin II type 1A receptor, cRaf-1 and ERK (11McDonald P.H.

(15Budd D.C. Gary B.W. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4581-4587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) show that phosphorylation of the muscarinic M3 receptor by casein kinase 1α on sites in the third intracellular loop contributes to the mechanism of receptor activation of ERK1/2 by working in concert with the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C arm of the phospholipase C-signaling pathway. Recruitment of β-arrestin1 to the phosphorylated third intracellular loop of the muscarinic M3 receptor is essential in this signaling process (16Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). M3 muscarinic receptors, like most of the GPCRs, have been shown to form dimers (17Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); in this work we investigated to see whether the paired activation of both of the receptor components of the M3 dimer plays a role in the cascade of events leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Reagents—N-[3H]methylscopolamine (83 Ci/mmol), [3H]MK912 (81 Ci/mmol), and [3H]adenine (32 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Myo-[3H]inositol (23 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Tissue culture media and sera were from Sigma and Celbio. Forskolin, pertussis toxin, carbachol, clonidine, atropine, and yohimbine were from Sigma. Ro-20–1724 was from Calbiochem. Eukaryotic Expression Vectors—We used human M2 and rat M3 muscarinic receptors inserted into a pCD plasmid (18Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The construction of the M3-short, M3/M2(16aa) and the chimeric adrenergic/muscarinic α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors has been described elsewhere (8Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 19Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dörje F. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the M3-short was obtained by cutting out 196 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic (i3) loop of M3 (the remaining i3 loop was 43 amino acids long). In M3/M2(16aa), the first 16 amino acids of the i3 loop of the M3 receptor were replaced with the corresponding segment of the M2 muscarinic receptor. The chimeric adrenergic/muscarinic α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors were obtained by exchanging the last two transmembrane regions between the adrenergic α2C and the muscarinic M3 receptors. In both chimeras the third cytoplasmic loop was from the M3 receptor. A schematic representation of the receptor mutants used is shown in Fig. 1. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments the chimeric M3/α2 receptor was tagged at its N terminus with the HA antigen (HA-M3/α2). Cell Cultures and Transfection—COS-7 cells were incubated at +37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (containing 5% CO2) and grown in Eagle's medium as modified by Dulbecco, which was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 105/100-mm dish, and 24 h later they were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method (21Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA used for each transfection was brought to 4 μg by adding an appropriate amount of vector DNA. Generation of stable CHO cell lines expressing the muscarinic M3 and M3-short receptors was described previously (Maggio et al. (19Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). To establish the double-transfected CHO M3/M3-short cell line, we co-transfected the M3-short receptor in CHO M3. Because originally the CHO M3 cells were selected with the neomycin analogue G418, the M3-short receptor was subcloned in the pcDNA3.1/hygro(–) vector (Invitrogen), and the selection of the CHO M3/M3-short cells was done with hygromycin. After several rounds of clonal selection, several colonies were isolated with the cloning ring and tested for the presence of the M3-short by PCR amplification of the i3 loop. Double-transfected CHO M3/M3-short cells were then tested in a binding assay to evaluate the increase in binding compared to CHO M3. The ultimate modification in the amount of M3 after selection was quantified by immunoblot with anti-M3 antibody directed against the third loop. Membrane Preparation and Binding Assay—On day 1 the COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid(s) of interest. Three days after transfection, confluent plates of cells were lysed by replacing the medium with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mm Na-HEPES, 2 mm EDTA). After 20 min the cells were scraped off the plate and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 20 min at +4 °C. The lysed cell pellet was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 155 mm NaCl, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Binding was carried out at +30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml, and 1 μm atropine or 100 μm noradrenaline was used to define nonspecific binding. The bound ligand was separated from the unbound ligand using glass-fiber filters (Whatman, GF/B) with a Brandel Cell Harvester, and the filters were counted with a scintillation β-counter. Detection of Phosphorylated Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Isoforms (ERK1/2)—On day 1 the COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid(s) of interest. On day 3 the cells were exposed to serum-free medium until the day of the assay. On day 4 cells were treated for the indicated times with agonists or antagonists at +37 °C. Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% NIAPROOF, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 4 μm leupeptin, 300 nm aprotinin, 0.1 mm PMSF. The samples were then incubated for 30 min at +4 °C and centrifuged for 15 min at 17,000 rpm. The pellet was discharged, and protein concentration was measured in the supernatant with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Proteins were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and the extent of phosphorylation of (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK (Sigma). The blots were then stripped and reblotted with the anti-ERK1/2 (Sigma) to control the total amount of kinases loaded. Data from separate experiments were digitized on a flatbed scanner and analyzed with a Kodak scientific imaging system software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting of M3, M3-M2(16aa), and M3-short—For immunoprecipitation, an N-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged M3-short (HA-M3-short) was used. Three days after transfection confluent plates of cells were washed twice with sterile 0.9% NaCl and scraped with 300 μl of buffer solution A (0.2% digitonin, EDTA 1 mm in phosphate-buffered saline) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1.5 μm pepstatin, 4 μm leupeptin, 0.01 m aprotinin, and 500 μm PMSF). Lysed cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at +4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 200 μl of buffer solution B (1% digitonin, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) containing the protease inhibitor mixture and incubated at +4 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 20 min at +4 °C, and then the supernatant was recovered for immunoprecipitation. To eliminate proteins that could non-specifically bind magnetic beads the cell extract was pre-exposed to 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads for 1 h at +4 °C. A magnetic field was applied to the side of the tube, and the supernatant was recovered and transferred to a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of an anti-M3 antibody directed against the i3-loop (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the tube, and the suspension was incubated at +4 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads were added and incubated at +4 °C for an additional hour. A magnetic field was applied to pull beads to the side of the tube, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The magnetic beads were washed with 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1% NIAPROOF, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) including the protease inhibitor mixture. Bead pellets were recovered by applying a magnetic field, and they were re-suspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer (plus 150 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at +70 °C for 5 min. A magnetic field was applied to the sample, and the supernatant was recovered and loaded on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were run at 90 V for 2–3 h and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 100 V. The co-immunoprecipitated HA-M3-short protein was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody from (Sigma). Data from separate experiments were digitized on a flatbed scanner and analyzed with a Kodak scientific imaging system software. Immunoprecipitation of [3H]NMS- and [3H]MK-912-labeled HA-M3/α2 and α2/M3 Receptors—COS-7 cells were transfected with the chimeric HA-M3/α2 and the α2/M3 receptors. Three days after transfection confluent plates of cells were washed three times with sterile 0.9% NaCl and scraped off the plate into ice-cold buffer (Buffer C) containing 20 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 1 mm benzamide, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.6. They were homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s and spun down in a centrifuge for 40 min at +4 °C and 17,000 rpm. This step was then repeated in a slightly different buffer (Buffer D): 20 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4. Detergents were added in Buffer D to a final concentration of 1% digitonin and 0.06% sodium cholate. The suspension was shaken on a horizontal shaker for 40 min at +4 °C and then centrifuged for 40 min at +4 °C and 17,000 rpm. Protein content was assessed in the supernatant fraction, and the relative concentration was adjusted to 20 mg of protein/ml. Binding was carried out in a final volume of 55 μl, 5 μl of soluble receptor preparation and 50 μl of [3H]NMS or [3H]MK912 in Buffer E (20 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) containing 0.3% digitonin and 0.02% sodium cholate. The reaction was carried out at +30 °C in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes. Nonspecific binding was calculated in the presence of 1 μm atropine or 100 μm noradrenaline. At the end of the incubation period each sample was immunoprecipitated with the magnetic beads as described in the previous paragraph. Immunoprecipitation of the α2/M3 receptor was performed with 20 μgof an anti-M3 antibody directed against the C terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), whereas immunoprecipitation of HA-M3/α2 was performed with 20 μg of the anti-HA antibody. Bead pellets containing the labeled HA-M3/α2 and α2/M3 receptors were counted with a scintillation β-counter. Phosphatidylinositol Breakdown Assay—Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml) for 48 h. Immediately before the experiment the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 min in Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl and 20 mm HEPES. The medium was then replaced by 0.25 ml of the same medium containing the experimental agents. After a 1-h incubation at +25 °C the reaction was arrested by the addition of 0.75 ml of 7.5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The trichloroacetic acid was extracted with water-saturated diethyl ether (3 × 4 ml), and levels of IP1 were determined by anion exchange chromatography (22Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Adenyl Cyclase Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid(s) containing the receptor of interest plus the adenyl cyclase V. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were trypsinized and recultured in 24-well plates, and after an additional 24 h they were assayed for adenyl cyclase activity. The assay was performed in triplicate as described by Avidor-Reiss et al. (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells in the 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h with 0.25 ml/well of fresh growth medium containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine, and this medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well of DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm) and RO-20–1724 (0.5 mm). AC activity was stimulated by the addition of 1 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of carbachol. After 10 min of incubation at +30 °C, the medium was removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP followed by neutralization with KOH. The amount of [3H]cAMP formed was determined by a two-step column separation procedure, as described by Avidor-Reiss et al. (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments we characterized the ability of the muscarinic M3 receptor to stimulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2a, carbachol at a concentration of 0.1 mm increases the fraction of ERK1/2 phosphorylated in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the muscarinic M3 receptor. This effect was already evident after 1 min; it reached the maximum at 5 min and vanished after 20 min. The dose-response curve of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was characterized by a sudden change in the response to carbachol between 10 and 100 μm (Fig. 2b). This was completely different from the dose-response curve of M3-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, in which a gradual increase in IP1 accumulation with the increase of the concentration of carbachol was observed (see Fig. 4a).Fig. 4Carbachol stimulation of inositol phosphate hydrolysis (a) or inhibition of cAMP accumulation (b) in COS-7 cells separately transfected or co-transfected with 1 μg of DNA of M3, 1 μg of DNA of M3/M2(16aa) (2 μg when co-transfected with M3), and 2 μg of DNA M3-short receptors. For inositol phosphate breakdown assay cells were pre-labeled for 48 h with 3 μCi/ml [3H]inositol and, immediately before the assay, incubated for 15 min in Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl and 20 mm HEPES. The medium was then replaced by the same medium containing increasing concentrations of carbachol, and the cells were then incubated for 1 h at +25 °C. For the adenyl cyclase assay, cells were pre-labeled for 2 h with 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine, then adenyl cyclase activity was stimulated for 10 min at +30 °C by the addition of 1 μm forskolin in the presence of increasing concentrations of carbachol. The graphs are representative of two experiments, each performed in triplicate (a) or in quadruplicate (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Budd et al.

In agreement with the data reported by Budd et al. (15Budd D.C. Gary B.W. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4581-4587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the M3-short receptor was unable to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a) despite the fact that this receptor was efficiently coupled to Gαq, as shown by the increase in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (Fig. 4a). To see if the M3-short receptor can interfere with the ability of the wild type muscarinic M3 receptor to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we co-transfected these two receptors together. As shown in Fig. 3a, the M3-short completely blocks the ability of the wild type M3 receptor to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. It is interesting to note that the co-transfection of these two receptors together did not modify the extent of the IP1 accumulation in phosphatidylinositol breakdown assays (Fig. 4a). In another set of experiments we tested another mutant muscarinic M3 receptor in which 16 amino acids of the N-terminal i3 loops were exchanged with 16 amino acids of the M2 (M3/M2(16aa)). Although the binding affinity of this receptor for muscarinic ligands remained unchanged, its coupling selectivity was altered. As reported by Wess et al. (20Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dörje F. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar), this receptor loses the ability to stimulate the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (Fig. 4a) and acquires the ability to inhibit the accumulation of cAMP (Fig. 4b). Regardless of its change in coupling selectivity, this receptor efficiently stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3b). Pertussis toxin at a concentration of 130 ng/ml given 24 h before the assay reduced but did not abolish the ability of carbachol to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3b). The magnitude of the basal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced, and after the correction for the change in the basal level the stimulation was on average 3.29-fold in cells treated with pertussis toxin and 4.14-fold in cells untreated. This difference was statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed paired Student's t test). To see if the M3-short receptor was able to inhibit the effect of the M3/M2(16aa) to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we co-transfected these two receptors together. Similar to what has been observed with the wild type M3 receptor, the M3-short completely abolished the M3/M2(16aa) induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Remarkably, the ability of the two receptors expressed together to activate the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (Fig. 4a) and to inhibit the accumulation of cAMP (Fig. 4b) was not altered, indicating that the co-expression of these two receptors does not interfere with G-protein coupling. In a control experiment, we co-transfected the M3/M2(16aa) with the wild type M3 receptor. In this condition carbachol was able to activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3c); furthermore, there was no modification in the ability of the two receptors to induce the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (Fig. 4a) and to inhibit the accumulation of cAMP (Fig. 4b). An alternative explanation for the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by M3-short could be that it sequesters some proteins needed for the activation of ERK1/2. To"

Structure-function studies have suggested that the second transmembrane domain (M2) and the adjacent pre- and post-M2 regions are involved in channel pore formation, cation selectivity, and amiloride sensitivity. Because Na+ selectivity, unitary Na+ conductance (γNa), and amiloride sensitivity of δ-ENaC are strikingly different from those of α-ENaC, the hypothesis that the pre-H2 domain may contribute to these characterizations has been examined by swapping the pre-H2, H2, and both (pre-H2+H2) domains of δ- and α-ENaCs. Whole-cell and single channel results showed that the permeation ratio of Li+ and Na+ (PLi/PNa) for the swap α chimeras co-expressed with βγ-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes decreased significantly. In contrast, the ratio of PLi/PNa for the swap δ constructs was not significantly altered. Single channel studies confirmed that swapping of the H2 and the pre-H2+H2 domains increased the γNa of α-ENaC but decreased the γNa of δ-ENaC. A significant increment in the apparent inhibitory dissociation constant for amiloride (Kiamil) was observed in the α chimeras by swapping the pre-H2, H2, and pre-H2+H2 domains. In contrast, a striking decline of Kiamil was obtained in the chimeric δ constructs with substitution of the H2 and pre-H2+H2 domains. Our results demonstrate that the pre-H2 domain, combined with the H2 domain, contributes to the PLi/PNa ratio, single channel Na+ conductance, and amiloride sensitivity of α- and δ-ENaCs.

The topology of ENaC/DEG comprises two short N- and C-terminal intracellular tails, two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains (M1 and M2), and a large, extracellular loop with two (or three) cysteine-rich domains (1Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). There is an overall ∼37% amino acid identity between α-, δ-, β-, and γ-subunits. Both the α- and δ-subunits can form independent conducting channels with similar amiloride sensitivities and ion selectivities to those co-expressed with βγ-subunits. The β- and γ-subunits are modifying subunits that regulate the trafficking and conductance of α- and δ-ENaCs (1Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol.

The αβγ-ENaC has a higher permeability to Na+ and Li+ compared with the other alkali metals. For example, αβγ-ENaC has a permeability ratio of PLi/PNa up to 2, but the channel is virtually impermeant to K+ ions (1Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol.

Similar to other ENaC/DEG superfamily members, ENaC is very sensitive to amiloride, displaying an apparent inhibitory dissociation constant (Kiamil) in the nanomolar range (1Benos D.J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that positively charged residues downstream of the M2 region of α-hENaC (post-M2 domain) also contributed to ion permeation and gating behavior and that the functional diameter of the channel pore, in constructs in which these post-M2 positively charged amino acids were mutated to negatively charged glutamic acids, was altered. There is 63% diversity in the predicted amino acid sequences between α- and δ-ENaC subunits. δ- and α-ENaCs have three essential biophysical and pharmacological differences (16Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). First, the whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ current of δβγ-ENaC is greater than the amiloride-sensitive Li+ current, yielding a Li+/Na+ permeation ratio (PLi/PNa) of 0.6 rather than 2.0 (for αβγ-ENaC). There is no difference in PNa/PK. Second, the value of Kiamil for δβγ-ENaC (up to 2.6 μm) is 30-fold greater than that for αβγ-ENaC (16Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Third, the unitary Na+ conductance (γNa) measured for δβγ-ENaC in cell-attached patches is 2.4-fold greater than that of wt αβγ-ENaC, but the unitary Li+ conductance (γLi) is unchanged (16Waldmann R.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have been shown recently to mediate ion selectivity, channel conductance, and agonist/ion affinity. The contributions of the extracellular pre-H2 domains of ENaC to the ion selectivity filter and amiloride inhibition are unknown. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-H2 domains of α- and δ-ENaC subunits may be integrally associated with amiloride affinity, ion selectivity, and conductance, therefore contributing to the different pharmacological and biophysical properties between α- and δ-ENaC. Our results show that swapping the pre-H2 and/or H2 regions of α- and δ-ENaC carried over the features associated with their parental wild type constructs partly in cation selectivity, single channel conductance, and almost entirely amiloride sensitivity to the chimeric mutations. Site-directed and Swap Mutagenesis and Functional Expression—Swap and triple mutants were generated in rat α- and human δ-ENaC cRNAs cloned into pSP70 vector (Promega, WI) using the Chameleon Double-stranded Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (15Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cRNAs were synthesized using the T7 promoter (Ambion, TX) and dissolved in nuclease-free water. Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNAs containing α- (or δ-), β-, and γ-ENaC (ratio 1:1:1) for each subunit. Injected oocytes were incubated in ½ strength L-15 medium at 18 °C (22Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1182-C1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37693-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The triple mutants and swap chimeras were engineered as follows (Fig. 1): the pre-H2 chimeras (αpH2 and δpH2), swapping α545-568 with δ459-518; the H2 chimeras (αH2 and δH2), exchanging α569-587 with δ519-537; the pre-H2+H2 chimeras (αpH2H2 and δpH2H2), switching α545-587 with δ495-537; the α triple mutant (αtrip), αS564E,S566A,S568V; the δ triple mutant (δtrip), δE514S,A516S,V518S. Dual Electrode Voltage Clamp—Whole-cell cation currents were measured in oocytes expressing ENaC using dual electrode voltage clamp 48 or 72 h post-injection (23Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37693-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Oocytes were impaled with two 3 m KCl-filled electrodes, having resistances of 0.5-2 megohms. A Dagan TEV-200 voltage clamp amplifier was used to clamp oocytes with concomitant recording of currents. Two reference electrodes were connected to the bath by 3 m KCl, 3% agar bridges. The continuously perfused bathing solution was ND96 (in mm): 96 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 KCl, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Equimolar concentrations of LiCl were used to replace NaCl to examine ion selectivity. The chamber volume was less than 100 nl, and the switching of solutions was controlled by SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step system (Warner, Hamden, CT). Sampling protocols were given by pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and currents at -100 and +60 mV were continuously monitored at an interval of 2 s using a strip chart recorder. Oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of 0 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) relationships were acquired by stepping the holding potential in 20-mV increments from -120 to + 80 mV. I-V data were recorded after the monitoring currents were stable before and after the application of 10 μm amiloride to the bath except where stated. Data were sampled at the rate of 1 kHz and filtered at 500 kHz. Single Channel Patch Clamp—Oocytes were shrunk in a hyperosmotic medium, and the vitelline membrane was removed before patch clamping (15Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The on-cell and inside-out configurations were used to record single channel currents, using an Axopatch 1B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) (15Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The patch pipettes were pulled from fire-polished borosilicate glass (WPI Instruments) by using a multistepped micropipette puller (model M97, Flaming/Brown). The electrode tips were fire-polished. The resistance of the electrode was 5-10 megohms when filled with pipette solution (NaCl 100 mm, HEPES-Na 10 mm (pH 7.5)). Currents were collected using the software CLAMPEX 7.0 at a sampling interval of 500 μs. The current traces were filtered with the 0.1 kHz built-in low pass filter of CLAMPEX 7.0 and digitized by DigiData 1200 (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA). After collecting data for the on-cell configuration, inside-out patches were excised in bath solution (100 mm LiCl, 10 mm HEPES free acid (pH 7.5), LiOH), simply by pulling the electrode back. Depolarizing potentials (0 to +120 mV) were applied to the on-cell patch, and both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing potentials (-100 mV to +100 mV) were applied to the inside-out patches. Data Analysis—All macroscopic currents presented in this paper were amiloride-sensitive currents (except the traces in Fig. 6), which were derived by subtracting, by CLAMPFIT, the amiloride-resistant current measured in the presence of 10 μm amiloride from the total current amplitude measured in the absence of the drug. Amiloride-sensitive currents, measured between 200 and 800 ms after application of the test potentials, were averaged. Analysis of single channel data was performed using the FETCHAN and pSTAT programs of pCLAMP version 8.0 or Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) as described previously (15Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unitary current level was computed by making all-point histograms or measuring the amplitude of the current transient. Single channel conductance was calculated by linear regression of I-V curves. Values of γNa and γLi under bi-ionic conditions were estimated by fitting the inward and outward current sections of I-V curves, respectively. The absolute permeabilities for Na+ (PNa) and Li+ (PLi) and intraoocyte ion concentrations were retrieved from the fitting of the macroscopic current-voltage curves (I-V) with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation 1 (15Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IamilxAcell=Px·z·Etest·F2[X+]out-[X+]in·eF·Etest/R·TR·T·(1-eF·Etest/R·T) where R, T, and F have their usual meanings; z is the valence of the cation; Iamilx represents the amiloride-sensitive current carried by the cation X+; Px is the absolute permeability value for the cation X+, and [X+]out and [X+]in indicate extraoocyte and intraoocyte concentrations, respectively. Acell is the calculated surface of an oocyte, assuming that the oocyte is a spheroid with a diameter of 1.0 mm. The absolute cation permeability coefficients from single channel recordings were computed by fitting the bi-ionic I-V curves with the modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current Equation 2, iLi+iNa=(PNa·[Na+]out+PLi·[Li+]in)·z·Etest·F2RT·eEtest·F/R·T1-eEtest·F/R·T where iLi and iNa indicate the unitary current carried by Na+ in the pipette solution ([Na+]out) and Li+ in the bath solution ([Li+]in), respectively. The corresponding permeabilities were expressed as PNa and PLi, respectively. To analyze the affinity of amiloride to the channel, perfusates containing different concentrations of amiloride (ranging from 0 to 1 mm) were switched into the chamber. Both the Kiamil and Hill coefficient were retrieved by fitting the dose-response curves of amiloride with the Hill Equation 3, I=11+AmilKiamiln where Kiamil is the concentration required for inhibiting half of the maximal current; I is the measured amiloride-sensitive current at the concentration of Amil; and n represents the Hill coefficient. The voltage dependence of amiloride inhibition was also characterized by fitting the plot of Kiamil as function of membrane voltage with the Woodhull Equation 4 (24Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), Kiamil(Etest)=Kd(0)·expδ·z·F·EtestR·T where Kiamil(Etest) is the equilibrium inhibitory dissociation constant at a test potential (Etest); Kiamil(0) is the Kiamil at 0 mV; δ is the fractional distance across the electric field that can be sensed by amiloride; z is +1 for amiloride; and R, T, and F have their usual meanings. Both whole-cell and single channel current traces carried by cations moving from the extra-oocyte to the intra-oocyte side were depicted as inward (negative) currents and vice versa. Average data were reported as mean ± S.E. if not stated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance combined with the Bonferroni test for variance and mean of unpaired data. A p value of <0.05 between experimental groups was considered statistically significant. The purpose of the study was to test the role of the pre-H2 regions of α- and δ-ENaC subunits in ion permeation, conductance, and amiloride inhibition. Because these properties of α-rENaC and δ-hENaC are significantly different from each other at the macroscopic and microscopic current levels, these particular subunits were chosen for analysis. The chimeras were engineered by swapping the pre-H2 region as well as the H2 domain. Fig. 1 shows that there is 45.8 and 52.6% identity (37% identity for full-lengthα-rENaC and δ-hENaC) between the pre-H2 and H2 regions, respectively. Whole-cell Studies—To test the role of the pre-H2 region in ion selectivity, whole-cell amiloride-sensitive currents carried by extracellular Na+ or Li+ (101 mm) were recorded in oocytes with the conventional two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Wild type (wt) rat βγ-ENaC subunits were co-expressed with wt α-rENaC and its swap chimeras, whereas δ-hENaC and the swapped constructs were expressed with wt human βγ-ENaC subunits. As shown in Fig. 2, the activation of the amiloride-sensitive currents evoked at membrane potentials was not time-dependent between -120 mV to +80 mV. Oocytes were held at 0 mV, which was close to the resting membrane potential as ENaC expression caused an overloading of the cytosolic Na+ and Li+ concentration, leading to a depolarization of the resting membrane potential. Both wt and chimeric constructs had a slightly inward rectified I-V curve with a reversal potential (Erev) of more than +10 mV (Fig. 3). The macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+ and Li+ currents were -1520.37 ± 361 and -3524.33 ± 606 nA, respectively, at a membrane potential of -120 mV for wt αβγ-rENaC (n = 33). Current carried by Li+ was markedly greater than that of Na+ (p < 0.001). On the other hand, the whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ and Li+ currents of αpH2βγ-rENaC were -2970.99 ± 832 (p < 0.01 compared with that of wt αβγ-ENaC) and -4011.51 ± 1178 nA, respectively (n = 25). Conversely, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC was greater than the Li+ current (-2602.61 ± 530 versus -1660.94 ± 386 nA for Na+ and Li+, respectively, n = 34). The current amplitudes of both amiloride-sensitive Na+ and Li+ currents associated with δpH2βγ-hENaC were greater than wt construct (-3302.67 ± 670 nA for Na+ and -2490.11 ± 528 nA for Li+, respectively, n = 26, p < 0.05). These results for wt αβγ-rENaC and δβγ-hENaC were consistent with those reported previously (16Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

To address whether the pre-H2 domain regulates Na+ or Li+ permeation, we calculated the absolute permeation constant. The retrieved values were listed in Table I. Only αpH2 and αpH2H2 chimeras shifted the Erev significantly to the hyperpolarizing direction. The value of PNa for wt rat ENaC was about half of PLi, yielding a PLi/PNa ratio of 1.8. However, the PNa of wt human ENaC was greater and the PLi/PNa ratio was less compared with its rENaC counterpart. In contrast, the PLi for wt δ-hENaC was smaller (approximately up to 50% that of rENaC), whereas PNa was greater than these of wt rENaC, yielding a PLi/PNa ratio of 0.62. The selectivity ratios of wt rat and human ENaC constructs calculated from the permeation constant were completely consistent with previous studies (16Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N.

For comparison, chimeras swapping the H2 and pre-H2+H2 domains were constructed. A significant increment in PNa was observed for the"

We showed previously in islets that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is lowered by excess fatty acids (the so-called Randle effect). We have now investigated PDH activity and pyruvate metabolism in islets after 48-h culture at 16.7 mmol/liter glucose. Active PDH Vmax was lowered 65% by 48 h of high glucose, and this effect was markedly attenuated by co-culture with triacsin C, which inhibits acyl-CoA synthase. Despite the large reduction in PDH activity, glucose oxidation was twice normal. The reason was continued metabolism of pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase (Vmax, 83% of control) and diversion of flux through the pyruvate-malate shuttle. The result was a 3-fold increase of the pyruvate concentration that overcame the lowered PDH activity by mass action as shown by glucose oxidation measured with [6-14C]glucose being twice normal. In addition, glucose-induced insulin secretion was 3-fold increased after 48 h of high glucose, and this effect was totally blocked by co-culture with triacsin C. These results show that a unique feature of islet β-cells is not only fatty acids but also excess glucose that impairs PDH activity. Also, a specialized trait of β-cells is a long chain acyl-CoA-mediated defense mechanism that prevents a reduction in glucose oxidation and consequently in insulin secretion.

Also, a specialized trait of β-cells is a long chain acyl-CoA-mediated defense mechanism that prevents a reduction in glucose oxidation and consequently in insulin secretion. The molecular and biochemical basis for how glucose stimulates insulin secretion is not well understood. A hypothesis with considerable experimental support pertains to pyruvate metabolism through pyruvate carboxylase (PC), 1The abbreviations used are: PC, pyruvate carboxylase; LC-CoA, long chain acyl-CoA; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NS, not significant. the so-called anaplerosis pathway (1Prentki M.

Several downstream metabolites are proposed to be effectors of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Best known is malonyl-CoA, which inhibits fatty acid oxidation so that long chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) accumulates (3Prentki M. Joly E. El-Assaad W. Roduit R.

Another proposed effector is production of cytoplasmic reducing equivalents through the malate-pyruvate (10MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and citrate-pyruvate shuttles (11Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Attesting to the importance of the anaplerosis pathway are studies of islets or clonal β-cells with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion because of being cultured with excess fatty acids (12Brun T.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that show lowered expression of PC or downstream enzymes. Thus, interest in the anaplerosis pathways has mostly focused on potential direct regulatory effects on insulin secretion. We studied β-cells exposed to states of excess fatty acids in which glucose-induced insulin secretion is preserved, and we have identified another potential regulatory role for PC and its downstream pathways. We cultured islets for 4 days with 0.25 mmol/liter oleate and 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, and we observed that glucose oxidation was increased despite pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity being lowered by 30% (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We made a similar finding in isolated islets from insulin-resistant, hyperlipidemic, nondiabetic Zucker fatty rats (18Liu Y.Q. Jetton T.L. Leahy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39163-39168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The effect of excess fatty acids to lower PDH activity was first described by Randle et al. (19Randle P.J. Priestman D.A. Mistry S. Halsall A. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S155-S161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver and subsequently was shown by others to occur in islets (20Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Zhou Y.P. Berggren P.O. Grill V. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism is an increase in PDH kinase activity that deactivates PDH (19Randle P.J. Priestman D.A. Mistry S. Halsall A. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S155-S161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In muscle, glucose oxidation, thus ATP production, is lowered because PDH is the sole pathway for mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Islets are more complex because of the presence and high activity of PC (22MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our studies of fatty acid-associated lowering of PDH activity (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Liu Y.Q. Jetton T.L. Leahy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39163-39168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), PC activity was unaffected or slightly increased, and flux through the malate-pyruvate shuttle was more than doubled, as was the concentration of pyruvate. We proposed from these findings that islets are protected against the mitochondrial dysmetabolism that occurs with excess fatty acids in other tissues because of having an alternate pyruvate metabolism pathway through PC and that diversion through this pathway results in augmented flux through the pyruvate shuttles, which raises the level of cytoplasmic pyruvate to an extent that overcomes the lowered PDH activity through mass action. Long term culture of islets and β-cells under high glucose conditions is another state of increased anaplerosis (23Roche E. Farfari S. Witters L.A. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Brun T. Corkey B.E. Saha A.K. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The effect on pyruvate metabolism is unclear. One study noted no change in PDH mRNA or protein expression (23Roche E. Farfari S. Witters L.A. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Brun T. Corkey B.E. Saha A.K. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas another showed that PDH activity was lowered (24Patanà G. Anello M. Piro S. Vigneri R. Purrello F. Rabuazzo A.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2749-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results are reminiscent of the PDH deactivation induced by excess fatty acids. Fatty acids and high glucose both increase production of LC-CoA (3Prentki M. Joly E. El-Assaad W. Roduit R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S405-S413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that phosphofructokinase activity was enhanced in 4-day fatty acid-cultured islets and 2-day high glucose-cultured islets, with both of those effects blocked by inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase using triacsin C (25Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whether the PDH deactivation related to excess fatty acids is similar and consequently occurs in islets with long term high glucose is unknown. The current study investigated pyruvate metabolism in rat islets cultured 48 h at 16.7 mmol/liter glucose. We confirmed inhibition of PDH activity and showed substantial prevention by triacsin C. Also, glucose oxidation and glucose-induced insulin secretion were enhanced despite the lowered measured PDH activity in association with a marked increase in the malate-pyruvate shuttle and a tripling of the pyruvate concentration. Islet Culture—Islets were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Germantown, NY) by an adaptation of the method of Gotoh et al. (27Gotoh M. Maki T. Satomi S. Porter J. Bonner-Weir S. O'Hara C.J. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1987; 43: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar): pancreas duct infiltration with collagenase, Histopaque gradient separation, and hand picking. They were cultured 48 h at 37 °C in humidified air and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5.5 or 16.7 mmol/liter glucose, 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Triacsin C (0.5 μg/ml) was included in the 48-h culture where stated in the text. Following the culture period, islet extracts were made for measurement of enzyme activities, or the islets were preincubated for 30 min in KRB that contained 5.5 mmol/liter glucose and 0.07% BSA and then incubated either for an additional 60 min at various glucose concentrations for analysis of metabolites or secreted insulin or for 90 min for the glucose metabolism studies. DNA was measured using the method of Labarca and Paigen (28Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar), and protein was measured by a commercial kit that used BSA as standard (Bio-Rad). To avoid confusion over terminology in the text, islet groups in terms of the 48-h culture conditions are referred to as “normal glucose” and “high glucose,” and references to the post-culture incubation studies include the actual utilized glucose concentrations. Enzyme Activities—Glucose phosphorylation was measured in islet extracts as described previously (29Chen C. Hosokawa H. Bumbalo L.M. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a method based on quantifying conversion of NAD+ to NADH by exogenous glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (30Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Islet homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated at 10 glucose concentrations (0.03–100 mmol/liter) to measure glucose phosphorylation. Maximal velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values for glucokinase and hexokinase were calculated by linear regression from an Eadie-Scatchard plot and 10 cycles of the method of Spears et al. (31Spears G. Sneyd J.G. Loten E.G. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) to identify the activity of each enzyme. Active PDH was measured as described previously (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (300) were homogenized on ice in 0.3 ml of 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmol/liter KCl, 3 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmol/liter Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mmol/liter trypsin inhibitor, 0.02 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 2% rat serum, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100; then freeze-thawed three times; and passed through a 0.5-ml insulin syringe 10 times. Extract (50 μl) and 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 3 mmol/liter NAD, 0.4 mmol/liter thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.4 mmol/liter CoA, 2 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 7.5 units/ml lipoamide dehydrogenase, 1 mmol/liter pyruvate, 0.1 μCi of [1-14C]pyruvate) were added to a cup inside a rubber-stoppered 20-ml scintillation vial that contained a center well with filter paper. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by injecting 200 μl of 1 n HCl into the cup. CO2 was trapped in the filter paper by injecting 100 μlof1 n KOH into the center well. For PDH activity, we set 1 unit equal to 1 μmol of CO2/min. PC was measured according to the method of MacDonald et al. (15MacDonald M.J. Tang J. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Islet homogenate (5 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of reaction buffer (2 mmol/liter Na3-ATP, 2.5 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 100 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 8 mmol/liter pyruvate, 0.2 mmol/liter acetyl-CoA, 2 μCi of [14C]NaHCO3) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by liquid scintillation counting. Malate dehydrogenase was measured as described previously (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (100) were homogenized in 100 μl of 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mmol/liter sucrose, 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 mmol/liter cysteine, 0.02% BSA. Extract (10 μl) was added to 0.82 ml of 0.12 mol/liter glycine, pH 10, 100 μl of 0.85 mol/liter l-malate, pH 7, 67 μl of 37.5 mmol/liter NAD. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 20 min. Malic enzyme was measured as described previously (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (100) were sonicated in 100 μl of 50 mmol/liter triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 3 mmol/liter MnCl2, 0.02% BSA. Extract (50 μl) or NADPH standard (1–12 nmol) was added to 0.95 ml of prewarmed reaction buffer (50 mmol/liter triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 3 mmol/liter MnCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.1 mmol/liter NADP, 1 mmol/liter l-malate at 37 °C). Fluorescence was measured for 20 min at excitation 340 nm and emission 420 nm. Metabolites—Following the 48-h culture and 30-min preincubation, islets were incubated 60 min at 37 °C in prewarmed and oxygenated KRB that contained the stated glucose concentrations in the text or figure, followed by biochemical analysis. Glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) concentration was measured as described previously (25Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Islets underwent rapid lysis after the 60-min incubation using 10 μl of 40 mmol/liter NaOH and were placed on ice for 10 min; then 3 μl of 0.15 mol/liter HCl was added with incubation at 75 °C for 20 min to destroy cellular enzymes to ensure stability of the Glc-6-P. Extract (20 islets) was added to 15 μl of reaction buffer (0.15 mol/liter Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 20 μmol/liter NADP, 0.02 units/ml grade 1 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated for 30 min at 28 °C in a shaking water bath followed by addition of 4 μl of 1 mol/liter NaOH and incubation at 75 °C for 20 min to destroy any remaining NADP. The formed NADPH was amplified by the cycling method by adding 100 μl of reagent (9 units/ml type II glutamate dehydrogenase, 5 mmol/liter α-ketoglutaric acid, 1 mmol/liter Glc-6-P, 6 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) for 60 min at 38 °C, followed by heating to 100 °C for 10 min to stop the reaction. A sample (100 μl) was transferred to a UV cuvette containing 1 ml of 0.006 units/ml 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in 0.15 mol/liter Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 30 μmol/liter NADP, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 30 mmol/liter ammonium acetate, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and let stand at room temperature for 30 min. The formed 6-phosphogluconate was measured by fluorometer at 340 nm excitation and 420 nm emission, and islet Glc-6-P concentration was determined from Glc-6-P standards (1–20 pmol). Malate and pyruvate were measured as described previously (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (300) were lysed in 150 μl of 2 mol/liter perchloric acid on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatant was neutralized with 3 mol/liter KHCO3 and recentrifuged at 12,000 × g. Malate and pyruvate standards were prepared in perchloric acid. 50 μl of extract or malate standard (0.1–1 nmol) was added to 250 μl of reaction buffer (20 mmol/liter 2-amino-2-methyl propanol, pH 9.9, 2 mmol/liter glutamate, 50 μmol/liter NAD, 1 μg of aspartate aminotransferase, 2.5 μg of malate dehydrogenase) for 20 min at 30 °C. Nonmetabolized NAD was removed by addition of 0.25 ml of potassium phosphate, pH 11.9, and incubation at 60 °C for 15 min, followed by addition of 12 μl of 1 mol/liter imidazole and another 15 min at 60 °C. Fluorescence was measured at excitation 340 nm and emission 465 nm. 30 μl of extract or pyruvate standard (20–200 pmol of sodium pyruvate) was added to 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mmol/liter imidazole, pH 7, 0.6 mmol/liter ascorbate, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 6 μmol/liter NADH, 0.125 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) at room temperature for 20 min. Nonmetabolized NADH was removed by addition of 20 μl of 2 n HCl at room temperature for 30 min followed by 1 ml of 6 n NaOH for 10 min at 60 °C. Fluorescence was measured at excitation 360 nm and emission 460 nm. Oxaloacetate was measured as described previously (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (50) were lysed 20 min in 40 μl of 0.25 mol/liter perchloric acid at –20 °C followed by sonication and addition of 20 μl of 0.94 mol/liter KOH. Extract (30 μl) or oxaloacetate standard in perchloric acid (0.2–2.0 pmol) was added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (75 mmol/liter K2PO4, pH 7.4, 80 nmol/liter [acetyl-3H]acetyl-CoA, 50 μg/ml citrate synthase) at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by 600 μl of charcoal mixture (8 g of charcoal, 38 g of citric acid monohydrate, 120 ml of 95% ethanol) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant. Citrate concentration was measured as described previously (26Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Islets (200) were lysed with trichloroacetic acid and placed on ice followed by centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins. Supernatant was neutralized by ether extraction five times, lyophilized, and resolubilized in 100 μl of H2O. Extract (20 μl) or citrate standard (0.1–2 nmol) was added to 0.1 mol/liter Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 40 μmol/liter ZnCl2, 3 μmol/liter NADH, 0.4 μg/ml malate dehydrogenase (final volume of 0.5 ml). Fluorescence was determined at 340 nm excitation and 465 nm emission, and then the measurements were repeated 5 min after adding 10 μl of citrate lyase solution, with the Δ value representing the citrate content. Islet Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Secretion—Glucose utilization and oxidation were determined with d-[5-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose as described previously (32Hosokawa H. Corkey B.E. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Experiments were also performed with [6-14C]glucose and [3,4-14C]glucose based on the principle that the 6-isomer enters the citric acid cycle as [2-14C]acetyl-CoA by way of PDH, whereas the 3,4-isomer reflects pyruvate metabolism through both PDH and PC (33Schuit F.

Insulin secretion was measured in duplicate vials of 10 islets following the 60-min incubation in KRB, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% BSA, glucose (2.8, 8.3, and 16.7 mm) at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Islets were sedimented by gentle centrifugation, and insulin in the medium was measured by insulin radioimmunoassay. Islet insulin content was measured post-sonication and -extraction in acid ethanol. Malate Release from Isolated Mitochondria—The method is previously described (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial isolation, islets (400) were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 5 mmol/liter potassium HEPES, pH 7.5, 230 mmol/liter mannitol, 70 mmol/liter sucrose, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclear and cell debris, followed by recentrifugation of the supernatant at 5,500 × g for 10 min to sediment the mitochondria. The sedimented mitochondria were resuspended in 120 μl of ice-cold buffer (5 mmol/liter potassium HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mmol/liter K2PO4, 5 mmol/liter KHCO3, 2 mmol/liter Na2ADP, 230 mmol/liter mannitol, 70 mmol/liter sucrose, with or without 10 mmol/liter pyruvate) and kept on ice. Malate release was measured using the method of MacDonald (10MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was placed at 37 °C, and 50-μl samples were taken at 0 and 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min followed by addition of 15 μl of 0.92 m perchloric acid to the supernatant, return of the pH to 7.0 with 1 mol/liter KOH, and recentrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. Malate was measured using the method of Sener et al. (34Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Dufrane S.P. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Supernatant (40 μl) or malate standard (0–30 pmol) was added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (100 mmol/liter Tris/KCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmol/liter NAD, 0.2 mmol/liter [3H]acetyl-CoA, 20 μg/ml malate dehydrogenase from pig heart, 60 μg/ml citrate synthase from pig heart) at room temperature for 60 min. The final product of [3H]citrate was separated with 600 μl of charcoal mixture (120 ml of 95% ethanol, 8 g of charcoal, 38 g of citrate acid monohydrate) and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min followed by liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant. Data Presentation—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by the unpaired Student's t test. Effects of 48-h High Glucose Culture on Islet Glucose Metabolism—Islet protein (0.73 ± 0.01 ng/islet in normal glucose-cultured islets versus 0.72 ± 0.01 ng/islet in high glucose-cultured islets, n = 4, p = NS), DNA (21 ± 1 ng/islet in normal glucose-cultured islets versus 20 ± 1 ng/islet in high glucose-cultured islets, n = 5, p = NS), and insulin (33 ± 5 ng/islet in normal glucose-cultured islets versus 31 ± 5 μg/islet in high glucose-cultured islets, n = 6, p = NS) contents were unchanged by the high glucose culture. We (35Chen C. Hosokawa H. Bumbalo L.M. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and others (30Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) have reported that islet glucokinase expression and activity are increased by long term exposure to high glucose. As expected, this effect was noted in this study (glucokinase Vmax of 11.7 ± 0.9 mol of glucose/kg of DNA/90 min in high glucose-cultured islets versus 5.6 ± 0.5 mol of glucose/kg of DNA/90 min in normal glucose-cultured islets, p < 0.001; glucokinase Km of 18.8 ± 3.9 mmol/liter glucose in high glucose-cultured islets versus 13.0 ± 0.5 mmol/liter glucose in normal glucose-cultured islets, p = NS; hexokinase Vmax of 3.8 ± 0.5 mol of glucose/kg of DNA/90 min in high glucose-cultured islets versus 3.6 ± 0.3 mol of glucose/kg of DNA/90 min in normal glucose-cultured islets, p = NS; hexokinase Km of 0.08 ± 0.02 mmol/liter glucose in high glucose-cultured islets versus 0.10 ± 0.01 mmol/liter glucose in normal glucose-cultured islets, p = NS; n = 4). It is also well known that chronic high glucose increases gene expression and consequently activity of phosphofructokinase (26Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L.

These dual effects resulted in no change in the regulation of the Glc-6-P concentration in the high glucose-cultured islets as shown in Fig. 1; the Glc-6-P concentrations of both groups of cultured islets were identical after the 60-min incubations at 5.5 and 16.7 mmol/liter glucose. Islet glucose utilization (Fig. 2A) and glucose oxidation (Fig. 2B) were also measured. The high glucose-cultured islets had increases at 8.3 and 27.7 mmol/liter glucose compared with the normal glucose-cultured islets, with the -fold increase for utilization being 40–50% versus more than a doubling for oxidation. PDH Activity—The high glucose culture lowered active PDH Vmax by 65% (Fig. 3A). This effect was substantially prevented by co-culture with triacsin C. A time course study in Fig. 3B showed an increase in PDH activity after 2 h of 16.7 mmol/liter glucose that was back to base line at 6 h and then subnormal at 24 and 48 h. Pyruvate Metabolism—In contrast to PDH, the Vmax of PC was only minimally lowered by the high glucose culture (83% of control islets) (Table I). Our prediction based on our studies of lowered islet PDH activity associated with excess fatty acids (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L.

This shuttle consists of mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by PC, conversion to malate by malate dehydrogenase, and malate export to the cytoplasm followed by malic enzyme conversion back to pyruvate. We tested our prediction by measuring activities of these enzymes, concentrations of the metabolites, and malate efflux from isolated mitochondria.Table IEnzyme activities in 48-h high glucose-cultured (16.7 mmol/liter) and normal glucose-cultured (5.5 mmol/liter) rat isletsPyruvate carboxylaseMalate dehydrogenaseMalic enzymenmol/min/mgpmol/min/isletpmol/min/isletNormal glucose-cultured islets (4)23 ± 1393 ± 178.0 ± 0.3High glucose-cultured islets (4)19 ± 1456 ± 2711.1 ± 1.1p value0.012NS0.033 Open table in a new tab In the high glucose-cultured islets, malate dehydrogenase activity was unchanged, and malic enzyme Vmax was 40% increased compared with the normal glucose-cultured islets (Table I).

In Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing GIRK channels, membrane stretch induced by 50% reduction of osmotic pressure caused a prompt reduction of GIRK1/4, GIRK1, and GIRK4 currents by 16.6-42.6%. Comparable GIRK current reduction was produced by protein kinase C (PKC) activation (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate).

Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The KACh channels are stimulated by M2 receptor activation in response to parasympathetic stimulation, which leads to the hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and results in a decreased heart rate (2Sui J.L.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to this canonical activating pathway, molecules such as Gβγ, intracellular Na+, and Mg2+ also activate the GIRK channels by strengthening the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) interaction with the channels (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). PIP2 has been shown to directly interact with the C terminus of the GIRK channels and activate the channels as a membrane-delimited second messenger (5Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). GIRK channels have also been shown to be modulated by other factors such as mechanical stretch (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (PKC) (3Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although an involvement of PIP2 is not known. Mechanical stimuli alter the electrophysiological properties of the heart. This mechanoelectrical feedback plays important roles in regulating cardiac function (8Lab M.J. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Lab M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For example, the atria act as volume sensors and regulate heart rate, such that distension of the right atria or stretch of the sinoatrial node increases the heart rate and causes the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (10Bolter C.P. Wilson S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1112-R1117PubMed Google Scholar, 11Arai A. Kodama I. Toyama J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1726-H1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathophysiological conditions such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, these mechanoelectrical feedback mechanisms sometimes lead to arrhythmias (12Van den Berg M.P. Tuinenburg A.E.

Bull. 2001; 59: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, Ji et al. (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GIRK channels, which are localized in the atrium and the sinoatrial node, are mechanosensitive, and have suggested that the mechanosensitivity of KACh channels contributes to the mechanoelectrical feedback of the atria (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanisms as to how the GIRK channels sense the stretch of the membrane have not been clarified. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels, the effects of PKC, PIP2, integrin, and cytoskeletal elements on the mechanosensitivity have been studied in the Xenopus oocyte heterologous expression system and in rabbit atrial myocytes. Here we present evidence that the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels depends on their direct interaction with PIP2, which can be modulated by PKC probably through PIP2 hydrolysis via PLC. Mutagenesis and cRNA Synthesis—Chimeras between GIRK4 and IRK1 were constructed using two-step PCR (14Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 373A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cDNA constructs were linearized and cRNAs were produced using an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). The GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC)-δ (PHD-GFP) cDNA was subcloned into a modified pYES2 vector for expression in oocytes. Channel Expression in Oocytes and Current Recording—Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion with collagenase, and the follicular membrane was removed mechanically by fine forceps. Stage IV-V oocytes were injected with 1-2 ng of cRNAs. The ratio of Gβγ cRNAs co-injected with GIRK channels was 1:5 (Gβγ/GIRK = 0.2) unless otherwise specified. Electrophysiological studies were conducted 2-6 days after injection. Whole cell currents were measured with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique at room temperature as described previously (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes contained 3 m KCl with a resistance of 0.3-1.0 MΩ. The currents were elicited in response to voltage steps between -140 ∼ +20 mV with a holding potential at -20 mV (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Atrial Myocyte Isolation and Current Recording—Japanese white rabbits were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and the hearts were excised after being heparinized. Single atrial myocytes were isolated enzymatically as described previously (15Lu Z. Kamiya K. Opthof T. Yasui K. Kodama I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded in modified Tyrode solution using standard techniques. Patch pipettes had a resistance of 3-5 MΩ after being filled with an internal solution. Solutions and Chemicals—Xenopus oocytes were kept in ND96(-) solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3-7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Whole cell currents were recorded in KD98 solution containing 98 mm KCl, 2 mm KOH, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with MES). Current recordings from rabbit atrial myocytes were performed in external solution consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Tetrodotoxin (0.02 mm) and nifedipine (0.01 mm) were added to the solution to block INa and ICa,L. Internal pipette solution contained 150 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except RGD peptide (GRGDSP, Invitrogen). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), staurosporine, calphostin C, cytochalasin D, and phalloidin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Final concentrations of Me2SO in the recording chamber were less than 0.1% and had no effects on the GIRK, IRK1, and KACh channel activity. Hypo-osmotic Challenge—For Xenopus oocytes, normal osmotic external solution contained 50 mm KCl and 100 mm sucrose (200 mosmol). Hypo-osmotic challenge (100 mosmol) was induced by removal of sucrose for 15-30 min. This procedure caused substantial cell swelling, resulting in a significant increase of oocyte diameter by 6.7 ± 1.2% (n = 10, p < 0.05). For Chinese hamster ovary cells, normal osmotic external solution contained 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 225 mm mannitol (300 mosmol). Hypo-osmotic challenge (225 mosmol) was induced by removal of mannitol. Confocal Microscopy—PHD-GFP was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells by cRNA injection and transient DNA transfection, respectively. The oocytes or cells were placed in a small chamber on a glass coverslip and placed on a stage of inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (TE2000 and C1, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A 1-μm section of an oocyte or a 0.3-μm section of a cell was imaged using a ×40 objective lens. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences were analyzed with Student's paired or unpaired t test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Mechanosensitivity of GIRK Channels—Because native atrial KACh channels are heteromeric proteins consisting of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (1Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), we first examined the mechanosensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/4 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Co-expression of GIRK1, GIRK4 (GIRK1/GIRK4 = 1), and Gβγ (Gβγ/GIRK = 0.2) in oocytes led to large basal currents of strong inward rectification through the persistent activation by Gβγ. As shown in Fig. 1, hypo-osmotic challenge led to a significant decrease in the current amplitude of the GIRK1/4 current by 22.8 ± 4.5% (n = 6, p < 0.05), reaching its lowest point 20-30 min after the start of the perfusion of hypo-osmotic solution. This is consistent with a previous report by Ji et al. (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GIRK1/4 currents recovered to initial values after the solution was returned to normal osmotic solution. In control experiments, we showed that another member of the Kir family, IRK1 (Kir2.1), was not affected by hypo-osmotic challenge (Fig. 1). In addition, non-injected oocytes did not show any change of the current amplitude in response to the hypo-osmotic challenge (data not shown). We next applied the hypo-osmotic challenge to homomeric GIRK1 and GIRK4 channels that were separately expressed. Because the GIRK1 subunit has been reported not to form functional channels by itself when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16Ivanina T. Neusch C. Li Y.X. Tong Y. Labarca C. Mosher D.F. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the mutant GIRK1(F137S) was used to make functional homomeric GIRK1 channels (17Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The extent of current reduction by hypo-osmotic challenge was significantly greater in the GIRK4 channel (42.6 ± 8.4%, n = 8, p < 0.01) than in the GIRK1 channel (16.6 ± 6.2%, n = 11, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). These results indicate that both GIRK4 and GIRK1 subunits play important roles in the mechanosensitivity of the GIRK1/4 channels. PKC Activation Mediates Mechanosensitivity—We investigated whether membrane stretch inhibits GIRK currents via a PKC-dependent pathway. When the PKC activator, PMA, was added to the external bath solution for 3 min, the homomeric GIRK4 current decreased by 46.7 ± 4.8% (n = 4, p < 0.01), reaching a plateau level at ∼30 min. Homomeric GIRK1-(F137S) and heteromeric GIRK1/4 showed similar PKC sensitivity (inhibited by PMA, respectively, by 44.7 ± 2.1%, n = 10, p < 0.01, and 45.5 ± 1.8%, n = 8, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). For control experiments, PMA was added to oocytes expressing IRK1; the IRK1 current was insensitive to PKC activation (Fig. 2A) as has been previously described by Henry et al. (18Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Preincubation of oocytes with staurosporine (1 μm), a nonspecific PKC inhibitor, for 12-24 h prevented the mechanosensitivity of the GIRK4 channel (Fig. 2B). Calphostin C (2 μm), a specific PKC inhibitor, gave similar results to staurosporine (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that PKC activation is intimately involved in the mechanosensitive gating of GIRK channels. We also examined if PMA-induced and mechanical stretch-induced inhibitions of homomeric GIRK4 channels are additive (Fig. 2, C and D). In the oocyte challenged initially by hypo-osmotic challenge, the current was reduced by 43 ± 6.2% (n = 8, p < 0.05), reaching to a plateau level at 20-30 min. Additional application of PMA (1 μm) resulted in a further significant current reduction; the current was reduced finally by 54 ± 4.8% from the baseline (n = 8, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, initial exposure to 1 μm PMA resulted in the current reduction by 58 ± 3% (n = 3, p < 0.05), and additional application of hypo-osmotic challenge caused no further current reduction (Fig. 2D). Channel-PIP2 Interaction Is Critical for Mechanosensitivity—PIP2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of GIRK channels: regulatory molecules such as Gβγ and Na+ activate GIRK channels by strengthening the interaction of the channel with PIP2 (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although both GIRK1/4 and IRK1 channels are modulated by PIP2 (19Rohacs T. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36065-36072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), GIRK channels possess weaker PIP2 affinity than IRK1, such that GIRK can be more readily modulated by Gβγ, and intracellular Na+ and Mg2+ (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We predicted that the difference in the strength of PIP2 interaction with the channel subunit might be responsible for the differential responses of GIRK and IRK1 channels to PKC activators and to the hypo-osmotic challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated that arginine (Arg225 and Arg235) and isoleucine (Ile229) residues in the proximal C terminus of GIRK are critical for the interaction with PIP2 (Fig. 3). Replacement of these residues with the corresponding regions of IRK1 was shown to strengthen the channel-PIP2 interaction (20Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To test whether these regions are responsible for the mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity, we swapped the region spanning Arg225-Arg235 in GIRK4 with the corresponding region of IRK1, and replaced Ile229 in GIRK4 with the corresponding residue from IRK1, namely leucine. The resultant chimera and mutant were designated as GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) (Fig. 3). Both of GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) channels expressed alone (without Gβγ subunits) in oocytes had larger basal current with strong inward rectification compared with GIRK4 channels co-expressed with Gβγ. If the channel expression levels are similar, the larger basal current can be because of stronger channel-PIP2 interaction (Fig. 4A). The mechanosensitivity was abolished almost completely in the GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) and GIRK4(I229L) channels (Fig. 4B). Similar results (relatively large basal currents and a loss of mechanosensitivity) were also obtained when these chimera and mutant channels were co-expressed with Gβγ (data not shown). We next constructed a reverse chimera of IRK1 by swapping the PIP2-interacting region of GIRK4. The reverse chimera, IRK1-GIRK4(Lys214-Leu252) showed no appreciable basal current (Fig. 4A). Thus, we made single and double points mutants of IRK1 by replacing residues of IRK1 with the corresponding residues of GIRK4. The reverse single point mutants of the IRK1 channel (IRK1(L222I) and IRK1(R213Q)) showed relatively large basal currents (Fig. 4A). Those single point mutants, however, did not gain mechanosensitivity (Fig. 4C). A single point mutation might have been insufficient to modulate the IRK1 channel properties. We, therefore, further constructed a reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), to obtain a greater modification of the channel-PIP2 interaction. The double mutant channel demonstrated strong inward rectifying basal currents with amplitude comparable with GIRK4 channel co-expressed with Gβγ (Fig. 4A). The double mutant current was significantly inhibited by hypo-osmotic challenge (by 33 ± 7%), although the time course of inhibition was slower than that of wild-type GIRK4 (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of Gβγ Attenuates Mechanosensitivity—Gβγ can directly interact with GIRK channels and stabilize the interaction with PIP2, inducing channel activation (5Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). If the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels is dependent on channel-PIP2 interaction, as we have presented above, then Gβγ overexpression might decrease or block the mechanosensitivity. We therefore co-expressed excess Gβγ with wild-type GIRK4 channels (the ratio of Gβγ/GIRK4 was increased from 0.2 to 18.0). As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of Gβγ attenuated the current reduction by hypo-osmotic challenge from 42.6 ± 8.4 to 14 ± 4.3% (n = 6, p < 0.05). In the meantime, the overexpression of Gβγ had no significant effects on the current reduction in response to PMA (1 μm) (data not shown). Channel-PIP2 Interaction and PKC Sensitivity—To clarify the relationship between the PKC pathway and the channel-PIP2 interaction, we examined the effects of PMA on the chimera and mutant channels in which the strength of PIP2 binding had been modified. As shown in Fig. 6A, the GIRK4(I229L) and the GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245), which are predicted to have stronger PIP2 affinity than wild-type GIRK4, had significantly less PKC sensitivity; the current reduction at 30 min for GIRK4(I229L) (by 29 ± 2.0%, n = 4) and the corresponding value for GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245) (by 18 ± 1.8% n = 6) were both significantly less than wild-type GIRK4 (by 42.6 ± 8.4%, n = 8) (p < 0.05). The time course of current inhibition was also slower in these chimera and mutant channels. Moreover, the reverse single point mutants, IRK1(L222I) and IRK1(R213Q), which presumably have weaker PIP2 affinity than wild-type IRK1, gained PKC sensitivity of a slower time course (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the reverse double point mutant, IRK1(L222I/R213Q), was inhibited by PKC activation as rapidly as wild-type GIRK4. These data suggest that PKC sensitivity depends on the strength of the channel-PIP2 interaction. How Does PKC Activation Modify Channel-PIP2 Interaction?—Two hypotheses were investigated; first, that PKC phosphorylates the GIRK channels directly, thereby altering the channel interaction with PIP2, and second, that PKC activation regulates PIP2 metabolism via other factors. Previous reports suggested that PIP2 levels in the cell membrane are regulated by PKC activity through a modulation of synthesis via phosphatidylinositol kinase and phosphatase (21Nasuhoglu C.

Wijayaratnam A.P. Gleeson P. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Mitchell C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9376-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or a modulation of hydrolysis via PLC (23Boon A.M. Beresford B.J. Mellors A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of direct channel phosphorylation, we examined the mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity in the mutant GIRK4 channels in which potential PKC phosphorylation sites were mutated. GIRK4 possesses five consensus PKC phosphorylation sites of the (S/T)-X-(R/K) sequence (Fig. 3) (25Woodgett J.R. Gould K.L. Hunter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The five single point mutants in which serine or threonine was replaced with alanine, or the mutant in which all five phosphorylation sites were abolished, still retained PKC sensitivity in terms of the PMA-induced current reduction comparable with wild-type GIRK4, although GIRK4(S233A) and the quintuple mutant yielded small basal currents (Fig. 7, A and B). The current reduction in response to hypo-osmotic challenge (mechanosensitivity) was also well preserved in all the six mutant channels (Fig. 7C). These observations suggest that the PKC-dependent regulation of the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels may not be attributed to direct phosphorylation of the channels. We next examined the role of PIP2 hydrolysis by using a PH domain of PLC-δ tagged with green fluorescent protein (PHD-GFP). Because PHD-GFP binds specifically to both inositol triphosphate and PIP2, it provides a relative rather than an absolute measurement of changes in plasma membrane PIP2 levels (26Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Quantification of the membrane localization would also be limited under the condition causing a substantial change of membrane shape. Despite such limitations, however, the technique will provide useful information to estimate the extent and time course of PIP2 hydrolysis (30Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Fig. 8A displays confocal images from Xenopus oocytes expressing PHD-GFP. PHD-GFP localized to the plasma membrane, where it is bound to PIP2 under the control condition (Fig. 8A, left upper panel). Hypo-osmotic challenge applied to the oocyte resulted in appreciable translocation of the PHD-GFP signal to the cytoplasm within 5 min, allowing direct observation of PIP2 hydrolysis to inositol triphosphate (Fig. 8A, right upper panel). Treatment of another oocyte with 1 μm PMA caused similar rapid translocation of GFP signal from the cell membrane to cytoplasm within 5 min (Fig. 8A, left lower panel). When hypo-osmotic challenge was applied to the oocyte preincubated with 1 μm staurosporine for 12 h, it did not cause a substantial change of the membrane-limited localization of PHD-GFP signal (Fig. 8A, right lower panel). Fig. 8B summarizes the quantitative data of the relative fluorescence in the membrane versus the cytosol. The fluorescence ratio was reduced significantly by 35 ± 2.5% with hypo-osmotic challenge (n = 3) and by 38 ± 4% (n = 3) with 1 μm PMA (p < 0.05). In the oocytes preincubated with staurosporine, however, the fluorescence ratio was unaffected by hypo-osmotic challenge (n = 3). Similar prevention of PHD-GFP translocation in response to the hypo-osmotic challenge was obtained in the oocytes preincubated with 2 μm calphostin C, a specific PKC inhibitor (data not shown). These results suggest that hypo-osmotic challenge enhances PIP2 hydrolysis via PLC, and PKC activation is involved in the phenomenon. The consequent PIP2 reduction in the membrane would prevent GIRK channel activation. Membrane stretch may enhance PIP2 hydrolysis not only in amphibian oocytes but also in mammalian cells. To confirm this issue, we applied hypo-osmotic challenge to Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with PHD-GFP. Rapid translocation of GFP signals in response to hypo-osmotic challenge and its reversal upon resumption of the osmotic pressure were recognized (Fig. 8C). Actin-Cytoskeleton Is Involved in Mechanosensitivity—To evaluate whether cytoskeletal interactions are involved in the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels, oocytes were preincubated for 4-12 h with compounds affecting actin polymerization. In oocytes preincubated with cytochalasin D (10 μm), which induces actin depolymerization and disrupts the cytoskeleton (27Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Mason H.S. Latten M.J. Godoy L.D. Horowitz B. Kenyon J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the hypo-osmotic challenge caused a less prominent (by 33 ± 3.2%, n = 3, p < 0.05) and a slower inhibition of GIRK4 currents than in untreated control oocytes (by 42.6 ± 8.4%, n = 8) (Fig. 9A). Preincubation with phalloidin (20 μm), which induces actin polymerization and stabilizes the cytoskeleton (27Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Mason H.S. Latten M.J. Godoy L.D. Horowitz B. Kenyon J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), also attenuated the mechanosensitivity of GIRK4 currents compared with untreated control oocytes from 42.6 ± 8.4 to 21.4 ± 1.6% (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 9B). These observations indicate that cytoskeleton might either be directly involved in the mechanosensitivity of the GIRK channel, or modulate the translocation of PKC, thereby indirectly affecting the mechanosensitivity of the channel. Integrin, a transmembrane protein, is suggested to be a mechanosensor that transmits mechanical signals to the cytoskeleton (29Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). In the present study, we also examined the influence of integrin on the mechanosensitivity of the GIRK channel. For mutation in the RGD motif (the recognition sequence of integrin for other proteins), GIRK4(R115K) did not affect the mechanosensitivity of GIRK4 channel (Fig. 9C). In addition, the application of RGD peptide (GRGDSP, 100 μm), which completely inhibits integrin binding to the RGD motif in other proteins (24Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), did not change the mechanosensitivity of GIRK4 channels (Fig. 9D). Involvement of PKC Activation in the Mechanosensitivity of KACh Channels in Native Atrial Myocytes—Whole cell currents were recorded from isolated rabbit atrial myocytes by using a patch clamp technique at a holding potential of -100 mV (Fig. 10). Positive pressure (10 cmH2O) was applied to the myocyte through the patch electrode to induce membrane stretch as described previously (6Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The positive pressure did not affect the basal current. Application of carbachol (CCh, 10 μm) to the external solution gave rise to a large inward current. Positive pressure (for 30 s) applied in the presence of CCh caused a prompt reduction of the inward current (by 25 ± 3%, n = 4), and the effect was reversible upon removal of the pressure (Fig. 10A). The CCh-induced current was abolished by external application of 5 mm Ba2+, which is known to block KACh channels. The current in the presence of both 10 μm CCh and 5 mm Ba2+ was unaffected by positive pressure. External application of 500 nm PMA (for 1 min) also caused a reduction of the CCh-induced inward current (by 41 ± 4%, n = 3); the onset of current reduction was slow and the change was not reversed upon removal of PMA (Fig. 10B) like the effects of PMA on the GIRK channels expressed in oocytes (Fig. 2A). In atrial myocytes pretreated with 500 nm staurosporine (30 min application to the external solution), positive pressure (10 cmH2O) caused only a minimal reduction of the CCh-induced inward current (by 8 ± 3%, n = 6) (Fig. 10C), and the change was significantly less than that without pretreatment (Fig. 10D). Positive pressure applied to the myocytes after elimination of the CCh-induced current by 5 mm Ba2+ had no effect (Fig. 10C). A similar inhibition by positive pressure was observed in the atrial myocytes pretreated by direct application of 100 nm staurosporine to the pipette solution (data not shown). These results indicate that PKC plays an important role in the mechanosensitivity of KACh channels in native atrial myocytes. The present study is the first report to define the molecular basis for the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels. We have found that PKC and PIP2 play important roles in regulating the mechanosensitivity of GIRK channels. PKC activation may cause a reduction of membrane PIP2 content, giving rise to an inhibition of channel-PIP2 interaction required for the GIRK channel activity. The involvement of PKC in the mechanosensitivity of KACh channels was also confirmed in native atrial myocytes. Our data seem to indicate that integrin is not involved in the inhibition of GIRK by mechanical stretch via a classical RGD motif, although we cannot exclude a possible integrin binding via an atypical motif (16Ivanina T. Neusch C. Li Y.X. Tong Y. Labarca C. Mosher D.F. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro experiments have implicated multiple signaling pathways in the cellular response to mechanical stretch, including PLC, PKC, and protein kinase A. In the mechanosensitivity of the GIRK channel, PKC is considered to be an essential molecule in the signal cascade for the following reasons. First, an inhibition of PKC by staurosporine or calphostin C prevented the hypo-osmotic challenge-induced GIRK4 current reduction almost completely. Second, the effects of hypo-osmotic challenge and PKC activation on the current amplitude were qualitatively parallel in the GIRK (wild-type, mutant, and chimera) channels employed in the present study. Third, PKC activation, like hypo-osmotic challenge, caused a rapid translocation of PHD-GFP signal from the cell membrane to the cytosol. Another key molecule is PIP2. Emerging evidence have indicated a novel mechanism for regulation of inward rectifying K+ channels via direct interaction with membrane phospholipids, PIP2 (5Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 30Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 31Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This direct interaction occurs between PIP2 and several positively charged residues in the proximal C termini of the channel (5Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and likely regulates channel opening by stabilizing the structure of the cytoplasmic entrance of the pore. PIP2 mediates the regulation of the GIRK channel by Gβγ, intracellular Na+ and Mg2+. Kobrinsky et al. (32Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported that receptor-regulated PIP2 hydrolysis (via M1 muscarinic receptor) causes desensitization of GIRK channels through a reduction of PIP2 content in the sarcolemma. Zhou et al. (33Zhou W. Arrabit C. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that local anesthetics inhibit the GIRK channel by antagonizing the channel-PIP2 interaction. We found that GIRK4 chimera (GIRK4-IRK1(Lys207-Leu245)) and mutant (GIRK4(I229L)) channels (with strengthened channel-PIP2 interaction) showed much less mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity compared with wild-type GIRK4 channels. In contrast, IRK1 gained the mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity by reverse double point mutation of the PIP2 binding domain (L221/R213Q) to weaken the channel-PIP2 interaction. These observations are concordant with the above mentioned scenario, suggesting a common PIP2 regulatory machinery of GIRK channel activation. In the present study, mutagenesis of the five consensus PKC phosphorylation sites in GIRK4 channels did not inhibit the mechanosensitivity and PKC sensitivity. Accordingly, PKC activation may not modulate the channel-PIP2 interaction by direct GIRK channel phosphorylation. Our experiments using Xenopus oocytes expressing PHD-GFP have shown that hypo-osmotic challenge or PMA application caused a prompt translocation of GFP signals from the cell membrane to the cytosol, indicating PIP2 hydrolysis by the stimuli. In addition, the hypo-osmotic challenge-induced PHD-GFP translocation was prevented by PKC inhibitors (staurosporine and calphostin C). It seems reasonable to speculate from these observations that an activation of PKC in response to membrane stretch may enhance PIP2 hydrolysis, and the consequent reduction of membrane PIP2 content would prevent the GIRK channel-PIP2 interaction. Zeng et al. (34Zeng W.Z. Li X.J. Hilgemann D.W. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16852-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing ROMK1 and muscarinic (M1) receptors that an activation of PKC inhibits the channel in association with a reduction of 32P-labeled PIP2 content in the membrane. The signaling pathways upstream of the PKC activation in response to membrane stretch remain unknown. Mechanical stretch might activate PLC first, and in turn cleave PIP2 into diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. Diacylglycerol and Ca2+ then activate PKC. In this case, PKC will make a positive-feedback circuit by enhancing the PIP2 hydrolysis, and play a role of signal amplifier. PKC activation can also reduce the membrane PIP2 content by regulation of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (35van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and regulation of activity and location of lipid phosphatases and/or lipid kinases (21Nasuhoglu C.

The molecular identity of lipid kinases and phosphatases regulating the PIP2 metabolism remain controversial. Our findings may have clinical implications, because some hereditary diseases have been reported to be the result of genetic mutations affecting Kir channel-PIP2 interaction. Lopes et al. (37Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) recently found that mutations in IRK1 (R218Q and R218W), which alter Kir channel-PIP2 interaction, are associated with Anderson's syndrome, a disease characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features (36Plaster N.M.

Subramony S.H. Wolfe G. Fu Y.H. Ptacek L.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Also ROMK1 mutations at Arg312, which decrease the affinity for PIP2, are associated with the antenatal variant of Bartter's syndrome, a disease characterized by polyhydramnios, premature delivery, hypokalemic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria (37Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To date, clinical conditions associated with alterations in PIP2 interaction with GIRK4 have not been identified to our knowledge. We should be careful in extrapolating the present results to the native GIRK channels in the heart, because compositions of membrane phospholipids and intracellular regulating molecules are different between Xenopus oocytes and cardiac myocytes.

Its constituent, organized structures are polymeric microtubules, actin microfilaments, and intermediate filaments (2Porter K. J.

Within the set of microtubule assembling proteins, tau is of particular interest. In healthy neurons, tau, through its control of the reversible polymerization of microtubules, participates in the extension of both axons and neuritic processes, also known as neural growth cone development, and in the development of neural polarity (3Trinczek B.

Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1996; 165: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the correlation between cognitive decline and the development of the tau neurofribrillary tangles. The progression of neural destruction in AD begins with loss or retraction of distal dendrites, accompanied by the formation of neuropil threads and an incipient neurofibrillary tangle in the soma, followed by loss of proximal dendrites, increased tau aggregation, and destruction of the soma (11Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1996; 165: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). One of the central questions regarding the development of AD and other tauopathies is the significance of the development of the neurofibrillary tangles. Are they merely markers of the progress of the disease, or are they, in fact, the causative agent of neuronal death (12Brandt R.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Lamoureux P. Buxbaum R. Heidemann S. Nature. 1989; 340: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This cytoskeletal tension is transmitted to binding sites in the inert extracellular matrix via transmembrane integrin receptors (16Sims J. Karp S. Ingber D. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1215-1222PubMed Google Scholar) and other focal adhesion proteins (17Turner C. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In fact, cell shape is controlled through a delicate balance of signal (18DiTella M. Feiguin F. Carri N. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and adhesive factors (19Mooney D. Langer R. Ingber D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the cytomatrix and the extracellular matrix. Cell adhesion substrates include extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens (19Mooney D. Langer R. Ingber D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gundersen R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 21: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The most abundant protein of the extracellular matrix is collagen I, a fibrillar triple helical protein that forms gel networks in irregular connective tissue (21Cleary E. Comper W.

J. 2003; 84: 1272-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Tau, like collagen I, is very hydrophilic (24Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and shares other characteristics; both are proline-rich and nonglobular, self-assemble into fibrils, and are found in vivo as several isoforms. The spectroscopic and electron microscopic results presented here demonstrate other common features of structure and behavior between collagen I and tau 2–19 peptide and full-length protein: precedence of a gel phase leading to fibril formation, the involvement of proline residues in weak hydrogen bonding of both the gel matrix and fibril, and a polyproline II secondary structure (PHFs). These results are discussed with respect to the cytoskeletal changes that might ensue from the generation of pathological intraneuronal compressive forces by a collagen-like gel and fibril (12Brandt R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lithium thiocyanate, glycerol, bovine skin gelatin type B, and insoluble bovine Achilles tendon collagen type I were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Peptide Synthesis—N-terminal tau 2–19 peptide (primary sequence AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTYG) and tau 309–326 (primary sequence VYKPVDLSKVTSKCGSLG), a segment from the tau protein pseudorepeat region, were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis methodology on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer at a 0.1 mm scale by the standard protocol for Fmoc chemistry (25Chan W. White P. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: The Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). The reagents piperidine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylpyrrolidine, dichloric methane, Fmoc amino acids, and preloaded resin and a HOBT/HBTU* activation kit were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Peptide resin was cleared and deprotected by a mixture of tetrafluoroacetic acid, water, phenol, and triisopropylsilane in a ratio of 88:5:5:2 for 2 h. The peptide was precipitated by ether, washed, and lyophilized. The peptide was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography (Voyager DE STR, PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a C8 reverse phase column (HP1090; Hewlett Packard Co.) and amino acid analysis (Hewlett Packard Amino Quant). For the C-terminally biotinylated tau 2–19, Fmoc ϵ-aminocaproic acid (Bachem California, Inc., Torrance, CA) was inserted as a biotin linker during automatic peptide synthesis. After deprotection, the Fmoc group resin was washed with Me2SO; 0.244 g (1 mmol) of (+)-biotin (Sigma) was dissolved in 5 ml of a 1:1 solution of dimethylformamide and Me2SO. To this was added 2.1 ml of a 0.45 m HOBT/HBTU activation solution and 3 ml of diethyl ether. The resulting activated biotin solution was added to 0.1 mmol of the Fmoc group resin and stirred overnight. The resulting resin was washed successively with a 1:1 solution of dimethylformamide and Me2SO plus dimethylformamide and dichloromethane to remove the excess biotin. The biotinylated resin was cleared as above. Preparation of Tau 2–19 Samples—Freeze-dried tau 2–19 was dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 6 mm and stored undisturbed at 4 °C for 5 years. The tau 2–19 was found to have gelled after this time; UVRR results were recorded on the undiluted gel. Typically, polyanions such as perchlorate (0.2 m) (26Dudik J. Johnson C. Asher S. J. Chem. Phys. 1985; 82: 1732-1740Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Hildebrandt P. Copeland R. Spiro T. Otlewski J. Laskowski M.J. Prendergast F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5426-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) are added as internal peak calibration standards in the acquisition of UVRR data. However, polyanions are known catalysts of in vitro PHF formation (28Perez M. Valpuesta J. Medina M. Montejo de Garcini E. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 29Kampers T. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), so an internal standard was not added to the aged tau 2–19 gel. The gel was cloudy after curing, so an absorption spectrum could not be recorded. When the gel was pipetted into a quartz tube, the gel became less viscous, exhibiting a gel phenomenon known as shear thinning; upon standing, the gel recovers its original viscosity (30Schneider J. Pochan D. Ozbas B. Rajagopal K. Pakstis L. Kretsinger J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 15030-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The gel was subsequently dissolved and diluted to 4 mm by the addition of a 100-μl aliquot of 9.1 m lithium thiocyanate. The UV laser beam (1.8 milliwatts) that was incident on the quartz NMR tube holding the dissolved tau 2–19 sample during the UVRR experiment caused the formation of a translucent tau film on the tube. The remaining tau solution was removed from the quartz tube, and UVRR results were recorded for the film alone. The tau film was found to be soluble in 3 m lithium thiocyanate solution. The tau 2–19 solution decanted from the quartz tube was spun at high speed (estimated as 1 kHz), and the resulting aggregated tau 2–19 was pelleted. The aggregate was resuspended in deionized water, and UVRR results were likewise recorded for it. A 10 mm solution of lyophilized tau 2–19 with biotin on the C terminus was freshly prepared in deionized water for UVRR spectroscopy. In trials to reproduce the UVRR results of the cured tau 2–19 gel on a shorter time scale, a fresh aliquot of lyophilized tau 2–19 was dissolved in deionized water at the gelation concentration of 10 mm and stored undisturbed at 4 °C. This aliquot gelled within 2 months. A UVRR spectrum of this gel was acquired periodically up to 9 months of age. Additional 10 mm tau 2–19 aliquots were subject to different treatments: 1) heating in a sealed ampule to 95 °C for 5 days; 2) vigorous stirring at room temperature for 19 h; 3) vigorous stirring followed by partial drying under a nitrogen stream; 4) adjusting the pH to 10.5; and 5) dissolution in 10 mm sodium chloride (31Lockwood N. van Tankeren R. Mayo K. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preparation of PHF Samples—Immunoaffinity-purified PHFs (32Jicha G. O'Donnell A. Weaver C. Angeletti R. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Vincent I. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2878-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) at 2 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4) were a gift of Dr. Peter Davies. PHFs dissolved in 9 m LiSCN were dialyzed exhaustively against distilled water and recovered as a solid by drying under a nitrogen gas stream at room temperature prior to incorporation in a KBr pellet. Additionally, it was found that PHFs dissolved in 9 m LiSCN, as for tau 2–19 in LiSCN, formed a translucent film when exposed to the UV laser beam. Preparation of Collagen Samples—Insoluble bovine collagen type I was suspended in Tris-buffered saline at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. A bovine skin gelatin gel was prepared by dissolution in deionized water and in D2O at a 50 mg/ml concentration at ∼60 °C with stirring. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy—Solid tau 2–19 samples, gel and aggregate, were transferred to grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The grids were then blotted dry before immediate observation in a JEOL 100CX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc.) at 80 kV. UVRR Spectroscopy—An argon ion laser system, described elsewhere (34Juszczak L. Hirsch R. Nagel R. Friedman J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar), was used to generate continuous wave, 228.9-nm light at an incident power of 1.8 milliwatts. The samples were chilled to 10 ± 4 °C, rastered, and spun in order to minimize UV-induced photodamage. The UVRR spectra are an average of a set of 3-min acquisitions, collected over an 805–1680-cm–1 frequency window; see Figs. 1, 6, and 7 for numbers of acquisitions. The frequency scale of each spectrum is calibrated against the peaks of two reference solvents, indene and toluene, and is accurate to ±1cm–1. The software program Grams/32 AI, version 6.00 (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH) was used to determine peak heights (full width at half-maximum) and for curve fits to complex bands. Fitting parameters were not restricted.Fig. 6UVRR spectra (229 nm).a, bovine skin gelatin prepared at 50 mg/ml in deionized water (three 3-min acquisitions); b, 2-month-old tau 2–19 gel prepared at 10 mm concentration in deionized water (one 3-min acquisition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7UVRR spectra (229 nm).a, bovine Achilles tendon collagen type I (25 mg/ml) suspended in Tris-buffered saline (three 3-min acquisitions); b, tau PHFs (2 mg/ml) suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 3-min acquisitions).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FTIR Spectroscopy—FTIR spectra were acquired on a Nicolet (Madison, WI) Magna 600 FTIR spectrometer. Samples were prepared either as potassium bromide pellets or as smears on zinc selenide windows. For the tau 2–19 samples, the peptide concentration was 10 mm in D2O. Protein samples embedded in KBr were not subjected to potentially denaturing high pressure, since the pellets were formed using a screw-type press, which allows only for pressures applicable by hand-held wrenches. The number of accumulated scans varied; instrumental resolution was set to 4 cm–1. UVRR Spectroscopy of Tau 2–19 Peptide Phases—UVRR results (229-nm excitation) for the 5-year-old tau 2–19 peptide in four different phases are given in Fig. 1. The spectral window has been truncated to the 1100–1680-cm–1 region, since the bands of interest are concentrated here. Fig. 1, spectrum a shows the UVRR results for 5-year-old, cured tau 2–19 gel, whereas results for solution phase tau 2–19 with the C-terminally linked biotin, which prevents aggregation, are given in Fig. 1, spectrum c. The UVRR difference spectrum between the cured gel (Fig. 1, spectrum a) and solution phase (Fig. 1, spectrum c) of tau 2–19 is given in Fig. 1, spectrum b, where the 1616-cm–1 peaks were normalized before spectral subtraction. The addition of lithium thiocyanate (final thiocyanate concentration = 3 m), a known disrupter of water structure (35Ostrovskii D. Jacobsson P. Nystrom B. Marstokk O. Kopperud H. Macromolecules. 1999; 32: 5552-5560Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), to the cured tau 2–19 gel yields a noncloudy liquid, implying tau dissolution. The UVRR spectrum for the thiocyanate solution of the cured tau 2–19 gel is given in Fig. 1, spectrum d. The UVRR result for the tau 2–19 aggregate, described under “Materials and Methods,” is given in Fig. 1, spectrum e. The result for the tau 2–19 film, also described above, is superimposable on those for the tau 2–19 aggregate (Fig. 1, spectrum e) and therefore is not shown. The peak frequency of the vibrational bands for the UVRR results of Fig. 1 are summarized in Table I. As expected for excitation at 229 nm, the solution phase UVRR spectrum for biotin-linked tau 2–19 in Fig. 1, spectrum c, exhibits strong vibrational bands for the single tyrosine residue: Y8a at 1616 cm–1 (ring C-C stretch), a Y8b shoulder at 1600 cm–1, Y9a at 1178 cm–1 (ring C- H bend), and Y7a at 1208 cm–1 (Cβ-Cγ stretch) (36Austin J.

Open table in a new tab The UVRR results for the cured, tau 2–19 gel in Fig. 1, spectrum a, display not only the aforementioned tyrosine peaks but also strongly (and unexpectedly) enhanced amide bands at 1238 cm–1 (CαH mode), 1298 cm–1 (amide III (Am III)), 1384 cm–1 (amide S), 1550 cm–1 (amide II (Am II)), and 1579 cm–1 (amide II) (36Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T. Clark R. Hester R. Biomolecular Spectroscopy. Part A. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993: 55-125Google Scholar, 40Wang Y. Purrello R. Georgiou S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6368-6377Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A very weakly enhanced imide II band at 1445 cm–1, due to a carbonyl stretching mode of the single proline, is also seen (41Takeuchi H. Harada I. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1990; 21: 509-515Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of this band is also not expected, since proline is resonantly enhanced at a shorter wavelength, ∼218 nm. The shoulder at 1218 cm–1 is an unassigned amide mode that has also been found in the UVRR spectrum (229 nm) of undiluted N-methylacetamide at –30 °C. 2L. J. Juszczak, unpublished data. The difference spectrum shown in Fig. 1, spectrum b, clarifies the amide band positions for the 5-year-old, cured tau gel results in Fig. 1, spectrum a. It also reveals a residual peak at 1600 cm–1, which is attributed to deprotonation of some unspecified population of tyrosines within the gel rather than to the single phenylalanine, because of the predominance of tyrosinate peaks in Fig. 1, spectra d and e, and the presence of a weak Y9a′ band at 1168 cm–1 (42Asher S. Ludwig M. Johnson C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3186-3197Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Fodor S. Copeland R. Grygon C. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509-5518Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The presence of tyrosinate also suggests that the 1579-cm–1 band contains a tyrosinate Y8b′ component (42Asher S. Ludwig M. Johnson C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3186-3197Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Fodor S. Copeland R. Grygon C. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509-5518Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 3The tyrosinate Y8b′ mode is reported (43Fodor S. Copeland R. Grygon C. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509-5518Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as occurring at 1558 cm-1, whereas the data therein show that it is actually at ∼1585 cm-1. The phenylalanine F8b mode is reported at 1593 cm-1, and the F8a is reported at 1604 cm-1 (42Asher S. Ludwig M. Johnson C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3186-3197Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar), whereas tyrosinate Y8a′ is reported at 1601 cm-1. Since the tyrosinate Y8b′ mode is very similar to the F8b mode, Y8b′ would therefore be expected at ∼1590 cm-1 and not at 1556 cm-1 as reported. The data therein show, in fact, a shoulder at ∼1590 cm-1 on the Y8a′ band. The 1218-cm–1 shoulder of Fig. 1, spectrum a, is revealed in the difference spectrum, spectrum b of Fig. 1. Amide I bands, which appear at or above a frequency of ∼1630 cm–1, are not seen (37Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark R. Hester R. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 113-175Google Scholar, 44Sugawara Y. Hirakawa A. Tsuboi M. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1984; 108: 206-214Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The addition of lithium thiocyanate to the cloudy, cured tau 2–19 gel resulted in a clear solution and yielded the UVRR results shown in Fig. 1, spectrum d. The spectrum is now less complex; tyrosine bands are now shifted to tyrosinate positions. The Y8a′ band lies at 1602 cm–1, and the Y8b′ band lies at 1583 cm–1; low frequency Y9a′ and Y7a′ bands are poorly resolved. The 1555-cm–1 band is attributed to amide II. The 1583-cm–1 band may also contain a weak amide II component, although a three-component curve fit (data not shown) to this high frequency cluster of bands (1555–1602 cm–1) yielded a reduced χ2 of <1, suggesting that both amide II and Y8b′ bands do not contribute. The UVRR results for the tau 2–19 aggregate are shown in Fig. 1, spectrum e; the tau 2–19 film results are similar (data not shown). The configuration of high frequency bands (1555–1602 cm–1) for the tau peptide aggregate is the same as for the dissolved tau gel (Fig. 1, spectrum d). At the low frequency end of the spectrum, however, bands are better resolved. Peaks appear at 1168 and 1182 cm–1; these are assigned as Y9a′ and F9a, respectively. A weak amide III band appears at 1302 cm–1, and a weak imide II band is found at 1445 cm–1. Electron Microscopy of Tau 2–19 Phases—Electron micrographs at × 20,000 magnification of the tau 2–19 aggregate and 5-year-old gel in the presence of uranyl acetate stain are shown in Fig. 2. The aggregate, Fig. 2A, does not stain, indicating that water is excluded from the structure, whereas the cured gel, Fig. 2B, is stained; water permeates the gel structure. UVRR Spectroscopy of Tau 2–19 Gels Alternately Processed— Clearly, tracking the structural change evident in the 5-year-old tau 2–19 gel at earlier time points is of interest. UVRR results for 10 mm samples of tau 2–19 under varying solution conditions and processing methods are given in Fig. 3. The high frequency quartet of peaks from the UVRR results of the 5-year-old, cured tau gel are reproduced in Fig. 3, spectrum a, for ease of comparison. The UVRR results for tau 2–19 vigorously stirred for 19 h at room temperature are shown in Fig. 3, spectrum b. This treatment yielded a cloudy gel. The tyrosine Y8a peak at 1615 cm–1 and Y8b peak at 1597 cm–1 are clearly present; a very weak amide II band at 1555.5 cm–1 is also evident. Curve-fitting results to the broad Y8 band envelope showed that additional bands, evident as shoulders in Fig. 3, spectrum b, are located at 1603 and 1584 cm–1 (data not shown). These latter bands have counterparts in the results for the 5-year-old tau gel and became more explicit after gel drying, discussed below. Heating tau 2–10 to 95 °C for 5 days yielded a Y8 band with low frequency shoulders of greater intensity and a Y8a band slightly up-shifted to 1613 cm–1. These spectroscopic results approach those of the 5-year-old tau gel, but the physical appearance of the gel was yellow, suggesting oxidation. The UVRR results for a 10 mm tau 2–19 solution at pH 10.5 are given in Fig. 3, spectrum d. Here, the tyrosinate Y8a′ peak appears at 1604 cm–1, close to the 1600-cm–1 tyrosinate peak of the 5-year-old tau gel (Fig. 3, spectrum a), and a Y8b′ shoulder is located at 1585 cm–1. The amide II band is stronger than those found in the UVRR results for the heated or stirred tau gels (Fig. 3, spectra c and b, respectively). In order to determine the age at which a tau 2–19 gel stored at 4 °C attains the spectroscopic markers of the 5-year-old tau gel (Fig. 1, spectrum a), a solution at the gelation ons"

Despite the potentially important function of uH2B, it is not known how the histone modification is physiologically regulated. Here, we found that carbohydrates were potent inducers of mono-ubiquitination of H2B. We further showed that mono-ubiquitination of H2B required glycolysis, the central metabolic pathway of carbohydrates. Yeast Strains and DNA Constructs—Yeast strain Y96 (MATα ura3–25 lys2–801amberade2–101ochretrp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 hta1-htb1Δ::V̇aLEU2 hta2-htb2Δ::URA3 HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)) was derived from YPH500 (Stratagene) as described before (18.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Y208 was the same as Y96 except HTA1-FLAG-htb1(K123R). Y119 (htb2Δ:: URA3 htb1Δ::KANMX bre1Δ::LEU2 FLAG HTB1 (CEN HIS) was derived from BY4733 (Research Genetics). Y206 was Y119 with FLAG-FLAG BRE1 (CEN TRP). Y97 was Y96 with CRE1 (CEN TRP1) (19.Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Y98 (hxk2Δ), Y101 (snf3Δ::HIS5), Y102 (rgt2Δ::HIS5), Y103 (gpr1Δ:: HIS5), and Y104 (hxk2Δ::loxP glk1Δ::HIS5) were derived from Y97 and constructed by Cre-mediated gene knock-out method (19.Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Y218 (PFK1 PFK2 HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)), Y219 (pfk1::HIS3 PFK2 HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)) and Y223 (pfk1::LEU2 pfk2::TRP1 HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)) were isogenic to MCH-7B strains (ura3–52 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1::loxP MAL SUC GAL), which were obtained from J. J. Heinisch. Y236 (HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)), Y237 (cyt1Δ::KAN HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)), and Y238 (cox9Δ:: KAN HTA1-FLAG-HTB1(CEN URA3)) were made from BY4741 (Open Biosystems). BRE1 with its endogenous promoter region was cloned by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned to SmaI site of pRS414. Subsequently, N-terminal FLAG-FLAG-Bre1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and sequence verified. All the N-terminal FLAG-tagged H2B constructs were generated either by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) or generously provided by M. A. Osley. Western Blot Analysis and Glucose Assay—Whole-cell extracts from normalized number of cells or histones were prepared, analyzed on 12 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blotted with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) as described previously (9.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Glucose analysis was performed with a glucose assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. We made a serendipitous observation that uH2B was not detected in yeast Y96 with FLAG-tagged H2B as the only copy of H2B in water (Fig. 1A, lane 4). We further found that uH2B was also absent in stationary phase Y96 that was cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) for 7 days (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In striking contrast, significant amount of uH2B was present in exponential phase Y96 (e.g. A600 = 1) in YPD (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1, 3, and 4). These initial observations indicated that the induction of uH2B was subjected to environmental and/or nutritional regulation. Stationary phase yeast is in a non-proliferating or Go state, resulting from nutrient depletion (20.Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Because uH2B was not detected in stationary phase yeast, we then sought to explore whether addition of nutrients to stationary phase yeast could induce uH2B. To do so, we collected stationary phase Y96, washed it with water, and resuspended it with 5 ml of the following solutions in separation or in combination (A600 = 1): 2% glucose, nitrogen base, ammonia sulfate, and amino acid mixture. After incubating the yeast at 30 °C for 1 h, we prepared whole cell extracts for assaying the presence of uH2B. We found that glucose alone was capable of inducing uH2B (Fig. 1A, lane 11). In contrast, amino acids, nitrogen base, and ammonia sulfate were defective in inducing uH2B (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 12). In addition, uH2B could be readily induced by a range of glucose concentrations (0.05 to 2% tested) within a few minutes of incubation in Y96 (data not shown). The data demonstrate that glucose is an inducer of uH2B. There are four stages of yeast growth on the glucose-based medium YPD: exponential phase during which glucose is present, diauxic shift when glucose is depleted, post-diauxic shift when yeast growth depends on respiration, and stationary phase when nutrient is depleted (20.Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To examine the presence of uH2B in the four stages of yeast growth, we inoculated Y96 in YPD and measured glucose levels in the medium, cell density, and uH2B levels at various time points. We found that uH2B was significantly present in exponential phase (A600 was less than 12) (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5; Fig. 1C). However, only less than 4% of the original bulk uH2B was present in post-diauxic shift (A600 was from about 17 to 41) (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7; Fig. 1C). Moreover, uH2B was not detectable in stationary phase (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9; Fig. 1C). Therefore, the presence of uH2B closely correlated with the presence of glucose (Fig. 1C), further suggesting that glucose is an inducer of uH2B. Genetic studies indicate that mono-ubiquitination of H2B is catalyzed in vivo by Bre-1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase (12.Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 13.Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Golshani A. Zhang Y. Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Because uH2B was not detected in stationary phase, we sought to determine whether Bre1 was expressed in stationary phase. To assess Bre1 expression, we first tagged chromosomal BRE1 with green fluorescence protein at its carboxyl terminus. However, presumably because the RING-finger domain of Bre1 is at the extreme carboxyl terminus (12.Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), fusion of green fluorescence protein to the C-terminal of Bre1 rendered Bre1-green fluorescence protein fusion to be catalytically inactive (data not shown). Therefore, we generated a bre1Δ mutant (Y119, derived from BY4733 strain) and introduced the bre1Δ mutant with pRS414-(2x) FLAG-Bre1 (CEN TRP) under the control of BRE1 endogenous promoter (Y206) and cultured it in YPD until stationary phase was reached. pRS414-(2x) FLAG-Bre1 directed expression of FLAG-FLAG-Bre1, in which tandem FLAG epitopes were tagged after its start methionine. We found that FLAG-FLAG-Bre1 protein was present throughout the four growth stages, whereas the presence of uH2B was mainly in exponential phase (Fig. 1D) as described earlier. These data suggest that the Bre1 enzymatic activity on H2B in vivo is down-regulated in post-diauxic shift and stationary phase. Alternatively, expression and/or activity of positive regulators for mono-ubiquitination of H2B such as Rad6, Lge1, or Rtf1 (8.Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 12.Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol.

Glucose is a major carbon and energy source for yeast. There are a number of known glucose sensors monitoring the presence of glucose, which include hexokinase II, Snf3, Snf1, Rgt2, Gpr1, and glucokinase I (21.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22.Ozcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moore B. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S185-S205Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to explore whether individual glucose sensors play an essential role in inducing uH2B. To test this, we generated isogenic strains of Y96, namely, hxk2Δ, snf1Δ, snf3Δ, rgt2Δ, gpr1Δ, and hxk2Δ glk1Δ mutants, in which the entire open reading frames of these genes were deleted. We cultured them in YPD until A600 reached about 2, and prepared whole cell extracts for analyzing the presence of uH2B as described. We found that uH2B was present in all the mutant strains (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that these sensors do not play an essential role in inducing uH2B. In addition to glucose, yeast can also utilize a variety of carbohydrates as its carbon and energy sources. Therefore, we sought to test whether other carbohydrates could also induce uH2B. To do so, we collected stationary phase Y96, washed it with water, resuspended it with 2% various carbohydrates (A600 = 2), and incubated these cultures at 30 °C for 6 h. We found that mannose, fructose, and sucrose were also very potent in inducing uH2B when added to stationary phase yeast (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). Raffinose and maltose could also induce uH2B (Fig. 3A, lanes 12 and 13). These data indicate that uH2B can be induced by a wide array of carbohydrates. In contrast, l-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose, and 2-deoxyglucose, non-metabolic glucose analogs, were defective in inducing uH2B (Fig. 3A, lanes 9–11). l-Glucose is not transported by the yeast (21.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). 3-O-Methyl-d-glucopyranose is transported; however, it is not phosphorylated at the C-6 position (21.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose is transported and phosphorylated at the C-6 position but is not further phosphorylated at the C-1 position (21.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which is a key step for the entry of glycolysis. Therefore, our data suggest that glucose-mediated mono-ubiquitination of H2B requires glucose metabolism. These observations led us to explore whether glycolysis, the central carbohydrate metabolic pathway (27.Michal G. Biochemical Pathways: An Atlas of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Wiley and Spektrum, New York1999Google Scholar), plays a role in inducing uH2B. We first examined whether iodoacetate (IAA), 1The abbreviations used are: IAA, iodoacetate; WCE, whole-cell extract. an inhibitor of glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step of glycolysis (28.Webb J. Enzyme and Metoblic Inhibitors. III. Academic Press, Inc., New York1966Google Scholar), could inhibit the induction of uH2B. We collected stationary phase Y96 and resuspended it with fresh YPD containing various amount of IAA (A600 = 2) and further incubated it at 30 °C for 30 min. We found that glucose-induced uH2B levels were markedly reduced in the presence of IAA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In contrast, rotenone, an inhibitor of respiratory chain (29.Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), had no effect on inducing uH2B (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that glycolysis, but not respiration, is required for carbohydrate-induced ubiquitination of H2B. To further examine the role of glycolysis on carbohydrate-induced uH2B, we examined the presence of uH2B in glycolytic mutants, in which genes for the entry of glycolysis are deleted. The first irreversible step for glycolysis is the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, catalyzed by 6-phosphofructokinase activity encoded by PFK1 or PFK2 (30.Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., and Walter, P. (2002) Molecular Biology of the Cell, Garland ScienceGoogle Scholar). Deletion of both PFK1 and PFK2 genes abolishes glycolysis (31.Klein C.J. Olsson L. Nielsen J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To test the effect of glycolysis on the induction of uH2B, we cultured isogenic strains Y218 (WT), Y219 (pfk1), and Y223 (pfk1 pfk2) in SC-U/GE (1% glycerol and 3% ethanol) for 3 days. uH2B was not present in the WT, pfk1, and pfk1 pfk2 strains before YPD was added (Fig. 3D, lanes 3, 5, and 7). After resuspending the WT, pfk1, and pfk1 pfk2 strains in YPD (A600 = 2) and incubating them at 30 °C for 3 h, we found that uH2B was induced in the WT strain as expected (Fig. 3D, lane 4). However, the induction of uH2B was impaired in the pfk1 mutant (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 4 and 6). Furthermore, the induction of uH2B was abolished in the pfk1 pfk2 mutant (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 4, 6, and 8). In contrast, deletion of CYT1 or COX9 (Y237 or Y238), which encodes essential respiration protein cytochrome c1 or cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIA, respectively, had no effect on uH2B (Fig. 3E). These data further validate our model that glycolysis is required for the carbohydrate-induced mono-ubiquitination of H2B. Mono-ubiquitination of H2B at Lys123 is implicated in yeast telomeric silencing (9.Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Consistent with the gene-silencing role, our comparative genome-wide expression data showed that about 70 metabolic genes, which are normally repressed in exponential phase and up-regulated in post-diauxic shift and stationary phase, were up-regulated in a h2b-K123R strain when it was in exponential phase in YPD. 2L. Dong and C. W. Xu, unpublished data. Taken together, our data suggest that uH2B might function as a histone marker for the carbohydrate metabolism or carbon source in yeast. In summary, we have found that carbohydrates are potent inducers for mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B in yeast. We have further discovered that the induction of mono-ubiquitinated H2B requires glycolysis, the central carbohydrate metabolic pathway. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of novel metabolic regulation of histone modifications by sugars or carbohydrates. We thank M. A. Osley, J. J. Heinisch, and J.

Clones exhibit 20- to more than 300-fold greater resistance to Ec. Unexpectedly, they also display stable cross-resistance to tunicamycin, thapsigargin, dithiothreitol, and cycloheximide but not doxorubicin, etoposide, or Fas ligand. Phenotypic analysis indicates that the cells display increased store-operated calcium influx and resistance to ER Ca2+ store depletion by Ec. E2R2, the most resistant clone, was observed to maintain protein synthesis levels after treatment with Ec or thapsigargin. Expression of GRP78, an ER-based chaperone, was induced by these ER stress treatments but to equal degrees in HL-60 and E2R2 cells. By using microarray analysis, at least 15 ribosomal protein genes were found to be overexpressed in E2R2 compared with HL-60 cells. We also found that ribosomal protein content was increased by 30% in E2R2 as well as other clones. The resistance phenotype was partially reversed by the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin. Therefore, increased store-operated calcium influx, resistance to ER Ca2+ store depletion, and overexpression of ribosomal proteins define a novel phenotype of ER stress-associated multidrug resistance.

Calcium signals play a central role in many cellular activities including cell movement, secretion, proliferation, gene transcription, and cell death (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). In non-excitable cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ec, econazole; SOC, store-operated calcium; Tg, thapsigargin; DTT, dithiothreitol; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; TRP, transient receptor potential. plays a key role in calcium signaling. Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C generates the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate that diffuses rapidly through the cytosol to interact with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor on the ER membrane releasing calcium stored in the ER lumen. The resulting depletion of calcium within the ER triggers calcium entry from the extracellular milieu through the plasma membrane. This capacitive or store-operated calcium (SOC) influx (3Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) serves to both expand the initial calcium signal and replenish the emptied ER store (4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Although the nature of SOC channel remains unclear, the importance of SOC influx in maintaining cell viability has been demonstrated in different studies (6Kohn E.C. Sandeen M.A. Liotta L.A.

In addition to its key role in Ca2+ signaling, the ER is a site for protein synthesis, and these two functions intersect under conditions of ER stress. For instance, treatment of cells with thapsigargin (Tg), the inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase responsible for transporting Ca2+ into the ER, rapidly depletes ER Ca2+ stores (14Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), inhibits the function of Ca2+-dependent chaperones, and triggers the unfolded protein response (15Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Econazole (Ec) is an antifungal imidazole that depletes Ca2+ from the ER of mammalian cells and blocks Ca2+ influx (16Gamberucci A. Fulceri R. Benedetti A. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Jan C.R. Ho C.M. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These effects result in sustained depletion of Ca2+ from ER stores and profound inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell death (11Soboloff J. Berger S.A. J. Biol.

We have shown that some transformed cells exhibit several orders of magnitude greater sensitivity to Ec than normal cells (12Soboloff J. Zhang Y. Minden M. Berger S.A. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1219-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Crump M. Berger S.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This enhanced sensitivity may be due to the activated nature of tumor cells since we have shown that concurrent stimulation of cells with growth factors such as steel factor (9Gommerman J.L. Berger S.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Soboloff J. Berger S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13812-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor, or bombesin (13Zhang Y. Crump M. Berger S.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) enhances cell death; this is a process we refer to as activation-enhanced cell death. However, the nature of the differential sensitivity is not fully understood. To investigate further the molecular events associated with resistance and sensitivity to Ca2+ and ER stress-induced cell death, we developed mutant cell clones by selection of HL-60 leukemia cells with stepwise increasing concentrations of econazole. The resultant clones exhibit resistance to Ec and cross-resistance to other ER stress-inducing agents including Tg, tunicamycin (inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation), dithiothreitol (DTT; disulfide bond reducing agent), and cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor). Phenotypic analysis indicates that these cells also exhibit resistance to Ec-induced ER Ca2+ depletion, display increased SOC influx, increased ribosomal protein content, and sustained protein synthesis levels in the presence of Ec and Tg. These studies therefore define a novel phenotype of multidrug resistance associated with inducers of ER stress. Culture and Selection Conditions—Human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. In order to generate resistant cells, the cells were exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of Ec that caused a reduction in the proportion of viable cells by at least 90% followed by a recovery phase. At the end of a series of such steps, cells were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded for further study. To maintain the phenotype of resistance, the Ec-resistant clones designated E2R2, E2R4, E2R6 were challenged with econazole once a month to ensure stability of the resistant phenotype. All the phenotypic characterizations were performed 1 week following drug treatment, and the cell viability was higher than 95%. Clonogenicity Assays—To measure clonogenicity, HL-60 or resistant clone cells (5 × 104) were incubated in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS for 24 h in the presence or absence of different concentration of drugs. Unless indicated, all drugs were purchased from Sigma. For treatment with econazole, cells were incubated in serum-free media for 2 h, resuspended in RPMI with 5% FBS, and cultured for an additional 22 h. 2000 treated cells were plated in 0.3% agar containing 20% FBS in RPMI 1640. Colonies were counted after 10 days incubation in humidity at 5% CO2, 37 °C. Apoptosis Assay—HL-60 and E2R2 cells were treated as for the clonogenic assay for 24 h. At the end of the culture period, cells were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in 5% formalin containing 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Cells were observed under fluorescence microscopy and scored for apoptotic morphology. Cells exhibiting nuclear condensation/fragmentation were defined as apoptotic. A minimum of 200 cells was counted per group. Intracellular Calcium Measurement—Measurements of [Ca2+]c were performed by flow cytometry. HL-60 or resistant clone cells were serum-deprived for 2 h in Tyrode's buffer (HEPES (10 mm), NaCl (100 mm), KCl (5 mm), CaCl2 (1.4 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), glucose (5.6 mm), bovine serum albumin (0.05%)). Cells were incubated in loading buffer (30 min; 5 μm indo-1AM (Molecular Probes), 0.03% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) in Tyrode's buffer), washed two times, and incubated on ice for 15 min to allow for the complete removal and/or conversion of indo-1AM to Ca2+-sensitive indo-1. Measurements were performed using a laser tuned to 338 nm while monitoring emissions at 405 and 450 nm. The cell population was gated to exclude debris and dead cells using FloJo software (TreeStar). The concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ was calculated according to Equation 1, [Ca2+]i=Kd×(Fmin/Fmax)×(R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)(Eq. 1) where R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities measured at 405 and 450 nm during the experiments, and F is the fluorescence intensity measured at 450 nm. Rmin, Rmax, Fmin, and Fmax values were determined from in situ calibration of unlysed cells using 4 μm ionomycin in the absence (Rmin and Fmin; 10 mm EGTA) and presence (Rmax and Fmax) of Ca2+. Kd (250 nm) is the dissociation constant for indo-1 at 37 °C (18Grynkiewcz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rmin, Rmax, Fmin, and Fmax values varied depending upon settings and were determined at the beginning of each experimental procedure. Protein Synthesis—Cells (2 × 105/sample) were collected, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in RPMI supplemented with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.05%; Sigma). Cells were treated with Ec (0, 15 μm) or Tg (0, 100 nm) for 15 min. After centrifugation (2500 rpm; 5 min), cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine (50 μCi/ml) for 10 min (37 °C; 5% CO2) in leucine-free RPMI. After two washes in RPMI, pellets were lysed with Triton X-100 (0.5% in PBS) followed by trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v; 4 °C). Samples were washed in trichloroacetic acid (5% w/v), and the protein pellets were resuspended in microscintillant (Packard Instrument Co.) and measured using a microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Microarray Analysis—The microarrays used in the present study are the human 19K2 microarrays (Clinical Genomics Centre, CGC, Toronto, Canada) that contain 18,980 human cDNAs and 220 positive and negative control features (Invitrogen). A complete gene list and protocols for the production of the microarrays can be found at University Health Network CGC web site (www.microarrays.ca). HL-60 and E2R2 cells were grown under log phase conditions at equivalent cell densities. The cells were collected, and total RNAs from HL-60 or E2R2 were extracted; cDNAs were labeled, respectively, with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dye through reverse transcription, purified, and hybridized to the human 19K2 gene chips. The slides were then washed and air-dried before being scanned through an Axon GenePix 4000A scanner. The fluorescence intensity was quantitated by GenePix 3.0 software (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA). Normalization and analysis of microarray data were performed using software developed by Beheshti (19Beheshti B. Braude I. Marrano P. Thorner P. Zielenska M. Squire J.A. Neoplasia. 2003; 5: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Expression of four ribosomal protein genes was further evaluated by Northern blot. Briefly, RNA samples extracted from equal cell numbers from both wild type and E2R2 cells were fractionated on an 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. After transfer, the nylon membranes were UV cross-linked. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 50 °C in DigEasy hybridization solution (Roche Applied Science). The probes for the ribosomal protein genes S12, L27, and L12 were obtained from ATCC, and the probe for the Large P2 gene was cloned reverse transcriptase-PCR. The probes were prepared by random priming labeling (Invitrogen) with [α-32P]dCTP. The membranes were also probed for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene as a control for total RNA loading. For quantitation, densitometry analysis of the blots was performed and analyzed by NIH Image 1.62 software. Ribosomal Protein Isolation and Quantitation—1 × 108 HL-60 or resistant clone cells cultured under log phase conditions were collected, washed with cold PBS, and fractionated according to the method described by Madjar et al. (20Madjar J.J. Arpin M. Marion M.J. Reboud J.P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1977; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ribosomal fraction was isolated through centrifugation of cytoplasmic supernatants on top of a 1 m sucrose cushion at 245,000 × g to pellet the ribosomes. The ribosome pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of sample buffer and disrupted by incubation in 60 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min. Ribosomal RNAs were extracted with TRIzol and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with EtBr. Total ribosomal proteins were separately analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the protein bands. Western Blot—Assays for the expression of Bip (GRP78), an ER stress marker, were performed by Western blot. Cells were treated with different ER stress-inducing agents as described for the clonogenicity assays. After 12 h of treatment, the cells were collected and lysed in chilled RIPA buffer (Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v), sodium deoxycholate (0.05% w/v), SDS (0.1% w/v)), containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml) and protease inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), by sonication (30 s) followed by an incubation period (30 min; 4 °C). The proteins in the supernatants (18,000 × g; 20 min; 4 °C) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST: Tris (10 mm), pH 8.0, NaCl (150 mm), Tween 20 (0.1%)) containing 2% powdered skim milk and subsequently incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with monoclonal anti-human Bip(GRP78) antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-actin (Sigma). Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with secondary antibody (30 min; rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). Membranes were then washed in TBST and visualized using the ECL kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. To verify the presence of ribosomal proteins in purified fractions, we used a human autoantibody (ImmunoVision, Springdale, AR) that recognizes the human ribosomal protein P antigens. 3 μl of ribosomal proteins or 50 μg of total proteins from whole lysates of the cells were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gel, incubated with antisera (1:5000), and detected with secondary antibody (rabbit anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000, Sigma). Other antibodies used in the present study include anti-GADD153 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, polyclonal antibody). Phosphorylation of eIF2α—To examine phosphorylation of eIF2α, both wild type and E2R2 cells were treated with Ec (15 μm) or Tg(1 μm) for 1 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture and protease inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), and total protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel as described above. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was detected by Western blot using an antibody recognizing phosphorylated eIF2α (serine 51, Cell Signaling). The same samples were also probed for total eIF2α as a control. Statistical Analysis—Colony data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, with differences between individual means determined by Bonferroni's post-tests. SOC calcium influx was analyzed by area under the curve. Correlation of calcium influx with relative resistance was analyzed by linear regression. Other data were analyzed by Student's t test. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Selection of Econazole-resistant HL-60 Cells—In order to study the mechanism of action of the ER stress-inducing agent Ec, we developed Ec-resistant variants of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 by treating the cells with stepwise increasing concentrations of the drug followed by recovery in the absence of drug over a period of 6 months. We then subcloned these cells by limiting dilution assay. Six clones of Ec-resistant cells designated E2R1 to E2R6 were generated, and 3 of the clones exhibiting the highest levels of resistance were analyzed. Fig. 1A showed different degrees of resistance to the drug Ec. At the highest concentration used, the fold increase of resistance for mutant clones ranged from 20 to more than 300 compared with wild type HL-60 cells. Among these mutant clones, E2R2 cells displayed the highest relative resistance to Ec by clonogenicity assay, and the variant E2R4 was the least resistant (Fig. 1A). By challenging the mutant cells with Ec once a month, we have maintained the resistant phenotype for more than 2 years. Resistant Clones Are Cross-resistant to ER Stress-inducing Agents—Previous work from our laboratory indicated that Ec induces the depletion of Ca2+ from the ER resulting in profound inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death. We therefore investigated the sensitivity of resistant clone cells to other ER stress-inducing agents. By using a colony forming assay, we found that all the mutant clones tested were 100–200 times more resistant to Tg, tunicamycin, and DTT (Fig. 1, B–D). In contrast, no significant difference in sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs such as doxorubicin and etoposide was observed in these cell lines (data not shown). Because E2R2 cells displayed the highest relative resistance to all tested stress-inducing agents and were found to be the most stable, they were chosen for further analysis. Morphological analysis of HL-60 cells treated for 24 h with the agents mentioned above indicated typical characteristics of apoptosis such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation. In agreement with this observation, we have detected cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 12 in cells treated with Ec, Tg, and tunicamycin. 2Y. Zhang and S. A. Berger, unpublished observations. In contrast, E2R2 cells displayed only limited levels of apoptosis in response to these agents (Fig. 2A), so for drug concentrations that lead to more than 50% of ER stress-related apoptosis in HL-60 cells, none of the drugs were toxic to E2R2 cells (Fig. 2B). The cross-resistance to these agents was not observed with all inducers of cell death because both cell lines exhibited similar sensitivity to etoposide and Fas ligand (Fig. 2B), agents that are not thought to target the ER. These results therefore show that E2R2 cells selected for resistance to Ec exhibit specific cross-resistance to ER stress-associated agents. Increase in Capacitive Calcium Influx in Resistant Clones— Because Ec is known to stimulate ER Ca2+ depletion and block influx, we investigated the dynamic Ca2+ content of the mutant cells. Intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]c) were measured in indo-1AM loaded HL-60 and resistant clone cells by flow cytometry. In the unchallenged state, basal [Ca2+]c for HL-60 and E2R2 cells was similar and found to be between 50 and 100 nm. Tg is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase and causes rapid release of Ca2+ from the ER coupled with capacitive influx (14Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation with thapsigargin (3 μm) led to a biphasic increase of [Ca2+]c which was seen in both cell lines consisting of a rapid but small magnitude “plateau” followed by a prolonged and further elevation of [Ca2+]c, likely representing influx through SOC Ca2+ channels. Both the peak and total magnitude of the Ca2+ signal were significantly greater in the resistant clone compared with WT cells. The peaks of the transients for two cells were 767 ± 223 nm in E2R2 cells and 514 ± 94 nm in HL-60 cells (Table I, n = 7, p < 0.05).Table IER Ca2+ content and Ca2+ influx The abbreviations used are as follows: Ni2+, nickel; AUC, area under the curve.Peak [Ca2+]c (Tg)Δ[Ca2+]c (Tg)AUC (Tg)AUC (Ni2+ + Tg)SOCnmμm·sμm·sμm·sHL60513 ± 94378 ± 54141 ± 668 ± 1373 ± 9E2R2766 ± 223ap < 0.05636 ± 17ap < 0.05288 ± 18bp < 0.00162 ± 9226 ± 11cp < 0.001.

SOC values were derived by subtracting area under the curve values in the presence of Ni2+ from area under the curve values in its absence Open table in a new tab In order to distinguish between mobilization and influx, cells were treated with Tg in the presence of Ni2+, a nonspecific Ca2+ influx antagonist, to block all influx (Fig. 3B). In this case, the peak change (188 ± 63 nm in HL-60 versus 192 ± 36 nm in E2R2 cells, n = 5, p > 0.05) and total Ca2+ were similar indicating that Tg-releasable ER Ca2+ content was the same in both cell types but that the mutant cells exhibited greater store-operated influx. In order to confirm this difference, Ca2+ influx was measured directly by restoring Ca2+ to the culture medium following Tg treatment in Ca2+-free medium. As shown in Fig. 3C, both the peak influx and area under the curve were significantly larger in E2R2 compared with WT cells. We therefore conclude that E2R2 cells exhibit similar resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and similar ER Ca2+ content compared with WT. However, capacitive Ca2+ influx is much higher in E2R2 cells in response to Tg than WT. By using the same calcium measurement method, we found that the other resistant clones E2R4 and E2R6 also showed significantly increased calcium influx (Fig. 3D) while retaining similar ER calcium content as WT cells (Fig. 3E). The increased calcium influx (SOC, μm·s) observed in these resistant clones was found to correlate strongly with the relative resistance (log fold resistance, logR) to Ec (Fig. 3F; r = 0.93, p = 0.038), supporting the conclusion that increased Ca2+ influx correlates with ER stress resistance. ER Calcium Store Depletion by Prolonged Incubation with Ec—In a previous study (11Soboloff J. Berger S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13812-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we showed that Ec suppressed protein synthesis of murine bone marrow mast cells through sustained depletion of ER calcium stores. In order to investigate whether E2R2 cells were also resistant to ER calcium depletion, the cells were incubated with very high levels of Ec. Both E2R2 and WT cells were observed to release similar levels of Ca2+ from Tg-sensitive stores (Fig. 4A). The level of Ca2+ released into the cytoplasm is consistent with mobilization from intracellular stores in the absence of influx. However, when the two cell lines were incubated with econazole (15 μm) in Tyrode's buffer for 2 h at 37 °C and Ca2+ content in the Tg-sensitive ER store was measured, as shown in Fig. 4B, the ER Ca2+ store in WT cells was completely depleted, whereas the mutant cells retained significant levels of ER Ca2+. These results indicate that while Ec can still stimulate release from the ER and block influx in E2R2 cells, E2R2 cells are capable of refilling their ER and the WT cells are not. Grp78 Expression—Previous studies from other laboratories had shown that overexpression of the ER-resident chaperone Grp78 can contribute to resistance to ER stress (21Liu H. Bowes III, R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21751-21759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Morris J.A.

Kamidono S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Given the cross-resistance phenotype of the E2R2 cells, we therefore investigated the expression levels of GRP78. As shown in Fig. 5A, GRP78 expression was found to be overexpressed in both E2R2 and HL-60 cells 12 h following treatment with ER stress-inducing agents. However, E2R2 cells did not exhibit any higher levels of GRP78 than HL-60 cells. Therefore, GRP78 overexpression does not appear to contribute to the cross-resistance phenotype in E2R2 cells. GADD153 Expression—GADD153 (also known as CHOP) is a leucine zipper transcription factor that is highly inducible in response to cellular stress including ER stress (24Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 25Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D.

Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Because induction of GADD153 expression in response to ER stress promotes death, we determined expression levels of GADD153 following exposure to different ER stress-inducing agents. Surprisingly, neither HL-60 cells nor E2R2-resistant cells were induced to express GADD153 protein (Fig. 5B), indicating that alterations in GADD153 expression are not associated with the resistance phenotype. Generalized Overexpression of Ribosomal Protein Genes Is Observed in Cross-resistant E2R2 Cells—In order to further investigate differences between the mutant and WT cells, we used microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profile of E2R2 cells with that of the wild type HL-60 cells. The two cell lines were grown under identical tissue culture conditions and to similar cell densities in order to suppress differences associated with growth status. From 10 comparisons with 4 independent RNA extractions, we observed ∼86 genes whose expression was reproducibly increased in E2R2 cells compared with HL-60 cells. Remarkably, we observed that at least 15 family members of the ribosomal protein genes were overexpressed in E2R2 cells at levels ranging from 1.5- to 3-fold. Overexpressed genes include ribosomal proteins of the large subunit of the ribosome (rpL6, rpL12, rpL21, rpL23a, rpL27, rpL31, rpL37, rpL41, and rpLarge P2) and ribosomal proteins of the small subunit of the ribosome (rpS3a, rpS12, rpS27, rpS29, and rpS37) (Table II).Table IIOverexpressed ribosomal protein genes by microarray analysisAccession no.Gene descriptionExpression ratio (E2R2/HL60)AA046808Ribosomal protein S27 isoform3.03 ± 0.22AA114861Ribosomal protein L273.00 ± 0.17AA121296Ribosomal protein L372.83 ± 0.12N74701Ribosomal protein S3a2.80 ± 0.11T62916Ribosomal protein S292.69 ± 0.19AA039258Ribosomal protein L312.60 ± 0.04W32969Ribosomal protein L37a2.46 ± 0.14N81091Ribosomal protein L62.28 ± 0.09H47113Ribosomal protein L23a2.17 ± 0.20T48772Ribosomal protein L122.10 ± 0.23W93580Ribosomal protein S121.71 ± 0.13W93065Ribosomal protein L211.68 ± 0.20AA156680Ribosomal protein S2"
https://openalex.org/W2169766184,"RRAG A (Rag A)/Gtr1p is a member of the Ras-like small G protein family that genetically interacts with RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RanGTPase. RRAG A/Gtr1p forms a heterodimer with other G proteins, RRAG C and RRAG D/Gtr2p, in a nucleotide-independent manner. To further elucidate the function of RRAG A/Gtr1p, we isolated a protein that interacts with RRAG A. This protein is a novel nucleolar protein, Nop132. Nop132 is associated with the GTP form, but not the GDP form, of RRAG A, suggesting that RRAG A might regulate Nop132 function. Nop132 is also associated with RRAG C and RRAG D. The Nop132 amino acid sequence is similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleolar Nop8p, which is associated with Gtr1p, Gtr2p, and Nip7p. Nop132 also interacts with human Nip7 and is colocalized with RRAG A, RRAG C, and Nip7. RNA interference knockdown of Nop132 inhibited cell growth of HeLa cells.

Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins are a superfamily of regulatory GTP hydrolases composed of a large number of proteins, which include Ras family proteins, heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, and the elongation factors, TU and G, among others (1Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Ras-like small G proteins such as Ras, Rab, Rho, ARF, and Ran are monomeric and bind to the guanine nucleotides, GTP or GDP, to function as molecular switches. They also have crucial roles in cell growth, differentiation, and protein trafficking between different intracellular compartments (2Milburn M.V. Tong L. DeVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Among the Ras superfamily of small G proteins, Ran is a nuclear protein with several functions, including nucleocytoplasmic transport of many types of protein and nucleic acids across nuclear membranes (4Nishimoto T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sazer S. Dasso M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1111-1118PubMed Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran (RCC1) is bound to chromatin with histone H2A and H2B and confined within the nucleus (6Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Li H.Y. Wirtz D. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the Ran GTPase-activating protein is located both inside the cytosol and tethered to the external face of the nuclear pore complex with RanBP2. Compartmentalization of these factors is believed to create a gradient of GTPase Ran across the nuclear pore complex, which controls the stability of Impβ interactions with particular cargo molecules. Ran is also a key factor that controls mitotic processes, including spindle assembly during metaphase and reformation of the nuclear envelope during telophase (8Heald I. Weis I. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Azuma Y. Dasso M. Curr. Opin.

Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2311-2318PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise function of Gtr1p remains uncertain, it is thought to have a role in phosphate transport (11Bun Y.M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although yeast cells can grow even if GTR1 and GTR2 are deleted, they cannot grow at low temperature (12Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). Because many G proteins have multiple functions, Gtr1p and Gtr2p localization within the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests a role in both, possibly that of nucleocytoplasmic transport, as in the case of RanGTPase. RRAG A/Rag A is a functional homologue to yeast Gtr1p (13Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar) and belongs to the Ras superfamily of small G proteins. RRAG A/Rag A/FIP-1 was originally isolated using PCR methods during the search for novel G proteins (14Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was also independently isolated by two-hybrid screening using adenovirus E3 14.7K as the bait and is involved in tumor necrosis factor α-mediated cell death (15Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that RRAG A/Rag A forms a complex with other G proteins, RRAG C/Rag C and RRAG D/Rag D, which are homologues to Gtr2p (16Sekiguchi T. Hirose E. Nakashima N. Ii M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7246-7257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Heterodimer formation between RRAG A and RRAG C is a specific characteristic of these proteins, which are distinct from other Ras family proteins in that they are usually monomeric. RRAG A/Rag A/FIP-1 is associated with the dynein light chain, which is part of the molecular motor system located at the negative ends of microtubules, close to the nuclear membrane. This suggests a role for RRAG A/Rag A/FIP-1 in dynein-microtubule effects on the transcytoplasmic transport of organelles, viruses, and signal transduction molecules (17Lukashok S.A. Tarassishin L. Li Y. Horwitz M.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.hugo-international.org/hugo/) recently approved the root symbol of RRAG # for Ras-related GTP binding #. Thus, in the present study, RRAG A, RRAG B, RRAG C, and RRAG D were used for Rag A, Rag B, Rag C, and Rag D, respectively. In an effort to determine which cellular proteins might interact with RRAG A in the RCC1-Ran pathway, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using RRAG A as the bait. This search identified a novel protein, which we named Nop132, because the protein has classic characteristics of nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolar localization and RNA-binding activity. Exogenous expression of the carboxyl terminus of Nop132 guided the formation of the R-rings induced by Nopp140 (18Isaac C. Yang Y. Meier U.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nop132 also interacted with RRAG C, RRAG D, and Nip7 and might be an anchoring protein that localizes these proteins to the nucleolus in the signal transduction pathway. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that Nop132 is similar to the yeast Nop8p, an essential nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis (19Zanchin N.I. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nop132 knockdown by RNA interference revealed that Nop132 is an essential protein, as is Nop8. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—BHK21 cells and HeLa cells were grown at 37.5 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2-90% air. Cells were washed with TD buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 136.8 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.7 mm Na2HPO4). BHK21 cells (2 × 105 cells) were transfected with DNA-lipid complex comprising 1 μg each of various vectors plus 7 μl (for a 35-mm dish) or 15 μl (for a 60-mm dish) of LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 4 h in the absence of serum and antibiotics as recommended by the supplier, and incubated at 37.5 °C for 48 h as described previously (20Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two pairs of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interference RNA; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; DB, DNA binding; EGFP, enhance green fluorescent protein; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole. were chemically synthesized (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan) and annealed before transfection. Transfection was performed on 2 × 104 HeLa cells with a final concentration of 200 mm siRNA duplex using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated control oligonucleotide, there was nearly 100% incorporation of the oligonucleotide under our experimental conditions observed with a fluorescence microscope. The oligonucleotide sequences used for antisense and RNA interference experiments were: A-a (5′-UGAAGAACAGGUAAGACUCTT-3′), A-s (5′-GAGUCUUACCUGUUCUUCATT-3′), B (5′-CACUUCACCUAAUGAGCCATT-3′/5′-UGGCUCAUUAGGUGAAGUGTT-3′), and C (5′-CAGUUUCCUUAGGUGAGCCTT-3′/5′-GGCUCACCUAAGGAAACUGTT-3′). Generation of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Recombinant baculoviruses encoding Nop132, RRAG A, RRAG C, and RRAG D were generated in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the initial transfection, working virus stocks were generated by three sequential virus amplifications. Sf9 cells were cultured in 250-ml disposable Erlenmeyer flasks at 27 °C under rotation at 125 rpm in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at a density of 0.5-6.0 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were seeded at 3.0 × 106 cells and infected with a 1:100 dilution of baculovirus stocks and cultured for 48-72 h before obtaining the cell extract. Yeast Growth Media, Two-hybrid Screening—S. cerevisiae cells were grown in the following media: YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), SD-Trp, -Leu, and -His (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with all essential amino acids except for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine), and GE-Leu and -Trp (3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with all essential amino acids except for leucine and tryptophan). Amino acids were added to a final concentration of 20-50 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. Large scale yeast transformation and two-hybrid screening were performed using the Y190 S. cerevisiae strain essentially as described before (16Sekiguchi T. Hirose E. Nakashima N. Ii M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7246-7257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed as described previously (16Sekiguchi T. Hirose E. Nakashima N. Ii M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7246-7257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase chromogenic filter assays were performed by transferring the yeast colonies onto nitrocellulose filters (Protran BA85, Schleicher and Schuell, Germany). The yeast cells were partially lysed by submerging the filters in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. Filters were allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 5 min and placed onto filter paper presoaked in Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) supplemented with 0.07 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside. Filters were placed at 30 °C. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21 harboring a GST plasmid was grown in 750 ml of LB medium, treated with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration, 0.2 mm) for 4 h at 30 °C as described previously (21Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were dispersed in lysis solution at a ratio of 1:5 (cell volume: lysis solution (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin)) and sonicated three times for 5 min on ice (Sonicator™, Heat System-Ultrasonics Inc., Farmingdale, NY, with a microtip, 40% cycle, and output control 4). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 10 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. Recombinant DNA—To obtain a full-length cDNA of Nop132, we performed a DNA data base search (BLAST) of human expressed sequence tag clones using a two-hybrid clone cDNA sequence. Clones HEP08473 (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession no. AK000743; provided by Dr. Sumio Sugano, University of Tokyo) and HEMBA1004596 (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession no. AK001049; provided by Dr. Takao Isogai, Helix Research Institute) were derived from the same gene. Because there were gaps between these two clones, we amplified a 1.0-kbp middle region using the reverse transcription-PCR method with HeLa poly(A)+ RNA (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number, AB109030). We also amplified human Nopp140, Clk, and RNPS1 cDNAs with the RT-PCR method using HeLa poly(A)+ RNA. The BglII/SalI fragment of Nopp140 was inserted into the BglII/SalI site of pDsRed1. The XhoI/BamHI fragment of Clk was inserted into the XhoI/BamHI site of pEGFPc1. The BamHI/HindIII fragment of RNPS1 was inserted into the BamHI/HindIII site of pDsRed1. GST-Nop132N was constructed by inserting the BglII/BamHI fragment of Nop132 (1-197 aa) into the BamHI site of pGEX-KG. Fusion proteins with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) were constructed in pAS1 or pAS404. Those with the GAL4 activation-binding domain (GAL4AD) were constructed in pACT2, as described previously (16Sekiguchi T. Hirose E. Nakashima N. Ii M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7246-7257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Each construct was verified by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISMR 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Protein samples were electrophoresed on a 10% or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel or 5-20% gradient gel (Pagel, Atto, Japan) and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22Sekiguchi T. Nohiro Y. Nakamura Y. Hisamoto N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the supplier. The Nop132 antibody was prepared as follows. Based on the sequence of human Nop132 cDNA, a peptide with the sequence HYDPTKQDHATYERKRDDK was synthesized. This peptide was coupled to the carrier protein and used to immunize rabbits. The Nop132N, RRAG A, and RRAG C antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with GST-Nop132N, GST-RRAG A, or GST-RRAG C proteins. Rabbit anti-HA antibody (catalog no. 561) was purchased from the MBL Institute. Mouse anti-T7 antibody (Cat.no.69522) was purchased from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-myc antibody (A-14) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The nucleolar-specific antiserum (catalog no. ANA-N) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). In Vitro Binding Assay—Nop8p and portions of Nop132 were synthesized for the in vitro binding assay. Nop8p in the pET28a vector and the fragments of Nop132 cDNA in the pCR2 vector (Invitrogen) were incubated with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) plus 40 μl of a quick master mix of TnT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for 90 min at 30 °C as recommended by the supplier. The resultant extract was diluted to 500 μl with the immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm DTT). GST, GST-RRAG A, GST-RRAG C, or GST-Nip7 (20 μg), which were bound to the glutathione Sepharose-4B beads, were mixed with the 35S-labeled proteins. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the beads were spun down, washed four times with the immunoprecipitation buffer, and suspended in 50 μl of the sample buffer. Bound proteins were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using the Fuji BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan). Immunofluorescence—Cells (2 × 105) that were seeded on coverslips in a 35-mm dish were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE. The transfected cells on coverslips were fixed with 1 ml of cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min at -20 °C or 1 ml 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. They were processed for immunostaining as described previously (20Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with Hoechst33342 (1 μg/ml) and mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)-treated slides. A Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Germany) was used for sample analysis using standard microscopic methods. Digital images of the stained cells were obtained using the Olympus laser-scanning microscope LSM-GB200 system, as described previously (13Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of a Novel Protein, Nop132, That Interacts with RRAG A—The identification of interacting proteins with known functions is helpful for determining the function of RRAG A/Gtr1p and RRAG C/Gtr2p proteins. To search for interacting proteins for RRAG A, we employed yeast two-hybrid screens with RRAG A. Such screenings revealed that 2 of 30 clones were derived from cDNA fragments from the same gene. The full-length gene was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subcloned into the pME18SFL3 vector. The gene had the predicted molecular mass of 132 kDa and was named Nop132, because the gene product was localized within the nucleolus (see Fig. 2, a and b). The deduced amino acid sequence analysis of Nop132 protein indicated that Nop132 has a eukaryotic RNA recognition motif at its amino-terminal region (8-89 aa residues; Fig. 1a), suggesting that the Nop132 protein is an RNA-binding protein. A BLAST search identified the putative mouse homologue of Nop132 (GenBank™ accession no. XM127302). Sequence similarity comparisons between human Nop132 and the mouse homologue (Fig. 1a) indicated a higher similarity at both the amino-terminal region (1-240 aa; 83.8%) and the carboxyl-terminal region (750-1168 aa; 70.7%). A BLAST search also revealed that yeast Nop8p (GenBank™ accession no. Q08287) has similarity with human Nop132 in both the amino-terminal region (1-90 aa; 29.8%) and carboxyl-terminal region (750-1168 aa; 16%), where a coiled-coil structure for protein interaction was predicted in both proteins. The basic amino acid stretch of Nop132 (958-976 aa) was predicted to be a nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1, a and b). Three coiled-coil structures, one at its amino-terminal region and the other two at its carboxyl-terminal region, were predicted regions for protein-protein interaction (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1a, schematic representation of Nop132 motifs. Nop132 motifs were predicted using Pfam (32Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and the Coil program (33Lupas A. Van D.M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). RRM, RNA recognition motif; Coil, coiled-coil domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal. Sequence similarity (% similarity to human Nop132) was calculated using DNASIS software (Hitachi Software, Japan). b, the NLS is present in a portion of Nop132 (958-RKRDDKPRESKAKRKKKR-976). BHK21 cells were transiently transfected with the vectors as described below. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and processed for fluorescence microscopy. The carboxyl terminus of Nop132 with NLS was localized within the nucleus (i). The carboxyl terminus of Nop132 without NLS and the EGFP vector were localized within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (ii and iii). i, pEGFPc1-carrying carboxyl terminus of Nop132 (958-1168 aa); ii, pEGFPc1-carrying carboxyl terminus of Nop132 (977-1168 aa); iii, pEGFPc1 vector. Left panels are phase images. Right panels are fluorescence images. Arrows in the phase image panels indicate cells expressing EGFP. Scale bar, 10 μm. c, Western blot analysis of viral coinfection. Left panel: samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sf9 insect cells coinfected with the Nop132 recombinant baculovirus and one of the following recombinant baculovirus vectors: RRAG A, RRAG C, and/or RRAG D. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Nop132 antibody. The precipitates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with the anti-His tag antibody to detect His-tagged proteins, as described under “Experimental Procedures”. The positions of Nop132, RRAG A, RRAG C, and RRAG D are indicated by arrows. IgG bands are indicated by an asterisk. Right panel: total cell extract and the supernatant fraction used above were run on Pagel and immunoblotted with the anti-His antibody. d, the association of wild-type, T21L, and Q66L forms of RRAG A with Nop132. Extracts were obtained from cultures of S. cerevisiae colonies harboring two human genes, the RRAG A wild-type (lanes 1 and 4), T21L-(gtr1-11) (lane 2), or the Q66L form (lane 3) in the pAS404 vector, and the carboxyl terminus of Nop132 (883-1168 aa) in the pACT2 vector (lanes 1-3), as shown in the figure. Their β-galactosidase activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown as means of duplicate values with standard deviations. Lower panel: two independent transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity in filter assay. e, colony growth was tested on a plate lacking tryptophan and leucine or on a plate lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, but with the addition of 3-AT. Two independent colonies of each clone were picked up. The experiment was performed at least twice and representative results are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To observe Nop132 and RRAG A interaction in vivo, His tag fusion proteins were produced in Sf9 cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus, which expressed Nop132 and RRAG A, as shown in Fig. 1c (right panel, lanes 4). Nop132 was bound to RRAG A (Fig. 1c, left panel, lanes 3). As a control, normal rabbit serum failed to pull down RRAG A (Fig. 1c, left panel, lanes 4). Previously, we suggested that RRAG C and RRAG D probably form a heterodimer with RRAG A (16Sekiguchi T. Hirose E. Nakashima N. Ii M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7246-7257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether RRAG C and RRAG D could also associate with Nop132. Nop132 was associated with RRAG C and RRAG D, as well as with RRAG A (Fig. 1c, left panel, lanes 5 and 7). In general, Ras-like small G proteins function as binary switches by cycling between an inactive form bound to GDP and the active GTP-bound state, thereby modulating the structure of their target proteins (effectors) by binding to and activating or inhibiting their biologic activity. A candidate effector protein for RRAG A has not yet been identified. To determine whether Nop132 was a candidate effector protein of RRAG A, wild-type and T21L and Q66L forms of RRAG A were used as bait to examine the interaction with the carboxyl terminus of Nop132 (883-1168 aa; Fig. 1, d and e). The T21L mutant of RRAG A (mutation of the 21st threonine to leucine), corresponded to a dominant negative form of Ran, T24N (GDP form), whereas the Q66L mutant of RRAG A (mutation of the 66th glutamine to leucine) corresponded to a dominant positive form of Ran, Q69L (GTP form) (12Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). Positive associations between constructs were monitored by transcriptional activation of the His3 gene by growth on defined media lacking histidine and activation of the lacZ reporter gene, which resulted in the expression of β-galactosidase activity. The control Y190 strain harboring pAS404-RRAG A and pACT2 had fewer than 8.0 β-galactosidase units. There were 472 β-galactosidase units in the Y190 strain harboring pAS404-RRAG A and pACT2-Nop132 (Fig. 1d). There were 732 β-galactosidase units in pAS404-RRAG A (GTP form)-pACT2-Nop132 (Fig. 1d), whereas there were fewer than 10 β-galactosidase units in pAS404-RRAG A (GDP form) and pACT2-Nop132, suggesting that Nop132 does not interact with the RRAG A GDP form. Y190 strains, harboring pAS404-RRAG A (GTP form)-pACT2- Nop132 but not pAS404-RRAG A (GDP form)-pACT2- Nop132, grew in SD medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but containing 3-AT (Fig. 1e). Nop132 Is a Novel Nucleolar Protein—Subcellular localization of Nop132 was studied with immunofluorescence staining. BHK21 cells were transfected with DsRed-tagged Nop132 to establish a cell line that stably expressed DsRed-tagged Nop132. Double labeling of BHK21 cells with the nucleolar-specific antiserum ANA-N (23Pinkoski M.J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10225-10229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Nop132 indicated that they were colocalized (Fig. 2a). In this experiment, Nop132 appears red, whereas the nucleolus is labeled green. Consistently, regions of red spots in DsRed-Nop132 (left panel) were colocalized with faintly stained regions in a DNA panel and dark regions of the nucleus in a phase image panel (right panel), which are characteristic findings for the nucleolus. Moreover, double labeling of HeLa cells with ANA-N and an affinity-purified antibody against Nop132 revealed a colocalization pattern, suggesting that Nop132 is mainly localized in the nucleolus (Fig. 2b). Consistently, RRAG A colocalized with Nop132 in BHK21 cells following transient transfection (Fig. 2c, right panel). Nop132 had a nuclear localization signal (958-976 aa) in its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1, a and b); consistently, the carboxyl terminus of Nop132 (827-1168 aa) localized within the nucleus (Fig. 2d, left panel). The carboxyl terminus of Nop132 also colocalized with RRAG A (Fig. 2d, right panel). As shown by the arrowheads in Fig. 2d, the carboxyl terminus of Nop132 and RRAG A were localized in a unique ring-like structure, which is similar to R-rings (18Isaac C. Yang Y. Meier U.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Isaac C. Pollard J.W. Meier U.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4253-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nop132 probably guided the formation of the R-rings in the nucleus, because RRAG A could not guide the formation of the R-rings. Only Nopp140 can guide the formation of the R-rings. Consistently, Nopp140 localized at the periphery of Nop132, suggesting that Nop132 and Nopp140 have similar roles in the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 2f). RRAG C also colocalized with Nop132 in BHK21 cells, although RRAG C in the nucleus localized at the periphery of Nop132 (Fig. 2e, right panel). When overexpressed by transient transfection, Nop132 sometimes colocalized with other nuclear structures, as indicated by colocalization of Nop132 with the proteins localized in the nuclear speckles such as Clk-1 and RNPS1 (Fig. 2, g and h). These findings suggest that Nop132 has multiple roles in the nucleus. Nop132 Interacts with Nip7—Nop132 has sequence similarity to yeast S. cerevisiae Nop8p (Fig. 1a). S. cerevisiae Gtr1p was used to determine whether it could bind to Nop8p. GST-Gtr1p and GST-Gtr2p were able to pull down in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled Nop8p (Fig. 3a, lanes 2 and 3). As a control, GST failed to pull down Nop8p (Fig. 3a, lane 1). GST-Gtr1p and GST-Gtr2p, which were prepared from the yeast cell lysate, pulled down HA-tagged Nop8p (data not shown). Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the region that interacts with Gtr1p resides within amino acid residues 201-484 of Nop8p (data not shown). Nop8p interacts with Nip7p in budding yeast (19Zanchin N.I. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2098518758,"The basic helix-loop-helix PAS (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors SIM1 and arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) are involved in the control of feeding behavior. Sim1 haploinsufficiency causes hyperphagia in mice and humans, most likely by perturbing the hypothalamus function. The administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a ligand of AHR, causes severe anorexia, which also appears to be of central origin. Both SIM1 and AHR require heterodimerization either with ARNT or ARNT2 to function. Here, we characterize the promoter for Sim1 and show that a consensus AHR-ARNT/2 binding site positively regulates its activity in the context of transfection experiments in Neuro-2A cells. A gel shift assay indicated that AHR-ARNT/2 can bind its putative site in the Sim1 promoter. Overexpression of Arnt, Arnt2, or Ahr increased the activity of a reporter construct containing the Sim1 promoter by 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, but failed to do so when the AHR-ARNT/2 binding site was mutated. Similarly, TCDD increased the activity of the reporter construct by 1.8-fold but not that of its mutated version. Finally, we found that TCDD increased Sim1 expression in Neuro-2A cells and in mouse kidney and hypothalamus by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively. We conclude that Sim1 expression is regulated by AHR-ARNT/2. This result raises the possibility that Sim1 mediates the effect of TCDD on feeding and points to a complex network of regulatory interactions between bHLH-PAS proteins. The basic helix-loop-helix PAS (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors SIM1 and arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) are involved in the control of feeding behavior. Sim1 haploinsufficiency causes hyperphagia in mice and humans, most likely by perturbing the hypothalamus function. The administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a ligand of AHR, causes severe anorexia, which also appears to be of central origin. Both SIM1 and AHR require heterodimerization either with ARNT or ARNT2 to function. Here, we characterize the promoter for Sim1 and show that a consensus AHR-ARNT/2 binding site positively regulates its activity in the context of transfection experiments in Neuro-2A cells. A gel shift assay indicated that AHR-ARNT/2 can bind its putative site in the Sim1 promoter. Overexpression of Arnt, Arnt2, or Ahr increased the activity of a reporter construct containing the Sim1 promoter by 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, but failed to do so when the AHR-ARNT/2 binding site was mutated. Similarly, TCDD increased the activity of the reporter construct by 1.8-fold but not that of its mutated version. Finally, we found that TCDD increased Sim1 expression in Neuro-2A cells and in mouse kidney and hypothalamus by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively. We conclude that Sim1 expression is regulated by AHR-ARNT/2. This result raises the possibility that Sim1 mediates the effect of TCDD on feeding and points to a complex network of regulatory interactions between bHLH-PAS proteins. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) 1The abbreviations used are: PVN, paraventricular nucleus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AHR, arylhydrocarbon receptor; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; DRE, dioxin-responsive element; RACE, rapid amplification of 5′cDNA ends; TSS, transcription start site; PAS, Per, ARNT, AHR, SIM homology domain; ARNT, Ah-receptor nuclear translocator; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor. of the hypothalamus contains neuroendocrine cells that are critical for the regulation of several physiological processes, including energy balance and blood pressure. Loss-of-function experiments in mice have shown that the bHLH-PAS transcription factor SIM1 is essential for the differentiation of PVN neurons (1Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T. May N.R. Fan C.-M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3264-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the absence of Sim1, virtually all PVN neurons fail to develop. Interestingly, whereas Sim1-homozygous mice die shortly after birth, presumably from the PVN defect, Sim1 heterozygous mice survive and develop hyperphagia and obesity (2Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Also, a balanced translocation interrupting SIM1 was found in a child with isolated hyperphagia and severe obesity (3Holder Jr., J.L. Butte N.F. Zinn A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 101-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the PVN is a key regulator of appetite and Sim1 is not expressed in other nuclei involved in the control of feeding, it has been proposed that PVN dysfunction causes the hyperphagia associated with Sim1 haploinsufficiency. Such a PVN dysfunction could be related to the developmental function of Sim1. Indeed, the PVN of Sim1 heterozygous mice is hypocellular (2Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sim1 is continuously and strongly expressed in the mature PVN, raising the possibility that it could also control feeding behavior physiologically. The arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR), another bHLH-PAS protein, also has the potential of affecting feeding behavior. The subcellular localization of AHR is determined by its interaction with small ligands, which include 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a toxic aromatic hydrocarbon produced in our industrial environment. Upon binding to TCDD, AHR is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it activates transcription of target genes (reviewed in Refs. 4Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 5Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 6Gu Y.Z.

Administration of a single sublethal dose of TCDD to rodents specifically induces anorexia without causing nausea or triggering other forms of behavior (reviewed in Refs. 7Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 483-549PubMed Google Scholar and 8Unkila M. Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other toxic effects of TCDD include thymic involution, immunosuppression, and various endocrine abnormalities. However, decreased food intake is the cause of the weight loss associated with acute TCDD toxicity and is a major contributor to the lethality observed at higher dose. Mutant analysis has confirmed that TCDD toxicity requires Ahr (9Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TCDD induces anorexia remains unknown, but there are some evidences that it might involve the hypothalamus (reviewed in Refs. 7Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto J. Pharmacol.

SIM1 and AHR belong to a group of proteins that need to heterodimerize with members of another group of bHLH-PAS proteins, of which only four representatives are as yet characterized: ARNT (10Hoffman C.

Mutant studies have established that heterodimerization of SIM1 with ARNT2 is required for PVN development (20Michaud J.L. DeRossi C. May N.R. Holdener B.C. Fan C.M. Mech.

Systematic investigations of DNA binding specificities of bHLH-PAS proteins have shown that a heterodimer composed of Drosophila SIM or mammalian SIM1 and ARNT preferentially binds to GT(G/A)CGTG, whereas mammalian AHR-ARNT preferentially binds to TNGCGTG, which defines the so-called dioxin-responsive element (DRE) (24Woods S.L.

Here, we characterize the Sim1 promoter and show that its activity is positively regulated by AHR-ARNT/2 and TCDD in cultured cells as well as in mice. These observations raise the possibility that Sim1 mediates the effect of TCDD on feeding behavior and suggest the existence of complex regulatory interactions between bHLH-PAS proteins. Constructs—Sim1 genomic fragments were generated by PCR from a mouse BAC clone and were inserted into pGL3-basic and pGL3-promoter expression vectors, which contain a luciferase reporter gene (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The DRE, located in the Sim1 5′ region, was mutated by using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Arnt and Ahr expression vectors were generous gifts from Drs. Yoshiaki Fujii-Kuriyama and Christopher Bradfield, respectively. The Arnt2 expression vector has been described previously (20Michaud J.L. DeRossi C. May N.R. Holdener B.C. Fan C.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Chemicals—TCDD was purchased from The National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Repository Midwest Research Institute. For cell culture experiments, it was dissolved in Me2SO and added to culture media at a final concentration of 10 nm when 40% confluence was reached (28Wang F. Samudio I. Safe S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Jeon M.S. Esser C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6975-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Fukunaga B.N.

MBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 48 h of incubation. For animal experiments, TCDD was dissolved in a corn oil/acetone mix (95%/5%, v/v) and administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 360 μg/kg to 5-month-old C57BL/6 male mice. RACE—Rapid amplification of 5′cDNA ends (RACE) analysis was performed by using the Clontech SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of total RNA. Touchdown PCR was then performed with Sim1 gene-specific primer GSP1 (5′-GTCCAGTT GGGAGGTGATGGCTGAGGG-3′). Nested PCR was performed with primers GSP2 (5′-CCGGGAAGACACGAATGATGGACAGG-3′) or GSP3 (5′-CCGCGGTAAGAACCCGGGTCCTTGGGA-3′). The nested PCR products were cloned into pLivSelect-PCR Cloning vector (Bio S&T Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and sequenced. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The Neuro-2A cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Neuro-2A (N2A) cells were maintained in minimum essential Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and Earle’s balanced salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Transfection was performed 24 h after seeding 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes using 2.0 μg of plasmid. In co-transfection experiments, 1.5 μg of each plasmid was used. All transfection experiments also included the pHβ plasmid (1 μg), which produces β-galactosidase. After overnight incubation, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured for 48 h. Cells were then scraped from the dishes, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer. Aliquots of the lysate were used for assay of β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was expressed as relative activity compared with that of control vectors and shown as the mean ± S.D. of three independent transient transfection experiments, each performed in duplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Mouse AHR, ARNT2, and SIM1 proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The reactions were carried out for 90 min at 30 °C. The relative amounts of the translated proteins were semi-quantified by visualization on 10% SDS-PAGE after incorporation of biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Promega). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done as described by Swanson et al. (27Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of dimerizing partners were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of TCDD (0.4 μm). Poly(dI-dC) (200 ng or 1.2 mg) and KCl (final concentration: 100 mm) were added to the protein mixture in a final volume of 10 μl, and incubation was carried out at room temperature for 10 min. In some instances, a 500-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was also added. End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm) was then added, and the sample was incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was submitted to electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide nondenaturing gel using 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) as the running buffer. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Each electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiment was performed independently three times. The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used were: D1, 5′-TCGAGCTGGGGGCATTGCGTGACATACC-3′; D2, 5′-TCGAGGTATGTCACGCAATGCCCCCAGC-3′; S1, 5′-AGCCGCGAGCCCAGTCGCGTGGGGGG-3′; S2, 5′-CCCCCCCCCACGCGACTGGGCTCGCG-3′; M1, 5′-AGCCGCGAGCCCAGTCGGGGGG-3′; M2, 5′-CCCCCCCCCACTGGGCTCGCG-3′. Oligonucleotides D1 and D2 contain a prototypical DRE that was characterized by Swanson et al. (27Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Single-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptase-PCR for detection of Ahr (32Moriguchi T. Motohashi H. Hosoya T. Nakajima O.

Primers for real-time PCR were designed using Primer3 software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research), subjected to a melting curve analysis, and then examined by standard PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis for correct product size. Quantitative PCR was performed using a Smart Cycler (Cepheid). For each reaction, 25 μl of SYBR-Green PCR, 1 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of each primer (5 μm), and 12.5 μl of SYBR-Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix (Sigma) were mixed together. Sim1 PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 15 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, for 45 cycles. The same conditions were used to amplify β-actin with the exception that the annealing temperature was 55 °C. Real-time PCR reactions using the same starting amount of RNA purified from the different tissues studied showed that TCDD did not change the level of β-actin expression. For each sample, reactions were performed in duplicate, and threshold cycle numbers were averaged. Sim1 expression was normalized to β-actin and -fold induction was calculated according to the formula described by Buckhaults et al. (35Buckhaults P. Rago C. St Croix B. Romans K.E. Saha S. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6996-7001PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used are: Sim1, 5′-CAAAATGAGAGTGGTCTTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGTAGATGAGAGCCGAGTTC-3′; β-actin, 5′-ACGTTGACATCCGTAAAGACCT-3′ and 5′-GCAGTAATCTCCTTCTGCATCC-3′. A 5′-RACE approach was used to map Sim1 transcription start site (TSS). A first round of amplification using primer GSP1, which sequence is located in the translated region, was followed by a round of nested amplification with either primer GSP2 or GSP3, located in the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1A). Nested PCRs using primers GSP2 and GSP3 generated fragments of 560 and 340 bp, respectively, from murine newborn kidney (Fig. 1B). Fragments of similar size were also obtained from embryonic brains obtained at 12.5 days post-coitus and newborn hypothalamus (data not shown). Sequencing of these nested amplification products indicated that the TSS is located 1121 nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon. Sequence analysis showed the presence of consensus TATA, GC, and CAAT boxes, respectively, 43, 94, and 133/164 bp upstream of the TSS (Fig. 1C). A high level of identity between mouse and human sequences (77%) was found over a segment of 184 bp located immediately 5′ to the TSS. We next cloned a 670-bp fragment (named fragment A), encompassing Sim1 TSS, upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (Fig. 2A). This construct was transiently transfected into N2A cells, which express Sim1, and luciferase activity was assayed (Fig. 2A). Fragment A increased luciferase activity over base line by 6-fold, indicating promoter activity. Deletion of 250 bp at the 3′ end of fragment A resulted in a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity, suggesting the existence of an element between positions -15 and +235 that inhibits promoter activity (Fig. 2A, fragment A2). Further deleting a 38-bp segment, which contained a potential TATA box, decreased the activity of the promoter by 60% (fragment A3), whereas a larger 3′ deletion removing the GC and CAAT boxes abolished promoter activity (fragment A4). Deletion of 322 bp at the 5′ end of fragment A was associated with low but detectable promoter activity (fragment A5). This series of deletion locates Sim1 minimal core promoter between position -178 and the TSS. Similar results were obtained with the 293 cell line, which also expresses Sim1 (data not shown). Fragment A4 had no promoter activity. However, fragment A4 contained a positive regulatory element because it increased the activity of a SV40 promoter by more than 3-fold in N2A cells, as shown by luciferase assay (Fig. 2B). Deletion of 47 bp at the 3′ end of the A4 fragment resulted in a 50% decrease of this stimulatory activity (Fig. 2B, fragment A6). We noticed that the consensus sequence of the DRE (TCGCGTG) was present in this 47-bp segment. Interestingly, deletion of 4 base pairs within this element (CGTG) decreased the stimulatory activity of fragment A4 on the SV40 promoter by 50%, strongly suggesting that this potential DRE corresponds to the positive regulatory element mapped to the 3′ end of fragment A4 (Fig. 2B). Consistently, introduction of the same 4-bp mutation in the A2 fragment (fragment A2m) decreased its promoter activity by 50% (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we identified a potential DRE that positively affects the activity of both SV40 and Sim1 basal promoters. It has been shown that the sequence flanking a consensus DRE can affect the binding of the AHR-ARNT/2 complex (25Shen S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6815-6819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lusska A. Shen Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AHR-ARNT complex binds the potential DRE found in fragment A, we performed mobility shift studies using in vitro translated AHR and ARNT2. We found that AHR-ARNT2 binds a 26-bp oligonucleotide that contains Sim1 DRE but not its mutated version (Fig. 3). Binding to Sim1 DRE was increased in the presence of TCDD, decreased in the presence of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, and unchanged in the presence of unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 3; not shown). To further address the contribution of the DRE to the regulation of Sim1 expression, the effect of Ahr, Arnt, or Arnt2 overexpression on the Sim1 promoter activity of fragment A2 was assessed in co-transfection experiments using N2A cells, in which these three genes are expressed (data not shown). Overexpression of Ahr, Arnt, and Arnt2 increased the promoter activity associated with fragment A2 by 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, but not that of its mutated version (A2m) in which the DRE has been destroyed (Fig. 4A). The addition of TCDD increased by itself the promoter activity associated with fragment A2 by 1.9-fold but had no effect on fragment A2m (Fig. 4B). Transfection of the Ahr expression vector in the presence of TCDD increased the promoter activity of fragment A2 by 2.4 ± 0.1-fold (not shown); this increase was 28% higher than that obtained in cotransfection experiments performed in the absence of TCDD. Although small, this difference is significant (p < 0.05). The lack of an important additive effect of Ahr overexpression and TCDD treatment would suggest that a component of the AHR-ARNT/2 complex or of the Sim1 promoter limits the effect of the DRE element on its activity, at least in the context of the construct used here. Altogether, these results provide functional evidence that AHR-ARNT/2 regulates Sim1 promoter. To explore the regulatory interaction between Ahr and Sim1 in vivo, we studied the effect of TCDD on Sim1 gene expression in N2A cells using quantitative real-time PCR. We observed that the addition of TCDD to N2A cells increased Sim1 mRNA levels by 4-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5C). We next examined Sim1 expression in the kidney and hypothalamus of C57BL/6 mice treated with a single dose of TCDD (360 μg/kg), which has been shown to cause severe hypophagia in mice from this strain (36Kelling C.K. Christian B.J. Inhorn S.L. Peterson R.E. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1985; 5: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed the efficiency of this dose by observing its effects in C57BL/6 mice over a 2-week period (Fig. 5, A and B). We next measured Sim1 expression levels in mice tissues 3 days after injection of TCDD or vehicle. A 3- and 2-fold increase of Sim1 expression in kidney and hypothalamus, respectively, was observed after TCDD administration (Fig. 5C). On the whole, we conclude that Sim1 expression is regulated in vivo by AHR-ARNT/2. AHR mediates at least two distinct sets of responses. First, AHR regulates an adaptive response pathway to environmental contaminants such as the polychlorinated dioxins that contaminate industrial chemicals (4Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 5Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 6Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Specifically, AHR up-regulates xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A1 that participate in the degradation and elimination of these toxins. Second, AHR mediates the toxic effects of these compounds. For instance, the administration of TCDD triggers a complex syndrome characterized by thymic involution, immunosuppression, endocrine abnormalities, and anorexia. Although it has been shown that Ahr is required for the toxicity of TCDD, little is known about the downstream molecular events that lead to its effect (9Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Our observation that Ahr acts upstream of Sim1 raises the possibility that the latter is involved in mediating the toxicity of TCDD and points to a complex hierarchal interactions between bHLH-PAS proteins. TCDD and the Control of Appetite—The mechanism underlying the effect of TCDD on feeding remains unknown but might involve the hypothalamus, in keeping with its central role in the control of appetite (reviewed in Ref. 7Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 483-549PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the intracerebroventricular injection of TCDD triggers an even stronger effect on appetite than when it is administered peripherally supports this possibility (37Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto L. Tuomisto J. Toxicology. 1989; 58: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence in fact suggest that Ahr can act in the PVN, a critical hypothalamic center regulating feeding behavior. First, Ahr, Arnt, and Arnt2 are expressed in the mature PVN (2Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 38Petersen S.L. Curran M.A. Marconi S.A. Carpenter C.D. Lubbers L.S. McAbee M.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 427: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, TCDD administered peripherally can induce the expression of Cyp1a1, a direct target of Ahr, in the hypothalamus by 6-fold within 1 day suggesting that it crosses the blood-brain barrier (39Huang P. Rannug A. Ahlbom E. Hakansson H. Ceccatelli S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 169: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Also, TCDD increases the expression of c-Fos in the PVN within 3 days after the administration of a single dose (40Cheng S.B. Kuchiiwa S. Nagatomo I. Akasaki Y. Uchida M. Tominaga M. Hashiguchi W. Kuchiiwa T. Nakagawa S. Brain Res. 2002; 931: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Third, various endocrine perturbations have been observed following the administration of TCDD, some of which were related to processes regulated by the PVN. For instance, chronic administration of TCDD results in an increase of corticotropin-releasing hormone and vasopressin production by the PVN (41Shridhar S. Farley A. Reid R.L. Foster W.G. Van Vugt D.A. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 63: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that TCDD can potentiate the secretion of oxytocin by PVN cells (42Pohjanvirta R. Unkila M. Tuomisto J. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1994; 47: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our finding that TCDD increases Sim1 transcript levels in the hypothalamus further supports the idea that TCDD can modulate gene expression in this structure. PVN dysfunction appears to underlie the hyperphagia associated with Sim1 haploinsufficiency. The fact that the PVN of Sim1+/- mice is hypocellular suggests that this dysfunction is of developmental origin. On the other hand, Sim1 is continuously expressed in the PVN postnatally, raising the possibility that it functions physiologically to control feeding. If this were indeed the case, appetite would then be remarkably sensitive to Sim1 levels because reduction of its gene dosage by 50% is sufficient to markedly increase food intake. Conversely, the 2-fold increase of its expression level in the hypothalamus following TCDD administration would be predicted to decrease feeding. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the induction of Sim1 expression by TCDD mediates, at least partially, its effect on feeding. Alternatively, Sim1 could mediate the effect of TCDD on other aspects of PVN function such as the secretion of hormones. Also, both the loss of AHR function and the administration of a hydrocarbon ligand of AHR disrupt nephrogenesis (43Falahatpisheh M.H. Ramos K.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2160-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sim1 is strongly expressed in the developing nephrons, and its expression in the kidney increases upon TCDD administration, as shown by our study. It is thus possible that Sim1 plays a role downstream of Ahr in the kidney. It is unclear whether AHR normally plays a physiological role in the control of feeding behavior in the absence of TCDD. AHR mutant mice were not reported to be thin nor obese, although on some backgrounds, their growth appears transiently decreased (44Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.

Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It will be particularly interesting to determine whether recently identified endogenous ligands for AHR have the same effect on feeding as TCDD and whether they also increase Sim1 expression (47Song J. Clagett-Dame M. Peterson R.E. Hahn M.E. Westler W.M. Sicinski R.R. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 48Denison M.S.

The analysis of such natural ligands may reveal some physiological functions of the Ahr pathway that were unraveled by mutant analysis. Regulatory Interactions between bHLH-PAS Proteins— bHLH-PAS proteins can cross-talk in a parallel manner to regulate target gene expression. First, the activity of two or more bHLH-PAS proteins can be modulated by the availability of a dimerizing partner for which they compete (23Probst M.R. Fan C.-M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Woods S.L. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Second, some bHLH-PAS heterodimers, such as HIF-ARNT and SIM1-ARNT, have the potential of binding to the same DNA sequence (24Woods S.L. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10236-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Third, two bHLH-PAS heterodimers can directly regulate the transcription of the same downstream gene by interacting with distinct regulatory elements as found for AHR-ARNT and HIF-ARNT, which both control the expression of the erythropoietin gene (53Chan W.K. Yao G. Gu Y.Z. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12115-12123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). bHLH-PAS proteins can also regulate their own expression or the expression of genes coding for other bHLH-PAS proteins. For instance, in the fly, SIM positively and directly regulates its own expression through interaction with TANGO, a homolog of ARNT (2Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Expression and mutant studies have shown that ARNT2 acts as the dimerizing partner of SIM1 during PVN development (20Michaud J.L. DeRossi C. May N.R. Holdener B.C. Fan C.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Hosoya T. Oda Y. Takahashi S. Morita M. Kawauchi S. Ema M. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

A. 2001; 98: 6692-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ARNT2 can also directly regulate Sim1 expression by forming a complex with AHR that binds a consensus DRE located upstream of the Sim1 promoter. However, we propose that AHR-ARNT2 is not required for basal or tissue-specific expression of Sim1 but provides an additional layer of regulation that modulates Sim1 levels. This mechanism of regulation could be critical for the physiological processes controlled by Sim1 or for TCDD toxicity. We thank Laurent Knafo for help with the real-time PCR assay and Chen-Ming Fan for critical reading of the manuscript."

The degradation of MyoD can occur via an NH2 terminus-dependent pathway or a lysine-dependent pathway, suggesting that MyoD ubiquitination may be driven by different mechanisms. To understand this process, deletion analysis was used to identify the region of MyoD that is required for rapid proteolysis in the lysine-dependent pathway. Here we report that the basic helix-loop-helix domain is required for ubiquitination and lysine-dependent degradation of MyoD in the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis in MyoD revealed that lysine 133 is the major internal lysine of ubiquitination. The half-life of the MyoD K133R mutant protein was longer than that of wild type MyoD, substantiating the implication of lysine 133 in the turnover of MyoD in myoblasts. In addition, the MyoD K133R mutant displayed activity 2–3-fold higher than the wild type in transactivation muscle-specific gene and myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that lysine 133 is targeted for ubiquitination and rapid degradation of MyoD in the lysine-dependent pathway and plays an integral role in compromising MyoD activity in the nucleus.

Ubiquitination and degradation of many proteins are essential for cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and development (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can also carry out various non-proteolytic functions, controlling activities as diverse as transcription, nucleotide excision repair, receptor internalization, and ribosome function (see review, Ref. 2Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of the target protein is mediated by a cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions that require a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that acts in the last step of the cascade (3Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin protein ligases regulate the timing and substrate specificity in protein degradation. MyoD is a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) 1The abbreviations used are: b-HLHbasic helix-loop-helixHAhemagglutininMCKmuscle creatine kinaseWTwild type.1The abbreviations used are: b-HLHbasic helix-loop-helixHAhemagglutininMCKmuscle creatine kinaseWTwild type. transcription factor that controls proliferation and differentiation (4Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MyoD induces myogenesis involves both the withdrawal from the cell cycle and the activation of muscle-specific genes expression (5Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 6Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The HLH domain is required for dimerization with the ubiquitously expressed E-proteins, and the basic domain is responsible for DNA binding. Heterodimers bind to the consensus E-box (CANNTG) DNA sequence motif found in the promoters of many muscle-specific genes (7Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Structurally, MyoD contains several functionally distinct domains responsible for transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling, and nuclear localization (8Gerber A.N. Klesert T.R. Bergstrom D. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Vandromme M. Cavadore J.-C. Bonnieu A. Froeschle A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrate a direct link between MyoD levels and cell cycle regulation (10Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M.

Cell Res. 2000; 259: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), development (12Megeney L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and regeneration (13Huijbregts J. White J.D. Ground M.D. Acta Histochem. 2001; 103: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this last process, MyoD is required for myogenic stem cell function in adult skeletal muscle (14Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The interplay between G1 cyclins and Cdk inhibitors on one hand and MyoD and its cofactors on the other hand plays a critical role in myoblast cell cycle withdrawal. Accurate synchronization of dividing myoblasts revealed that MyoD is subject to specific cell cycle-dependent regulation (see review, Ref. 15Kitzmann M. Fernandez A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Specific phosphorylation of MyoD at serine 200 implies that Cdk2-cyclin E and up-regulation of its inhibitors (p57kip2 and p21cip1) control MyoD levels and subsequent myoblast cell cycle progression or exit into differentiation (11Tintignac L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The signal-inducing phosphorylation of MyoD leads to its degradation by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway that includes CDC34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity (E2) (18Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent data have shown that MyoD could be regulated independently of its phosphorylation state, implicating other(s) recognition signal(s), mechanism(s), or multiprotein complexes. For example, up-regulation of the cyclin-Cdk inhibitor p57KIP2 stabilizes MyoD by direct interaction with MyoD (19Reynaud E.G. Leibovitch M.-P. Tintignac L.A.J. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18767-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas in a cell-free system specific DNA binding stabilizes MyoD (20Abu-Hatoum O.A Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro MyoD is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HeLa nucleoplasm (21Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MyoD could be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system via two distinct pathways, an NH2 terminus-dependent pathway (22Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and a lysine-dependent pathway (23Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MyoD appears to be ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus (23Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but the molecular determinants and the factors necessary for ubiquitination and targeting of MyoD to the proteasome are not well known.In the present work we have studied the regions of MyoD that target it for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We show that the NH2-terminal residue is not essential for conjugation and degradation of nuclear MyoD. Ubiquitination of MyoD implies lysine 133. Preventing ubiquitination at this site by mutation (K133R) leads to stabilization of the MyoD protein. We demonstrate that the MyoD mutant protein K133R shows both a higher activity in transactivating muscle-specific gene expression and a greater ability to convert 10T1/2 cells to muscle cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the ubiquitination of MyoD on lysine 133 may serve two functions in signaling protein degradation by the proteasome and in regulation of the transcriptional activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—MG132 (N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal), chloroquine, E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino)-butane) were purchased from Sigma. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone was purchased from Calbiochem. 35S-translabel was obtained from ICN.Plasmid Constructs—pEMSV-MyoD was a generous gift from the Weintraub laboratory. Expression vector pcDNA3-HA was generated by cloning three hemagglutinin epitope tags (3 HA) at the amino terminus of the MyoD cDNA insert in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The reporter plasmid MCK-Luc (p1256 MCK), generously provided by S. Hauscka, contains the promoter-enhancer region from the mouse muscle creatine kinase.Expression vectors pcDNA3-HA-MyoD 2–114 and pcDNA3-HA-MyoD 173–318 were obtained by inserting in-frame an EcoRI-XbaI fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction using pEMSV-MyoD as template into the EcoRI-XbaI site of the pcDNA3-HA expression plasmid. Expression vector pcDNA3-HA-b-HLH was obtained by inserting in-frame the MyoD insert BssHII-NarI filled by the Klenow polymerase fragment into the EcoRI-filled site of the pCMV-HA expression plasmid. All lysine-mutated species of MyoD were generated in the laboratory of K. Breitschopf and were obtained from Dr. A. Harel-Bellan. Inserts were subcloned in pcDNA3-HA expression vector.Site-specific Mutagenesis of MyoD Protein—MyoD mutants were obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Cultures, DNA Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The fibroblastic cell line 10T1/2 was maintained in growth medium supplemented with antibiotics (a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin; Invitrogen) and with 15% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 10T1/2 cells were transfected by using jetPEI (Qbiogene). Briefly, 3 × 104 cells/well were plated onto 24-well plates. On the following day, cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids as indicated in legends of the figures. The total amount of DNA used for each plate was normalized with the respective empty expression vehicle. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was determined using 10-μl aliquots of cell extracts from harvested cells in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) with equivalent quantities of proteins in triplicate. The experiments were repeated at least twice.Metabolic Labeling—Cell cultures were incubated for one hour in methionine-free medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum followed by incubation for 30 min in the same medium with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Trans 35S label; ICN). In cold-chase experiments, the [35S]methionine-labeled cultures were rinsed with fresh medium supplemented with 10 mm non-radioactive methionine and 15% fetal calf serum and harvested at appropriate times. For immunoprecipitation of HA-MyoD, cells were lysed as described as below.Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analyses—For immunoprecipitation, precleared cell lysates in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm Na-orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 3 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes bound to protein G-Sepharose were collected by centrifugation and washed several times in IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (35S-labeled proteins) and autoradiography.For ubiquitination, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% NaDoc, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Then cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies.For immunoblot analyses, total cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay-EDTA buffer and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes, they were blocked with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% skimmed milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: polyclonal anti-MyoD (C20) diluted 1/500, monoclonal anti-Ub (P4D1) diluted 1/1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) diluted 1/1000 (Roche Applied Science), monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) diluted 1/5000 (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-Troponin T (JLT-12) diluted 1/300 (Sigma). Nitrocellulose membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with a peroxysase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/10,000 for blots with polyclonal primary antibodies or 1/4,000 with blots using monoclonal primary antibodies. After several washes, membranes were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were exposed with Agfa Curix RP2 films.Cycloheximide Treatment—10T1/2 cells were transfected with expression vectors in 6-well plates as described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized, pooled, and redistributed in the number of necessary wells for the experiment in order to homogenize the transfection for the half-life determination. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at 50 μg/ml for the indicated times and harvested for Western blot analyses. HA-MyoD-wt and the derivatives were detected using anti-HA antibodies (12CA5). For each experiment, α-tubulin was used as an internal control. Western blots were scanned and quantified using Gel Scan (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—An in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed in a reconstituted cell-free system as described previously (11Tintignac L. Leibovitch M.-P. Kitzman M. Fernandez A. Ducommun B. Meijer L. Leibovitch S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro translated 35S-labeled MyoD-wt and/or the various mutants were incubated with 10T1/2 cell extracts (5 mg/ml) in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 5 mm ATP) together with 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 mg/ml ubiquitin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a proteasome inhibitor mixture (1 μm okadaic acid, 25 μm MG132, and 25 μm clastro-lactacystin β-lactone). The reactions (10 μl) were carried out at 37 °C for 0, 30, and 60 min and were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and fluorography.Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%) for 30 min and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were immunostained with anti-HA, anti-C-20, or anti-Troponin T antibodies. The Texas red-conjugated F(ab)′2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG or the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab)′2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG were used to visualize the mouse monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the NH2-terminal residue has been implicated in conjugation and degradation of the protein in vitro and in COS cells (22Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway by MG132 resulted in accumulation of ubiquitylated MyoD protein in which three HA tags replaced the NH2-terminal Met residue in 10T1/2 cells (11Tintignac L. Leibovitch M.-P. Kitzman M. Fernandez A. Ducommun B. Meijer L. Leibovitch S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that the NH2 terminus-blocked (6× Myc-tagged) species of MyoD are degraded via ubiquitination of internal lysines (23Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that two distinct pathways mediate ubiquitination and degradation of MyoD: an NH2 terminus-dependent pathway and a lysine-dependent ubiquitination pathway. First we investigated whether three HA tags could modify MyoD turnover in vivo. We transiently expressed untagged MyoD (MyoD-wt) and 3HA-tagged MyoD (HA-MyoD) in 10T1/2 cells. The amount of newly synthesized MyoD was measured by immunoprecipitation analysis with the anti-MyoD polyclonal antibody (C20) in [35S]methionine pulse-labeled cells. The localization and the amounts of MyoD did not differ significantly between untagged MyoD-wt and HA-MyoD. (Fig. 1, A and B). We then compared the rates of degradation of the MyoD proteins. 10T1/2 cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the amount of MyoD at various times was determined by Western blot analysis. When analyzed by pulse-chase experiments and/or cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 1C), the half-life of MyoD-wt was ∼50 min (24Benayoun B. Pelpel K. Solhonne B. Guillier M. Leibovitch S.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and that of HA-MyoD was roughly identical (45 and 50 min, respectively), indicating that the replacement of the NH2-terminal Met residue by the 3× HA tag does not noticeably affect the stability of MyoD in vivo. These data suggest that the NH2 terminus-dependent pathway and the lysine-dependent pathway have the same activity in the nuclear degradation of MyoD.The b-HLH Domain Is Implicated for Ubiquitination and Degradation of MyoD—To determine which region is required for the proteolysis of nuclear MyoD, we constructed a panel of MyoD deletion mutants. The expression constructs were transiently expressed in 10T1/2 cells, and the localization and the stability of MyoD proteins were determined 48 h later. As shown in Fig. 2, the NH2 (MyoD 2–114, which contains only a part of nuclear localization sequence 1; Ref. 23Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the COOH domains of MyoD (MyoD 173–318) were found exclusively in the cytoplasm. They showed a half-life of ∼75 and 130 min, respectively, and were stable with regard to MyoD-wt. In contrast, the central domain of MyoD (amino acids 83–172, termed b-HLH-MyoD) was found exclusively in the nucleus, and the half-life was reduced to ∼10 min. These data suggest that, independent of the serine 200 previously shown to be implicated in the modulation of the half-life and the myogenic activity of MyoD (16Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. . Labbé J.-C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), MyoD stability seems to be governed by the action of various elements: the NH2 and COOH domains that promote MyoD stabilization and the b-HLH domain that promotes MyoD destruction.Fig. 2Deletion analysis of MyoD protein turnover. 10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid pcDNA3-HA-MyoD or the indicated deletion mutations. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to the medium for 30, 90, and 180 min, respectively. MyoD protein levels were determined by immunoblotting as described in Fig. 1C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether b-HLH-MyoD was subject to specific lysine-dependent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We first compared the localization and the half-lives of b-HLH-MyoD and the lysine-less b-HLH MyoD in which Lys-99, -102, -104, -112, -124, -133, and -146 are mutated to arginine (Fig. 3A). These b-HLH MyoD constructs were transfected in 10T/1/2 cells and 48 h later were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Wild type b-HLH-MyoD and the lysineless b-HLH MyoD were both localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). The rates of degradation of MyoD proteins were compared in cycloheximide-treated 10T1/2 cells as described in Fig. 1. As previously shown in Fig. 2, b-HLH-MyoD was degraded with a half-life of about 10 min, which was found to be markedly increased to 60 min in the lysine-less b-HLH MyoD (Fig. 3B). Finally, we examined the effect of different protease inhibitors on the amount of b-HLH-MyoD in transiently transfected cells. Addition of MG132 or lactacystin, two specific inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome (3Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), induced an accumulation of the b-HLH-MyoD protein, whereas the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 or chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteolysis, was ineffective (Fig. 3C). Addition of MG132 or lactacystin induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of b-HLH-MyoD. In contrast, mutation of all the lysine residues rendered ineffective the addition of MG132 or lactacystin and blocked ubiquitination of lysine-less b-HLH-MyoD (Fig. 3, D and E). These data strongly suggest that the b-HLH domain contains the lysine(s) implicated in MyoD ubiquitination and destabilization.Fig. 3Implication of the b-HLH domain in the lysine-dependent degradation of MyoD.A, schematic diagram of the lysine residues located in the b-HLH domain of MyoD protein. B, b-HLH MyoD and the lysine-less b-HLH MyoD were transfected into 10T1/2 cells; 48 h later, cells were visualized by immunofluorescence or treated by cycloheximide. Both proteins were localized in the nucleus. C, 10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with empty expression vector (lane 1) or with pcDNA3-HA-b-HLH MyoD (lanes 2–7). Cells were grown for 48 h in proliferative medium and untreated (lane 2) or treated with Me2SO (lane 3), 30 μm MG132 (lane 4), 100 μm chloroquine (lane 5), 30 μm E64 (lane 6), or 10 μm lactacystin (lane 7). Cell lysates were prepared 5 h later, and 50 μg of total proteins were subjected to Western blot with anti-HA antibodies (left panel). 500 μg of total cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-MyoD antibodies; then ubiquitin-MyoD conjugates were identified in immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibodies (right panel). D, 10T1/2 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors coding for the lysine-less b-HLH MyoD and HA-ubiquitin and treated as in panel C. 500 μg of total cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-MyoD antibodies; ubiquitin-MyoD conjugates were identified in immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies. No ubiquitination of the lysine-less b-HLH MyoD protein was observed after MG132 treatment of transfected cells.

From the data presented above, our results suggest that the lysine-dependent degradation pathway of MyoD implicates lysine residues located between amino acids 83 and 172 in the b-HLH domain. Lysines at position 99, 102, and 104 of MyoD, the major acetylation determinants essential for muscle differentiation (26Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Moll. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), are probably not implicated in ubiquitination because although acetylation of MyoD increased during differentiation, the turnover of MyoD is not modified in differentiated myotubes (25Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the context of the full-length MyoD molecule and to map more precisely the lysine residue(s) implicated in the ubiquitination of MyoD, point mutants in which lysines are progressively replaced by arginines starting at the NH2 terminus were used in in vivo and in vitro experiments (Fig. 4A). As suggested by the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the replacement of the five lysines (at positions 58, 99, 102, 104, and 112) did not affect either the half-life or the ubiquitination of MyoD in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4, A–C). Additional mutation of lysine 124 did not significantly modify the detection of MyoD conjugation to ubiquitin in the form of high molecular weight polyubiquitin conjugates nor the half-life (∼50 min). In contrast, the level of polyubiquitin conjugation was markedly affected by replacement of lysine 133 to arginine 133 and the half-life of mutant 3 was significantly increased (up to 180 min). Additional mutation of lysine 146 in mutant 4 did not noticeably modify these findings. Because mutated lysines are located within the nuclear localization signals (9Vandromme M. Cavadore J.-C. Bonnieu A. Froeschle A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we looked at the cellular distribution of the MyoD mutants. Immunofluorescent experiments confirmed that all the mutants are properly shuttled and retained in the nucleus (Fig. 4A and data not shown). However, as previously shown (26Sartorelli V. Puri P.L.

Point mutations in which the lysines were replaced to arginines were introduced sequentially as indicated (e.g. in mutant 1, lysines 58, 99, 102, and 104 are replaced to arginines). The half-lives of the MyoD wt and the MyoD mutants were carried out as described in Fig 1C. B, 10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-MyoD and/or the MyoD mutants 1–4 together with pCMV-HA-ubiquitin and grown for 48 h in proliferative medium before treatment with 30 μm MG132.

TAFIa is a labile enzyme that can be inactivated by conformational instability or proteolysis. TAFI is ∼40% identical to pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB). In contrast to TAFIa, pancreatic CPB is a stable protease. We hypothesized that regions or residues that are not conserved in TAFIa compared with pancreatic CPB play a role in the conformational instability of TAFIa and that replacement of these non-conserved residues with residues of pancreatic CPB would lead to a TAFIa molecule with an increased stability. Therefore, we have expressed, purified, and characterized two TAFI-CPB chimeras: TAFI-CPB-(293–333) and TAFI-CPB-(293–401). TAFI-CPB-(293–333) could be activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin, but not as efficiently as wild-type TAFI. After activation, this mutant was unstable and was hardly able to prolong clot lysis of TAFI-deficient plasma. Binding of TAFI-CPB-(293–333) to both plasminogen and fibrinogen was normal compared with wild-type TAFI. TAFI-CPB-(293–401) could be activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin, although at a lower rate compared with wild-type TAFI. The activated mutant displayed a markedly prolonged half-life of 1.5 h.

The coagulation system is a potent mechanism that prevents blood loss after vascular injury. It consists of a number of linked enzymatic reactions resulting in thrombin generation. Thrombin converts soluble fibrinogen into a fibrin clot. The central protein of the fibrinolytic system, plasmin, dissolves the blood clot by degrading the fibrin polymers into soluble fragments.

Activated TAFI (TAFIa) down-regulates fibrinolysis, presumably by removing C-terminal lysines from fibrin that is already partially degraded by plasmin. Those lysines act as ligands for the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Removal of the lysines attenuates the fibrin cofactor function of t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation, resulting in prevention of accelerated plasmin formation and consequently down-regulation of fibrinolysis (6Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TAFI is, in analogy to other carboxypeptidases such as pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B, proteolytically activated by thrombin or plasmin by cleavage at Arg92, which results in release of the activation peptide from the catalytic domain (7Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6688-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TAFI is classified as a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase subfamily. The pancreatic metallocarboxypeptidases playing a role in the digestive system are the best characterized members of this group. According to their substrate specificity, they are referred to as carboxypeptidase A, which preferentially hydrolyzes aliphatic C-terminal residues, or carboxypeptidase B (CPB), which, like TAFIa, preferentially hydrolyzes C-terminal basic amino residues. TAFI shows ∼40% identity to pancreatic procarboxypeptidases; and upon activation, TAFI exerts CPB-like activity. Residues of carboxypeptidases A and B that have been implicated in catalysis (Glu271 and Arg125; residue numbering of TAFIa), substrate binding (Arg143, Tyr249, and Asn142), and zinc binding (His67, Glu70, and His196) are conserved in the 309-amino acid catalytic domain of TAFIa (7Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of Asp257 may determine the specificity for basic amino acids. TAFI is synthesized in the liver as a prepropeptide consisting of 423 amino acids (7Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P.

Despite all the similarities between TAFI and pancreatic pro-CPB, pancreatic CPB is, in contrast to TAFIa, a stable protease (13Burgos F.J. Salva M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that regions or residues that are not conserved in TAFI compared with pancreatic pro-CPB play a role in the conformational instability of TAFIa and that replacement of these non-conserved residues of TAFI with the corresponding ones of pancreatic CPB would lead to a TAFIa molecule with an increased stability. Several mutant forms of TAFIa with variations in the Arg302–Arg330 region have an altered stability. Recently, a naturally occurring variation was found at position 325 (Thr325 or Ile325) in human TAFI (14Brouwers G.J. Vos H.L. Leebeek F.W. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M.L.

The isoleucine residue at position 325 extends the half-life of TAFIa from 8 to 15 min at 37 °C. The Ile325 variant also exhibits an increased antifibrinolytic potential of TAFIa compared with the Thr325 variant (14Brouwers G.J. Vos H.L. Leebeek F.W. Bulk S. Schneider M. Boffa M. Koschinsky M.L.

Interestingly, mutations at positions 302, 320, and 330 all have a negative effect on the stability of TAFIa, and the variation at position 325 lies between these residues (9Boffa M. Wang W.

Therefore, we expressed, purified, and analyzed two TAFI-CPB chimeric proteins in which parts of this C-terminal region of TAFI were replaced with the corresponding ones of pancreatic CPB.

Hippuryl-Arg and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Porcine pancreatic CPB was from Roche Applied Science (Almere, The Netherlands), and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor was from Calbiochem. Thrombin was a generous gift from Dr. W. Kisiel (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM), plasmin from Dr. A. Reijerkerk (University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands), and pancreatic pro-CPB cDNA from Drs. N. Dekker and M.

The cDNA of human pancreatic pro-CPB was used in a PCR to amplify the fragment encoding amino acids 288–327 (pro-CPB numbering) using the forward primer GCA TGC ACT CGT ACT CCC AAA TGA TG and the reverse primer CCA TGG CCA TAT GTG TAC TTG GTG C, introducing an SphI and an NcoI cleavage site (underlined), respectively.

The PCRs (100 μl) contained ∼100 pmol of each primer, 250 μm dNTPs, 2 ng of template DNA, and 5 units of Pwo polymerase. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles. The PCR products were cloned into TOPO ZeroBlunt (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The fragments were digested with SphI and NcoI (CPB-(288–327)) or SphI and KpnI (CPB-(288–395)) out of the respective TOPO vectors and ligated into pfastBacTAFI. This resulted in two chimeric constructs in which the base pairs encoding amino acids 293–333 and 293–401 of TAFI, respectively, were replaced with the base pairs encoding the corresponding amino acid residues of pancreatic CPB. The TAFI-CPB chimeras were excised from the vectors using XbaI and KpnI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Both constructs were confirmed by sequencing and were found to contain the Thr147 isoform of TAFI. Our wild-type TAFI contained the Thr147 and Thr325 isoforms. The constructs were used to make stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells as described (16Meijers J.C.M. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stably expressing clones were cultured to confluency in a cell factory, and the medium was changed to UltraCHO (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and harvested twice a week. The recombinant chimeras were named TAFI-CPB-(293–333) and TAFI-CPB-(293–401). Purification of TAFI and TAFI-CPB Chimeras—TAFI was purified essentially as described (10Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture media were applied to a PD-10 Sephadex G-25M column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which an antibody against TAFI (monoclonal antibody Nik-9H10) was coupled. The columns were equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Unbound and nonspecifically bound proteins were washed away with 0.5 m NaCl in TBS, and bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. The eluted fractions were collected in 1/10 (v/v) 1 m Tris, pH 9; pooled and diluted three times in H2O; and applied to a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which an antibody against human serum albumin was coupled. The flow-through was applied to a protein G-Sepharose column. Both columns were equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The flow-through was applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Samples were analyzed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing a single band of ∼60 kDa were pooled. Concentrations were determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. TAFI Activation and TAFIa Activity Assay—The assay was basically carried out as described (17Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To follow the activation and inactivation of TAFI over time, TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), or TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (12.5 nm; all concentrations are final concentrations) was added to a premixture of thrombin (16 nm) and thrombomodulin (32 nm) or plasmin (100 nm), both in the presence of CaCl2 (10 mm), in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. To measure the rate of activation, 12.5 nm TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), or TAFI-CPB-(293–401), 8 nm thrombin, 16 nm thrombomodulin, and 5 mm CaCl2 were used; and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C. At several time points, 20-μl samples were withdrawn and added to 50 μl of a mixture of PPACK (30 μm) or aprotinin (25 μg/ml) to stop thrombin or plasmin activity, respectively, and hippuryl-Arg (21.4 mm) as a substrate. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, substrate conversion was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1 m HCl. Then, o-methylhippuric acid (22.5 μm) was added as an internal standard, and both o-methylhippuric acid and hippuric acid were extracted using a solid-phase extraction unit (Waters Oasis, Wexford, Ireland) according to the supplier's recommendation, and samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (17Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TAFIa activity is expressed in units/liter. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of substrate/min at 37 °C under the conditions described (17Schatteman K.A. Goossens F.J. Scharpé S.S. Neels H.M. Hendriks D.F. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Clot Lysis Assay—The clot lysis assay was performed essentially as described previously (18Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70 μl of citrated human TAFI-deficient plasma (TdP) (19Marx P.F. Wagenaar G.T.M. Reijerkerk A. Tiekstra M.J. Van Rossum A.G. Gebbink M.F. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was mixed with various concentrations of TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), TAFI-CPB-(293–401), or porcine pancreatic CPB. The volumes were adjusted to 100 μl with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; (25 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, and 3.5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For some experiments, TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (1.7 μm) was pre-activated by incubation with thrombin (17 nm), thrombomodulin-Sepharose (∼400 pmol of thrombomodulin/ml of Sepharose was coupled, and 20 μl of a 1:4 slurry of beads/HBS was added to the reaction mixture, giving a final concentration of maximally 27 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm). The volume was adjusted to 60 μl with HBS, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 30 min. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged for 1 min, and various volumes of the supernatant were added in the lysis assay. To check if activation of TAFI-CPB-(293–401) had occurred, a sample was also measured in the activity assay described above. The activation mixture (thrombomodulin-Sepharose, thrombin, and CaCl2 in HBS) without TAFI-CPB-(293–401) was used as a control. For the clot lysis assay, a mixture (50 μl) of thrombin (final concentration in assay of 20 nm), CaCl2 (final concentration in assay of 10 mm), and t-PA (final concentration in assay of 30 units/ml) was added to the plasma. The volume was adjusted to 150 μl with HBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The experiments were done in the presence or absence of 5 μl of carboxypeptidase inhibitor (7.8 μm). To determine the plasmin concentration required for clot lysis, fibrinogen (2 mg/ml) was mixed with thrombin (20 nm), CaCl2 (10 mm), and various concentrations of plasmin (0–200 nm), and the volume was adjusted to 150 μl with HBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For all experiments, samples (100 μl) were transferred to a microtiter plate, and turbidity was measured over time at 37 °C at 405 nm in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The clot lysis time is defined as the time at which half-maximal lysis occurred. Affinities of Anti-TAFI Antibodies for TAFI and TAFI-CPB Chimeras—TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (3 μg/ml) were immobilized overnight at 4 °C on a 96-well plate (Maxisorp, Nunc International). The wells were blocked by incubation with blocking buffer (TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin; 200 μl/well) at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples of a sheep anti-TAFI polyclonal antibody or a mouse anti-TAFI monoclonal antibody (Nik-9H10) (0–10 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) were allowed to bind to the immobilized proteins at room temperature for 1.5 h. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody or a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-mouse antibody, respectively, diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (100 μl/well) at room temperature for 1 h. After a final washing step, peroxidase activity was detected with o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) in phosphate/citrate buffer (100 mm Na2HPO4 and 50 mm citric acid, pH 5.0) with 0.035% H2O2 (100 μl/well). Color was allowed to develop, after which the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 m sulfuric acid to each well (50 μl/well), and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. The data were analyzed by fitting to the one-site binding equation: Y = Bmax·X/(KD + X), where Bmax is the maximal binding, and KD is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding. Fibrinogen Binding—Fibrinogen (1 μg/ml in 50 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.6; 100 μl/well) was immobilized overnight at 4 °C on a 96-well plate (Maxisorp). The wells were blocked by incubation with blocking buffer (200 μl/well) at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples of TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (0–1.7 μm, 100 μl/well) were allowed to bind to the immobilized fibrinogen at room temperature for 1.5 h. In a separate experiment, TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (0–167 nm) were incubated with thrombin (20 nm), thrombomodulin (5 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) prior to binding to fibrinogen. The volume was adjusted to 180 μl with TBS. At different time points, thrombin activity was stopped by addition of 60 μl of PPACK (final concentration of 37.5 μm). Samples (100 μl/well, in duplicate) of these incubation mixtures were then allowed to bind to the immobilized fibrinogen. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with a sheep anti-TAFI polyclonal antibody (3 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (100 μl/well) at room temperature for 1 h. After a final washing step, peroxidase activity was detected with o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) in phosphate/citrate buffer with 0.035% H2O2 (100 μl/well). Color was allowed to develop, after which the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 m sulfuric acid to each well (50 μl/well), and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. To investigate the binding of fibrinogen in solution to TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) that had been incubated previously with thrombin, thrombomodulin, and CaCl2 as described above, fibrinogen (3 μg/ml) was added to the pre-activated samples, and complex formation was allowed for 30 min at room temperature. Samples (100 μl/well, in duplicate) were then transferred to a 96-well plate on which a rabbit anti-fibrinogen antibody (3 μg/ml) had been immobilized, and the same procedure as described above was followed to detect binding. The data were analyzed (except for the binding of the TAFIa forms) by fitting to the one-site binding equation (see above). Plasminogen Binding—Plasminogen was purified as described (20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). To study the binding of TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) to plasminogen, the same procedure as described for fibrinogen binding was used, with the following modifications. The wells were coated with plasminogen (3 μg/ml). Samples of TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (0–333 nm, 100 μl/well, at least in duplicate) were allowed to bind to the immobilized plasminogen, and binding was detected using mouse anti-TAFI monoclonal antibody Nik-9H10 (3 μg/ml) and a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The data were analyzed by fitting to the one-site binding equation (see above). Binding Studies Using a BIAcore 2000 Biosensor System—Plasminogen and fibrinogen were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB) according to the supplier's recommendation. Plasminogen and fibrinogen were applied in 10 mm NaAc, pH 3.1. Immobilization of plasminogen and fibrinogen on the chip resulted in increases in the resonance signal of ∼1750 and ∼2600 resonance units, respectively. Binding studies were done using 10 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 25 μl/min at 25 °C. The KD values were calculated using software provided with the instrument. TAFI-CPB Chimeras—To determine regions that are important for the conformational instability of TAFIa, we constructed two TAFI-CPB chimeras, TAFI-CPB-(293–333) and TAFI-CPB-(293–401), in which amino acids 293–333 and 293–401, respectively, were replaced with the corresponding residues of pancreatic CPB (Fig. 1). As a result, 28 of the 41 amino acids in sequence 293–333 were mutated in TAFI-CPB-(293–333) compared with wild-type TAFI, including the major thrombin cleavage site in TAFIa, Arg302, which is a Tyr residue in pancreatic CPB; and this chimera was 1 amino acid shorter than wild-type TAFI. TAFI-CPB-(293–401) contained another 31 extra amino acid changes in addition to the ones also present in TAFI-CPB-(293–333), again including the R302Y mutation, and included the same total number of amino acids as wild-type TAFI. In both chimeras, the polymorph residue 325 is a Ser residue. The constructs were stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, and the chimeric proteins were purified from culture media. The two chimeras were characterized and compared with recombinant human TAFI. Activation of TAFI by the Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Complex—TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) were incubated with the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex at 37 °C. At various time points, samples were removed; the reactions were stopped by addition of PPACK; and TAFIa activity was measured using hippuryl-Arg as a substrate. TAFI-CPB-(293–333) was activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin, but not as efficiently as wild-type TAFI. Under these conditions, the maximal TAFIa activity of TAFI and TAFI-CPB-(293–333) was reached by ∼1 min, after which it decreased (Fig. 2A). TAFI-CPB-(293–401) was activated at a lower rate than wild-type TAFI, and TAFIa-CPB-(293–401) was far more stable than wild-type TAFIa. To study the rate of activation of TAFI and the TAFI-CPB chimeras in more detail, the system had to be modified to slow down the reaction by reducing the concentration of thrombin and thrombomodulin and by incubating the reaction mixtures at 4 °C. The rates of activation of TAFI-CPB-(293–333) (8 ± 1 units/liter s–1) and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) (0.3 ± 0.1 units/liter s–1) were ∼4 and ∼100 times lower, respectively, than that of TAFI (32 ± 7 units liter–1 s–1) (Fig. 2B). Stability of TAFIa, TAFIa-CPB-(293–333), and TAFIa-CPB-(293–401)—To investigate the stability of the various TAFIa enzymes, TAFI and TAFI-CPB-(293–333) were activated for 1 min and TAFI-CPB-(293–401) for 10 min by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, after which thrombin activity was or was not inhibited by addition of PPACK. In the absence of PPACK, both proteolytic and conformational inactivation could take place. In the presence of PPACK, proteolytic inactivation of TAFIa by thrombin was prevented, whereas spontaneous inactivation could still proceed. The samples were kept at 37 °C to allow spontaneous conformational inactivation. The rate of TAFIa and TAFIa-CPB-(293–333) inactivation (Fig. 3A and Table I) and TAFIa-CPB-(293–401) inactivation (Fig. 3B and Table I) in the presence of PPACK did not differ from the rate of inactivation in the absence of PPACK (Fig. 3A and Table I). The half-life of TAFIa-CPB-(293–333) (0.9 ± 0.2 min) was reduced and that of TAFIa-CPB-(293–401) (96 ± 29 min) was prolonged compared with wild-type TAFIa (2.9 ± 0.2 min).Table IHalf-lives of TAFI, TAFI-CPB-(293–333), and TAFI-CPB-(293–401)t½-PPACK+PPACKminminTAFI3.3 ± 0.52.9 ± 0.2TAFI-CPB-(293-333)1.2 ± 0.040.9 ± 0.2TAFI-CPB-(293-401)115 ± 2296 ± 29 Open table in a new tab The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex cleaves TAFI (∼55 kDa) at Arg92, releasing the activation peptide (∼19 kDa; not visible on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels) from the catalytic domain (36 kDa). The catalytic domain is degraded further by cleavage at Arg302, resulting in fragments of 25 and 11 kDa. The major thrombin cleavage site (Arg302), however, is mutated to a Tyr residue in both TAFI-CPB-(293–333) and TAFI-CPB-(293–401). SDS-PAGE analysis of samples of the activation mixtures revealed that t"

L., Ye, R. D., and Pan, Z. K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 40977-40981). Here we present evidence that RhoA associates specifically with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc in human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with fMLP and that Lbc specifically catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RhoA in human peripheral blood monocytes. Cotransfection of the monocytic THP1 cells with lbc with a κB promoter reporter plasmid results in a marked increase in NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression. Finally, Lbc-enhanced NF-κB activation is inhibited by a RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum. A dominant-negative form of RhoA (T19N) also inhibited Lbc-enhanced reporter gene expression in a κB-dependent manner. These results indicate that guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc is a novel signal transducer for RhoA-mediated NF-κB activation in human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with bacterial products.

Leukocyte infiltration is characteristic of inflammatory reaction to tissue injuries caused by trauma, invasion of foreign particles, ischemia-reperfusion, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions. This process begins with activation of leukocytes by a collection of cell-attracting chemicals termed chemoattractants.

However, the signaling mechanisms utilized by chemoattractants to activate NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes are poorly defined.fMLP stimulates peripheral blood mononuclear cells to express a defined set of gene products, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. Pretreatment of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with pertussis toxin abolishes fMLP-stimulated cytokine synthesis, suggesting that a Gαi containing heterotrimeric G protein may mediate the process (4Arbour N.

NF-κB is of paramount importance to immune cell function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate-early genes (10Sen R. Baltimore D.

In leukocytes, NF-κB activation results in the transcription of immediate-early genes that encode IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, MCP-1, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, as well as several adhesion molecules (11Baeuerle P.A.

Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We further showed that fMLP stimulates small GTPase RhoA activity, and this activity in monocytes is required for NF-κB activation induced by fMLP (14Huang S. Chen L.-Y. Zuraw B.L. Ye R.D. Pan Z.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40977-40981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The activation of Rho proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote the transition between the inactive GDP-bound state and the active GTP-bound state of these GTPases. Rho-related exchange factors acquire tumorigenic activity by deletion of their N-terminal region, and most of them have been identified as potent oncogenes isolated from different transformed cell lines. These putative GEFs share the structural arrangement of a 200-amino-acid motif, the Dbl homology domain, followed by a second putative signaling motif, the pleckstrin homology domain. Many GEFs have been identified for the Rho family of GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), including: dbl, ost, lfc, lbc, vav, and net (reviewed in Refs. 15Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report also indicated that Rho GTPases regulate c-fos transcription activation (20Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), that constitutively active Rho proteins can activate NF-κB (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar), and that tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of NF-κB in NIH-3T3 cells is dependent on Cdc42 and RhoA (22Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Despite an apparent role of the Rho GTPases in gene expression, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Rho activity and Rho signaling in gene transcription.In this study, we therefore investigated the role of guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the signaling events that lead to activation of RhoA and NF-κB in fMLP-stimulated monocytes. We found that RhoA associates specifically with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc in monocytes stimulated with fMLP and that Lbc specifically catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RhoA. Cotransfection of the monocytic THP1 cells with lbc with a κB promoter reporter plasmid results in a marked increase in NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression. Furthermore, lbc-induced NF-κB activation is blocked by a RhoA inhibitor or co-transfection with a RhoA dominant-negative mutant. These results suggest that fMLPs stimulate RhoA and NF-κB activation and that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc is involved in mediating this effect in human peripheral blood monocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—fMLP was obtained from Sigma. Pertussis and cholera toxins were purchased from Calbiochem. The cDNA coding for Lbc was kindly provided by Y. Zheng (University of Tennessee). The polymerase chain reaction was used to insert the cDNA of the Lbc protein into the XbaI-BamHI cloning sites of the pGEX vector and pcDNA3 vector. The GST-RhoA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The RhoA dominant-negative (T19N) pCMV plasmids and recombinant Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase were obtained as described previously (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Lbc, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Preparation of Monocytes from Peripheral Blood—-Heparinized human peripheral blood from health donors was fractionated on Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradients. Mononuclear cells and neutrophils were initially separated by centrifugation through a 55%/74% discontinuous Percoll gradient. Monocytes were further prepared from the mononuclear cell population with gelatin/plasma coated flasks as described (8Pan Z.K. Kravchenko V.V. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The purity of monocytes was greater than 85-90% as determined by staining with an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (Coulter Immunology, Miami, FL), and cell viability was greater than 95% as measured by trypan blue exclusion. Monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm; Irvine Scienfic, Santa Ana, CA).GTPγS Binding Assay—[35S]GTPγS binding of RhoA under the catalysis of Lbc was determined as described (23Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RhoA was first loaded with GDP in loading buffer. The guanine nucleotide exchange reaction was initiated by mixing the GDP-loaded G protein with Lbc-containing immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody) or control immunoprecipitates (control antibody) in the reaction buffer with [35S]GTPγS and was terminated at various time points by dilution of the reaction mixture in ice-cold termination buffer. The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to the G protein was finally quantified by filtration of the terminated reactions through nitrocellulose filter. Briefly, ∼2 μg of GST-RhoA protein was incubated in 60 μl of loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm AMP-PNP, and 10 μm GDP) for 5 min at room temperature. MgCl2 was added (5 mm) for 15 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the GDP-loaded RhoA were mixed with 20 μl of Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody) or control monocyte immunoprecipitates (control antibody) in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 μm [35S]GTPγS) to initiate the exchange reaction at room temperature. The terminated reactions at various time points (0 min-20 min) were filtered immediately through the BA 85 nitrocellulose filters, and the radioactivity detained by the filter was measured by scintillation counting.GDP Dissociation Assay—Approximately 2 μg of GST-RhoA protein was incubated in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm AMP-PNP, and 10 μm [3H]GDP) for 5 min at room temperature. MgCl2 was added (5 mm) for 15 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the [3H]GDP-loaded RhoA were mixed with 20 μl of Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody) or control monocyte immunoprecipitates (control antibody) in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm GTP) to initiate the exchange reaction at room temperature. The terminated reactions at various time points (0-20 min) were filtered immediately through the BA 85 nitrocellulose filters, and the radioactivity detained by the filter was measured by scintillation counting.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Monocyte lysates were incubated with an appropriate amount of antibody for 3 h and then precipitated following absorption onto protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed three times, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Filter strips were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature followed by addition of peroxidase-conjugated IgG at 1:10,000 for 30 min and analysis with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Luciferase Activity Assay—The plasmid pIL-8(κB)LUC (WT-IL-8-LUC) contains a κB site from the promoter region of the IL-8 gene, and a separate plasmid pIL-8(Mu)LUC (MU-IL-8-LUC) has a nonfunctional mutant κB site. Both constructs were kindly provided by Dr. N. Mackman (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) (24Liu R. O'Connell M. Johnson K. Pritzker K. Mackman N. Terkeltaub R. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) was used as a control for monitoring the transfection efficiency by the expression of β-galactosidase. THP1 cells were transiently transfected using diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran (25Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and were cultivated for 48 h before a 4-h stimulation with medium or fMLP (100 nm). Luciferase activity was determined by using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and the Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA).RESULTSEndogenous Lbc Interacts with RhoA in Monocytes Stimulated with fMLP—Guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc is reported to have GEF activity specific for Rho in NIH 3T3 cells. Lbc gene expression is strongly expressed in normal human peripheral blood leukocytes and HL-60 cells (26Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lbc is a novel signal transducer for RhoA-mediated NF-κB activation in human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with fMLP. To assess the role of Lbc in fMLP-induced RhoA-mediated NF-κB activation, we first examined the Lbc expression pattern in human peripheral blood leukocytes. We used an antibody that recognizes Lbc in order to detect the endogenous Lbc in human peripheral blood monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Human blood lymphocytes contained little Lbc expression. In contrast, monocytes exhibited high endogenous Lbc expression, and neutrophils displayed low levels of Lbc (Fig. 1). We next examined whether the biological activity of the Lbc in monocytes is based on its ability to interact with low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins or whether Lbc can functionally bind to Rho family GTP-binding proteins in vivo. Monocytes (10 × 106) were stimulated with media (Fig. 2, lanes 1), or fMLP (100 nm) at 37° for 10 min (Fig. 2, lanes 2), before the cells were lysed. Anti-Rho family GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to immunoprecipitate Rho GTPases from the lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Lbc antibodies. Fig. 2 showed that the anti-RhoA (Fig. 2A), anti-Rac1 (Fig. 2B), and anti-Cdc42 (Fig. 2C) antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate GTPases from the lysates, and the precipitates were Western blotted with the anti-Lbc antibody. Only RhoA was observed to co-precipitate with Lbc in fMLP-stimulated monocytes. As control experiments, we preincubated Rho GTPases antibodies with the blocking peptides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), then immunoprecipitated as described above to test the specific interaction of fMLP stimulated-RhoA with Lbc (Fig. 2, lanes 3). These results indicate that Lbc is functionally associated with the Rho GTP-binding protein in monocytes stimulated with fMLP.Fig. 2Endogenous Lbc is interacted with RhoA in fMLP-stimulated monocytes. Monocytes were stimulated with media (lane 1) or fMLP (100 nm), for 10 min (lane 2), the whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-RhoA (A), anti-Rac (B), and anti-Cdc42 (C) antibodies. The immunoprecipitates (IP) were probed with either anti-Lbc antibody (upper panel) or anti-RhoA, anti-Rac, and anti-Cdc42 antibodies (lower panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiments were repeated three times with essentially identical results. IB, immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lbc Binding with RhoA in fMLP-stimulated Monocytes Involves fMLP Receptors Coupled to Pertussis Toxin-sensitive Heterotrimeric G Proteins—We demonstrated previously that fMLP-induced RhoA activity in monocytes is mediated through fMLP receptors that are coupled to pertussis-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins. We therefore examined whether the functional interaction between Lbc and RhoA is subject to inhibition by bacterial toxins that ADP-ribosylate the α-subunits of certain G-protein (Fig. 3). Monocytes were pretreated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 3, P.Tx) and cholera toxin (Fig. 3, C.Tx) separately and then stimulated with fMLP. Pertussis toxin (0.5 μg/ml) significantly reduced fMLP-induced interaction of Lbc and RhoA, whereas cholera toxin has no such inhibitory effect in monocytes. Thus, our results indicate that fMLP stimulates the interaction of Lbc and RhoA through fMLP receptors that are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins.Fig. 3Pertussis toxin inhibits fMLP-stimulated Lbc and RhoA interaction. Human peripheral blood monocytes were preincubated for 4 h with either pertussis toxin (P.Tx, 0.5 μg/ml; lane 3) or cholera toxin (C.Tx, 5 μg/ml; lane 4) before stimulation with fMLP (100 nm). Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) assays were determined as described in the legend for Fig. 2. These results are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lbc Functions as a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor for RhoA in Monocytes Stimulated with fMLP—The results presented above identify and confirm the interaction between Lbc and RhoA in monocytes under fMLP-stimulated conditions. We next used GTP binding assays to examine whether Lbc functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA in monocytes stimulated with fMLP. Recombinant GST-RhoA were preloaded with [3H]GDP and incubated with immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody) from fMLP-stimulated monocytes for the indicated time before termination of the reactions by filtration through the nitrocellulose filter. The rate of dissociation of [3H]GDP from RhoA was stimulated ∼6-fold by the Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates with anti-Lbc antibody (Fig. 4A). Similarly, there is an increase in the rate (∼6-fold) of [35S]GTPγS binding to RhoA by Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates with anti-Lbc antibody (Fig. 4B). These results further confirmed and demonstrated that the interaction between RhoA and Lbc is functional importance and that Lbc specifically catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RhoA in human blood monocytes.Fig. 4Lbc functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA in human peripheral blood monocytes. A, effects of Lbc on the kinetics of GDP dissociation from RhoA. Two μl of recombinant GST-RhoA was preloaded with [3H]GDP and incubated with 20 μl of Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody, filled triangles) or 20 μl control monocyte immunoprecipitates (control antibody, filled circles) in reaction buffer for the indicated time before termination of the reactions by the nitrocellulose filter binding method. B, effects of Lbc on the kinetics of GTP binding. Twenty μl of Lbc-containing monocyte immunoprecipitates (anti-Lbc antibody, filled triangles) or 20 μl control monocyte immunoprecipitates (control antibody, filled circles) was added to the GDP-bound GST-RhoA (2 μg) in a reaction mixture containing [35S]GTPγS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RhoA Activity Is Required for Lbc-enhanced Reporter Gene Expression in a κB-dependent Manner—We have previously demonstrated that fMLP stimulated RhoA activity, and this activity is required for fMLP-induced NF-κB activity in human monocytes (14Huang S.

The results presented above showed that the interaction between RhoA and Lbc is functionally important and that Lbc specifically catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RhoA in human blood monocytes. These results suggest that Lbc may be involved in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation and cytokine gene expression in monocytes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of Lbc on fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. THP1 cells were co-transfected with an expression vector encoding an Lbc together with a plasmid pIL-8(κB)LUC (WT-IL-8-LUC) containing κB site from the promoter region of the IL-8 gene or a separate plasmid pIL-8(mu)LUC (MU-IL-8-LUC) that has a nonfunctionally mutant κB site. Fig. 5A shows that overexpression of Lbc in THP1 cells induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with the WT-IL-8-LUC (Fig. 5A, lane 3) as compared with the vector control (lane 1, p < 0.01). In contrast, overexpression of Lbc in fMLP-stimulated THP1 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 2) did not cause a significant increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with MU-IL-8-LUC (from which the κB site was deleted) as compared with fMLP-stimulated cells transfected with WT-IL-8-LUC (Fig. 5B, lane 4). The relationship among Lbc, RhoA, and subsequent NF-κB activation and cytokine gene expression was further explored using C3 transferase exoenzyme, an exotoxin produced by C. botulium that specifically inhibits the RhoA small GTP-binding proteins but does not inhibit Rac or Cdc42 (24Liu R. O'Connell M. Johnson K. Pritzker K. Mackman N. Terkeltaub R. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Preincubation of THP1 cells with the recombinant C3 transferase exoenzyme (10 μg/ml, overnight) before co-transfection of Lbc with WT-IL-8-LUC reporter plasmid significantly inhibited the luciferase activity (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5RhoA activity is required for Lbc-enhanced gene expression in human blood leukocytes. As shown in A, THP1 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the WT-IL-8-LUC plasmid (lanes 1-4), 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (lanes 1-4), and 0.2 μg of either pcDNA3 (empty vector, lanes 1 and 2) or Lbc (lanes 3 and 4). After 48 h, cells were incubated with media (lanes 1 and 3) or 100 nm fMLP (lanes 2 and 4) for 6 h. As shown in B, THP1 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the MU-IL-8-LUC plasmid (lanes 1 and 2), 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (lanes 1 and 2), and 0.2 μg of either Lbc (lane 2) or empty vector (lane 1). After 48 h, cells were incubated with media (lane 1) or 100 nm fMLP (lane 2) for 6 h. As shown in C, THP1 cells were preincubated with media alone (lanes 1 and 2) or recombinant C3 transferase (recombination C3 transferase (rC3) inhibitor; 10 μg/ml) overnight (lane 3) and then co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the WT-IL-8-LUC plasmid (lanes 1-3), 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (lanes 1-3), and 0.2 μg of either Lbc (lanes 2 and 3) or pcDNA3 (lane 1). After 48 h, cells were incubated with media (lane 1) or 100 nm fMLP (lanes 2 and 3) for 6 h. As shown in D, THP1 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the WT-IL-8-LUC plasmid (lanes 1-3), 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (lanes 1-3), and 0.2 μg of Lbc (lanes 2 and 3), and RhoA-T19N (dominant-negative mutant of the RhoA; lane 3) or pcDNA3 (lanes 1 and 2). All results were normalized for transfection efficiency using the expression of β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system and Monolight 2010 luminometer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further demonstration of the necessity for RhoA activity in Lbc-enhanced NF-κB activation was obtained by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of RhoA (RhoA-T19N). THP1 cells were co-transfected with an expression vector encoding a dominant-negative form of RhoA (RhoA-T19N) together with Lbc and WT-IL-8-LUC plasmid. Fig. 5D shows the effect of the dominant-negative RhoA mutant protein on Lbc-enhanced luciferase activity in THP1 cells. Co-transfection of the dominant-negative RhoA plasmid with Lbc and the WT-IL-8-LUC plasmid significantly blocked Lbc-enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 5D, lane 3). Taken together with the previous results, this strongly suggests that RhoA activity is required for Lbc-enhanced NF-κB activation and cytokine gene expression.DISCUSSIONThe Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins has been implicated in multiple signaling pathways leading to cytoskeleton reorganization (27Hall A.

The correction of the chemical shifts for paramagnetic and porphyrin ring current influences in the paramagnetic substrate complex reveals that the strength of all but one of the numerous relatively robust H-bonds are conserved in apohHO, and similar ordered water molecules are located near these H-bond donors as observed in the substrate complexes. The unique and significant weakening of the Tyr58 OH hydrogen bond to the catalytically critical Asp140 carboxylate in apohHO is suggested to arise from the removal of the axial H-bond acceptor ligand rather than the loss of substrate. The interhelical positions of the conserved strong H-bonds argue for a structural role in maintaining a conserved structure for helices C–H upon loss of substrate. While the structure and H-bond network are largely conserved upon loss of substrate, the variably increased rate of NH lability dictates a significant loss of dynamic stability in the conserved structure, particularly near the distal helix F. 1H NMR was used to investigate the molecular structure, and dynamic properties of soluble, recombinant, substrate-free human heme oxygenase (apohHO) on a comparative basis with similar studies on the substrate complex.

A hint of the problem in analyzing a substrate-free HO is found in the substrate complexes themselves. Thus, hHO-heme could be induced to crystallize only after truncating by ∼30 residues the soluble construct, and the structure revealed two molecules per unit cell with key differences in the distal pocket (13Schuller D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2036373073,"Peptides corresponding to residues 65–79 of human lymphocyte antigen class II sequence (DQA*03011) are cell-permeable and at high concentrations block activation of protein kinase B/Akt and p70-S6 kinase in T-cells, effects attributed to inhibition of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity. To understand the molecular basis of this, we analyzed the effect this peptide had on activity of class I PI 3-kinases. Although there was no effect on the activity of class Ib PI 3-kinase or on the protein kinase activity of class I PI 3-kinases, there was a biphasic effect on lipid kinase activity of the class Ia enzymes. There was an inhibition of activity at higher peptide concentrations because of a formation of insoluble complexes between peptide and enzyme. Conversely, at lower peptide concentrations there was a profound activation of PI 3-kinase activity of class Ia PI 3-kinases. Studies of peptide variants revealed that all active peptides conform to heptad repeat motifs characteristic of coiled-coil helices. Surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed direct sequence-specific binding of active peptide to the p85α adapter subunit of class Ia PI 3-kinase. Active peptides also activated protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in vivo in a wortmannin-sensitive manner while reducing recoverable cellular p85 levels. These results indicate that the human lymphocyte antigen class II-derived peptides regulate PI 3-kinase by direct interaction, probably via the coiled-coil domain. These peptides define a novel mechanism of regulating PI 3-kinase and will provide a useful tool for specifically dissecting the function of class Ia PI 3-kinase in cells and for probing structure-function relationships in the class Ia PI 3-kinase heterodimers.

Several classes of PI 3-kinase exist, but tyrosine kinase-linked receptors signal mainly through class Ia PI 3-kinases, which are bifunctional kinases, possessing both lipid and protein kinase activities (4Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The class Ia PI 3-kinases can be regulated in a number of ways. These include interactions via the SH2, SH3, and Bcr homology domains of the adapter subunit and direct interaction of Ras through the Ras binding domain of the catalytic subunit (1Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J.

A potentially novel mechanism for regulating PI 3-kinase activity has recently emerged from studies of the properties of biologically active peptides derived from class II MHC molecules (5Boytim M. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2215-2222PubMed Google Scholar). These studies identified a peptide fragment of DQA*03011 α chain allele of MHC class II that was capable of blocking IL2-induced T-cell proliferation and thus offered a possibly novel means of achieving immunosuppression. Further work found that treatment of T-cells with one of these peptides, corresponding to the residues 65–79 of DQA*03011, blocked IL2-induced activation of protein kinase B/Akt and p70-S6K activities (6Boytim M.L. Lilly P. Drouvalakis K. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and also blocked the ability of IL2 to regulate levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (5Boytim M. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2215-2222PubMed Google Scholar). This was attributed to a direct inhibition of PI 3-kinase. How this occurs is unknown; nonetheless, the study noted a reasonable degree of sequence homology between the peptide and a conserved region in the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinases, and the authors speculated this may be important. In the present study, we sought to define the mechanism by which this peptide is able to regulate PI 3-kinase activity. At higher concentrations the peptide reduced class Ia PI 3-kinase in vitro. However, this is not due to direct inhibition of PI 3-kinase catalytic activity but as a result of the peptide causing the enzyme to become insoluble, probably as a result of complex formation between peptide multimers and the PI 3-kinase. A reduction in levels of class Ia PI 3-kinase adapter subunit was observed when high concentrations of peptide were added to cells indicating that in vivo it also induced a reduction in the amount of PI 3-kinase that could be solubilized. However, at lower concentrations, the peptide greatly stimulated class Ia PI 3-kinase activity. Low concentrations of peptide also activated protein kinase B and ERK in CHO-IR cells in a wortmannin-sensitive manner suggesting the peptides are activating PI 3-kinase directly in cells. Using variants of the wild type peptide it was found that only peptides conforming to a heptad repeat consensus were capable of interacting with PI 3-kinase suggesting the regulatory effects were mediated via the coiled-coil domains of PI 3-kinase. Overall these studies define a novel mechanism for the regulation of PI 3-kinase activity and indicate that these peptides will be useful reagents for studying PI 3-kinase function. Materials—Peptides were synthesized by the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London, London, UK. Recombinant baculoviruses were provided by Prof. M. D. Waterfield (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University College London, UK). Recombinant p110γ was provided by Dr. Roger Williams (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal anti-p85 antibody, raised against the N-terminal SH2 domain, has been generated in-house. Polyclonal anti-p110α-specific antibody was provided by Dr. Bart Vanhaesebroeck (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University College London, UK). Phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-Akt (Thr-308), phospho-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) E10, Akt, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. PY99 antiphosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant Protein Expression, Isolation, and Analysis—Recombinant p85α/p110α, p85α/p110β, and p85α/p110δ heterodimers were expressed in baculovirally infected Sf9 insect cells and purified using an affinity matrix prepared by coupling the phosphopeptide YpVPMLG (Yp = phosphotyrosine), corresponding to the Tyr-751 of the human platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, to Actigel ALD (Sterogene, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed using Actigel-bound p85α/p110 complexes. For surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, glutathione S-transferase-p85α was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the glutathione S-transferase moiety was removed after cleavage with thrombin. SPR Analysis—The direct interaction of peptides with recombinant p85α subunit was assayed using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor (BIAcore 3000) in “interaction buffer” (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20). Peptides were resuspended in 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and covalently attached to a sensor chip surface activated by an N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride mixture (immobilization kit, BIAcore SA). In a separate set of experiments, peptides were first biotinylated by incubation for 3 h with a 10-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimidebiotin (Sigma) in a 1:1 mixture of phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with dimethylformamide. The peptides were then applied to a disposable Sep-Pak C8 reversed-phase cartridge (Waters); washed extensively with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile; then eluted with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile; dried; and resuspended in interaction buffer. They were then injected over a sensor chip surface on which avidin (Calbiochem) was immobilized covalently to a level of 3000 resonance units and allowed to reach saturation. In both cases, p85α was diluted in interaction buffer and injected directly over the immobilized peptides. Cell-based Experiments—For cell-based assays CHO-IR cells were cultured in 40-mm dishes. Confluent cell monolayers were serum-starved for 16 h prior to any treatment and then treated with peptides at the indicated concentrations or vehicle in a volume of 1 ml for 30 min or with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell monolayers were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 ng/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were spun for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 5× electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the supernatants, and the samples were boiled and analyzed on 10% acrylamide-SDS gels, followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Immunoblotting using the phospho-specific antibodies was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Visualization was performed with ECL. Images were analyzed with a Fuji LAS-1000 Luminescent Image analyzer and Fuji Image Gauge software. PI 3-Kinase Protein Kinase and Lipid Kinase Assays—PI 3-kinase autophosphorylation assays were performed in a total volume of 30 μl in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. For treatment with various peptides, the enzyme was preincubated with the respective peptide or vehicle in a volume of 25 μl for 10 min on ice. Reactions were initiated by adding 5 μl of a mix of ATP (final concentration of 100 μm, plus 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay) and MnCl2 (final concentration of 10 mm), incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and terminated by the addition of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PI 3-kinase lipid kinase assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP (plus 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay) using 200 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. For treatment with various peptides, the enzyme was preincubated with the respective peptide or vehicle in a volume of 25 μl for 10 min on ice. Then phosphatidylinositol was added, and reactions were initiated by adding a mix containing ATP and MgCl2. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The mixture was vortexed, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the lower organic phase was washed with 80 μl of methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1). After centrifugation the aqueous phase was again discarded, and the lower organic phase evaporated to dryness. Reaction products were resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform: methanol (4:1) and spotted onto thin layer silica gel-60 plates (Merck), which had been pretreated with 1% oxalic acid, 1 mm EDTA in water: methanol (6:4). TLC plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, 4 m ammonia (9:7:4). Images of radiolabeled protein and lipid products were analyzed using a Fuji FLA-2000 phosphorimager and Fuji Image Gauge software. A previous report that synthetic peptides derived from the MHC class II sequences directly inhibit PI 3-kinase activity in p85 immunoprecipitates (6Boytim M.L. Lilly P. Drouvalakis K. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) prompted the present investigation of their effects on lipid and protein kinase activities of recombinant PI 3-kinases. Therefore, we synthesized the wild type peptide (M1) and three derivatives (M2–M4) of this peptide, two of which (M2 and M3) had been found previously to be active in blocking IL2 effects on T-cell proliferation (Table I) (5Boytim M. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2215-2222PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides M5–M7 were synthesized to correspond to the regions of PI 3-kinases that were homologous to the MHC class II DQA*03011-derived peptides (Table II) as it was also speculated that this homology may contribute to the functionality of these peptides (6Boytim M.L. Lilly P. Drouvalakis K. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additionally, four other peptides were used as controls. Two of these were based on the region of the class Ia PI 3-kinase adapter subunit that contains the Ser-608 residue that is the target of the protein kinase activity of the catalytic subunit (4Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The other two control peptides were based on the Ser-111 sequence in the eIF4E-binding protein-1, which is a wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation site in vivo (7Heesom K.J. Avison M.B. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These four were chosen as the Ser-608- and Ser-111-based peptides are substrates for the protein kinase activity of PI 3-kinase and could potentially therefore act as competitors for the lipid kinase activity.Table ISequences of the MHC-derived synthetic peptides used in the present studyPeptideSequenceRemarksa b c d e f g a b c d e f gM1N I A V L K H N L N I V I K Rwild type (DQ 65-79)M2N I A V L S H N L N I V I K RK70S (more potent)a“More potent” refers to peptide inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation (5).M3N I A V L K H N L S I V I K RK74S (more potent)M4N I A V L S H N L S I V I K RK70S/K74S (double mutant)M5N I A V L K H N S N I M V K Dbased on p110αbSubstitutions have been made to resemble closer to the designated PI 3-kinase.M6N I A V L K H S D N I M V K Kbased on p110βM7N I A V L K H N D N I M L R Sbased on PI 3-kinase-C2αSer-608L G N E N T E D Q Y S L V E D D E D Lbased on p85α Ser-608Ser-608AL G N E N T E D Q Y A L V E D D E D LSer-111R R P E D K R A G G E E S Q F E M D Ibased on eIF4E-binding protein-1 Ser-111Ser-111AR R P E D K R A G G E E A Q F E M D Ia “More potent” refers to peptide inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation (5Boytim M.

Surprisingly, in the presence of 100 μm peptide there was a strong activation observed with the MHC class II DQA 65–79 peptide and its three derivatives (M1–M4) (Fig. 1). The p110-based peptides M5, M6, and M7 and peptides based on the Ser-608 of p85α or the Ser-111 of the eIF4E-binding protein-1 had a minimal effect showing stimulation of less than 2-fold. As these results contrasted with those obtained previously (6Boytim M.L. Lilly P. Drouvalakis K. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) we next tested higher concentrations of peptide. At 1 mm peptide we find that PI 3-kinase activity of p85α/p110α is completely inhibited in our in vitro assay (Fig. 2). To test whether these effects were an isoform-specific phenomenon we next tested the effect of various peptides on the lipid kinase activity of recombinant p85α/p110β. This revealed a similar pattern as seen with p85α/p110α, with the wild type peptide (M1) causing a strong stimulation of the lipid kinase activity at 100 μm but with inhibition evident at 1 mm (Fig. 3). Peptides inactive against p85α/p110α were also inactive against p85α/p110β.Fig. 2Dose-response curve for the wild type (M1) MHC-derived peptide on recombinant p85α/p110α lipid kinase activity.A, recombinant p85α/p110α was incubated with various concentrations of the M1 peptide for 10 min on ice followed by an in vitro lipid kinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol as the substrates.

PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of the MHC class II-derived peptide on protein and lipid kinase were then compared in all class I PI 3-kinases (p85α/p110α, p85α/p110β, p85α/p110δ, and p110γ). For each of the heterodimeric PI 3-kinases (p85α/p110α, p85α/p110β, or p85α/p110δ) a strong stimulation of lipid kinase activity was observed at 100 μm with inhibition observed at 1 mm in all cases. Surprisingly, the lipid kinase activity of the monomeric class Ib p110γ was not increased by 100 μm peptide and was only slightly decreased by 1 mm peptide (Fig. 4, A, top, and B). Interestingly, under the same experimental conditions the protein kinase activity of the heterodimeric class Ia PI 3-kinases (assessed as phosphorylation of p85α by p110α or autophosphorylation of p110β and p110δ) was not significantly affected by the peptide at 100 μm (Fig. 4, A, middle, and C), whereas at 1 mm peptide the same inhibition as for the lipid kinase activity was observed. When the gels from the above experiment were Coomassie-stained, it was seen that the p85 protein was not detectable in the lane of the assay performed at 1 mm peptide. This result was confirmed in Western blotting experiments, suggesting that peptide multimers bound to PI 3-kinase, thus preventing solubilization and recovery of the latter (Fig. 4D). This indicates the inhibitory effects of the peptide are not likely to be caused by direct inhibition of catalytic activity but rather due to concentration-dependent formation of insoluble complexes between peptide multimers and PI 3-kinase. The specific effects of the peptides on class Ia PI 3-kinase suggested a direct interaction with the p85 adapter subunit. Therefore, the binding of MHC class II-derived peptide to p85α was assayed by surface plasmon resonance. Two of the peptides, M2, which caused activation of PI 3-kinase, and M5, which had minimal effect on PI 3-kinase in the enzymatic activity assays, were directly immobilized on a biosensor chip. As shown in Fig. 5, the analysis revealed stronger binding of recombinant p85α to the M2 over the M5 peptide. Similar results were obtained after biotinylation of the above peptides and immobilization on a streptavidin-coated chip, although p85α directly interacted with streptavidin to some extent thus complicating the analysis (data not shown). These data further confirmed the sequence-specific direct interaction of these peptides with heterodimeric PI 3-kinase. It was observed previously that the DQ 65–79 class II MHC-derived peptide is cell-permeable (6Boytim M.L. Lilly P. Drouvalakis K. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which lead us to test whether the stimulatory effects observed in vitro with low concentrations of peptide could manifest as activation of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways in cells. Here we find three of the MHC class II-derived peptides (M2–M4) were able to stimulate phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt and of ERK1/2 in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (Figs. 6 and 7A). This suggested an activation of PI 3-kinase in the cell by the peptides. As the peptides were not activating tyrosine kinases in the cell (Fig. 7B) it was unlikely that they were acting via cell surface receptors, and the most likely scenario was a direct interaction between the peptides and PI 3-kinase as was observed in vitro. This is further supported by the finding that high concentrations of peptide caused a reduction in recoverable p85 adapter subunit levels with no apparent effects on actin or Akt levels (Fig. 7A) suggesting that the peptides were permeating the cell membrane and directly interacting with PI 3-kinase to specifically induce it to become insoluble.Fig. 7Similar mechanisms underlie both in vitro and in vivo PI 3-kinase activation.A, CHO-IR cells were either treated with 100 or 500 μm peptide M2 for 30 min at 37 °C or stimulated with 100 nm insulin (ins) for 10 min (the Me2SO concentration in the culture medium was adjusted to be equal in all experiments). Subsequently, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide gel and immunoblotting with a phosphorylation state-specific antibody against Ser-473 of Akt. The same filter was consecutively stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total Akt, the PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85, and β-actin. IB, immunoblot. B, activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by MHC-derived peptides does not involve apparent activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase. An identical series of samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY99. Two independent experiments were performed with identical results. Blots from one representative experiment are shown here. MW, molecular weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The current findings extend previous studies by demonstrating that the inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity induced by MHC class II DQA 65–79 peptide is specific to the class Ia isoforms. The results further suggest the inhibition is not due to direct inhibition of catalytic activity but is in fact due to formation of insoluble peptide multimer-enzyme complexes. This implies that the peptide can directly interact with class Ia PI 3-kinase, and as this was not observed in class Ib isoforms it suggests that the effect requires the presence of the p85 adapter subunit of class Ia PI 3-kinase. This is supported by SPR analysis which revealed sequence-specific binding of the MHC peptides to recombinant p85α. However, at lower peptide concentrations the class Ia PI 3-kinases remain in solution, and their activity is actually greatly increased. This stimulatory effect is not an artifact of peptide affecting the environment of the lipid assay as some closely related peptides do not cause the stimulation, and none of the peptides activate the class Ib PI 3-kinase. Therefore this presumably results from a direct interaction between the peptide and PI 3-kinase outside the catalytic site. A number of mechanisms have been defined by which class Ia PI 3-kinase can be activated by interactions outside the catalytic site. The most well studied of these involves the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides to the SH2 domains of p85 adapter subunits (8Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J.

Other mechanisms have also been characterized that involve the binding of Ras to a specific Ras binding domain in p110 (13Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) or the binding of Rac or Cdc42 to the Bcr homology domain of p85 (15Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beeton C.A. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the peptides described in the current study are unlikely to activate PI 3-kinase by any of these mechanisms and thus represent a novel mechanism. Our studies with variants of the wild type peptide show there is a high degree of specificity in the sequences capable of activating PI 3-kinase. Previously it was noted that there was a high homology between part of the sequence of this peptide (70–79) and a region (916–924) of the p110 catalytic subunit (Table II), and it was suggested this was functionally important. However, there is no evidence that this homology is related with the effect of the peptides, and indeed we find that peptides that fully mimic the catalytic subunit sequences are in fact inactive. Our results reveal a more likely mechanistic basis of the action of the peptides as all the active peptides, but none of the inactive ones, fall within the abcdefg heptad repeat consensus motif (see Table I), where a and d are hydrophobic residues, whereas b, c, e, f, and g are hydrophilic residues (17Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The possibility that this is important in the functional effects of the peptides is supported by the results of a complete serine mutagenesis scan of the DQA 65–89 peptide where mutants that caused loss of function, as assessed by blocking T-cell proliferation, were also mutations that disrupted the heptad consensus sequence (5Boytim M. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2215-2222PubMed Google Scholar). Any explanation for the mechanism by which the peptides act must also take into account the finding that higher peptide concentrations cause insolubility and loss of function of the PI 3-kinase. The answer to this can also be explained by the heptad arrangement as this is indicative of coiled-coil amphipathic helices where residues a and d form the helix interface and residues b, c, e, f, and g form the solvent-exposed part of the coiled coil. These properties cause oligomerization, which is a common property of coiled-coil proteins (17Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The most likely binding partner for this heptad repeat lies in the p110 binding domain in the iSH2 domain of the p85 subunit, which was predicted to form a coiled coil (18Panayotou G. Bax B. Gout I. Federwisch M. Wroblowski B. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a view supported by recent electron paramagnetic resonance studies (19Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 3275-3280Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, secondary structure prediction of the rather hydrophobic N terminus of p110, where the p85 binding domain resides, predicts 60% of it forms α-helices and 40% forms β-sheet conformations, and thus it has been proposed that hydrophobic helices in this region interact with the coiled coil of the iSH2 domain (20Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The interaction of a peptide capable of multimer formation with this domain would also explain the insolubility seen at high concentration of the peptide, assuming that high molecular weight heteroligomeric complexes are formed under these conditions. The interaction of peptide with this region could also explain the activation observed as it is established that the binding of the regulatory subunit p85 to the catalytic subunit p110 inhibits the enzymatic activity of the latter (21Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, binding of peptide to the coiled-coil region of the p85 iSH2 domain or the N terminus of p110 (or both) could disrupt the interaction and relieve the inhibition. It has been proposed that activation of the lipid kinase activity of PI 3-kinase by SH2 domain-mediated interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is mediated by conformational changes that partially relieve inhibition in this way (21Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard it is interesting that the protein kinase activity of class Ia PI 3-kinase is not increased by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins interacting with the SH2 domains indicating different mechanisms controlling lipid and protein kinase activities (10Layton M.J. Harpur A.G. Panayotou G. Bastiaens P.I.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33379-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we do not see any activation of protein kinase activity by the MHC-derived peptides. These studies suggest a number of potential applications for peptides based on those described here. One advantage of the peptides in the current study compared with other means of activating modulating PI 3-kinase is that these peptides are cell-permeable, as opposed to other PI 3-kinase activators such as Rac, Ras, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Therefore this allows a means to specifically regulate PI 3-kinase inside cells. If higher concentrations are used it would inhibit PI 3-kinase activity, and this could be used as a basis of immunosuppressive therapy (5Boytim M. Lyu S.-C. Jung R. Krensky A.M. Clayberger C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2215-2222PubMed Google Scholar, 22Claus R. Werner H. Schulze H.-A. Walzel H. Friemel H. Immunol. Lett. 1990; 26: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or potentially as a basis for antitumor therapy (23Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). There is evidence that soluble MHC molecules circulate in the serum (22Claus R. Werner H. Schulze H.-A. Walzel H. Friemel H. Immunol. Lett. 1990; 26: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1173-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Puppo F. Scudeletti M. Indiveri F. Ferrone S. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 124-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), so it is possible that such a mechanism may even have localized functional significance for PI 3-kinase regulation in vivo. As a research tool the peptides may be also useful in dissecting the specific contribution of class Ia PI 3-kinase in several signaling pathways as using these allows specific activation of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways and allows investigation of these in isolation from the other pathways that would inevitably be activated by, for example, growth factor stimulation of cells. In summary, these results suggest a novel mechanism of regulating PI 3-kinase activity in cells. These peptides will also provide a useful tool for specifically dissecting the function of class Ia PI 3-kinase in cells and for probing structure-function relationships in the p85/p110 heterodimers.
