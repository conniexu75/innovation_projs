https://openalex.org/W2791286257,"Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The chromatin state, in particular through the mark H4K16ac, has been implicated in aging and thus may play a pivotal role in age-associated neurodegeneration. Here we compare the genome-wide enrichment of H4K16ac in the lateral temporal lobe of AD individuals against both younger and elderly cognitively normal controls. We found that while normal aging leads to H4K16ac enrichment, AD entails dramatic losses of H4K16ac in the proximity of genes linked to aging and AD. Our analysis highlights the presence of three classes of AD-related changes with distinctive functional roles. Furthermore, we discovered an association between the genomic locations of significant H4K16ac changes with genetic variants identified in prior AD genome-wide association studies and with expression quantitative trait loci. Our results establish the basis for an epigenetic link between aging and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2792397649,"The addressable pocket of a protein is often not functionally relevant in disease. This is true for the multidomain, bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulator TRIM24. TRIM24 has been posited as a dependency in numerous cancers, yet potent and selective ligands for the TRIM24 bromodomain do not exert effective anti-proliferative responses. We therefore repositioned these probes as targeting features for heterobifunctional protein degraders. Recruitment of the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase by dTRIM24 elicits potent and selective degradation of TRIM24. Using dTRIM24 to probe TRIM24 function, we characterize the dynamic genome-wide consequences of TRIM24 loss on chromatin localization and gene control. Further, we identify TRIM24 as a novel dependency in acute leukemia. Pairwise study of TRIM24 degradation versus bromodomain inhibition reveals enhanced anti-proliferative response from degradation. We offer dTRIM24 as a chemical probe of an emerging cancer dependency, and establish a path forward for numerous selective yet ineffectual ligands for proteins of therapeutic interest."
https://openalex.org/W2794063115,"Recombinant rabies viral vectors have proven useful for applications including retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing, but their cytotoxicity has limited their use to short-term experiments. Here we introduce a new class of double-deletion-mutant rabies viral vectors that left transduced cells alive and healthy indefinitely. Deletion of the viral polymerase gene abolished cytotoxicity and reduced transgene expression to trace levels but left vectors still able to retrogradely infect projection neurons and express recombinases, allowing downstream expression of other transgene products such as fluorophores and calcium indicators. The morphology of retrogradely targeted cells appeared unperturbed at 1 year postinjection. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed no physiological abnormalities at 8 weeks. Longitudinal two-photon structural and functional imaging in vivo, tracking thousands of individual neurons for up to 4 months, showed that transduced neurons did not die but retained stable visual response properties even at the longest time points imaged. Rabies viral vectors are important tools in neuroscience, but their cytotoxicity usually limits their use. Chatterjee et al. introduce a new class of double-deletion-mutant rabies viral vectors that leaves neurons alive and healthy indefinitely."

It has been suggested that unattended contents might be solely retained in an activity-silent form. Instead, we demonstrate here that encoding unattended contents involves a division of labor. While visual cortex only maintains attended items, intraparietal areas and the frontal eye fields represent both attended and unattended items. Whether we currently pay attention to memory items matters for their neural representation. Unattended items are stored exclusively in activity of higher-level brain areas, whereas attended items are also represented in low-level sensory regions."
https://openalex.org/W2789849167,"In this article we describe the production and screening of a genetically encoded library of 106 lanthipeptides in Escherichia coli using the substrate-tolerant lanthipeptide synthetase ProcM. This plasmid-encoded library was combined with a bacterial reverse two-hybrid system for the interaction of the HIV p6 protein with the UEV domain of the human TSG101 protein, which is a critical protein-protein interaction for HIV budding from infected cells. Using this approach, we identified an inhibitor of this interaction from the lanthipeptide library, whose activity was verified in vitro and in cell-based virus-like particle-budding assays. Given the variety of lanthipeptide backbone scaffolds that may be produced with ProcM, this method may be used for the generation of genetically encoded libraries of natural product-like lanthipeptides containing substantial structural diversity. Such libraries may be combined with any cell-based assay to identify lanthipeptides with new biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2791532651,"Tendon is a dense connective tissue that transmits high mechanical forces from skeletal muscle to bone. The transcription factor scleraxis (Scx) is a highly specific marker of both precursor and mature tendon cells (tenocytes). Mice lacking scx exhibit a specific and virtually complete loss of tendons during development. However, the functional contribution of Scx to wound healing in adult tendon has not yet been fully characterized. Here, using ScxGFP-tracking and loss-of-function systems, we show in an adult mouse model of Achilles tendon injury that paratenon cells, representing a stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)-positive and Scx-negative progenitor subpopulation, display Scx induction, migrate to the wound site, and produce extracellular matrix (ECM) to bridge the defect, whereas resident tenocytes exhibit a delayed response. Scx induction in the progenitors is initiated by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. scx-deficient mice had migration of Sca-1-positive progenitor cell to the lesion site but impaired ECM assembly to bridge the defect. Mechanistically, scx-null progenitors displayed higher chondrogenic potential with up-regulation of SRY-box 9 (Sox9) coactivator PPAR-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) in vitro, and knock-in analysis revealed that forced expression of full-length scx significantly inhibited Sox9 expression. Accordingly, scx-null wounds formed cartilage-like tissues that developed ectopic ossification. Our findings indicate a critical role of Scx in a progenitor-cell lineage in wound healing of adult mouse tendon. These progenitor cells could represent targets in strategies to facilitate tendon repair. We propose that this lineage-regulatory mechanism in tissue progenitors could apply to a broader set of tissues or biological systems in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2793662335,"During and after protein translation, molecular chaperones require ATP hydrolysis to favor the native folding of their substrates and, under stress, to avoid aggregation and revert misfolding. Why do some chaperones need ATP, and what are the consequences of the energy contributed by the ATPase cycle? Here, we used biochemical assays and physical modeling to show that the bacterial chaperones GroEL (Hsp60) and DnaK (Hsp70) both use part of the energy from ATP hydrolysis to restore the native state of their substrates, even under denaturing conditions in which the native state is thermodynamically unstable. Consistently with thermodynamics, upon exhaustion of ATP, the metastable native chaperone products spontaneously revert to their equilibrium non-native states. In the presence of ATPase chaperones, some proteins may thus behave as open ATP-driven, nonequilibrium systems whose fate is only partially determined by equilibrium thermodynamics. A nonequilibrium thermodynamic model can explain how molecular chaperones such as GroEL can use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to maintain substrate proteins in an active state, even under conditions that favor the substrate’s inactive unfolded state."
https://openalex.org/W2791319616,"Background Inappropriate use of antibiotics is a global public health challenge and has been associated with antibiotic resistance. WHO reports show that efforts to promote rational antibiotic use in developing countries are poor. With the growing number of infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria, rational drug use becomes imperative and studies that promote rational drug use are highly necessary. Considering this, we investigated prescribing patterns and predictors of antibiotic prescription in primary health care facilities in Kumbo East (KE) and Kumbo West (KW) health districts in North West Cameroon, to contribute data which could influence policy on antibiotic use. Methods and findings A cross sectional retrospective study was conducted from April 2014 to April 2015 in 26 randomly selected primary care facilities. Questionnaires were administered to 59 antibiotic prescribers to determine factors that predict antibiotic prescribing. Data on antibiotic prescription were collected by review of consultation registers. Prescription rates and demographics, prescriber and institution factors were analyzed using ANOVA. The best predictor of prescription was determined using multiple linear regression analysis. Results A total of 30,096 prescriptions were reviewed. Overall antibiotic prescription rate was 36.71%, with a mean of 1.14 antibiotics prescribed per patient. Amoxicillin was the most prescribed (29.9%). The most prevalent indications for prescribing were respiratory tract infections (21.27%). All antibiotics prescribed were broad-spectrum. Antibiotics were prescribed for patients with malaria and also in situations where diagnosis was uncertain. Prescribing by generic name was 98.36% while 99.87% was from Essential Drug List. Use of laboratory results, patient turnout and Performance Based Financing (PBF) were significantly associated with antibiotic prescribing rates (p < 0.05). PBF moderated prescribing. Conclusion There was misuse of antibiotics in primary care facilities in study area. We recommend all primary care health facilities in study area to be included in the PBF scheme and that prescribing should only be done by physicians as the have adequate training."

This study aims to characterize and compare small RNA profiles in human biofluids. For this purpose, RNA was extracted from plasma and breast milk samples from 15 healthy postpartum mothers. Small RNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext® small RNA library preparation kit and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. miRNAs, isomiRs and clusters of small RNAs were annotated using seqBuster/seqCluster framework in 5 plasma and 10 milk samples that passed the initial quality control. The RNA yield was 81 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD): 41] and 3985 ng/mL (SD: 3767) for plasma and breast milk, respectively. Mean number of good quality reads was 4.04 million (M) (40.01% of the reads) in plasma and 12.5M (89.6%) in breast milk. One thousand one hundred eighty two miRNAs, 12,084 isomiRs and 1,053 small RNA clusters that included piwi-interfering RNAs (piRNAs), tRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) were detected. Samples grouped by biofluid, with 308 miRNAs, 1,790 isomiRs and 778 small RNA clusters differentially detected. In summary, plasma and milk showed a different small RNA profile. In both, miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs were identified, confirming the presence of non-miRNA species in plasma, and describing them for the first time in milk."
https://openalex.org/W2792738609,"Back ground Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world and about 80% of diabetic cases live in low and middle income countries. Glycemic control is the most important predictor for diabetic related complications and deaths. Identifying factors associated with glycemic control help health care providers and patients to work in the areas that reduce risks of diabetic related complications and deaths. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude and factors associated with glycemic control among type 2 diabetic patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods Hospital-based cross sectional study was conducted on 412 type 2 diabetic patients who were attending in diabetic clinics at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Data were collected through structured interview questionnaire, and data abstraction format to collect information from each patient’s medical records from March to April, 2015. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine magnitude of glycemic control and factors associated with poor glycemic control. Result Median age of participants was 52 years old (IQR = 40–60 years old). From the study participants,51.7% were females. Median duration of living with diabetes since diagnosis was 10 years (IQR: 5–16 years). About 80% of the respondents had uncontrolled fasting blood glucose level. The factors which are significantly associated with poor glycemic control were longer duration of diabetes (AOR = 2.72 95%CI:1.16–6.32), and being on insulin therapy (AOR = 3.01 95% CI: 1.5–5.9). Conclusion A high proportion of patients had poor glycemic control. Longer duration of the disease, and being on drug regimen of insulin were associated with poor glycemic control. Appropriate attention should be given to patients with longer duration of disease and those who are on insulin therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2789497937,"Several human P5-type transport ATPases are implicated in neurological disorders, but little is known about their physiological function and properties. Here, we investigated the relationship between the five mammalian P5 isoforms ATP13A1-5 in a comparative study. We demonstrated that ATP13A1-4 isoforms undergo autophosphorylation, which is a hallmark P-type ATPase property that is required for substrate transport. A phylogenetic analysis of P5 sequences revealed that ATP13A1 represents clade P5A, which is highly conserved between fungi and animals with one member in each investigated species. The ATP13A2-5 isoforms belong to clade P5B and diversified from one isoform in fungi and primitive animals to a maximum of four in mammals by successive gene duplication events in vertebrate evolution. We revealed that ATP13A1 localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and experimentally demonstrate that ATP13A1 likely contains 12 transmembrane helices. Conversely, ATP13A2-5 isoforms reside in overlapping compartments of the endosomal system and likely contain 10 transmembrane helices, similar to what was demonstrated earlier for ATP13A2. ATP13A1 complemented a deletion of the yeast P5A ATPase SPF1, while none of ATP13A2-5 could complement either the loss of SPF1 or that of the single P5B ATPase YPK9 in yeast. Thus, ATP13A1 carries out a basic ER function similar to its yeast counterpart Spf1p that plays a role in ER related processes like protein folding and processing. ATP13A2-5 isoforms diversified in mammals and are expressed in the endosomal system where they may have evolved novel complementary or partially redundant functions. While most P5-type ATPases are widely expressed, some P5B-type ATPases (ATP13A4 and ATP13A5) display a more limited tissue distribution in the brain and epithelial glandular cells, where they may exert specialized functions. At least some P5B isoforms are of vital importance for the nervous system, since ATP13A2 and ATP13A4 are linked to respectively Parkinson disease and autism spectrum disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2794206773,"Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) who did not met the WHO recommendations for physical activity and to evaluate the amount of time spent in sedentary behavior. Methods SLE patients were consecutively enrolled in a cross sectional study. The type and the time spent in physical activity and sedentary behavior were evaluated using the IPAQ short form questionnaire. The adequate physical activity was defined according to the 2010 WHO recommendations for health and the sedentary behavior according to the 2017 SBRN consensus. We also assessed quality of life using SF-36, mood disorders using BDI and HAM-H, fatigue using Facit-Fatigue and sleep disorders using PSQI scores. Results Physical activity was not sufficient to meet WHO recommendations in 56 of 93 SLE patients (60%). SLE patients spent a median (95% range) of 180 (0–600) minutes everyday in sedentary activities. The length of daily sedentary time was more than 6 hours in 25% of SLE patients. In multivariable analysis, the factors associated to the probability of not meeting WHO criteria was only the time of exposure to antimalarials (OR 0.88, p 0.03) and the factors related to the probability of being in the upper tertile of sedentary time (more than 270 minutes) were age (OR 1.04, p 0.02), disease activity expressed by SELENA-SLEDAI score (OR 1.2, p 0.01) and Facit-fatigue score (OR 0.94, p 0.04). Conclusion A relevant proportion of SLE patients were inadequately physically active. It is essential to improve the awareness of the importance of increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time. A better control of disease activity and fatigue and a prolonged use of antimalarials could help to reach this notable goal."
https://openalex.org/W2791972993,"Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI) is a metabolic genetic disorder caused by mutation of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). Because of the accumulation of toxic metabolites, HTI causes severe liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. HTI is an ideal model for gene therapy, and several strategies have been shown to ameliorate HTI symptoms in animal models. Although CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is able to correct the Fah mutation in mouse models, WT Cas9 induces numerous undesired mutations that have raised safety concerns for clinical applications. To develop a new method for gene correction with high fidelity, we generated a Fah mutant rat model to investigate whether Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-mediated genome editing can efficiently correct the Fah. First, we confirmed that Cas9n rarely induces indels in both on-target and off-target sites in cell lines. Using WT Cas9 as a positive control, we delivered Cas9n and the repair donor template/single guide (sg)RNA through adenoviral vectors into HTI rats. Analyses of the initial genome editing efficiency indicated that only WT Cas9 but not Cas9n causes indels at the on-target site in the liver tissue. After receiving either Cas9n or WT Cas9-mediated gene correction therapy, HTI rats gained weight steadily and survived. Fah-expressing hepatocytes occupied over 95% of the liver tissue 9 months after the treatment. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy prevented the progression of liver cirrhosis, a phenotype that could not be recapitulated in the HTI mouse model. These results strongly suggest that Cas9n-mediated genome editing is a valuable and safe gene therapy strategy for this genetic disease.

Loss of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is responsible for the neonatal hepatic dysfunction phenotype of lethal albino mice.Genes Dev. 1993; 7 (8253378): 2298-230710.1101/gad.7.12a.2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Defects in the FAH gene will cause the accumulation of hepatorenal toxic metabolites, including fumarylacetoacetate and maleylacetoacetate (2de Laet C. Dionisi-Vici C. Leonard J.V. McKiernan P. Mitchell G. Monti L. de Baulny H.O. Pintos-Morell G. Spiekerkötter U. Recommendations for the management of tyrosinaemia type 1.Orphanet. J. Rare Dis. 2013; 8 (23311542): 810.1186/1750-1172-8-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These metabolites lead to severe liver and kidney damage, for example, liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Fanconi syndrome (3Grompe M. The pathophysiology and treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1.Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21 (11745044): 563-57110.1055/s-2001-19035Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Current primary treatment for HTI is 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), a potent inhibitor of an enzyme upstream of FAH to prevent the generation of toxic metabolic intermediate products (2de Laet C.

However, a small proportion of the HTI patients respond poorly to the NTBC treatment, calling for alternative strategies that can fix the mutations in the Fah gene, for instance, gene therapies (4Masurel-Paulet A.

The revolutionary CRISPR/Cas9 technology is one of the most promising tools for genetic modification and therapy of genetic diseases. The programmable nuclease Cas9 is directed by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to efficiently generate a double strand break (DSB) at a DNA target site (5Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337 (22745249): 816-82110.1126/science.1225829Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar). Site-specific DSBs are repaired simultaneously in the cells by two major mechanisms, the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway or the high fidelity homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway (6Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. Genome editing. The new frontier of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9.Science. 2014; 346 (25430774): 1258096-125809710.1126/science.1258096Crossref PubMed Scopus (3581) Google Scholar). Both of the above DNA repair pathways are exploited for gene therapy studies that use NHEJ to delete dominant active mutations or HDR to repair loss-of-function mutations (7Ding Q. Strong A.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34 (26829317): 334-33810.1038/nbt.3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, because HDR efficiency is usually much lower than NHEJ efficiency in Cas9-transduced cells in vivo, most of the DSBs are repaired through the NHEJ pathway to generate numerous undesired indels in the on-target site. It is well-known that a portion of genetic disorders are caused not by null mutations of genes but by point mutations leading to reduction of mRNA expression or protein activity. Large amounts of undesired on-target mutations could ablate the residual function of the original protein, threatening the safety of patients. Additionally, a recent study reported that Cas9-induced on-target indels had unexpected counteractive effects, which made the phenotype of the spfash mice more severe (11Yang Y. Wang L. Bell P. McMenamin D. He Z. White J. Yu H. Xu C. Morizono H. Musunuru K. Batshaw M.L. Wilson J.M. A dual AAV system enables the Cas9-mediated correction of a metabolic liver disease in newborn mice.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 (26829317): 334-33810.1038/nbt.3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This observation raises a critical issue of how to reduce the undesired indels in genome editing-mediated gene therapy. Cas9 functions through two catalytic domains, a HNH domain and a RuvC-like domain. Introduction of a single amino acid substitution (usually D10A or H840A) in either of the domains generates the Cas9 nickase (Cas9n), which only creates a single strand break in targeted sites (12Cong L.

Hence, whether Cas9n-induced high fidelity DNA repair is feasible to correct genetic mutations for in vivo gene therapy is an area of active investigation. To test the therapeutic effects of Cas9n, we generated a rat HTI model with a 10-bp deletion in exon 2 of the Fah gene through the Cas9 system as previously described (18Zhang L. Shao Y. Li L. Tian F. Cen J. Chen X. Hu D. Zhou Y. Xie W. Zheng Y. Ji Y. Liu M. Li D. Hui L. Efficient liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocyte prevents cirrhosis in a rat model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Sci.Rep. 2016; 6 (27510266)31460 Google Scholar). As HTI rats are the only model to produce liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, we also evaluated whether gene therapy could prevent or reduce liver damage after long-term observation. A two-vector system was generated to deliver sgRNA/donor template and WT Cas9 or Cas9n through the tail vein into adult HTI rats. Through parallel comparisons, we demonstrated both Cas9 and Cas9n-mediated genome editing could correct the 10-bp Fah deletion in hepatocytes, which expanded in the absence of NTBC treatment and occupied 95% of the liver tissue after 9 months of the treatment. More importantly, unlike WT Cas9, which induced numerous on-target indels, Cas9n did not generate undesired mutations in the sites examined suggesting that Cas9n-mediated genome editing is a valuable and high fidelity gene therapy strategy for some genetic diseases. To confirm that Cas9n-induced SSBs are precisely repaired in cells with greatly reduced on-target and off-target indels, we compared the indel rates induced by Cas9 and Cas9n (the D10A mutant of SpyCas9 used in this study) in the EMX1 and VEGFA loci by two sgRNAs, which had been reported to frequently induce off-target mutations (16Ran F.A.

For each targeting site, 90 clones were sequenced. In accordance with previous publications (15Gao Y. Wu H. Wang Y. Liu X. Chen L. Li Q. Cui C. Liu X. Zhang J. Zhang Y.

Moreover, the indel sizes created by WT Cas9 ranged from −100 to +108 bp, showing an unpredictable pattern of NHEJ-induced indels (Fig. S1, A and C). On the other hand, Cas9n only created nucleotide substitutions at a low rate in on-target sites of the EMX1 locus (0.74%) but not in the VEGFA locus (Fig. 1B; Fig. S1B). Consistently, Cas9n induced rare off-target mutations in only one of the VEGF off-target sites (0.43% in OT-3-1), whereas off-target events caused by WT Cas9 were detected in each site tested, ranging from 0.81% for the lowest (OT) to 41.84% for the highest (OT-3-1), with the largest indel up to 57 bp (Fig. 1C; Fig. S2, A–C). Our results suggest that Cas9n induces indels extremely rarely. Earlier studies demonstrated that the rat HTI model recapitulates the key chronic symptoms of human HTI patient's liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (18Zhang L. Shao Y. Li L. Tian F. Cen J. Chen X. Hu D.

In this study, we sought to generate a disease model with more nucleotide mutations to investigate the efficiency and efficacy of Cas9-mediated gene therapy. We generated a novel Fah mutant (FahΔ10/Δ10) rat strain in the Sprague-Dawley genetic background with a 10-bp deletion in exon 2 from a different founder than previously reported (18Zhang L. Shao Y. Li L. Tian F. Cen J. Chen X. Hu D. Zhou Y. Xie W. Zheng Y. Ji Y. Liu M. Li D. Hui L. Efficient liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocyte prevents cirrhosis in a rat model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Sci.Rep. 2016; 6 (27510266)31460 Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B; Table S2). We confirmed that Fah expression is absent in the liver of homozygous mutants but not in WT or heterozygous rats by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C). After withdrawal of NTBC for 4 weeks the severe liver cirrhosis resulting from HTI was visualized by Masson's trichrome staining (Fig. 2D). Also, numerous activated hepatic stellate cells were detected by immunohistochemical staining of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Fig. 2E). Serum biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (TBIL), rose significantly, indicating severe liver damage in the FahΔ10/Δ10 rat (Fig. 2F). Thus, we successfully generated a Fah knockout rat that mimicked human HTI. Next, we investigated the ability of Cas9n to genetically correct the rat HTI model in vivo using WT Cas9 as a control. As we previously described (9Guan Y. Ma Y. Li Q. Sun Z. Ma L. Wu L. Wang L. Zeng L. Shao Y. Chen Y. Ma N. Lu W. Hu K. Han H. Yu Y. et al.CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic correction of a novel coagulator factor IX gene mutation ameliorates hemophilia in mouse.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8 (26964564): 477-48810.15252/emmm.201506039Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), recombinant adenovirus was used for packaging Cas9, Cas9n, and the sgRNA/donor template, named AdV–Cas9, AdV–Cas9n, and AdV–HDR, respectively. Cas9 or Cas9n was linked with mCherry through a T2A self-cleaving peptide. The sgRNA and the corrective donor template with 800-bp homology arms on each side of the 10-bp deletion site were inserted into a GFP-expressing vector. We also introduced several silent mutations into the HDR template to prevent re-digestion of the repaired genome (Fig. 3A, left). Immunogenicity is the major side effect of AdV-mediated gene therapy (9Guan Y. Ma Y. Li Q. Sun Z. Ma L. Wu L. Wang L. Zeng L. Shao Y. Chen Y. Ma N. Lu W. Hu K. Han H. Yu Y. et al.CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic correction of a novel coagulator factor IX gene mutation ameliorates hemophilia in mouse.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8 (26964564): 477-48810.15252/emmm.201506039Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To avoid the curative effect being masked by an AdV-induced immune response, a low AdV dose was used to treat the HTI rats. Specifically, 1 × 1010 vector genomes (vgs) of AdV-HDR and 1 × 1010 vgs of AdV-Cas9 or AdV-Cas9n were injected into 4-week-old rats through the tail vein on day 0 (Fig. 3A, right). The control groups received only 1 × 1010 vgs of AdV-HDR or PBS (Table S1). On day 7, partial hepatectomy was performed and the tissues were collected for initial infection and genome editing efficiency analyses. Both GFP- and mCherry-positive hepatocytes were detected in the treated groups and the initial infectious rate was estimated to be 20–30% (Fig. 3B). Genomic fragments containing the targeted site were amplified and cloned into TA vectors. Sequencing of 98 clones from each group detected a 10.2% indel rate in AdV–Cas9-infected livers, with random indel sizes from −50 to +36 bp (Fig. 3C; Fig. S3). More importantly, no indels were identified in the AdV–Cas9n-infected group, which is consistent with our in vitro findings that Cas9n induces extremely few indels at the on-target site compared with WT Cas9. However, we did not detect any clone containing the perfectly fixed Fah sequence among the 98 clones sequenced in each group, suggesting very low repair efficiency. Alternatively, we employed immunohistochemistry to detect Fah-positive cells to examine the initial correction rate. Indeed, sporadic Fah-positive cells were discovered in liver tissues from both Cas9- and Cas9n-treated groups with a similar low efficiency, estimated at about 0.1% (Fig. 3D). These data suggested that AdV-delivered Cas9n did induce HDR and correct the genetic mutations in vivo. Moreover, Cas9n largely reduced the introduction of uncontrollable on-target indels, minimizing the risks from the NHEJ-mediated frame shifts and large deletions. It has been demonstrated that Fah knockout rats can be rescued by WT hepatocyte transplantation and the transplanted cells were able to repopulate the whole liver (18Zhang L. Shao Y. Li L. Tian F. Cen J. Chen X. Hu D. Zhou Y. Xie W. Zheng Y. Ji Y. Liu M. Li D. Hui L. Efficient liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocyte prevents cirrhosis in a rat model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Sci.Rep. 2016; 6 (27510266)31460 Google Scholar). To check whether those initially repaired cells in our experiment can expand normally and take over the mutant cells, all rats were subjected to one cycle of NTBC withdrawal and re-feeding for 8 days and then left untreated for body weight monitoring. In the PBS and the AdV–HDR only control groups, the body weight of the rats sharply decreased 4 weeks after injection and none of them survived through day 40 of the experiment (Fig. 4A; Table S1). In contrast, similar to the AdV–Cas9/AdV–HDR-treated group, rats (3 of 4) that received AdV–Cas9n/AdV–HDR gained weight steadily 5 weeks after the treatment and the body weight ratio almost doubled on day 96 (Fig. 4A). In the meantime, liver damage conditions of both treated groups were monitored by periodic assessment of AST, ALT, and TBIL. As expected, all three markers declined gradually from high serum levels, indicating the acute liver damage after NTBC withdrawal and the gradual expansion of the repaired cells (Fig. 4B). Three months after the treatment, rat liver tissues were obtained via partial hepatectomy for further evaluation. Through IHC analyses, we discovered Fah+-cell-formed patches occupying over 60% of the livers in the AdV–Cas9n-treated group, which was comparable with the AdV–Cas9 group, suggesting successful restoration of repaired hepatocytes via expansion of those initially repaired cells (Fig. 4C). At this stage, liver damage markers (AST, ALT) were substantially reduced to normal levels compared with the NTBC off control group (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, DNA sequencing of 150 clones containing the mutated Fah site suggested that both Cas9 and Cas9n-mediated genome editing precisely repaired the 10-bp deletion in the Fah gene (Fig. 5B). These results above indicated that the repaired hepatocytes gradually expanded and rescued the liver from hepatic damageFigure 5Detection of homology directed repair in rat Fah locus.

Nevertheless, due to the characteristics of the mouse HTI models, previous reports were not able to reveal whether CRISPR/Cas9 rescue in mouse HTI models also rescued mice from progression to liver cirrhosis (8Yin H.

Taking advantage of the rat HTI model, we examined liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in rat HTI liver tissues. Interestingly, although we did discover fibrous septa with strong collagen deposition in both groups by Sirius Red staining 3 months after the injection, we did not detect any activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the Cas9- or NTBC-treated liver slides as indicated by α-SMA staining (Fig. 5C). HSCs are the inducer of fibrosis and the main source of collagen production (21Ismail M.H. Pinzani M. Reversal of liver fibrosis.Saudi J. Gastroenterol. 2009; 15 (19568569): 72-7910.4103/1319-3767.45072Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mismatch between Sirius Red and α-SMA staining may be explained if collagen was produced earlier when repaired hepatocytes were still in the minority. To confirm whether the HSCs were truly reversed to a quiescent state, AdV–Cas9n-treated HTI rats were analyzed at 9 months after injection. We found that Fah-positive cells expanded to ∼95% of the liver tissue (Fig. 4C) and the collagen deposition was significantly narrowed compared with rats treated for 3 months (Fig. 5C).

https://openalex.org/W2794305966,"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins often regulate function upon post-translational modification (PTM) through interactions with folded domains. An IDR linking two α-helices (α1-α2) of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL experiences several PTMs that reduce antiapoptotic activity. Here, we report that PTMs within the α1-α2 IDR promote its interaction with the folded core of Bcl-xL that inhibits the proapoptotic activity of two types of regulatory targets, BH3-only proteins and p53. This autoregulation utilizes an allosteric pathway whereby, in one direction, the IDR induces a direct displacement of p53 from Bcl-xL coupled to allosteric displacement of simultaneously bound BH3-only partners. This pathway operates in the opposite direction when the BH3-only protein PUMA binds to the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-xL, directly displacing other bound BH3-only proteins, and allosterically remodels the distal site, displacing p53. Our findings show how an IDR enhances functional versatility through PTM-dependent allosteric regulation of a folded protein domain. Post-translational modification of residues in an intrinsically disordered region of Bcl-XL promotes interactions with its folded core and allosterically reduces affinity for proapoptotic BH3-domain-containing proteins, resulting in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2792827614,"Every year in the United States, more than 300,000 infants are admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) where they are exposed to a chemical-intensive hospital environment during a developmentally vulnerable period. The neurodevelopmental impact of environmental exposure to phthalates during the NICU stay is unknown. As phthalate exposure during the third trimester developmental window has been implicated in neurobehavioral deficits in term-born children that are strikingly similar to a phenotype of neurobehavioral morbidity common among children born premature, the role of early-life phthalate exposure on the neurodevelopmental trajectory of premature infants may be clinically important. In this study, premature newborns with birth weight <1500g were recruited to participate in a prospective environmental health cohort study, NICU-HEALTH (Hospital Exposures and Long-Term Health), part of the DINE (Developmental Impact of NICU Exposures) cohort of the ECHO (Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes) program. Seventy-six percent of eligible infants enrolled in the study. Sixty-four of 81 infants survived and are included in this analysis. 164 urine specimens were analyzed for phthalate metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was performed prior to NICU discharge. Linear and weighted quantile sum regression quantified associations between phthalate biomarkers and NNNS performance, and between phthalate biomarkers and intensity of medical intervention. The sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) was associated with improved performance on the Attention and Regulation scales. Specific mixtures of phthalate biomarkers were also associated with improved NNNS performance. More intense medical intervention was associated with higher ∑DEHP exposure. NICU-based exposure to phthalates mixtures was associated with improved attention and social response. This suggests that the impact of phthalate exposure on neurodevelopment may follow a non-linear trajectory, perhaps accelerating the development of certain neural networks. The long-term neurodevelopmental impact of NICU-based phthalate exposure needs to be evaluated."

Animals were selected for genetic analysis based on serological reactivity towards a range of recombinant antigens derived from Gag and Env viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of subtypes B2 and A12 in both goats and sheep and subtypes A1 and B1 in goats only. In addition, two novel subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. Co-infections with strains belonging to different subtypes within A and B groups were detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats originating from four flocks. Although the reactivity of serum samples towards the recombinant antigens confirmed immunological relatedness between Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the cross-reactive nature of Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples failed to react with antigens representing all subtypes detected up-to-date in Poland, highlighting the limitations of the serological diagnosis. These data showed the complex nature of SRLV subtypes circulating in sheep and goats in Poland and the need for improving SRLV-related diagnostic capacity."

Designed to interfere with the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction during viral integration, unexpectedly, their major impact was on virus maturation. This activity has been linked to induction of aberrant IN multimerization, whereas inhibition of the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction accounts for weaker antiretroviral effect at integration. Because these dual activities result from INLAI binding to IN at a single binding site, we expected that these activities co-evolved together, driven by the affinity for IN. Using an original INLAI, MUT-A, and its activity on an Ala-125 (A125) IN variant, we found that these two activities on A125-IN can be fully dissociated: MUT-A–induced IN multimerization and the formation of eccentric condensates in viral particles, which are responsible for inhibition of virus maturation, were lost, whereas inhibition of the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction and consequently integration was fully retained. Hence, the mere binding of INLAI to A125 IN is insufficient to promote the conformational changes of IN required for aberrant multimerization. By analyzing the X-ray structures of MUT-A bound to the IN catalytic core domain (CCD) with or without the Ala-125 polymorphism, we discovered that the loss of IN multimerization is due to stabilization of the A125-IN variant CCD dimer, highlighting the importance of the CCD dimerization energy for IN multimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2789672266,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc finger transcription factor critical for the regulation of many cellular functions in both normal and neoplastic cells. Here, using human glioblastoma cells, we investigated KLF4's effects on cancer cell metabolism. We found that forced KLF4 expression promotes mitochondrial fusion and induces dramatic changes in mitochondrial morphology. To determine the impact of these changes on the cellular functions following, we analyzed how KLF4 alters glioblastoma cell metabolism, including glucose uptake, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and oxidative phosphorylation. We did not identify significant differences in baseline cellular metabolism between control and KLF4-expressing cells. However, when mitochondrial function was impaired, KLF4 significantly increased spare respiratory capacity and levels of reactive oxygen species in the cells. To identify the biological effects of these changes, we analyzed proliferation and survival of control and KLF4-expressing cells under stress conditions, including serum and nutrition deprivation. We found that following serum starvation, KLF4 altered cell cycle progression by arresting the cells at the G2/M phase and that KLF4 protected cells from nutrition deprivation-induced death. Finally, we demonstrated that methylation-dependent KLF4-binding activity mediates mitochondrial fusion. Specifically, the downstream targets of KLF4-mCpG binding, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, serve as the effector of KLF4-induced mitochondrial fusion, cell cycle arrest, and cell protection. Our experimental system provides a robust model for studying the interactions between mitochondrial morphology and function, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism, and mitochondrial fusion and cell death during tumor initiation and progression."

Digital planimetry is a popular technique in wound area measurement. It is accurate and repeatable when calibration is performed with 2 rulers placed at opposite sides of a wound. The aim of the current study was improving accuracy and precision of wound area measurement using capabilities of smart devices. Methods The correction of area measurement based on calculated camera tilt angle and the calculation of calibration coefficient of linear dimensions as weighted average were proposed. These and other improvements were applied in the Planimator app for Android, which was then used in the study. Accuracy and precision of the Planimator app were compared to the Visitrak device, the SilhouetteMobile device, the AreaMe software, and to the digital planimetry based on 2-ruler calibration with pictures taken by the smartphone, compact, and D-SLR cameras. Areas of 40 wound shapes of area ranged from 0.14 to 31.72 cm2 were measured with each device. Medians of relative errors (REs) were compared in the accuracy tests and standard deviations (SDs) of relative differences (RDs) were compared in the tests of precision. Results The median of REs for the Planimator app was not significantly different from the medians of REs for the digital planimetry based on pictures from the compact or D-SLR cameras, but it was significantly lower than the medians of REs for the Visitrak and SilhouetteMobile devices, the AreaMe software and the digital planimetry based on pictures from a smartphone camera. The SD of RDs for the Planimator app was not significantly different from the SDs of RDs for the digital planimetry based on pictures from the compact or D-SLR cameras, but it was significantly lower than the SDs of RDs for the Visitrak and SilhouetteMobile devices, the AreaMe software and the digital planimetry based on pictures from a smartphone camera. The Planimator app installed at a smartphone revealed to be 2-fold more accurate and 1.5-fold more precise than the measurements with using ImageJ software based on pictures taken with the same smartphone. Conclusions The Planimator app occurred to have the same accuracy and precision as measurements with digital planimetry with 2-ruler calibration and based on pictures from a compact camera or a D-SLR camera. This app showed better accuracy and precision than the Visitrak and SilhouetteMobile devices, the AreaMe software and the digital planimetry based on pictures from a smartphone camera."

Animals in the conventional treatment group (n = 6) received intravenous application of 2 mg/kg body weight colistin daily. Animals in the EVLP group (n = 6) had their LLL explanted and perfused ex vivo with a perfusion solution containing 200 μg/ml colistin. After two hours of ex vivo treatment, autotransplantation of the LLL was performed. All animals were followed for 4 days following the initiation of treatment. In the control and conventional treatment groups, the infection-related mortality rate after five days was 66.7%. In the EVLP group, there was one infection-related mortality and one procedure-related mortality, for an overall mortality rate of 33.3%. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of infection were less severe in the EVLP group than the other groups. Ex vivo lung perfusion with very high dose antibiotics presents a new therapeutic option of last resort for otherwise incurable multidrug resistant pneumonia without toxic side effects on other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2791614710,"Objective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease driven by multiple interacting pathophysiological processes that ultimately results in synaptic loss, neuronal death, and dementia. We implemented a fit-for-purpose modeled approach to qualify a broad selection of commercially available immunoassays and evaluate the biotemporal stability of analytes across five pathophysiological domains of interest in AD, including core amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau AD biomarkers, neurodegeneration, inflammation/immune modulation, neurovascular injury, and metabolism/oxidative stress. Methods Paired baseline and eight-week CSFs from twenty participants in a clinical drug trial for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD were used to evaluate sensitivity, intra-assay precision, inter-assay replicability, and eight-week biotemporal stability for sixty unique analytes measured with commercially available single- and multi-plex ELISA assays. Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated, and intraclass correlation and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were applied. Results We identified 32 biomarker candidates with good to excellent performance characteristics according to assay technical performance and CSF analyte biotemporal stability cut-off criteria. These included: 1) the core AD biomarkers Aβ1–42, Aβ1–40, Aβ1–38, and total tau; 2) non-Aβ, non-tau neurodegeneration markers NfL and FABP3; 3) inflammation/immune modulation markers IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12/23p40, IL-15, IL-16, MCP-1, MDC, MIP-1β, and YKL-40; 4) neurovascular markers Flt-1, ICAM-1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-10, PlGF, VCAM-1, VEGF, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D; and 5) metabolism/oxidative stress markers 24-OHC, adiponectin, leptin, soluble insulin receptor, and 8-OHdG. Conclusions Assays for these CSF analytes demonstrate consistent sensitivity, reliability, and biotemporally stability for use in a multiple pathophysiological CSF biomarker panel to profile AD. Their qualification enables further investigation for use in AD diagnosis, staging and progression, disease mechanism profiling, and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2790559564,"Background Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), the administration of complete therapeutic courses of antimalarials to children aged 3–59 months during the malaria transmission season, is a new strategy recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for malaria control in Sahelian countries such as Mali with seasonal transmission. The strategy is a highly cost-effective approach to reduce malaria burden in these areas. Despite the substantial benefits of SMC on malaria infection and disease, the optimal approach to deliver SMC remains to be determined. While fixed-point delivery (FPD) and non-directly observed treatment (NDOT) by community health workers are logistically attractive, these need to be evaluated and compared to other modes of delivery for maximal coverage. Methods To determine the optimal mode fixed-point (FPD) vs door-to-door delivery (DDD); directly observed treatment (DOT) vs. non- directly observed treatment (NDOT)), 31 villages in four health sub-districts were randomized to receive three rounds of SMC with Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus Amodiaquine (SP+AQ) at monthly intervals using one of the following methods: FPD+DOT; FPD+NDOT; DDD+DOT; DDD+NDOT. The primary endpoint was SMC coverage assessed by cross-sectional survey of 2,035 children at the end of intervention period. Results Coverage defined as the proportion of children who received all three days of SMC treatment during the three monthly rounds based information collected by interview (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in children who received SMC using DDD 74% (95% CI 69% - 80%) compared to FPD 60% (95% CI 50% - 70%); p = 0.009. It was similar in children who received SMC using DOT or NDOT 65%, (95% CI 55% - 76%) versus 68% (95% CI 57% - 79%); p = 0.72. Conclusions In summary, door-to-door delivery of SMC provides better coverage than FPD. Directly observed therapy, which requires more time and resources, did not improve coverage with SMC.

https://openalex.org/W2791728421,"With the evolution of communication technology and the exponential increase of mobile devices, the ubiquitous networking allows people to use our data and computing resources anytime and everywhere. However, numerous security concerns and complicated requirements arise as these ubiquitous networks are deployed throughout people’s lives. To meet the challenge, the user authentication schemes in ubiquitous networks should ensure the essential security properties for the preservation of the privacy with low computational cost. In 2017, Chaudhry et al. proposed a password-based authentication scheme for the roaming in ubiquitous networks to enhance the security. Unfortunately, we found that their scheme remains insecure in its protection of the user privacy. In this paper, we prove that Chaudhry et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to the stolen-mobile device and user impersonation attacks, and its drawbacks comprise the absence of the incorrect login-input detection, the incorrectness of the password change phase, and the absence of the revocation provision. Moreover, we suggest a possible way to fix the security flaw in Chaudhry et al’s scheme by using the biometric-based authentication for which the bio-hash is applied in the implementation of a three-factor authentication. We prove the security of the proposed scheme with the random oracle model and formally verify its security properties using a tool named ProVerif, and analyze it in terms of the computational and communication cost. The analysis result shows that the proposed scheme is suitable for resource-constrained ubiquitous environments."
https://openalex.org/W2793234924,"Objective We investigated the relationship between plasma miRNAs levels and inflammatory characteristics in asthmatic patients. Methods Eligible adults with untreated asthma (n = 35) underwent a clinical assessment, sputum induction, and assessment of pulmonary function test and Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores. Asthma phenotypes were defined using the sputum cell count. miR-199a-5p expression was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was used to detect miR-199a-5p secretion from peripheral blood-derived neutrophil, lymphocyte, macrophage and BEAS-2B cells. The correlation of miR-199a-5p expression with clinical parameters was analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. In silico analysis predicted the target genes and signaling pathway of miR-199a-5p. Transfection of miR-199a-5p mimics in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) was performed in vitro. Results The miRNA-199a-5p levels in plasma and sputum increased significantly in patients with neutrophilic asthma compared to healthy subjects (ps = 0.014 and 0.006, respectively). Expression of miR-199a-5p in the plasma of asthmatic patients positively correlated with sputum miR-199a-5p expression (r = 0.511, p = 0.021). The miR-199a-5p level was only elevated with LPS stimulation in neutrophils but not macrophages, lymphocytes, or epithelial cells from healthy controls (p < 0.01). miR-199a-5p expression increased in response to LPS (p = 0.005) and LPS combined with IL-4 (p = 0.003), but not IL-4 alone. However, peripheral neutrophils from eosinophilic asthma patients did not respond to LPS with increased miR-199a-5p expression (n = 5, p > 0.05) in contrast to the significant response from neutrophilic patients (n = 4, p < 0.0001). miR-199a-5p negatively correlated with FEV1, FVC and PEF (r = -0.377, p = 0.026; r = -0.419, p = 0.012; and r = -0.392, p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate correlation analysis confirmed that the plasma miR-199a-5p levels negatively correlated with FEV1 in patients with asthma (Adjusted R2 = 0.164, p = 0.015). In silico analysis suggested that the WNT signaling pathway participates in miR-199a-5p mediation of smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. In vitro experiment, miR-199a-5p mimics inhibited the protein expressions of WNT2 and WNT4, decreased the c-myc expression and dramatically increased the Sm-MHC expression in HASMCs. Conclusion Plasma miR-199a-5p was increased in neutrophilic asthma and negatively correlated with pulmonary function, which suggests that miR-199a-5p actively contributes to disease pathogenesis by modulating the inflammatory process and transferring the signal from inflammatory cells to structure cells."

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) derived oxidants and HDL proteome changes are implicated in HDL dysfunction in subjects with CAD in the United States; however, the effect of MPO on HDL function and HDL proteome in ethnic Chinese population is unknown. We recruited four matched ethnic Chinese groups (20 patients each): subjects with 1) low HDL levels (HDL levels in men 50mg/dL; women >60mg/dL) with no CAD; and 4) high HDL with CAD. Serum cytokines, serum MPO levels, serum CEC, MPO-oxidized HDL tyrosine moieties, and HDL proteome were assessed by mass spectrometry individually in the four groups. The cytokines, MPO levels, and HDL proteome profiles were not significantly different between the four groups. As expected, CEC was depressed in the entire CAD group but more specifically in the CAD low-HDL group. HDL of CAD subjects had significantly higher 3-nitrotyrosine than non-CAD subjects, but the MPO-specific 3-chlorotyrosine was unchanged; CEC in the CAD low-HDL group did not correlate with either HDL 3-chlorotyrosine or 3-nitrotyrosine levels. Neither 3-chlorotyrosine, which is MPO-specific, nor 3-nitrotyrosine generated from MPO or other reactive nitrogen species was associated with CEC. MPO mediated oxidative stress and HDL proteome composition changes are not the primary cause HDL dysfunction in Chinese subjects with CAD. These studies highlight ethnic differences in HDL dysfunction between United States and Chinese cohorts raising possibility of unique pathways of HDL dysfunction in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2770351479,"Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) provides a way to directly observe the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). To this end, FRET based biosensors are made, employing heterotrimeric G-protein subunits tagged with fluorescent proteins. These FRET based biosensors complement existing, indirect, ways to observe GPCR activation. Here we report on the insertion of mTurquoise2 at several sites in the human Gα13 subunit, aiming to develop a FRET-based Gα13 activation biosensor. Three fluorescently tagged Gα13 variants were found to be functional based on i) plasma membrane localization and ii) ability to recruit p115-RhoGEF upon activation of the LPA2 receptor. The tagged Gα13 subunits were used as FRET donor and combined with cp173Venus fused to the Gγ2 subunit, as the acceptor. We constructed Gα13 biosensors by generating a single plasmid that produces Gα13-mTurquoise2, Gβ1 and cp173Venus-Gγ2. The Gα13 activation biosensors showed a rapid and robust response when used in primary human endothelial cells that were exposed to thrombin, triggering endogenous protease activated receptors (PARs). This response was efficiently inhibited by the RGS domain of p115-RhoGEF and from the biosensor data we inferred that this is due to GAP activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the Gα13 sensor can be used to dissect heterotrimeric G-protein coupling efficiency in single living cells. We conclude that the Gα13 biosensor is a valuable tool for live-cell measurements that probe spatiotemporal aspects of Gα13 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2791377148,"Background Hereditary hypophosphatemia is a group of rare renal phosphate wasting disorders. The diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological, and biochemical features, and may require genetic testing to be confirmed. Methodology Clinical features and mutation spectrum were investigated in patients with hereditary hypophosphatemia. Genomic DNA of 23 patients from 15 unrelated families were screened sequentially by PCR-sequencing analysis for mutations in the following genes: PHEX, FGF23, DMP1, ENPP1, CLCN5, SLC34A3 and SLC34A1. CytoScan HD Array was used to identify large deletions. Results Genetic evaluation resulted in the identification of an additional asymptomatic but intermittent hypophosphatemic subject. Mutations were detected in 21 patients and an asymptomatic sibling from 13 families (86.6%, 13/15). PHEX mutations were identified in 20 patients from 12 families. Six of them were novel mutations present in 9 patients: c.983_987dupCTACC, c.1586+2T>G, c.1206delA, c.436+1G>T, c.1217G>T, and g.22,215,887–22,395,767del (179880 bp deletion including exon 16–22 and ZNF645). Six previously reported mutations were found in 11 patients. Among 12 different PHEX mutations, 6 were de novo mutations. Patients with de novo PHEX mutations often had delayed diagnosis and significantly shorter in height than those who had inherited PHEX mutations. Novel compound heterozygous mutations in SLC34A3 were found in one patient and his asymptomatic sister: c.1335+2T>A and c.1639_1652del14. No mutation was detected in two families. Conclusions This is the largest familial study on Turkish patients with hereditary hypophosphatemia. PHEX mutations, including various novel and de novo variants, are the most common genetic defect. More attention should be paid to hypophosphatemia by clinicians since some cases remain undiagnosed both during childhood and adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2791955697,"Objective To examine the prognostic value of the Fear Avoidance Model (FAM) variables when predicting pain intensity and disability 10-weeks postoperative following lumbar disc surgery. Methods We recruited patients scheduled for first-time, single level lumbar disc surgery. The following aspects of the FAM were assessed at preoperative baseline and after 10 postoperative weeks: numeric pain rating scale (0–10) for leg and back pain intensity separately, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Multivariate regression models were used to examine the best combination of baseline FAM variables to predict the 10-week leg pain, back pain, and disability. All multivariate models were adjusted for age and sex. Results 60 patients (30 females, mean [SD] age = 40.4 [9.5]) were enrolled. All FAM measures correlated with disability at baseline. Adding FAM variables to each of the stepwise multiple linear regression model explained a significant amount of the variance in disability (Adj. R2 = .38, p < .001), leg pain intensity (Adj. R2 = .25, p = .001), and back pain intensity Adj. R2 = .32, p < .001 at 10-weeks). After adjusting for age and gender, BDI and FABQ-work subscale were the only significant predictors added to each of the prediction models for the 10-week clinical outcome (leg pain, back pain, and ODI). Conclusion BDI and FABQ-work subscale variables are associated with baseline pain intensity and disability and predict short-term pain and disability following lumbar disc surgery. Measuring these variables in patients being considered for lumbar disc surgery may improve patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2793136114,"Repair of complex CNS circuitry requires newly incorporated neurons to become appropriately, functionally integrated. One approach is to direct differentiation of endogenous progenitors in situ, or ex vivo followed by transplantation. Prior studies find that newly incorporated neurons can establish long-distance axon projections, form synapses and functionally integrate in evolutionarily old hypothalamic energy-balance circuitry. We now demonstrate that postnatal neocortical connectivity can be reconstituted with point-to-point precision, including cellular integration of specific, molecularly identified projection neuron subtypes into correct positions, combined with development of appropriate long-distance projections and synapses. Using optogenetics-based electrophysiology, experiments demonstrate functional afferent and efferent integration of transplanted neurons into transcallosal projection neuron circuitry. Results further indicate that ‘primed’ early postmitotic neurons, including already fate-restricted deep-layer projection neurons and/or plastic postmitotic neuroblasts with partially fate-restricted potential, account for the predominant population of neurons capable of achieving this optimal level of integration. This work demonstrates subtype-specific molecular fidelity, laminar positioning, long-distance interhemisheric connectivity and electrophysiologic circuit integration by developmentally primed, microtransplanted neurons in postnatal mouse neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2794400334,"In αI integrins, including leukocyte function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), ligand-binding function is delegated to the αI domain, requiring extra steps in the relay of signals that activate ligand binding and coordinate it with cytoplasmic signals. Crystal structures reveal great variation in orientation between the αI domain and the remainder of the integrin head. Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in signal relay to the αI domain, including whether binding of the ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to the αI domain is linked to headpiece opening and engenders a preferred αI domain orientation. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and negative-stain EM, we define structures of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and their complex, and the effect of activation by Mn2+. Headpiece opening was substantially stabilized by substitution of Mg2+ with Mn2+ and became complete upon ICAM-1 addition. These agents stabilized αI-headpiece orientation, resulting in a well-defined orientation of ICAM-1 such that its tandem Ig-like domains pointed in the opposite direction from the β-subunit leg of LFA-1. Mutations in the integrin βI domain α1/α1′ helix stabilizing either the open or the closed βI-domain conformation indicated that α1/α1′ helix movements are linked to ICAM-1 binding by the αI domain and to the extended-open conformation of the ectodomain. The LFA-1–ICAM-1 orientation described here with ICAM-1 pointing anti-parallel to the LFA-1 β-subunit leg is the same orientation that would be stabilized by tensile force transmitted between the ligand and the actin cytoskeleton and is consistent with the cytoskeletal force model of integrin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2790580464,"An efficient method for finding a better maximizer of computationally extensive probability distributions is proposed on the basis of a Bayesian optimization technique. A key idea of the proposed method is to use extreme values of acquisition functions by Gaussian processes for the next training phase, which should be located near a local maximum or a global maximum of the probability distribution. Our Bayesian optimization technique is applied to the posterior distribution in the effective physical model estimation, which is a computationally extensive probability distribution. Even when the number of sampling points on the posterior distributions is fixed to be small, the Bayesian optimization provides a better maximizer of the posterior distributions in comparison to those by the random search method, the steepest descent method, or the Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, the Bayesian optimization improves the results efficiently by combining the steepest descent method and thus it is a powerful tool to search for a better maximizer of computationally extensive probability distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2791393998,"Childhood obesity represents a major health concern worldwide due to its well established detrimental effect on cardiovascular and its potential negative effect on kidney functions. However, biomarkers that can help diagnose early stages of kidney damage in obese children represent an unmet clinical need.In this study, we asked whether the prevalence of microalbuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or hyperuricemia recorded in a wide cohort of obese children and adolescents would positively correlate with cardiometabolic dysfunction in these subjects.We carried out a cross-sectional study on 360 obese children and adolescents between the ages of 3-18 years, enrolled in a tertiary care center. Clinical and biochemical evaluations including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed on all patients. Microalbuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (u-ACR) of 30-300 mg/g. All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), absolute values or percentages. Sex age-specific and eGFR SDs were used for statistical analyses. Serum uric acid ≥ 5.5 mg/dL was considered abnormal.The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 6.4%. Except for a lower insulinogenic-index, no correlations between microalbuminuria and cardiometabolic risk factors were detected. eGFR was < -1 SD and > 1 SD in 1.4% and 60.8% of subjects, respectively. Subjects with an eGFR > 1 SD had higher systolic blood pressure, liver enzymes, insulin resistance, glucose and insulin during OGTT, lower insulin sensitivity and a more prevalent microalbuminuria. Hyperuricemia (27.5%) increased the odds of hypertension, HDL ≤ 10th percentile and glucose ≥ 155.0 mg/dL after 60 minutes of OGTT.A worse cardiometabolic profile was observed in subjects with an eGFR > 1 SD compared to other subgroups. Therefore, pediatric obese patients with eGFR > 1 SD or hyperuricemia should be closely monitored for microalbuminuria and post-challenge glucose and insulin secretion, all potential indicators of renal dysfunction in these young patients."
https://openalex.org/W2790305145,"Vancomycin is a standard treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, and its efficacy is closely linked to the recommended serum trough concentration of 15-20 mg/L. However, it is unknown how the pre-dialysis trough serum concentration (Cpre-HD) correlates with MRSA eradication in renal failure patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis (HD).To evaluate the relationship between Cpre-HD and the treatment outcomes in this population.A retrospective study was conducted to enroll renal failure patients undergoing HD who had received vancomycin treatment for MRSA bacteremia during January 2013 to June 2016. Treatment failure was defined as persistent bacteremia after ≥ 7 days of vancomycin therapy or recurrent MRSA infection within 30 days. Patient characteristics, vancomycin dosing regimen, Cpre-HD, vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and subsequent culture data were reviewed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to find the optimal cut-off point of Cpre-HD.42 patients were enrolled and 64% had treatment failure. Although there were no significant differences in demographics or Cpre-HD between the two groups, Cpre-HD/MIC was significantly higher in the success group than that in the failure group (22.80±10.90 vs. 14.94±6.11, p = 0.019). The area under the ROC curve was 0.74, while the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 67%, 78%, 62.5%, and 81%, respectively, at the optimal Cpre-HD/MIC of ≧ 18.6.Cpre-HD/MIC was associated with vancomycin treatment outcome in MRSA bacteremia, and targeting to achieve a Cpre-HD/MIC of ≧ 18.6 may improve treatment outcomes in renal failure patients who are on intermittent HD."
https://openalex.org/W2794002198,"Environmental parameters, such as food level and water temperature, have been shown to be major factors influencing pearl oyster shell growth and molecular mechanisms involved in this biomineralization process. The present study investigates the effect of food level (i.e., microalgal concentration) and water temperature, in laboratory controlled conditions, on the last stages of pearl mineralization in order to assess their impact on pearl quality. To this end, grafted pearl oysters were fed at different levels of food and subjected to different water temperatures one month prior to harvest to evaluate the effect of these factors on 1) pearl and shell deposition rate, 2) expression of genes involved in biomineralization in pearl sacs, 3) nacre ultrastructure (tablet thickness and number of tablets deposited per day) and 4) pearl quality traits. Our results revealed that high water temperature stimulates both shell and pearl deposition rates. However, low water temperature led to thinner nacre tablets, a lower number of tablets deposited per day and impacted pearl quality with better luster and fewer defects. Conversely, the two tested food level had no significant effects on shell and pearl growth, pearl nacre ultrastructure or pearl quality. However, one gene, Aspein, was significantly downregulated in high food levels. These results will be helpful for the pearl industry. A wise strategy to increase pearl quality would be to rear pearl oysters at a high water temperature to increase pearl growth and consequently pearl size; and to harvest pearls after a period of low water temperature to enhance luster and to reduce the number of defects."
https://openalex.org/W2790779789,"Background Plasmodium knowlesi is recognised as the main cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia. The disease is often misdiagnosed as P. falciparum or P. malariae infections by microscopy, and the disease is difficult to eliminate due to its presence in both humans and monkeys. P. knowlesi infections can rapidly cause severe disease and require prompt diagnosis and treatment. No protein biomarker exists for the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of P. knowlesi infections. Plasmodium knowlesi infections can be diagnosed by PCR. Methods and principal findings Phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) is involved in malaria lipid biosynthesis and is not found in the human host. The P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi PMT proteins were recombinantly expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli host cells, affinity purified and used to raise antibodies in chickens. Antibodies against each recombinant PMT protein all detected all three recombinant proteins and the native 29 kDa P. falciparum PMT protein on western blots and in ELISA. Antibodies against a PMT epitope (PLENNQYTDEGVKC) common to all three PMT orthologues detected all three proteins. Antibodies against unique peptides from each orthologue of PMT, PfCEVEHKYLHENKE, PvVYSIKEYNSLKDC, PkLYPTDEYNSLKDC detected only the parent protein in western blots and P. falciparum infected red blood cell lysates or blood lysates spiked with the respective proteins. Similar concentrations of PfPMT and the control, PfLDH, were detected in the same parasite lysate. The recombinant PfPMT protein was detected by a human anti-malaria antibody pool. Conclusion PMT, like the pan-specific LDH biomarker used in RDT tests, is both soluble, present at comparable concentrations in the parasite and constitutes a promising antimalarial drug target. PMT is absent from the human proteome. PMT has the potential as a biomarker for human malaria and in particular as the first P. knowlesi specific protein with diagnostic potential for the identification of a P. knowlesi infection."
https://openalex.org/W2791383143,"Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 can grow without lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Lack of LOS can result from disruption of the early lipid A biosynthetic pathway genes lpxA, lpxC or lpxD. Although LOS itself is not essential for growth of A. baumannii ATCC 19606, it was previously shown that depletion of the lipid A biosynthetic enzyme LpxK in cells inhibited growth due to the toxic accumulation of lipid A pathway intermediates. Growth of LpxK-depleted cells was restored by chemical inhibition of LOS biosynthesis using CHIR-090 (LpxC) and fatty acid biosynthesis using cerulenin (FabB/F) and pyridopyrimidine (acetyl-CoA-carboxylase). Here, we expand on this by showing that inhibition of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), responsible for converting trans-2-enoyl-ACP into acyl-ACP during the fatty acid elongation cycle also restored growth during LpxK depletion. Inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis during LpxK depletion rescued growth at 37°C, but not at 30°C, whereas rescue by LpxC inhibition was temperature independent. We exploited these observations to demonstrate proof of concept for a targeted medium-throughput growth restoration screening assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of LOS and fatty acid biosynthesis. The differential temperature dependence of fatty acid and LpxC inhibition provides a simple means by which to separate growth stimulating compounds by pathway. Targeted cell-based screening platforms such as this are important for faster identification of compounds inhibiting pathways of interest in antibacterial discovery for clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens."

This strategy includes two parts: a degree assessment of unbalanced passenger demand and an optimization of the limited-stop service. The degree assessment of unbalanced passenger demand, which is based on the different passenger demand between stations and the unbalance of passengers within the station, is used to judge whether implementing the limited-stop service is necessary for a bus route. The optimization of limited-stop service considers the influence of stop skipping action and bus capacity on the left-over passengers to determine the proper skipping stations for the bus fleet serving the entire route by minimizing both the waiting time and in-vehicle time of passengers and the running time of vehicles. A solution algorithm based on genetic algorithm is also presented to evaluate the degree of unbalanced passenger demand and optimize the limited-stop scheme. Then, the proper strategy is tested on a bus route in Changchun city of China. The threshold of degree assessment of unbalanced passenger demand can be calibrated and adapted to different passenger demands."
https://openalex.org/W2791437323,"Recent studies have shown that Anopheles oswaldoi sensu lato comprises a cryptic species complex in South America. Anopheles konderi, which was previously raised to synonymy with An. oswaldoi, has also been suggested to form a species complex. An. oswaldoi has been incriminated as a malaria vector in some areas of the Brazilian Amazon, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, but was not recognized as a vector in the remaining regions in its geographic distribution. The role of An. konderi as a malaria vector is unknown or has been misattributed to An. oswaldoi. The focus of this study was molecular identification to infer the evolutionary relationships and preliminarily delimit the geographic distribution of the members of these complexes in the Brazilian Amazon region. The specimens were sampled from 18 localities belonging to five states in the Brazilian Amazon and sequenced for two molecular markers: the DNA barcode region (COI gene of mitochondrial DNA) and Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2 ribosomal DNA). COI (83 sequences) and ITS2 (27 sequences) datasets generated 43 and 10 haplotypes, respectively. Haplotype networks and phylogenetic analyses generated with the barcode region (COI gene) recovered five groups corresponding to An. oswaldoi s.s., An. oswaldoi B, An. oswaldoi A, An. konderi and An. sp. nr. konderi; all pairwise genetic distances were greater than 3%. The group represented by An. oswaldoi A exhibited three strongly supported lineages. The molecular dating indicated that the diversification process in these complexes started approximately 2.8 Mya, in the Pliocene. These findings confirm five very closely related species and present new records for these species in the Brazilian Amazon region. The paraphyly observed for the An. oswaldoi complex suggests that An. oswaldoi and An. konderi complexes may comprise a unique species complex named Oswaldoi-Konderi. Anopheles oswaldoi B may be a potential malaria vector in the extreme north of the Brazilian Amazon, whereas evidence of sympatry for the remaining species in other parts of the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Amazonas, Pará and Rondônia) precluded identification of probable vectors in those areas."
https://openalex.org/W2791407637,"The accumulation of findings that most responders in the ultimatum game reject unfair offers provides evidence that humans are driven by social preferences such as preferences for fairness and prosociality. On the other hand, if and how the proposer’s behavior is affected by social preferences remains unelucidated. We addressed this question for the first time by manipulating the knowledge that the proposer had about the responder’s belief concerning the intentionality of the proposer. In a new game called the “ultimatum game with ambiguous intentions of the proposer (UGAMB),” we made the intentionality of the proposer ambiguous to the recipient. We expected and found that the proposer would make more unfair offers in this new game than in the standard ultimatum game. This expectation can be derived from either the preference-based model or the strategy model of the proposer’s giving decision. The additional finding that more unfair giving in the UGAMB was not mediated by the proposer’s expectation that the recipient would be more willing to accept unfair offers provided support for the preference-based model. Using a psychological measure of cognitive control, the preference-based model received additional support through a conceptual replication of the previous finding that cognitive control of intuitive drive for prosociality in the dictator game, rather than mind reading in the ultimatum game, is responsible for the difference in giving between the two games."
https://openalex.org/W2793287029,"A novel and simple method for detecting 6 zearalenones in animal feed using liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunoaffinity columns (IAC) was developed. The chromatographic peaks of the 6 zearalenones were successfully identified by comparing their retention times and mass spectrum with reference standards. The mobile phase was composed of mobile phase A (water) and B (0.5% formic acid in ACN). Method validation was performed with linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy and precision. The limits of detection (LODs) for the instrument used to study zearalenones ranged from 0.3 to 1.1 μg/kg, and the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 1.0 to 2.2 μg/kg. Average recoveries of the 6 zearalenones ranged from 82.5% to 106.4%. Method replication resulted in intra-day and inter-day peak area variation of <3.8%. The developed method was specific and reliable and is suited for the routine analysis of zearalenones in animal feed."
https://openalex.org/W2793883488,"Nitrite is recognized as a bioactive nitric oxide (NO) metabolite. We have shown that nitrite inhibits platelet activation and increases platelet cGMP levels in the presence of partially deoxygenated erythrocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of nitrite on phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein on residue serine 239 (P-VASPSer239), a marker of protein kinase G (PKG) activation, in human platelets. In platelet-rich plasma (PRP), nitrite itself had no effect on levels of P-VASPSer239 while DEANONOate increased P-VASPSer239. Deoxygenation of PRP + erythrocytes (20% hematocrit) raised baseline P-VASPSer239 in platelets. At 20% hematocrit, nitrite (10 μM) increased P-VASPSer239 in platelets about 31% at 10–20 minutes of incubation while the levels of P-VASPSer157, a marker of protein kinase A (PKA) activation, were not changed. Nitrite increased P-VASPSer239 in platelets in the presence of deoxygenated erythrocytes at 20–40% hematocrit, but the effects were slightly greater at 20% hematocrit. In conclusion, our data confirm that nitrite increases P-VASPSer239 in platelets in the presence of deoxygenated erythrocytes. They also further support the idea that partially deoxygenated erythrocytes may modulate platelet activity, at least in part, via the NO/sGC/PKG pathway from NO formed by reduction of circulating nitrite ions."
https://openalex.org/W2792553738,"Mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) vectors have several advantages as gene delivery vectors, such as stable and independent maintenance in host cells without integration, transferability from donor cells to recipient cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT), and the potential for loading a megabase-sized DNA fragment. Previously, a MAC containing a multi-integrase platform (MI-MAC) was developed to facilitate the transfer of multiple genes into desired cells. Although the MI system can theoretically hold five gene-loading vectors (GLVs), there are a limited number of drugs available for the selection of multiple-GLV integration. To overcome this issue, we attempted to knock out and reuse drug resistance genes (DRGs) using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In this study, we developed new methods for multiple-GLV integration. As a proof of concept, we introduced five GLVs in the MI-MAC by these methods, in which each GLV contained a gene encoding a fluorescent or luminescent protein (EGFP, mCherry, BFP, Eluc, and Cluc). Genes of interest (GOI) on the MI-MAC were expressed stably and functionally without silencing in the host cells. Furthermore, the MI-MAC carrying five GLVs was transferred to other cells by MMCT, and the resultant recipient cells exhibited all five fluorescence/luminescence signals. Thus, the MI-MAC was successfully used as a multiple-GLV integration vector using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The MI-MAC employing these methods may resolve bottlenecks in developing multiple-gene humanized models, multiple-gene monitoring models, disease models, reprogramming, and inducible gene expression systems."
https://openalex.org/W2793292486,"In particle radiotherapy, range uncertainty is an important issue that needs to be overcome. Because high-dose conformality can be achieved using a particle beam, a small uncertainty can affect tumor control or cause normal-tissue complications. From this perspective, the treatment planning system (TPS) must be accurate. However, there is a well-known inaccuracy regarding dose computation in heterogeneous media. This means that verifying the uncertainty level is one of the prerequisites for TPS commissioning. We evaluated the range accuracy of the dose computation algorithm implemented in a commercial TPS, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation against measurement using a CT calibration phantom. A treatment plan was produced for eight different materials plugged into a phantom, and two-dimensional doses were measured using a chamber array. The measurement setup and beam delivery were simulated by MC code. For an infinite solid water phantom, the gamma passing rate between the measurement and TPS was 97.7%, and that between the measurement and MC was 96.5%. However, gamma passing rates between the measurement and TPS were 49.4% for the lung and 67.8% for bone, and between the measurement and MC were 85.6% for the lung and 100.0% for bone tissue. For adipose, breast, brain, liver, and bone mineral, the gamma passing rates computed by TPS were 91.7%, 90.6%, 81.7%, 85.6%, and 85.6%, respectively. The gamma passing rates for MC for adipose, breast, brain, liver, and bone mineral were 100.0%, 97.2%, 95.0%, 98.9%, and 97.8%, respectively. In conclusion, the described procedure successfully evaluated the allowable range uncertainty for TPS commissioning. The TPS dose calculation is inefficient in heterogeneous media with large differences in density, such as lung or bone tissue. Therefore, the limitations of TPS in heterogeneous media should be understood and applied in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2791769475,"This study aimed at establishing baseline key epidemiological parameters for varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in Vojvodina, Serbia, with the ultimate goal to quantify the VZV transmission potential in the population. Seroprevalence data generated during the first large cross-sectional VZV serosurvey were modelled, using a two-tiered modelling approach to calculate age-specific forces of infection (FOI), the basic reproduction number (R0) and herd immunity threshold (H). Seroprevalence and modelling data were compared with corresponding pre-vaccination epidemiological parameters from 11 countries participating in the European Sero-Epidemiology Network 2 (ESEN2) project. Serbia fits into the general dynamic VZV transmission patterns in Europe in the pre-vaccine era, with estimated R0 = 4.12, (95% CI: 2.69-7.07) and H = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63-0.86). The highest VZV transmission occurs among preschool children, as evidenced by the estimation of the highest FOI (0.22, 95% CI: 0.11-0.34) in the 0.5-4 age group, with a peak FOI of 0.25 at 2.23 years. Seroprevalence was consistently lower in 5-14 year-olds, resulting in considerable shares of VZV-susceptible adolescents (7.3%), and young adults (6%), resembling the situation in a minority of European countries. The obtained key epidemiological parameters showed most intense VZV transmission in preschool children aged <4 years, justifying the consideration of universal childhood immunization in the future. National immunization strategy should consider programs for VZV serologic screening and immunization of susceptible groups, including adolescents and women of reproductive age. This work is an important milestone towards the evaluation of varicella immunization policy options in Serbia."
https://openalex.org/W2790559358,"In order to test the feasibility of computer simulation in field maize planting, the selection of the method of single seed precise sowing in maize is studied based on the quadratic function model Y = A×(D-Dm)2+Ym, which depicts the relationship between maize yield and planting density. And the advantages and disadvantages of the two planting methods under the condition of single seed sowing are also compared: Method 1 is optimum density planting, while Method 2 is the ideal seedling emergence number planting. It is found that the yield reduction rate and yield fluctuation of Method 2 are all lower than those of Method 1. The yield of Method 2 increased by at least 0.043 t/hm2, and showed more advantages over Method 1 with higher yield level. Further study made on the influence of seedling emergence rate on the yield of maize finds that the yields of the two methods are both highly positively correlated with the seedling emergence rate and the standard deviations of their yields are both highly negatively correlated with the seedling emergence rate. For the study of the break-up problem of sparse caused by the method of single seed precise sowing, the definition of seedling missing spots is put forward. The study found that the relationship between number of hundred-dot spot and field seedling emergence rate is as the parabola function y = -189.32x2 + 309.55x - 118.95 and the relationship between number of spot missing seedling and field seedling emergence rate is as the negative exponent function y = 395.69e-6.144x. The results may help to guide the maize seeds production and single seed precise sowing to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W2793049440,"This paper deals with the skills related to the early reading acquisition in two countries that share language. Traditionally on reading readiness research there is a great interest to find out what factors affect early reading ability, but differ from other academic skills that affect general school learnings. Furthermore, it is also known how the influence of pre-reading variables in two countries with the same language, affect the development of the reading. On the other hand, several studies have examined what skills are related to reading readiness (phonological awareness, alphabetic awareness, naming speed, linguistic skills, metalinguistic knowledge and basic cognitive processes), but there are no studies showing whether countries can also influence the development of these skills.Our main objective in this study was to establish whether there were differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between Spanish (119 children) and Peruvian (128 children), five years old children assessed in their own countries and after controlling Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS). The results show that there are significant differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between these two samples. It's especially relevant, in these results, that the main predictor in a regression study was the country of origin, explaining a higher percentage of variance than other variables such as age differences, in months, or gender. These findings corroborate the results obtained in other studies with migrant population."
https://openalex.org/W2793736495,"Organotypic brain slice cultures have been recently used to study neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease (HD). They preserve brain three-dimensional architecture, synaptic connectivity and brain cells microenvironment. Here, we developed an innovative model of Huntington’s disease from coronal rat brain slices, that include all the areas involved in the pathology. HD-like neurodegeneration was obtained in only one week, in a single step, during organotypic slice preparation, without the use of neurotoxins. HD-like histopathology was analysed and after one week, a reduction of 40% of medium spiny neurons was observed. To analyse new therapeutic approaches in this innovative HD model, we developed a novel protocol of laser microdissection to isolate and analyse by RT-qPCR, grafted cells as well as surrounding tissue of fresh organotypic slices. We determined that laser microdissection could be performed on a 400μm organotypic slice after alcohol dehydration protocol, allowing the analysis of mRNA expression in the rat tissue as well as in grafted cells. In conclusion, we developed a new approach for modeling Huntington's disease ex vivo, and provided a useful innovative method for screening new potential therapies for neurodegenerative diseases especially when associated with laser microdissection."
