https://openalex.org/W4220753771,"The portal venous circulation provides a conduit for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor cells to the liver parenchyma sinusoids, a frequent site of metastasis. Turbulent flow in the portal circulation promotes retention of PDAC shed circulating tumor cells (CTC) and myeloid-derived immunosuppressor cells (MDSC). Excessive colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling can induce myeloid differentiation to MDSC and transformation of MDSC to myeloid-derived fibroblasts (M-FB). Interactions between PDAC CTC and M-FB in the portal blood promotes the formation of immunoresistant clusters that enhance CTC proliferation, migration, and survival. Analysis of portal and peripheral blood samples collected intraoperatively from 30 PDAC patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy showed that PDAC patient plasma contained high levels of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF1), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF/CSF2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-34 (IL-34) compared to healthy control levels. Moreover, the level of M-CSF in portal blood was significantly higher than that detected in the peripheral blood of PDAC patients. PDAC CTC aseptically isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) out of freshly collected patient portal blood mononuclear cells (PortalBMC) had elevated RNA expression of IL34 (IL-34 gene) and CSF1 (M-CSF/CSF1 gene) which both signal through CSF1R. PDAC CTC also had high levels of RNA expression for CXCL8 , the gene encoding chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) which can attract myeloid cells through their CXCR2 receptors. FACS-isolated portal PDAC CTC and M-FB co-cultured ex vivo had increased CTC proliferation, motility, and cluster formation compared to CTC cultured alone. CSF1R and CXCR2 cell surface expression were found on PDAC portal blood CTC and M-FB, suggesting that both cell types may respond to M-CSF, IL-34, and IL-8-mediated signaling. Portal PDAC CTC displayed enhanced RNA expression of CSF1 and IL34 , while CTC+M-FB+ clusters formed in vivo had increased RNA expression of CSF2 and IL34 . Portal M-FB were found to have high CSF1R RNA expression. CTC isolated from e x vivo 7-day cultures of PDAC patient portal blood mononuclear cells (PortalBMC) expressed elevated CSF1 , IL34 , and IL8 RNA, and CSF1 expression was elevated in M-FB. Treatment with rabbit anti-CSF1R antibodies decreased CTC proliferation. Treatment of PortalBMC cultures with humanized anti-CSF1R, humanized anti-IL-8, or anti-IL-34 antibodies disrupted CTC cluster formation and increased CTC apoptosis. U937 myeloid precursor cell line cultures treated with conditioned media from PortalBMC ex vivo cultures without treatment or treated with anti-IL-8 and/or anti-CSF1R did not prevent myeloid differentiation in the myeloid precursor cell line U937 to macrophage, dendritic cell, MDSC, and M-FB phenotypes; whereas, U937 cultures treated with conditioned media from PortalBMC ex vivo cultures exposed to anti-IL-34 were significantly inhibited in their myeloid differentiation to all but the M-FB phenotype. PDAC patient T cells that were found phenotypically anergic (CD3+CD25+CTLA4+PD1L1+) in PortalBMC could be re-activated (CD3+CD25+CTLA4-PD1L1-), and displayed increased interferon gamma (IFNγ) production when PortalBMC ex vivo cultures were treated with anti-CSF1R, anti-IL-8, and anti-IL-34 antibodies alone or in combination. These findings suggest that PDAC CTC have the potential to influence myeloid differentiation and/or antigen presenting cell activation in the PDAC portal blood microenvironment, and that disruption of CTC/M-FB interactions may be potential targets for reversing the immunosuppression supporting CTC survival in the portal blood."
https://openalex.org/W4220713458,"Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides, formerly evolved by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), that fold into functional three-dimensional structures. Such conformation is crucial for aptamers' ability to bind to a target with high affinity and specificity. Unnatural nucleotides have been used to develop nucleic acid mimic (NAM) aptamers with increased performance, such as biological stability. Prior knowledge of aptamer-target interactions is critical for applying post-SELEX modifications with unnatural nucleotides since it can affect aptamers' structure and performance. Here, we describe an easy-to-apply in silico workflow using free available software / web servers to predict the tertiary conformation of NAM, DNA and RNA aptamers, as well as the docking with the target molecule. Representative 2'-O-methyl (2'OMe), locked nucleic acid (LNA), DNA and RNA aptamers, with experimental data deposited in Protein Data Bank, were selected to validate the workflow. All aptamers' tertiary structure and docking models were successfully predicted with good structural similarity to the experimental data. Thus, this workflow will boost the development of aptamers, particularly NAM aptamers, by assisting in the rational modification of specific nucleotides and avoiding trial-and-error approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4220654952,"Mental, neurological and substance use conditions lead to tremendous suffering, yet globally access to effective care is limited. In line with the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 13), in 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health: Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to advance mental health policies, advocacy, and human rights and to scale up access to quality and affordable care for people living with mental health conditions. Six countries were selected as 'early-adopter' countries for the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health in the initial phase. Our objective was to rapidly and comprehensively assess the strength of mental health systems in each country with the goal of informing national priority-setting at the outset of the Initiative.We used a modified version of the Program for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME) situational analysis tool. We used a participatory process to document national demographic and population health characteristics; environmental, sociopolitical, and health-related threats; the status of mental health policies and plans; the prevalence of mental disorders and treatment coverage; and the availability of resources for mental health.Each country had distinct needs, though several common themes emerged. Most were dealing with crises with serious implications for population mental health. None had sufficient mental health services to meet their needs. All aimed to decentralize and deinstitutionalize mental health services, to integrate mental health care into primary health care, and to devote more financial and human resources to mental health systems. All cited insufficient and inequitably distributed specialist human resources for mental health as a major impediment.This rapid assessment facilitated priority-setting for mental health system strengthening by national stakeholders. Next steps include convening design workshops in each country and initiating monitoring and evaluation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4220799564,"Wheat is a staple crop that is critical for feeding a hungry and growing planet, but its nutritive value has declined as global temperatures have warmed. The price offered to producers depends not only on yield but also grain protein content (GPC), which are often negatively related at the field scale but can positively covary depending in part on management strategies, emphasizing the need to understand their variability within individual fields. We measured yield and GPC in a winter wheat field in Sun River, Montana, USA, and tested the ability of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) on spatial scales of ~10 cm and from Landsat on spatial scales of 30 m to predict them. Landsat observations were poorly related to yield and GPC measurements. A multiple linear model using information from four (three) UAV flyovers was selected as the most parsimonious and predicted 26% (40%) of the variability in wheat yield (GPC). We sought to understand the optimal spatial scale for interpreting UAV observations given that the ~ 10 cm pixels yielded more than 12 million measurements at far finer resolution than the 12 m scale of the harvester. The variance in NDVI observations was ""averaged out"" at larger pixel sizes but only ~ 20% of the total variance was averaged out at the spatial scale of the harvester on some measurement dates. Spatial averaging to the scale of the harvester also made little difference in the total information content of NDVI fit using Beta distributions as quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Radially-averaged power spectra of UAV-measured NDVI revealed relatively steep power-law relationships with exponentially less variance at finer spatial scales. Results suggest that larger pixels can reasonably capture the information content of within-field NDVI, but the 30 m Landsat scale is too coarse to describe some of the key features of the field, which are consistent with topography, historic management practices, and edaphic variability. Future research should seek to determine an 'optimum' spatial scale for NDVI observations that minimizes effort (and therefore cost) while maintaining the ability of producers to make management decisions that positively impact wheat yield and GPC."

https://openalex.org/W4220947827,"Background On 14 April 2016, British Columbia’s Provincial Medical Health Officer declared the overdose crisis a public health emergency, sanctioning the implementation of new overdose prevention sites (OPS) and supervised consumption sites (SCS) across the province. Methods We used the BC Centre for Disease Control’s Provincial Overdose Cohort of all overdose events between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017 to evaluate the population-level effects of OPSs and SCSs on acute health service use and mortality. We matched local health areas (LHA) that implemented any site with propensity score matched controls and conducted controlled interrupted time series analysis. Results During the study period, twenty-five OPSs and SCSs opened across fourteen of British Columbia’s 89 LHAs. Results from analysis of LHAs with matched controls (i.e. excluding Vancouver DTES) were mixed. Significant declines in reported overdose events, paramedic attendance, and emergency department visits were observed. However, there were no changes to trends in monthly hospitalization or mortality rates. Extensive sensitivity analyses found these results persisted. Conclusions We found OPSs and SCSs reduce opioid-related paramedic attendance and emergency department visit rates but no evidence that they reduce local hospitalization or mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W4220710429,"Grasping and mouth movements have been proposed to be integrated anatomically, functionally and evolutionarily. In line with this, we have shown that there is a systematic interaction between particular speech units and grip performance. For example, when the task requires pronouncing a speech unit simultaneously with grasp response, the speech units [i] and [t] are associated with relatively rapid and accurate precision grip responses, while [ɑ] and [k] are associated with power grip responses. This study is aimed at complementing the picture about which vowels and consonants are associated with these grasp types. The study validated our view that the high-front vowels and the alveolar consonants are associated with precision grip responses, while low and high-back vowels as well as velar consonants or those whose articulation involves the lowering of the tongue body are associated with power grip responses. This paper also proposes that one reason why small/large concepts are associated with specific speech sounds in the sound-magnitude symbolism is because articulation of these sounds is programmed within the overlapping mechanisms of precision or power grasping."
https://openalex.org/W4220811759,"Memories of the past help us adaptively respond to similar situations in the future. Originally described by Schacter & Addis in 2007, the ""constructive episodic simulation"" hypothesis proposes that waking thought combines fragments of various past episodes into imagined simulations of events that may occur in the future. This same framework may be useful for understanding the function of dreaming. N = 48 college students were asked to identify waking life sources for a total of N = 469 dreams. Participants frequently traced dreams to at least one past or future episodic source (53.5% and 25.7% of dreams, respectively). Individual dreams were very often traced to multiple waking sources (43.9% of all dreams with content), with fragments of past memory incorporated into scenarios that anticipated future events. Waking-life dream sources are described in terms of their phenomenology and distribution across time and sleep stage, providing new evidence that dreams not only reflect the past, but also utilize memory in simulating potential futures."
https://openalex.org/W4220837474,"Impairment of social functioning skills is a key hallmark of autism. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is a blood-based biomarker of social functioning, and a candidate for individualized treatment of ASD. The effects of OXT on the social brain are mediated by the OXT receptor (OXTR). This study assessed the clinical utility of blood OXT serum levels and the OXT receptor (OXTR) genotype as biomarkers of autism and its severity in a pediatric population in Iraq.Blood samples were collected from patients with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 60) and corresponding age and gender matched healthy controls (n = 60). All clinical samples were processed at the Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kufa in Iraq. Blood serum was assayed for OXT by sandwich ELISA. Receiver operator analysis (ROC) determined area under the curve (AUC), cutoff values, and sensitivity and specificity of OXT values for accuracy of diagnosis of ASD. Isolated genomic DNA was genotyped for the OXTR gene rs2268491(C/T) SNP using allele-specific PCR. The significance of genotype (CC, CT, and TT) and allele (C and T) distributions in different patient groups was assessed using odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the Chi-square test. All statistical analysis was performed used SPSS software.Study characteristics in the ASD population revealed a high level of consanguinity (36.66%), and ASD recurrence rate (11.66%) and family history (28.33%). OXT levels in patients with ASD (157.58±28.81 pg/ml) were significantly higher (p = 0.003) compared to controls (75.03±6.38 pg/ml). Within stratified ASD severity groups-OXT levels were significantly different (P = 0.032). ROC analysis determined similar AUC values for overall ASD (0.807), and stratified mild (0.793), moderate (0.889), and severe categories (0.795). The best cutoff for diagnosis of ASD was 83.8 pg/ml OXT with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 72.1% respectively. OXTR gene rs2268491(C/T) genotyping found that ASD patients have significantly lower (p = 0.021) genotype CC frequency and a significantly higher (p = 0.04) occurrence of the heterozygous CT genotype relative to controls. ASD subjects produced highest OXT levels with the TT genotype. T allele distribution was higher in ASD males. ASD males had significantly lower distribution of the CC genotype (48.89%) compared to females (80%) (Chi-square test: χ2 = 4.43, df = 1, p = 0.035). Whereas distribution of the CT genotype was significantly higher in autistic males (44.45%) compared to females (13.33%) (Chi-square test: χ2 = 4.68, df = 1, p = 0.03).Peripheral OXT levels and OXTR genetic alterations are potential biomarkers of social functioning in the ASD patient setting. The stratification of patients with ASD into severity categories shows significant differences both in OXT levels and OXTR (rs2268491, C/T) genotype and allele distributions, that can be sex dependent. OXT based therapies will require personalized medicine tactics to correctly identify patients with ASD who require neuropeptide boosting in social settings."
https://openalex.org/W4220911925,"Many factors can negatively impact perinatal outcomes, including inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG). Despite having the greatest potential to influence maternal and infant health, there is a lack of consensus regarding the GWG consistent with a healthy pregnancy. To date, GWG in Northern Tasmania remains understudied. We investigated how maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is related to weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention post-partum, and how maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is related to the mode of delivery. Approximately 300 Tasmanian mothers (n = 291 for mode of delivery and n = 282 for GWG) were included in this study. Analysis of variance and chi square tests were conducted to assess differences in BW of mothers across BMI categories and differences between categorical variables; respectively. Based on pre-pregnancy BMI, mothers were assigned to one of three groups, with healthy weight (<25 kg m-2), with overweight (25-29.9 kg m-2), or with obesity (>30 kg m-2). Pre-pregnancy BMI and body weight (BW) were significantly associated (p<0.001) with post-partum BW at 3 and 6 months. Only 25% of mothers with a normal weight BMI, 34% with overweight and 13% with obesity, achieved the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendation for GWG. Interestingly, a number of women in our cohort lost weight during gestation (1.5, 9 and 37% in <25, 25-29.9 and >30 kg m-2 groups, respectively). Further, women with obesity showed the lowest level of BW fluctuation and retained less weight post-partum. The highest number of caesarean sections were observed in mothers who exceeded GWG recommendations. Most mothers either exceeded or failed to achieve IOM recommendations for GWG. To improve the generalisability of these findings, this study should be replicated in a larger representative sample of the Tasmanian maternal population."
https://openalex.org/W4221098929,"Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended by the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) for infants, elderly 60+ years and patients at risk. In 2016, a sequential pneumococcal vaccination schedule (conjugate vaccine followed by polysaccharide vaccine 6-12 months later) supplemented this recommendation for immunocompromised patients ≥2 years of age. Previous research showed low pneumococcal vaccination rates (pnc-VR) in this vulnerable group. Moreover, no evidence is available on adherence to the newer sequential schedule. This study aimed to analyze the development of pnc-VRs in immunocompromised patients and rates of sequential vaccinations according to the STIKO recommendations.Using a representative health claims database, we assigned incident immunocompromised patients ≥2 years of age to one of two successive cohorts to observe trends over time: cohort A (first diagnosis of immunocompromised condition between 01/2013 and 12/2014), and cohort B (first diagnosis between 01/ 2015 and 12/2017). Pnc-VR within two years after first diagnosis and cumulative pnc-VR was compared among both cohorts. In cohort B, we assessed sequential pnc-VR within 15 months of the first vaccination. For additional analyses, patients were stratified by age, gender and immunocompromising condition.Cohort A and B comprised 193,521 and 289,279 patients, respectively. Overall pnc-VR increased over time from 4.3% (cohort A; 95%-confidence interval: 4.3%-4.4%) to 6.0% (cohort B; 5.9%-6.1%), with highest pnc-VRs in men ≥60 years (11.3%: 11.1%-11.6%) and HIV patients (15.2%: 13.1%-17.4%). Cumulative pnc-VRs in cohort B were higher in any quarter following diagnosis when compared with cohort A. Overall sequential pnc-VR in cohort B was 4.0% (3.7%-4.3%), with a higher rate observed in patients aged 16-59 (6.8%: 6.0%-7.7%) vs. patients aged ≥60 years (3.1%: 2.8%-3.4%).While some improvements were seen over time, pnc-VRs remain very low in immunocompromised patients, as did sequential vaccination rates. Current recommendations to protect immunocompromised patients from pneumococcal infections are not being sufficiently implemented."
https://openalex.org/W4220766572,"Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1, also known as Rev-erbα) is a nuclear transcription factor that is part of the molecular clock encoding circadian rhythms and may link daily rhythms with metabolism and inflammation. NR1D1, unlike most nuclear receptors, lacks a ligand-dependent activation function domain 2 and is a constitutive transcriptional repressor. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease, caused by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex. Approximately 10%–20% of familial ALS is caused by a toxic gain-of-function induced by mutations of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Dysregulated clock and clock-controlled gene expression occur in multiple tissues from mutant hSOD1-linked ALS mouse models. Here we explore NR1D1 dysregulation in the spinal cord of ALS mouse models and its consequences on astrocyte–motor neuron interaction. NR1D1 protein and mRNA expression are significantly downregulated in the spinal cord of symptomatic mice expressing mutant hSOD1, while no changes were observed in age-matched animals overexpressing wild-type hSOD1. In addition, NR1D1 downregulation in primary astrocyte cultures induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype and decreases the survival of cocultured motor neurons. NR1D1 orchestrates the cross talk between physiological pathways identified to be disrupted in ALS (e.g., metabolism, inflammation, redox homeostasis, and circadian rhythms) and we observed that downregulation of NR1D1 alters astrocyte–motor neuron interaction. Our results suggest that NR1D1 could be a potential therapeutic target to prevent astrocyte-mediated motor neuron toxicity in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W4220832554,"Dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the midbrain plays a pivotal role in motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. However, non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and post-mortem histopathology confirm dysfunction in other brain areas, including the locus coeruleus and its associated neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Here, we investigate the role of central norepinephrine-producing neurons in Parkinson's disease by chronically stimulating catecholaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus using chemogenetic manipulation. We show that norepinephrine neurons send complex axonal projections to the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, confirming physical communication between these regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased activity of norepinephrine neurons is protective against dopaminergic neuronal depletion in human α-syn A53T missense mutation over-expressing mice and prevents motor dysfunction in these mice. Remarkably, elevated norepinephrine neurons action fails to alleviate α-synuclein aggregation and microgliosis in the substantia nigra suggesting the presence of an alternate neuroprotective mechanism. The beneficial effects of high norepinephrine neuron activity might be attributed to the action of norepinephrine on dopaminergic neurons, as recombinant norepinephrine treatment increased primary dopaminergic neuron cultures survival and neurite sprouting. Collectively, our results suggest a neuroprotective mechanism where noradrenergic neurons activity preserves the integrity of dopaminergic neurons, which prevents synucleinopathy-dependent loss of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W4220874034,"Mast cells are tissue-resident immune cells that have numerous cytoplasmic granules which contain preformed pro-inflammatory mediators. Upon antigen stimulation, sensitized mast cells undergo profound changes to their morphology and rapidly release granule mediators by regulated exocytosis, also known as degranulation. We have previously shown that Rho GTPases regulate exocytosis, which suggests that cytoskeleton remodeling is involved in granule transport. Here, we used live-cell imaging to analyze cytoskeleton remodeling and granule transport in real-time as mast cells were antigen stimulated. We found that granule transport to the cell periphery was coordinated by de novo microtubule formation and not F-actin. Kinesore, a drug that activates the microtubule motor kinesin-1 in the absence of cargo, inhibited microtubule-granule association and significantly reduced exocytosis. Likewise, shRNA knock-down of Kif5b, the kinesin-1 heavy chain, also reduced exocytosis. Imaging showed granules accumulated in the perinuclear region after kinesore treatment or Kif5b knock-down. Complete microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole or colchicine resulted in the same effect. A biochemically enriched granule fraction showed kinesin-1 levels increase in antigen-stimulated cells, but are reduced by pre-treatment with kinesore. Kinesore had no effect on the levels of Slp3, a mast cell granule cargo adaptor, in the granule-enriched fraction which suggests that cargo adaptor recruitment to granules is independent of motor association. Taken together, these results show that granules associate with microtubules and are driven by kinesin-1 to facilitate exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220949744,"Psoriasis is a chronic disease with high impact on patients' health and their quality of life. Psoriasis often occurs along with other comorbidities, but it is not yet clear what role the comorbidities play in regional psoriasis prevalence. This study investigates the temporal and regional variation of the psoriasis comorbidities diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, hypertension, affective disorders in Germany and their association with psoriasis prevalence. This analysis based on the population set of ambulatory claims data (2010-2017) of the statutory health insurance (SHI) in Germany (approx. 70.3 million people in 2017). Psoriasis comorbidities rates were determined on county level. We performed descriptive spatiotemporal analyses of psoriasis comorbidity prevalence rates. In addition, we identified and compared spatial clusters and examined regional variations using spatial statistical methods. The results show strong regional variations (northeast to south gradient) and an increasing psoriasis prevalence (max. 28.8%) within the observation period. Considering the comorbidities, results indicate comparable spatial prevalence patterns for diabetes mellitus type II, obesity and hypertension. This means that the highest prevalence of comorbidities tends to be found where the psoriasis prevalence is highest. The spatiotemporal cluster analyses could once again confirm the results. An exception to this is to be found in the case of affective disorders with different spatial patterns. The results of the studies show the first spatiotemporal association between psoriasis prevalence and comorbidities in Germany. The causalities must be investigated in more detail in order to be able to derive measures for improved care."

The urban development in China has entered a post-development era characterized by coexisting urban expansion and local shrinkage whilst urbanization continues to progress in this country. This paper investigates the urban shrinkage of 80 cities in the Yellow River, China from the perspective of population and economy, based on urban shrinkage models drawing from western countries. It also analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution and influencing factors of urban shrinkage in this area using a spatial panel data model. The results show the following. (1) The phenomenon of urban shrinkage in the Yellow River Basin has gradually occurred and the degree of shrinkage has aggravated. (2) The shrinking cities in the Yellow River Basin are mainly population-related and potential. (3) The phenomenon of urban shrinkage in the Yellow River Basin shows significant spatiotemporal differences. Shrinking cities are mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin and the number of shrinking cities has gradually increased over time. (4) In terms of influencing factors, financial, traffic, and medical conditions have a greater impact on population-related and economy-related shrinkage in these cities."
https://openalex.org/W4221038421,"Background Predictive models could help clinicians identify risk factors that cause adverse events after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), allowing for appropriate preoperative preventive interventions and allocation of resources. Methods The National Inpatient Sample datasets from 2010–2014 were used to build Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Method (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predictive models for three clinically relevant outcomes after TKA—disposition at discharge, any post-surgical complications, and blood transfusion. Model performance was evaluated using the Brier scores as calibration measures, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) and F1 scores as discrimination measures. Results GBM-based predictive models were observed to have better calibration and discrimination than the other models; thus, indicating comparatively better overall performance. The Brier scores for GBM models predicting the outcomes under investigation ranged from 0.09–0.14, AUCs ranged from 79–87%, and F1-scores ranged from 41–73%. Variable importance analysis for GBM models revealed that admission month, patient location, and patient’s income level were significant predictors for all the outcomes. Additionally, any post-surgical complications and blood transfusions were significantly predicted by deficiency anemias, and discharge disposition by length of stay and age groups. Notably, any post-surgical complications were also significantly predicted by the patient undergoing blood transfusion. Conclusions The predictive abilities of the ML models were successfully demonstrated using data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), indicating a wide range of clinical applications for obtaining accurate prognoses of complications following orthopedic surgical procedures."

The present study aimed to assess the IV uptake and acceptability and to describe related knowledge and attitudes among pregnant women in Tunisia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 84 Tunisian healthcare facilities over a period of three months (from March to May 2019). All pregnant women aged ≥18 years who sought antenatal care in related health structures were included in this study based on a multistage self-weighted sampling. We measured knowledge and attitudes towards the IV and assessed factors related to willingness for its uptake. Results The questionnaire was completed by 1157 pregnant women. More than half of the participants (60.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] [57.3%–63.0%]) reported awareness about the IV. Among included PW, only 4.6%; 95% CI [3.5%–6.1%] received it during their current pregnancy. However, (36.8%; 95% CI [34.0%–39.6%]) declared their willingness to receive the vaccine in the next pregnancy. Recommendation by healthcare providers, identified to be the most trustful source of information, was the main reason for acceptance. However, the intention to accept the IV by pregnant women was significantly associated with such recommendation and perceived safety and effectiveness of this vaccine. Conclusion Antenatal care visits are a precious opportunity that should not be missed by health care providers and especially gynecologists to promote the IV uptake by pregnant women in Tunisia."
https://openalex.org/W4221117282,"Despite the great progress made over the last decades, stronger structural interventions are needed to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). Brazil is one of the largest and data-richest LMIC, with rapidly changing socioeconomic characteristics and an important HIV/AIDS burden. Over the last two decades Brazil has also implemented the world's largest Conditional Cash Transfer programs, the Bolsa Familia Program (BFP), and one of the most consolidated Primary Health Care (PHC) interventions, the Family Health Strategy (FHS).We will evaluate the effects of socioeconomic determinants, BFP exposure and FHS coverage on HIV/AIDS incidence, treatment adherence, hospitalizations, case fatality, and mortality using unprecedently large aggregate and individual-level longitudinal data. Moreover, we will integrate the retrospective datasets and estimated parameters with comprehensive forecasting models to project HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence and mortality scenarios up to 2030 according to future socioeconomic conditions and alternative policy implementations.We will combine individual-level data from all national HIV/AIDS registries with large-scale databases, including the ""100 Million Brazilian Cohort"", over a 19-year period (2000-2018). Several approaches will be used for the retrospective quasi-experimental impact evaluations, such as Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), Random Administrative Delays (RAD) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), combined with multivariable Poisson regressions for cohort analyses. Moreover, we will explore in depth lagged and long-term effects of changes in living conditions and in exposures to BFP and FHS. We will also investigate the effects of the interventions in a wide range of subpopulations. Finally, we will integrate such retrospective analyses with microsimulation, compartmental and agent-based models to forecast future HIV/AIDS scenarios.The unprecedented datasets, analyzed through state-of-the-art quasi-experimental methods and innovative mathematical models will provide essential evidences to the understanding and control of HIV/AIDS epidemic in LMICs such as Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W4220740394,"The zebrafish is an excellent model system to study thrombocyte function and development. Due to the difficulties in separating young and mature thrombocytes, comparative transcriptomics between these two cell types has not been performed. It is important to study these differences in order to understand the mechanism of thrombocyte maturation. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the young and mature zebrafish thrombocytes and compared the two datasets for young and mature thrombocyte transcripts. We found a total of 9143 genes expressed cumulatively in both young and mature thrombocytes, and among these, 72% of zebrafish thrombocyte-expressed genes have human orthologs according to the Ensembl human genome annotation. We also found 397 uniquely expressed genes in young and 2153 uniquely expressed genes in mature thrombocytes. Of these 397 and 2153 genes, 272 and 1620 corresponded to human orthologous genes, respectively. Of all genes expressed in both young and mature thrombocytes, 4224 have been reported to be expressed in human megakaryocytes, and 1603 were found in platelets. Among these orthologs, 156 transcription factor transcripts in thrombocytes were found in megakaryocytes and 60 transcription factor transcripts were found in platelets including a few already known factors such as Nfe2 and Nfe212a (related to Nfe2) that are present in both megakaryocytes, and platelets. These results indicate that thrombocytes have more megakaryocyte features and since platelets are megakaryocyte fragments, platelets also appear to be thrombocyte equivalents. In conclusion, our study delineates the differential gene expression patterns of young and mature thrombocytes, highlighting the processes regulating thrombocyte maturation. Future knockdown studies of these young and mature thrombocyte-specific genes are feasible and will provide the basis for understanding megakaryocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W4220761943,"Decision support systems are appropriate tools for guiding policymaking processes, especially in mental health (MH), where care provision should be delivered in a balanced and integrated way. This study aims to develop an analytical process for (i) assessing the performance of an MH ecosystem and (ii) identifying benchmark and target-for-improvement catchment areas. MH provision (inpatient, day and outpatient types of care) was analysed in the Mental Health Network of Gipuzkoa (Osakidetza, Basque Country, Spain) using a decision support system that integrated data envelopment analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and artificial intelligence. The unit of analysis was the 13 catchment areas defined by a reference MH centre. MH ecosystem performance was assessed by the following indicators: relative technical efficiency, stability and entropy to guide organizational interventions. Globally, the MH system of Gipuzkoa showed high efficiency scores in each main type of care (inpatient, day and outpatient), but it can be considered unstable (small changes can have relevant impacts on MH provision and performance). Both benchmark and target-for-improvement areas were identified and described. This article provides a guide for evidence-informed decision-making and policy design to improve the continuity of MH care after inpatient discharges. The findings show that it is crucial to design interventions and strategies (i) considering the characteristics of the area to be improved and (ii) assessing the potential impact on the performance of the global MH care ecosystem. For performance improvement, it is recommended to reduce admissions and readmissions for inpatient care, increase workforce capacity and utilization of day care services and increase the availability of outpatient care services."

They remain the second most common healthcare-associated infection in critically sick patients.To determine the prevalence of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, the spectrum of etiological agents, antibiotic sensitivity profile of bacterial pathogens among adult patients admitted to intensive care units.Patients admitted to the intensive care unit of hospitals in Addis Ababa who were on urethral indwelling catheters for >48 hours from October 2020 to September 2021 were included in the study. Urine specimens were aseptically collected and processed as per standard protocols. Microorganisms were isolated, identified, and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing.In all 220 pateints included in the study development of significant bacteriuria/candiduria was not affected by sex, age, and prior antibiotic therapy. However, the length of stay in the intensive care unit was significantly associated with bacteriuria /candiduria (P-value < 0.001). The overall prevalence of bacteriuria/candiduria was 51.4% among which 21.0%, 19.1%, and 11.4% were bacteriuria, candiduria, and polymicrobial infections, respectively. About 138 organisms were recovered of which 79 (57.25%) were bacteria and 59 (42.75%) were yeast isolates. Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas species, Klebsiella species E. coli, and Enterococcus species were the dominant bacterial isolates. Candida. albicans, Candida. krusei and Candida. tropicalis were the commonest yeasts. Many gram-negative bacterial isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone 36(94.7%), ampicillin 21(91.3%) followed by cefotaxime34(89.5%), amikacin (16.0%), nitrofurantoin (17.4%), meropenem (20.0%) and imipenem (20.0%). Out of 79 bacterial pathogens, 52(65.8%) were multiple antibiotic resistant of which 37(71.0%) were Gram-negative bacteria and 15(29%%) were Gram-positive bacteria. About 13(86.7%) isolates of Acinetobacter, all isolates of Klebsiella species (100%) and E. coli (100%) were multiple antibiotic-resistant. Out Of 18,10(55.56%), isolates of Enterococcus were multiple antibiotic-resistant.A very high prevalence of bacteriuria/ candiduria was demonstrated in this study. This warrants the establishment of multidimensional infection control approach on catheter associated urinary tract infection in ICU. In addition to high prevalence of candiduria, recovery of non-albicans candida species almost in equal proportion with candida albicans in the present study was an important finding as non-albicans candida species distinct to C. albicans are intrinsically resistant to the commonly used azole antifungal drugs in Ethiopia. The prevalence of rate MDR bacteria in our ICU particularly of E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas and Acetobacter spp was very high. In order to combat this problem, proper antibiotic policies should be formulated."
https://openalex.org/W4221049673,"An understanding of the relationship between the cultivated apple ( Malus domestica ) and its primary wild progenitor species ( M . sieversii ) not only provides an understanding of how apples have been improved in the past, but may be useful for apple improvement in the future. We measured 10 phenotypes in over 1000 unique apple accessions belonging to M . domestica and M . sieversii from Canada’s Apple Biodiversity Collection. Using principal components analysis (PCA), we determined that M . domestica and M . sieversii differ significantly in phenotypic space and are nearly completely distinguishable as two separate groups. We found that M . domestica had a shorter juvenile phase than M . sieversii and that cultivated trees produced flowers and ripe fruit later than their wild progenitors. Cultivated apples were also 3.6 times heavier, 43% less acidic, and had 68% less phenolic content than wild apples. Using historical records, we found that apple breeding over the past 200 years has resulted in a trend towards apples that have higher soluble solids, are less bitter, and soften less during storage. Our results quantify the significant changes in phenotype that have taken place since apple domestication, and provide evidence that apple breeding has led to continued phenotypic divergence of the cultivated apple from its wild progenitor species."
https://openalex.org/W4221049874,"Anopheles stephensi is an important vector of malaria in the South Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Africa. The olfactory system of An. stephensi plays an important role in host-seeking, oviposition, and feeding. Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are globular proteins that play a pivotal role in insect olfaction by transporting semiochemicals through the sensillum lymph to odorant receptors (ORs). Custom motifs designed from annotated OBPs of Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae were used for the identification of putative OBPs from protein sequences of the An. stephensi Indian strain. Further, BLASTp was also performed to identify missing OBPs and ORs. Subsequently, the presence of domains common to OBPs was confirmed. Identified OBPs were further classified into three sub-classes. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses were carried out to find homology, and thus the evolutionary relationship between An. stephensi OBPs and ORs with those of An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster. Gene structure and physicochemical properties of the OBPs and ORs were also predicted. A total of 44 OBPs and 45 ORs were predicted from the protein sequences of An. stephensi. OBPs were further classified into the classic (27), atypical (10) and plus-C (7) OBP subclasses. The phylogeny revealed close relationship of An. stephensi OBPs and ORs with An. gambiae homologs whereas only five OBPs and two ORs of An. stephensi were related to Ae. aegypti OBPs and ORs, respectively. However, D. melanogaster OBPs and ORs were distantly rooted. Synteny analyses showed the presence of collinear block between the OBPs and ORs of An. stephensi and An. gambiae as well as Ae. aegypti's. No homology was found with D. melanogaster OBPs and ORs. As an important component of the olfactory system, correctly identifying a species' OBPs and ORs provide a valuable resource for downstream translational research that will ultimately aim to better control the malaria vector An. stephensi."
https://openalex.org/W4221123584,"Lacewings exist in insecticide-dominant cropping systems. They are prime biological control agents due to outstanding ability of insecticide resistance development. This study examines occurrence of methoxyfenozide resistance and its subsequent effects on cross-resistance to other insecticides, inheritance and mechanism of resistance in C . carnea . Methoxy-SEL strain of C . carnea selected for 15 generations developed 3531.67-fold resistance to methoxyfenozide. Overlapping fiducial limits of LC 50 s of F 1 and F 1’ (reciprocal crosses) suggested an autosomal and incompletely dominant mode of inheritance. Resistance to methoxyfenozide was polygenic and its realized heritability value was high (h 2 = 0.62). Both PBO and DEF significantly changed LC 50 s indicating cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases and esterases detoxifying the resistance in Methoxy-SEL strain. Resistance to all tested insecticide was unstable but decrease rate was very negligible. These results have implications forpreservation of biological control and effective use in insecticide-dominant cropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W4220715795,"Profilin is a multi-ligand binding protein, which is a key regulator of actin dynamics and involved in regulating several cellular functions. It is present in all eukaryotes, including trypanosomatids such as Leishmania . However, not much is known about its functions in these organisms. Our earlier studies have shown that Leishmania parasites express a single homologue of profilin (LdPfn) that binds actin, phosphoinositides and poly- L- proline motives, and depletion of its intracellular pool to 50%of normal levels affects the cell growth and intracellular trafficking. Here, we show, employing affinity pull-down and mass spectroscopy, that LdPfn interacted with a large number of proteins, including those involved in mRNA processing and protein translation initiation, such as eIF4A1. Further, we reveal, using mRNA Seq analysis, that depletion of LdPfn in Leishmania cells (LdPfn +/- ) resulted in significantly reduced expression of genes which encode proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, mRNA translation initiation, nucleosides and amino acids transport. In addition, we show that in LdPfn +/- cells, cellular levels of eIF4A1 protein were significantly decreased, and during their cell division cycle, G1-to-S phase progression was delayed and orientation of mitotic spindle altered. These changes were, however, reversed to normal by episomal expression of GFP-LdPfn in LdPfn +/- cells. Taken together, our results indicate that profilin is involved in regulation of G1-to-S phase progression and mitotic spindle orientation in Leishmania cell cycle, perhaps through its interaction with elF4A1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W4220717724,"Background Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) has been used to address health disparities within several contexts by actively engaging communities. Though dialogues are recognized as a medium by which community members and other actors can make their voices heard through processes that support shared-decision making, power asymmetries often impede the achievement of this objective. Traditionally such relationship asymmetries exist between communities, health workers, and other professionals resulting in the exclusion of communities from decision making in participatory practices and dialogues. This study aimed to explore the experiences in the dialogues between different groups within communities, health workers and local government officials in a CBPR project on immunization in Nigeria. We adapted the framework by Elberse et al. (2011) to structure the possible exclusion mechanisms that could exist in dialogues between the three groups and we set up inclusion strategies to diminish the inequalities as much as possible. Methods and findings This is an exploratory and descriptive case study, using qualitative methods. Data was collected through observation and semi-structured interviews (SSI) with dialogue participants. All 24 participants in the multi-stakeholder dialogues were interviewed. Inclusion strategies involved creating enabling circumstances; influencing behaviour; and influencing use of language. Verbal and circumstantial strategies were of limited value in reducing exclusion. Behavioural inclusion strategies created more awareness of the importance of inclusion; and enabled different community stakeholders to direct their influences towards achieving the collective goals of the collaboration. An important learning is that if evidence is used in the dialogues, even when exclusion of certain individuals occurs, the outcomes could still favour them. A key issue is the difference between participation and representation and the need for more efficient ways of carrying out such interactive processes to ensure that the participation of the vulnerable groups is not merely symbolic. The study makes a case for the use of ‘boundary spanners’ in this dynamic—these are ‘elite’ individuals (or community champions) who can be a voice for the minorities and who could have the opportunity to influence decision making. Conclusion CBPR can enable local governments to develop effective partnerships with health workers and communities to achieve health-related goals even in the presence of asymmetries in relationships. Inclusion strategies in dialogues can improve participation and enable shared decision making, however exclusion of vulnerable groups may still occur. Intra-community dynamics and socio-cultural contexts can drive exclusion and less privileged community members require proper representation to enable their issues to be captured effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4220833673,"Asamitocins are maytansinoids produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum ssp . auranticum ATCC 31565 ( A . pretiosum ATCC 31565), which have a structure similar to that of maytansine, therefore serving as a precursor of maytansine in the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Currently, there are more than 20 known derivatives of ansamitocins, among which ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3) exhibits the highest antitumor activity. Despite its importance, the application of AP-3 is restricted by low yield, likely due to a substrate competition mechanism underlying the synthesis pathways of AP-3 and its byproducts. Given that N-demethylansamitocin P-3, the precursor of AP-3, is regulated by asm25 and asm10 to synthesize AGP-3 and AP-3, respectively, asm25 is predicted to be an inhibitory gene for AP-3 production. In this study, we inactivated asm25 in A . pretiosum ATCC 31565 by CRISPR-Cas9-guided gene editing. asm25 depletion resulted in a more than 2-fold increase in AP-3 yield. Surprisingly, the addition of isobutanol further improved AP-3 yield in the asm25 knockout strain by more than 6 times; in contrast, only a 1.53-fold increase was found in the WT strain under the parallel condition. Thus, we uncovered an unknown function of asm25 in AP-3 yield and identified asm25 as a promising target to enhance the large-scale industrial production of AP-3."

The Centro de Innovación en Salud ANCORA UC, the Health National Fund, and the Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Sur Oriente implemented a Multimorbidity Patient-Centered Care Model as a pilot study in the public health network from 2017 to 2020. Its objective was to reorganize the single diagnosis standard care into a new one based on multimorbidity integrated care. It included incorporating new roles, services, and activities according to each patient's risk stratification. This study aims to describe the perception of the health care teams regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on four main topics: how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the MCPM implementation, how participants adapted it, lessons learned, and recommendations for sustainability. We conducted a qualitative study with 35 semi-structured interviews between October and December 2020. Data analysis was codified, triangulated, and consolidated using MAXQDA 2020. Results showed that the pandemic paused the total of the implementation practically. Positive effects were the improvement of remote health care services, the activation of self-management, and the cohesion of the teamwork. In contrast, frequent abrupt changes and reorganization forced by pandemic evolution were negative effects. This study revealed the magnitude of the pandemic in the cancelation of health services and identified the urgent need to restart chronic services incorporating patient-centered care in our system."
https://openalex.org/W4220932983,"Introduction The pathophysiology behind the association between obesity and perinatal death is not fully understood but may be in part due to higher rates of pregnancy complications at earlier gestation amongst obese women. We aimed to quantify the proportion of perinatal deaths amongst obese and overweight women mediated by gestational age at stillbirth or live birth. Methods The study included all singleton births at ≥20 weeks’ gestation in British Columbia, 2004–2017, and excluded pregnancy terminations. The proportion of the association between BMI and perinatal death mediated by gestational age at delivery (in weeks) was estimated using natural effect models, with adjustment for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding and women missing BMI were conducted. Results Of 392,820 included women, 20.6% were overweight and 12.8% obese. Women with higher BMI had a lower gestational age at delivery. Perinatal mortality was 0.5% (1834 pregnancies); and was elevated in overweight (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.37) and obese women (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.36–1.77). Mediation analysis showed that 63.1% of the association between obesity and perinatal death was mediated by gestational age at delivery (natural indirect effect AOR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.23–1.42, natural direct effect AOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.32). Similar, but smaller effects were seen when comparing overweight women vs. women with a normal BMI. Estimated effects were not affected by adjustment for additional risk factors for perinatal death or sensitivity analyses for missing data. Conclusion Obese pregnancies have a higher risk of perinatal death in part mediated by a lower gestational age at delivery."

Because of various metabolic disorders, study the metabolism of chicken cell is important. Herein, the first genome-scale metabolic model of a chicken cell named iES1300, consists of 2427 reactions, 2569 metabolites, and 1300 genes, was reconstructed manually based on KEGG, BiGG, CHEBI, UNIPROT, REACTOME, and MetaNetX databases. Interactions of metabolic genes for growth were examined for E. coli, S. cerevisiae, human, and chicken metabolic models. The results indicated robustness to genetic manipulation for iES1300 similar to the results for human. iES1300 was integrated with transcriptomics data using algorithms and Principal Component Analysis was applied to compare context-specific models of the normal, tumor, lean and fat cell lines. It was found that the normal model has notable metabolic flexibility in the utilization of various metabolic pathways, especially in metabolic pathways of the carbohydrate metabolism, compared to the others. It was also concluded that the fat and tumor models have similar growth metabolisms and the lean chicken model has a more active lipid and carbohydrate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4221071293,"To study the effect of different shapes of hole defects in coal and rocks on their mechanical behavior and macro damage law, the microscopic mechanical parameters required for particle flow code (PFC) simulation were calibrated with laboratory test data, and then the evolution process of crack and stress field in coal and rocks with circle, square, triangular and trapezoidal holes under uniaxial compression were researched. The findings indicate that: the existence of hole defects lowers the elastic modulus, peak stress, peak strain and other mechanical parameters of coal and rock, and the reduction degree is influenced by the shape of defect. Meanwhile, the existence of hole defects promotes the generation and evolution of meso-cracks in coal and rock. For coal and rock with hole defects, the crack initiation stress and expansion stress are less than those of intact coal and rocks. The crack initiation stress and expansion stress of coal and rocks with trapezoidal hole defects are the smallest, and the coal and rocks with circular hole defects are the largest. The existence of hole defects weakens the damage degree of coal and rocks to some extent. With the increase of axial strain, the evolution curve of the number of meso-cracks shows stage characteristics, which consists of the calm period before the crack initiation point, the stable growth stage between the crack initiation point and the dilatation point, and the accelerated growth stage after the dilatation point. Before the initiation of crack, the concentration zone of compressive stress is located on the left and right sides of the hole defect, and the concentration zone of tensile stress is located on the upper and lower sides of the hole defect. The concentration of tensile stress is the main reason for the initiation and propagation of cracks, while the existence of compressive stress chain among macroscopic cracks is the cause of the residual strength of coal and rocks after failure."
https://openalex.org/W4221138084,"Xylella fastidiosa is a multi-continental, lethal, plant pathogenic bacterium that is transmitted by sharpshooter leafhoppers (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae) and adult spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae). The bacterium forms biofilms in plant xylem and the functional foregut of the insect. These biofilms serve as sources of inoculum for insect acquisition and subsequent inoculation to a healthy plant. In this study, 3D fluid dynamic simulations were performed for bidirectional cibarial propulsion of xylem sap through tube-like grapevine xylem and an anatomically accurate model of the functional foregut of the blue-green sharpshooter, Graphocephala atropunctata. The analysis supports a model of how fluid dynamics influence X. fastidiosa transmission. The model supports the hypothesis that X. fastidiosa inoculation is mostly driven by detachment of bacteria from the foregut due to high-velocity flow during egestion (outward fluid flow from the stylets). Acquisition occurs by fluid dynamics during both egestion and ingestion (fluid uptake through the stylets and swallowing). These simulation results are supported by previously reported X. fastidiosa colonization patterns in the functional foregut and sharpshooter stylet probing behaviors. The model indicates that xylem vessel diameter influences drag forces imposed on xylem wall-adherent bacteria; thus, vessel diameter may be an important component of the complex transmission process. Results from this study are directly applicable to development of novel grapevine resistance traits via electropenetrographic monitoring of vector acquisition and inoculation behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4220866693,"Professional pianists tend to develop playing-related musculoskeletal disorders mostly in the forearm. These injuries are often due to overuse, suggesting the existence of a common forearm region where muscles are often excited during piano playing across subjects. Here we use a grid of electrodes to test this hypothesis, assessing where EMGs with greatest amplitude are more likely to be detected when expert pianists perform different excerpts.Tasks were separated into two groups: classical excerpts and octaves, performed by eight, healthy, professional pianists. Monopolar electromyograms (EMGs) were sampled with a grid of 96 electrodes, covering the forearm region where hand and wrist muscles reside. Regions providing consistently high EMG amplitude across subjects were assessed with a non-parametric permutation test, designed for the statistical analysis of neuroimaging experiments. Spatial consistency across trials was assessed with the Binomial test.Spatial consistency of muscle excitation was found across subjects but not across tasks, confining at most 20% of the electrodes in the grid. These local groups of electrodes providing high EMG amplitude were found at the ventral forearm region during classical excerpts and at the dorsal region during octaves, when performed both at preferred and at high, playing speeds.Our results revealed that professional pianists consistently load a specific forearm region, depending on whether performing octaves or classical excerpts. This spatial consistency may help furthering our understanding on the incidence of playing-related muscular disorders and provide an anatomical reference for the study of active muscle loading in piano players using surface EMG."
https://openalex.org/W4220938548,"The goal of the research was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of the Stress Mindset Measure (SMM; general version, SMM-G, and specific version, SMM-S).Study 1 was an online survey conducted among 1651 adults (81% women, aged 18-84 years). To assess the theoretical validity of the SMM, the following constructs were also measured: Big Five personality dimensions, positive orientation, self-control, perceived stress at work, depressiveness, assessment of one's own health, and ego-resiliency. Study 2 was a test-retest reliability measurement and took place 10 months later among 344 participants.A factor validity was examined using exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analysis. EFA revealed a two-factor structure for the SMM-G and a one-factor structure for the SMM-S. However, these models obtained unsatisfactory goodness-of-fit indices in the CFA. Among the alternative models, the four-factor hierarchical model was best fitted to the data for both the SMM-G (RMSEA = .038, CFI = .996, TLI = .985) and the SMM-S (RMSEA = .041, CFI = .996, TLI = .990). These results were supported in the test-retest sample (SMM-G: RMSEA = .066, CFI = .990, TLI = .968; SMM-S: RMSEA = .056, CFI = .994, TLI = .983). Thus, four lower-order factors were identified: General, Health and Vitality, Performance and Productivity, Learning and Growth. The reliability of the overall general and specific indices measured with Cronbach's alpha was high and repeatable in both studies (Study 1: SMM-G α = .88; SMM-S α = .91; Study 2 (SMM-G, α = .87; SMM-S, α = .91). The stability for the SMM-G was satisfactory (r = .62; p < .001), and moderate for SMM-S (r = .46, p < .001). The theoretical validity analysis showed low (< |.40|) correlations in the expected directions with the majority of the selected tools.The Polish adaptation of the SMM has very good psychometric properties. However, the unidimensional character of the original scale is not confirmed, which was also the case in other existing adaptations. The analyses in a sample several times larger than in previous studies revealed a greater complexity of the construct, identifying one higher-order factor and four lower-order factors."
https://openalex.org/W4220951339,"Three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction is an important field of computer vision for restoring the 3D geometry of a given scene. Due to the demand for large amounts of memory, prevalent methods of 3D reconstruction yield inaccurate results, because of which the highly accuracy reconstruction of a scene remains an outstanding challenge. This study proposes a cascaded depth residual inference network, called DRI-MVSNet, that uses a cross-view similarity-based feature map fusion module for residual inference. It involves three improvements. First, a combined module is used for processing channel-related and spatial information to capture the relevant contextual information and improve feature representation. It combines the channel attention mechanism and spatial pooling networks. Second, a cross-view similarity-based feature map fusion module is proposed that learns the similarity between pairs of pixel in each source and reference image at planes of different depths along the frustum of the reference camera. Third, a deep, multi-stage residual prediction module is designed to generate a high-precision depth map that uses a non-uniform depth sampling strategy to construct hypothetical depth planes. The results of extensive experiments show that DRI-MVSNet delivers competitive performance on the DTU and the Tanks & Temples datasets, and the accuracy and completeness of the point cloud reconstructed by it are significantly superior to those of state-of-the-art benchmarks."
https://openalex.org/W4221051790,"Time perception is fluid and affected by manipulations to visual inputs. Previous literature shows that changes to low-level visual properties alter time judgments at the millisecond-level. At longer intervals, in the span of seconds and minutes, high-level cognitive effects (e.g., emotions, memories) elicited by visual inputs affect time perception, but these effects are confounded with semantic information in these inputs, and are therefore challenging to measure and control. In this work, we investigate the effect of asemantic visual properties (pure visual features devoid of emotional or semantic value) on interval time perception. Our experiments were conducted with binary and production tasks in both conventional and head-mounted displays, testing the effects of four different visual features (spatial luminance contrast, temporal frequency, field of view, and visual complexity). Our results reveal a consistent pattern: larger visual changes all shorten perceived time in intervals of up to 3min, remarkably contrary to their effect on millisecond-level perception. Our findings may help alter participants' time perception, which can have broad real-world implications."

However, an age-matched normative database is not readily available. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the response of ON and OFF visual pathways as a function of age.158 normal healthy adults (84 males and 74 females) whose age ranged 18-80 years participated in the study. None of them had any ocular disease (except cataract of grade II or less) and visual acuity of ≤ 20/25. Monocular testing (only one eye) was performed on the 'EyeSpeed' application on an iPad at 40cm distance. The targets ranged between 1 to 3 light or dark squares presented randomly in a noise background and participants responded by indicating the number of squares by touching the screen as fast as possible. The main outcome variables are reaction time, accuracy and performance index (1 / speed * accuracy).The median reaction time was shorter (Median (IQR): 1.53s (0.49) [dark] Vs 1.76s (0.58) [light], p < 0.001) and accuracy was higher (97.21% (3.30) [dark] Vs 95.15% (5.10) [light], p < 0.001) for dark targets than the light targets. Performance index and reaction time for both target types significantly correlated with age (ρ = -0.41 to -0.43; p < 0.001).This normative database will be useful to quantify disease-specific defects. More importantly, the ON pathway function can potentially serve as a surrogate for rod photoreceptor function."
https://openalex.org/W4221071057,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophic cytokine able to induce appetite reduction, weight loss and antidiabetic effects. However, its susceptibility to neutralizing anti-CNTF antibodies in patients hampered its use for treatment of human obesity and diabetes. In addition, CNTF has a very short plasma half-life, which limits its use as a therapeutic agent. Solutions, directed to prolong its in vivo effects, vary from the implantation of encapsulated secreting cells to identification of more active variants or chemical modification of the protein itself. PEGylation is a widely used modification for shielding proteins from circulating antibodies and for increasing their plasma half-life. Here, we have selected DH-CNTF, a CNTF variant which has a 40-fold higher affinity for the CNTF receptor α accompanied by an increased activity in cellular assays. The PEGylated DH-CNTF retained the biological activity of native protein in vitro and showed a significant improvement of pharmacokinetic parameters. In an acute model of glucose tolerance, the PEG-DH-CNTF was able to reduce the glycemia in diet-induced obese animals, with a performance equaled by a 10-fold higher dose of DH-CNTF. In addition, the PEGylated DH-CNTF analog demonstrated a more potent weight loss effect than the unmodified protein, opening to the use of CNTF as weight reducing agent with treatment regimens that can better meet patient compliance thanks to reduced dosing schedules."

External load during four consecutive microcycles (i.e., M1, M2, M3, and M4) and training sessions (i.e., MD-4, MD-3, MD-2, and MD-1) and a match day (i.e., MD) were registered in seventeen female professional soccer players (age: 26.3 ± 4.6 years; height: 166.3 ± 6.1 cm; body mass: 59.8 ± 6.8 kg; and body mass index: 21.6 ± 1.7 kg·m-2) who belonged to the same team in Spanish first division. A 10-Hz GPS that integrated a 100-Hz triaxial accelerometer was used to register external load. The results showed lower decelerations in M2 compared to M1 and M3 (p < 0.05), lower high-intensity distance (>16.0 km·h-1) in M3 vs. M2, and greater relative sprint distance (>21.0 km·min-1) in M4 vs. M1 and M3 (p < 0.05). MD-3 registered the highest load for all variables (p < 0.05). Forwards (FWs) performed (p < 0.05) significantly more sprints (meters and number > 21.0 km·h-1) than central midfielders (CMs) and central defenders (CDs) in MD-2 and MD.

Tyrosyl DNA-phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond between DNA 3'-end and a tyrosyl moiety of trapped topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes (Top1cc). We have previously shown Leishmania harbors a TDP1 gene (LdTDP1), however, the biological role of TDP1 remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have generated TDP1 knockout L. donovani (LdTDP1-/- ) promastigotes and have shown that LdTDP1-/- parasites are deficient in 3'-phosphodiesterase activities and were hypersensitive to Top1-poison like camptothecin (CPT), DNA alkylation agent like methyl methanesulfonate, and oxidative DNA lesions generated by hydrogen peroxide but were not sensitive to etoposide. We also detected elevated levels of CPT-induced reactive oxygen species triggering cell cycle arrest and cell death in LdTDP1-/- promastigotes. LdTDP1-/- promastigotes accumulate a significant change in the membrane morphology with the accumulation of membrane pores, which is associated with oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. To our surprise, we detected that LdTDP1-/- parasites were hypersensitive to antileishmanial drugs like amphotericin B and miltefosine, which could be rescued by complementation of wild-type TDP1 gene in the LdTDP1-/- parasites. Notably, multidrug-resistant L. donovani clinical isolates showed a marked reduction in TDP1 expression and were sensitive to Top1 poisons. Taken together, our study provides a new role of LdTDP1 in protecting L. donovani parasites from oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and resistance to amphotericin B and miltefosine."
https://openalex.org/W4220716306,"Cooperative behaviors are typically investigated using social dilemmas inserted into scenarios with well-known characteristics. Nonetheless, in real life, group members may be uncertain about what others will decide (social uncertainty) and the characteristics of the dilemma itself (environmental uncertainty). Previous studies have shown that uncertainty reduces the willingness to cooperate. Dual-process approaches to cooperation have given rise to two different views. Some authors argue that deliberation is needed to overrule selfish motives, whereas others argue that intuition favors cooperation. In this work, our goal was to investigate the role of intuitive mental processing on cooperation in a prisoner’s dilemma game involving uncertainty. Our results showed that participants cooperated less with their counterparts as the number of rounds progressed, suggesting a learning process and that intuitive mental processing in the first 50 rounds appears to favor cooperation under both deterministic and stochastic conditions. These results may help clarify the literature’s mixed effects regarding cognitive processing manipulation on cooperation. Developing a better understanding of these effects may improve strategies in social problems involving cooperation under uncertainty and cognitive constraints."
https://openalex.org/W4220740260,"Despite adequate infection prophylaxis, variation in self-reported quality of life (QOL) throughout the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion cycle is a widely reported but infrequently studied phenomenon. To better understand this phenomenon, subjects with humoral immunodeficiency receiving replacement doses of IVIG were studied over 3 infusion cycles. Questionnaire data from 6 time points spread over 3 IVIG infusions cycles (infusion day and 7 days after each infusion) were collected in conjunction with monitoring the blood for number of regulatory T-cells (Treg) and levels of 40 secreted analytes: primarily cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. At day 7, self-reported well-being increased, and self-reported fatigue decreased, reflecting an overall improvement in QOL 7 days after infusion. Over the same period, percentage of Treg cells in the blood increased (p<0.01). Multiple inflammatory chemokine and cytokine levels increased in the blood by 1 hour after infusion (CCL4 (MIP-1b), CCL3 (MIP-1a), CCL2 (MCP-1), TNF-α, granzyme B, IL-10, IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, and IFN- γ). The largest changes in analytes occurred in subjects initiated on IVIG during the study. A significant decrease in IL-25 (IL-17E) following infusion was seen in most intervals among subjects already receiving regular infusions prior to study entry. These findings reveal several short-term effects of IVIG given in replacement doses to patients with humoral immunodeficiency: QOL consistently improves in the first week of infusion, levels of a collection of monocyte-associated cytokines increase immediately after infusion whereas IL-25 levels decrease, and Treg levels increase. Moreover, patients that are new to IVIG experience more significant fluctuations in cytokine levels than those receiving it regularly."

A gamified app (EmpowerKids tool) was designed to support professionals to have discussions with 6- to 12-year-olds from low-income families about their health and wellbeing. The aim of this feasibility study was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the tool from the perspective of professionals in social, health and education settings. The study was conducted using a one-group post-test-only design. The usability data were collected using System Usability Scale and the acceptability data were collected using an open-ended questionnaire distributed to professionals (n = 24) in Estonia, Finland and Latvia. The data were collected during two phases. The tool was modified further on the basis of the results. The total usability scores were 82/100 (first testing) and 84/100 (second testing), indicating excellent usability. The answers related to acceptability were divided into four categories: suitability for the context; satisfaction and quality; attractiveness; modification needs. The professionals perceived that the tool helped them to build an overall picture of a child’s health and wellbeing, and to gain information about the child’s individual needs. The requirements for modification detected during the first testing were mostly related to difficulties with textual expressions and graphics. No major modification requirements were expressed during the second testing. The tool is considered feasible and may be used by professionals from different settings to support children’s health and wellbeing. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool from the perspective of child outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220837536,"Shipbuilding is a complex and large-scale operation involving many intermediate products (blocks) and the frequent transfer of blocks among workshops and stockyards. The reasonable use of methods to complete the transfer scheduling of intermediate products is of great importance. In this paper, the blocks and the flat transporters are the research objects. Based on organizing the various logistical processes for blocks and the circulation process in the shipyard, we established a model that takes the task time window and other factors as constraints, and minimizes the sum of delay time and no-load time of flat transporters while satisfying the punctuality of scheduling tasks. Three conclusions are reached: (1)The flat transporter utilization rate is inversely related to the value of the objective function. The smaller the value of the objective function, the more the usage rate of a particular one (2) loading is the biggest obstacle to the overall working time of flat transporters, and a simple optimization model cannot solve this problem; and (3) based on the optimization model, the load efficiency of flat transporters can be improved, and the delivery time can be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W4220847058,"The research object is the ground-rested circular RC tank. The innovation is to reveal the hydrodynamic pressure law of ground-rested circular RC tanks under bi-directional horizontal seismic action. The relationship between the sloshing wave height and hydrodynamic pressure is determined, the hydrodynamic pressure components and their combination are verified, calculation methods for hydrodynamic pressure are developed, and their distribution laws are presented. The results show that convective hydrodynamic pressure cannot be ignored when the tank is subjected to seismic action. Hydrodynamic pressure under unidirectional horizontal seismic action in X or Y direction is obtained by square root of the sum of impulsive pressure squared and convective pressure squared. Total hydrodynamic pressure under bi-directional horizontal seismic action is obtained by the square root of the sum of X-direction hydrodynamic pressure squared and Y-direction hydrodynamic pressure squared. This method can ensure the accuracy and reliability of hydrodynamic pressure calculation."
https://openalex.org/W4221113101,"Diabetic patients often have systemic circulation diseases which may cause serious systemic complications during ophthalmic surgeries with local anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intraoperative alteration of the vital signs in diabetic patients during cataract surgery with local anesthesia.Clinical records of 428 patients who underwent cataract surgeries with local anesthesia were reviewed. The parameters measured were systolic/diastolic blood pressures and pulse rates at pre-operation, 5, 10 and 15 minutes during the surgeries. The factors were compared between non-diabetic patients (n = 325) and diabetic patients (n = 103).Diabetic patients had significantly higher fasting blood sugar and preoperative pulse rate. Diabetic patients showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure compared to non-diabetic patients at 5 and 10 minutes from the beginning of surgery (p = 0.0093 and 0.0075, respectively). In the non-diabetic patients, the pulse rate was significantly decreased at 5 minutes from the beginning of surgery (p = 4.74 x 10-8) which was maintained during the surgery, but no change was observed in the pulse rate of the diabetic patients.Diabetic patients showed higher systolic blood pressure and pulse rate during cataract surgeries with local anesthesia, which should be monitored carefully by the physicians to avoid possible systemic complications."
https://openalex.org/W4226144950,"Mitochondrial dysfunctions are a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). β-Lactolin, a whey-derived glycine-threonine-tryptophan-tyrosine tetrapeptide, has been previously reported to prevent AD-like pathologies in an AD mouse model via regulation of microglial functions. However, the direct effect of β-lactolin on neuronal cells and neuronal mitochondrial functions remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of β-lactolin on mitochondrial functions in amyloid β (Aβ)-treated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells and human induced-pluripotent cell (hiPSC)-derived AD model neurons. Adding β-lactolin to Aβ-treated HT22 cells increased both the oxygen consumption rate and cellular ATP concentrations, suggesting that β-lactolin improves mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Using high content image analysis, we found that β-lactolin improved mitochondrial fragmentation, membrane potential, and oxidative stress in Aβ-treated cells, eventually preventing neuronal cell death. From a mechanistic perspective, we found that β-lactolin increased gene expression of mitofusin-2, which contributes to mitochondrial fusion events. Finally, we showed that β-lactolin improves both mitochondrial morphologies and membrane potentials in hiPSC-derived AD model neurons. Taken together, β-lactolin improved mitochondrial functions AD-related neuronal cell models and prevented neuronal cell death. The dual function of β-lactolin on both neuron and microglia marks an advantage in maintaining neuronal health."
