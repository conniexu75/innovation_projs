https://openalex.org/W3005151917,"Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) is crucial for the plant's immune response. How this sophisticated perception system can be usefully deployed in roots, continuously exposed to microbes, remains a mystery. By analyzing MAMP receptor expression and response at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis, we observed that differentiated outer cell layers show low expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and lack MAMP responsiveness. Yet, these cells can be gated to become responsive by neighbor cell damage. Laser ablation of small cell clusters strongly upregulates PRR expression in their vicinity, and elevated receptor expression is sufficient to induce responsiveness in non-responsive cells. Finally, localized damage also leads to immune responses to otherwise non-immunogenic, beneficial bacteria. Damage-gating is overridden by receptor overexpression, which antagonizes colonization. Our findings that cellular damage can ""switch on"" local immune responses helps to conceptualize how MAMP perception can be used despite the presence of microbial patterns in the soil."

Here we leverage the spatial separation of the sub-ependymal zone NSC niche and the olfactory bulb, the region to which newly generated neurons from the sub-ependymal zone migrate and integrate, and present a comprehensive proteomic characterization of these regions in comparison to the cerebral cortex, which is not conducive to neurogenesis and integration of new neurons. We find differing compositions of regulatory extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the neurogenic niche. We further show that quiescent NSCs are the main source of their local ECM, including the multi-functional enzyme transglutaminase 2, which we show is crucial for neurogenesis. Atomic force microscopy corroborated indications from the proteomic analyses that neurogenic niches are significantly stiffer than non-neurogenic parenchyma. Together these findings provide a powerful resource for unraveling unique compositions of neurogenic niches.

Adult stem cell niches provide complex regulatory architectures that maintain the stem cell population and prevent terminal differentiation (Crane et al., 2017Crane G.M. Jeffery E. Morrison S.J.

In the adult mammalian brain, the neural stem cell (NSC) niches are unique in supporting neurogenesis (Conover and Todd, 2017Conover J.C. Todd K.L.

The brain parenchyma outside these niches (e.g., neocortex; Figure 1A) even limits the neurogenic potential of transplanted NSCs or neuroblasts (Barker et al., 2018Barker R.A. Götz M. Parmar M.

Glial conversion of SVZ-derived committed neuronal precursors after ectopic grafting into the adult brain.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The largest NSC niche, the sub-ependymal zone (SEZ), generates neuroblasts that migrate to the distant olfactory bulb (OB), where they differentiate and integrate (Figures 1B and 1C) (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 2016Lim D.A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The Adult Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) and Olfactory Bulb (OB) Neurogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a018820-a018834Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This spatial separation allows the determination of the composition of the NSC niche (SEZ) that maintains the stem cells and generation of neuroblasts in comparison to the OB niche as an environment fostering neuronal differentiation and integration of new neurons. The SEZ, located at the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles that are lined by ependymal cells, harbors nestin+ quiescent NSCs that can be activated and give rise to transit-amplifying progenitors (TAPs) that then generate doublecortin (Dcx)-positive neuroblasts (Figure 1C). The medial side of the lateral ventricle, the medial sub-ependymal zone (MEZ), also shares ependymal cell lining and access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As it contains many fewer NSCs and Dcx+ neuroblasts (Figure 1C) than the SEZ, this region provides a useful comparative tissue to identify specific components of the NSC and neurogenesis-associated environment. Individual proteins and ECM structures (Kerever et al., 2007Kerever A. Schnack J. Vellinga D. Ichikawa N. Moon C. Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Efird J.T. Mercier F. Novel extracellular matrix structures in the neural stem cell niche capture the neurogenic factor fibroblast growth factor 2 from the extracellular milieu.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2146-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have been described as specific for the NSC niches in the adult murine brain, such as the ECM proteins Tenascin-C (Tnc) and Thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4) that both may regulate aspects of migration (Faissner et al., 2017Faissner A.

The adult mouse subependymal zone regenerates efficiently in the absence of tenascin-C.J Neuroscience. 2007; 27: 13991-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or the matrix-associated protein Plexin-b2 that regulates proliferation and migration (Saha et al., 2012Saha B. Ypsilanti A.R. Boutin C. Cremer H. Chédotal A. Plexin-B2 regulates the proliferation and migration of neuroblasts in the postnatal and adult subventricular zone.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16892-16905Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, no comprehensive proteomic analysis of this important niche has yet been performed. Likewise, in the OB, two matrix proteins, Reelin (Reln) and Tenascin-R (Tnr), have been reported to regulate the change from tangential to radial neuroblast migration (Figure 1B) (David et al., 2013David L.S. Schachner M. Saghatelyan A. The extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R affects adult but not developmental neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10324-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Hack et al., 2002Hack I. Bancila M. Loulier K. Carroll P. Cremer H. Reelin is a detachment signal in tangential chain-migration during postnatal neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and, besides neuronal activity, little is known about factors allowing the integration of new neurons into pre-existing networks in the adult brain (Hardy and Saghatelyan, 2017Hardy D. Saghatelyan A. Different forms of structural plasticity in the adult olfactory bulb.Neurogenesis (Austin). 2017; 4: e1301850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lledo and Valley, 2016Lledo P.M. Valley M. Adult Olfactory Bulb Neurogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a018945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above-described niches, the mature brain parenchyma allows neither neurogenesis nor integration of new neurons in the absence of injury (Frisén, 2016Frisén J. Neurogenesis and Gliogenesis in Nervous System Plasticity and Repair.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It contains a specialized extracellular matrix called “perineuronal nets” (PNNs) that is built up around neurons late in development and serves to restrict neuronal plasticity (Deepa et al., 2006Deepa S.S. Carulli D. Galtrey C. Rhodes K. Fukuda J. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Fawcett J.W. Composition of perineuronal net extracellular matrix in rat brain: a different disaccharide composition for the net-associated proteoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17789-17800Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As the NSC niche contains no neurons, and hence no PNNs, its ECM composition is expected to differ from the brain parenchyma, but the actual composition is largely unknown, as are potential differences in ECM composition between the OB and brain parenchyma. The ECM, the “matrisome,” consists of core ECM proteins often forming ECM structures, such as the basement membrane (BM) and associated ECM proteins, many with primarily protein-regulatory functions. The latter is essential for the enrichment and function of many growth factors and other signaling factors and, hence, is of key interest to mediate regulatory functions of a local niche. The proteins associated with the structural ECM can be enriched through detergent de-cellularization (Naba et al., 2012Naba A. Clauser K.R. Hoersch S. Liu H. Carr S.A. Hynes R.O.

Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11 (M111.014647)Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), but this has not yet been done in the NSC niches. In contrast to the paucity of proteome data, the transcriptomes of SEZ NSCs, their progeny, and the surrounding niche cells are well studied (Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010Beckervordersandforth R. Tripathi P. Ninkovic J. Bayam E. Lepier A. Stempfhuber B. Kirchhoff F. Hirrlinger J. Haslinger A.

However, gene expression analysis has proven inadequate to fully describe the proteome, including the tissue matrix environment (Angelidis et al., 2019Angelidis I. Simon L.M. Fernandez I.E. Strunz M.

For example, neurogenic and neuronal mRNAs are upregulated in NSCs and progenitors, but translation is inhibited to avoid premature differentiation and allow amplification of the lineage, a phenomenon referred to as “lineage priming” (Baser et al., 2019Baser A.

Moreover, proteins may be derived from the CSF that is contributing to the maintenance of the SEZ stem cell niche (Lepko et al., 2019Lepko T. Pusch M. Müller T. Schulte D. Ehses J. Kiebler M. Hasler J. Huttner H.B. Vandenbroucke R.E.

Determining the composition of the proteome, including the matrisome of the neurogenic niches, is thus important, particularly given the influence of the ECM composition on mechanical tissue properties, which regulate fate decisions of adult stem cells, such as muscle or mesenchymal SCs (Engler et al., 2006Engler A.J.

Mooney D.J. Mechanical forces direct stem cell behaviour in development and regeneration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 728-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Neural crest SCs have been found to differentiate into smooth muscle cells on stiffer substrates and glial cells on softer substrates (Zhu et al., 2019Zhu Y. Li X. Janairo R.R.R. Kwong G. Tsou A.D. Chu J.S. Wang A. Yu J. Wang D. Li S. Matrix stiffness modulates the differentiation of neural crest stem cells in vivo.J. Cell. Physiol. 2019; 234: 7569-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), consistent with CNS tissue belonging to the softest tissues in our body (Franze et al., 2013Franze K. Janmey P.A. Guck J. Mechanics in neuronal development and repair.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2013; 15: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This softness of CNS tissue is most likely due to low expression of certain structural matrix constituents, such as collagen I, and the soft nuclear matrix of neurons, given their low content of lamin A (Swift et al., 2013Swift J. Ivanovska I.L. Buxboim A. Harada T. Dingal P.C. Pinter J. Pajerowski J.D. Spinler K.R. Shin J.W. Tewari M. et al.Nuclear lamin-A scales with tissue stiffness and enhances matrix-directed differentiation.Science. 2013; 341: 1240104Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Tissue stiffness has been shown to potently influence neurite outgrowth (Koser et al., 2016Koser D.E. Thompson A.J. Foster S.K. Dwivedy A. Pillai E.K. Sheridan G.K. Svoboda H. Viana M. Costa L.D.

However, the mechanical properties of the adult stem cell niche are currently unknown. Here we set out to provide a first in-depth characterization of what makes the composition and architecture of the adult brain’s neurogenic niche uniquely different from the non-neurogenic brain parenchyma. For ultra-deep proteomic assessment of the neurogenic niches, we used library-matched single shot (LMSS) proteomics (see STAR Methods). Cerebral cortex (Cx) gray matter (GM, omitting the white matter [WM] and meninges) was compared with the OB (also omitting the meninges), the SEZ, and the MEZ (Figure 1D). To obtain SEZ and MEZ samples, we performed cryo-micro-dissections on 100-μm-thick tissue sections after removing cortex with corpus callosum and choroid plexus (10 sections per sample) (Figures 1E, 1F, and 1F′). The combination of methods allowed very high precision and proteome-measurement depth of the small SEZ and MEZ regions, avoiding the myelin-associated-glycoprotein-rich (MAG+) brain parenchyma (Figure 1G). We identified a total of 10,923 proteins in the library samples (four pooled tissue samples from each region) and 6,690 in LMSS samples (n = 4 per region) (Figure 1H; Table S1). Among the library-exclusive proteins, transcription factors (p = 1.68 × 10−6), cytokines, and neurogenesis-associated mitogens (e.g., interleukin-18, insulin growth factor, Vegf-α, etc.) were significantly enriched. As these are low-abundance proteins, in vivo proteome measurements of such factors have previously been unattainable. Our library measurements demonstrate that the mitogens and transcription factors known to be required for neurogenesis (e.g., Pax6) (Ninkovic et al., 2013Ninkovic J. Steiner-Mezzadri A. Jawerka M. Akinci U. Masserdotti G. Petricca S. Fischer J. von Holst A. Beckers J. Lie C.D. et al.The BAF complex interacts with Pax6 in adult neural progenitors to establish a neurogenic cross-regulatory transcriptional network.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 403-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) can be revealed and quantified in vivo with a proteome depth of 10,000 proteins (Figures S1A–S1D; Table S1). The principal component analysis (PCA) of the four regions revealed that the SEZ and the MEZ have a more similar proteome than the other two regions (Figure 1I). An enriched common category was cilium movement (p = 3.93 × 10−6) (Figure 1J), highlighting that proteins from a single cell layer, the ependymal cells lining the ventricle, can be detected: e.g., Tektin (Tek1), a protein exclusive to ependymal cells and NSCs at the SEZ (https://shiny.mdc-berlin.de/SVZapp/). In total, 4,786 proteins had a differential abundance among the four regions (ANOVA, FDR = 0.05) (Figure 1K). To identify features enriched in the neurogenic niche, we analyzed differences in protein abundance for either the OB or the SEZ in comparison to the Cx. Proteins were annotated with Uniprot keywords and the improved ECM annotation (http://matrisome.org; see STAR Methods). Enriched features of the OB included several nuclear and gene-regulatory processes (1D-annotation enrichment, FDR = 0.05) (Figures 1L and S1F; Table S2). This suggested that the OB has a larger proportion of gene-regulatory proteins, possibly because of the large population of maturing neuroblasts. Processes less pronounced in the OB compared to the Cx included synapse-associated features and core-matrisome proteins. Proteins enriched in the SEZ, like in the OB, were associated with gene regulation and also oxidative phosphorylation (Figures 1M and S1E; Table S2), which is consistent with the fact that NSCs are largely glycolytic and the metabolism has to change as they differentiate into neuroblasts (Beckervordersandforth, 2017Beckervordersandforth R. Mitochondrial Metabolism-Mediated Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis.Brain plasticity. 2017; 3: 73-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Knobloch and Jessberger, 2017Knobloch M. Jessberger S. Metabolism and neurogenesis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 42: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Annexin-family proteins were found enriched in the SEZ compared to the Cx (Figure 1M), a notable observation given their importance in regulating the proliferation and migration of cancer cells (Lauritzen et al., 2015Lauritzen S.P. Boye T.L. Nylandsted J. Annexins are instrumental for efficient plasma membrane repair in cancer cells.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 45: 32-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Core matrisome proteins demonstrated the highest abundance in Cx (p ≤ 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test) (Figure 2A), and several proteins of the PNNs had higher abundance in the Cx and the MEZ compared to the SEZ and the OB (Figures 1L and 1M). None of the proteoglycans associated with migration during developmental neurogenesis, such as neurocan, aggrecan, or versican (Long and Huttner, 2019Long K.R. Huttner W.B. How the extracellular matrix shapes neural development.Open Biol. 2019; 9: 180216Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, Maeda, 2015Maeda N. Proteoglycans and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex during development and disease.Front. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were an enriched component of the matrisome at the SEZ; instead, aggrecan was enriched in the OB in line with an association to neuroblasts (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2A–S2C). These data validate the quality of the dataset and provide a rich resource that can be accessed as a web-based database (https://pawelsm.github.io/neuronichen1/ or https://neuronicheproteome.org). The abundance of neurogenesis-associated proteins was lower in the MEZ compared to the SEZ but still detectable, further supporting the depth of our analysis. One such protein is Tnc, the neurogenic niche-associated ECM protein discussed above (Roll and Faissner, 2014Roll L. Faissner A. Influence of the extracellular matrix on endogenous and transplanted stem cells after brain damage.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that was enriched in the SEZ versus the MEZ, as expected (Figures 2A and 2B). We then compared the relative abundance of proteins in the SEZ, the MEZ, and the OB to the Cx as a control. These region-specific comparisons determined, S100a6 and C1ql3 among others, to be distinctly enriched among matrisome-associated proteins of the SEZ (Figures 2B, 2C, S2B, and S2C). We therefore aimed to determine which cells produce these SEZ-enriched proteins. Immunostaining for S100a6 was high in the SEZ and comparably absent in the MEZ (Figure 2D) and low to absent in astrocytes in the Cx parenchyma (Figures S3G and S3H), in agreement with our analysis. Excitingly, however, S100a6 staining labeled NSCs (slow dividing nestin+ cells in the SEZ; Figures S3B, S3C, and S3F), but not neuroblasts (Dcx+; Figures 2D, 2G, and S3A–S3C). Likewise, S100a6 staining also extends into the rostral migratory stream (RMS), co-localizing with GFAP+ cells, but not Dcx+ neuroblasts (Figures S3I and S3K). It is worth noting that NSCs, expressing GFAP, have been identified also at these more rostral positions (Alonso et al., 2008Alonso M. Ortega-Pérez I. Grubb M.S. Bourgeois J.P. Charneau P. Lledo P.M. Turning astrocytes from the rostral migratory stream into neurons: a role for the olfactory sensory organ.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11089-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also found S100a6+ GFAP+ cells in the WM (Figures S3E and S3J), consistent with the presence of some NSCs there (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 2016Lim D.A. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Thus, S100a6 not only labels NSCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) (Yamada and Jinno, 2014Yamada J. Jinno S.

Such 2C-like cells (2CLCs) can contribute to both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues when reintroduced into early embryos, although the molecular mechanism underlying such an expanded 2CLC potency remains elusive. We examine global nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in 2CLCs and identified miR-344 as the noncoding molecule that positively controls 2CLC potency. We find that activation of endogenous MERVL or miR-344-2 alone is sufficient to induce 2CLCs with activation of 2C genes and an expanded potency. Mechanistically, miR-344 is activated by DUX and post-transcriptionally represses ZMYM2 and its partner LSD1, and ZMYM2 recruits LSD1/HDAC corepressor complex to MERVL LTR for transcriptional repression. Consistently, zygotic depletion of Zmym2 compromises the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition during early development. Our studies establish the previously unappreciated DUX-miR-344-Zmym2/Lsd1 axis that controls MERVL for expanded stem cell potency."

https://openalex.org/W3006423879,"Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is an advanced stage of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and can lead to permanent vision loss. Currently, it affects 26.7 million people globally and on account of such a huge number of DME cases and the limited number of ophthalmologists, it is desirable to automate the diagnosis process. Computer-assisted, deep learning based diagnosis could help in early detection, following which precision medication can help to mitigate the vision loss.In order to automate the screening of DME, we propose a novel DMENet Algorithm which is built on the pillars of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). DMENet analyses the preprocessed color fundus images and passes it through a two-stage pipeline. The first stage detects the presence or absence of DME whereas the second stage takes only the positive cases and grades the images based on severity. In both the stages, we use a novel Hierarchical Ensemble of CNNs (HE-CNN). This paper uses two of the popular publicly available datasets IDRiD and MESSIDOR for classification. Preprocessing on the images is performed using morphological opening and gaussian kernel. The dataset is augmented to solve the class imbalance problem for better performance of the proposed model.The proposed methodology achieved an average Accuracy of 96.12%, Sensitivity of 96.32%, Specificity of 95.84%, and F-1 score of 0.9609 on MESSIDOR and IDRiD datasets.These excellent results establish the validity of the proposed methodology for use in DME screening and solidifies the applicability of the HE-CNN classification technique in the domain of biomedical imaging."

https://openalex.org/W3005786189,"Background Family planning counseling is critical for women to make informed reproductive and sexual health decisions. Despite Ethiopia's success in expanding access to family planning services, information on the quality of family planning counseling is limited. The objectives of this study were to assess whether the quality of counseling from the female client´s perspective has changed over time (2014 to 2018) and to investigate determinants associated with the quality of counseling to provide a more nuanced understanding of disparities in sexual and reproductive health outcomes in Ethiopia. Methods Data were obtained from five rounds of the Ethiopian Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 female survey questionnaire. Quality of counseling was categorized into four levels based on the responses of the questions that compose the Method Information Index, a core Family Planning 2020 indicator that serves as a proxy for quality of counseling and reflects the extent to which women are informed about side effects and alternate methods. The proportion of female contraceptive users that received good counseling were examined over time by each region, demographic characteristics, and contraception method type and source. Ordinal logistic regression was applied to the last survey round (2018) to investigate determinants associated with counseling quality. Results The proportion of female contraception users that reported receiving information on all three questions did not significantly change over the period 2014 to 2018. Overall quality of counseling on family planning was low, with only 30% of women reporting receiving sufficient information during counseling. The likelihood of good quality counseling was the least among those who had no formal schooling when compared to those who had higher educational attainment (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). Women from the wealthiest quintile were 1.72 times more likely (95% CI: 1.10, 2.69) to receive good quality counseling when compared to women in the lower wealth quintile. Women from rural areas were 1.51 times more likely to have received good counseling when compared to those in urban areas (95% CI: 1.04, 2.18). Amhara residents were less likely to receive good counseling when compared to the SNNPR (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.81). Women who acquired their method from the private sector had worse counseling (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.41) when compared to the public sector. Those using short-acting methods were more at risk of receiving lesser quality counseling when compared to users of long-acting methods (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.72). Conclusion The results of this analysis indicated that Ethiopia’s overall progress in modern contraceptive use has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the quality of family planning counseling. Improving the quality of contraception counseling for women across all demographics, including wealth quintiles and education, is a crucial strategy to support positive reproductive health outcomes with a rights-based focus. Based on the findings of this study, it is essential to emphasize the need to do proper counseling for all methods including short-acting methods especially for those working the private sector and some of the regions which have lower prevalence of good counseling. Further community-based participatory and qualitative research should focus on understanding the root causes and barriers to the delivery of high-quality counseling in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3005509160,"Abstract Enhanced prostaglandin production promotes the development and progression of cancer. Prostaglandins are generated from arachidonic acid (AA) by the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes. However, how cancer cells are able to maintain an elevated supply of AA for prostaglandin production remains unclear. Here, by using lung cancer cell lines and clinically relevant Kras G12D -driven mouse models, we show that the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL3) channels AA into phosphatidylinositols to provide the lysophosphatidylinositol-acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1) with a pool of AA to sustain high prostaglandin synthesis. LPIAT1 knockdown suppresses proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cell lines, and hinders in vivo tumorigenesis. In primary human lung tumors, the expression of LPIAT1 is elevated compared with healthy tissue, and predicts poor patient survival. This study uncovers the ACSL3-LPIAT1 axis as a requirement for the sustained prostaglandin synthesis in lung cancer with potential therapeutic value."

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesize that the tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in EVs is a key factor influencing the alleviation of colitis symptoms. DSS-induced colitis mice (C57BL/6, male, Naïve = 6, Sham = 8, PBS = 8 EV = 8, CTL-EV = 8, TSG-6 depleted EV = 8) were intraperitoneally administered EVs (100 ug/mice) on day 1, 3, and 5; colon tissues were collected on day 10 for histopathological, RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. In mice injected with EV, inflammation was alleviated. Indeed, EVs regulated the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 in inflamed colons. However, when injected with TSG-6 depleted EV, the degree of inflammatory relief was reduced. Furthermore, TSG-6 in EVs plays a key role in increasing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and polarizing macrophage from M1 to M2 in the colon. In conclusion, this study shows that TSG-6 in EVs is a major factor in the relief of DSS-induced colitis, by increasing the number of Tregs and macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W3006257674,"Hypertension is a major public health problem among the aging population worldwide. It causes cardiac remodeling, including hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which leads to development of hypertensive heart disease (HHD). Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) is associated with fibrogenesis in multiple organs, its contribution to cardiac remodeling in hypertension is poorly understood. Circulating miR-21 level was higher in patients with HHD than that in the control subjects. It also positively correlated with serum myocardial fibrotic markers. MiR-21 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the mice hearts after angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) compared with control mice. Expression level of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a main target of miR-21, was significantly decreased in Ang II infused mice and TAC mice compared with control mice. Expression levels of transcriptional activator protein 1 (AP-1) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which were downstream targets of PDCD4, were increased in Ang II infused mice and TAC mice compared with control mice. In vitro, mirVana-miR-21-specific inhibitor attenuated Ang II-induced PDCD4 downregulation and contributed to subsequent deactivation of AP-1/TGF-β1 signaling pathway in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Thus, suppression of miR-21 prevents hypertrophic stimulation-induced cardiac remodeling by regulating PDCD4, AP-1, and TGF-β1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3006626955,"Two fundamental goals of decision making are to select actions that maximize rewards while minimizing costs and to have strong confidence in the accuracy of a judgment. Neural signatures of these two forms of value: the subjective value (SV) of choice alternatives and the value of the judgment (confidence), have both been observed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, the relationship between these dual value signals and their relative time courses are unknown. Twenty-eight men and women underwent fMRI while performing a two-phase approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) task with mixed-outcomes of monetary rewards paired with painful shock stimuli. Neural responses were measured during offer valuation (offer phase) and choice valuation (commit phase) and analyzed with respect to observed decision outcomes, model-estimated SV and confidence. During the offer phase, vmPFC tracked SV and the decision but not confidence. During the commit phase, vmPFC tracked confidence, computed as the quadratic extension of SV, but not the offer valuation nor the decision. In fact, vmPFC responses from the commit phase were selective for confidence even for reject decisions wherein confidence and SV are inversely related. Conversely, activation of the cognitive control network, including within lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was associated with ambivalence, during both the offer and commit phases. Taken together, our results reveal complementary representations in vmPFC during value-based decision making that temporally dissociate such that offer valuation (SV) emerges before decision valuation (confidence)."

Therefore, utilization of type H vessels may be a strategy to treat diseases involving bone loss. In the present study, we found that nuciferine, a natural bioactive compound, has various effects, including inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and promoting type H vessel formation. Nuciferine inhibited osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption but increased the relative number of Trap+ preosteoclasts. Nuciferine restrained the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins, promoted PDGF-BB production and potentiated related angiogenic activities by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in vitro. We confirmed the bone-protective effects of nuciferine in ovariectomized mice and found that nuciferine treatment increased the PDGF-BB concentration and the number of type H vessels in the femur. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that nuciferine can decrease multinucleated osteoclast formation and promote type H vessel formation through preservation of Trap+ preosteoclasts via inhibition of the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and may be an excellent agent for the treatment of diseases involving bone loss."

However, the physiological roles of TCP96 in controlling bacterial infections and reducing LPS-induced inflammation are unclear. Here, using various biophysical methods, in silico molecular modeling, microbiological and cellular assays, and animal models, we examined the structural features and functional roles of recombinant TCP96 (rTCP96) in the aggregation of multiple bacteria and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists they produce. We found that rTCP96 aggregates both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their cell-wall components LPS, lipid A, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa were particularly sensitive to aggregation-induced bacterial permeabilization and killing. As a proof of concept, we show that rTCP96 reduces LPS-induced NF-κB activation in human monocytes, as well as in mouse models of LPS-induced subcutaneous inflammation.

This study builds upon and extends our previous work with the aim of understanding of TCPs spectrum of interactions with TLR agonists and bacteria, and importantly, the physiological role in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that a recombinant 96-amino acid TCP (rTCP96) aggregates both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the products LPS, lipid A, and LTA. Finally, we show as a proof of principle, that such aggregation reduces LPS-induced inflammatory signaling as well as levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria both in vitro as well as in vivo in experimental animal models. TCP96 represents an HNE-generated fragment, which is nine amino acids shorter (from the N terminus) than the B4 chain of γ-thrombin (Fig. 1) (15Petrlova J. Hansen F.C. van der Plas M.J.A. Huber R.G.

We recombinantly expressed TCP96 (rTCP96) and evaluated its antimicrobial effect on the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram-negative E. coli and two P. aeruginosa isolates (indicated as I and II in Fig. 2). The results showed that rTCP96 reduced the levels of particularly the Gram-negative strains E. coli and P. aeruginosa by 100–1000–fold, whereas the reduction of the Gram-positive S. aureus and E. faecalis was, albeit statistically significant, less marked (Fig. 2). To analyze whether the killing was mediated by bacterial permeabilization, we next employed live/dead staining, which uses propidium iodide (red color) to detect loss of membrane integrity. As seen, rTCP96 aggregated the bacteria, and killed (red) bacterial cells were observed in the aggregates of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). The size distribution of the aggregates and the relative abundance of the respective size groups was recorded and is summarized in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. The shorter TCP GKY25 killed the bacteria but did not cause aggregation (Fig. 3A, rightmost panels). We next selected E. coli and S. aureus bacteria for analysis using TEM after treatment with 5 μm rTCP96. Membrane breaks and perturbations, compatible with the results using the live/dead assay (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1) were observed (Fig. S2). Taken together, these results show that rTCP96 can induce aggregation and permeabilization of various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, leading to bacterial killing.Figure 2Antimicrobial activity of rTCP96. Viable count assay revealed a significant reduction in colony forming units of the indicated bacterial strains after treatment with 5 μm rTCP96. The strains used were E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (indicated by I and 9027 II), S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633.

We used Blue Native gels to determine the complex formations between rTCP96 (5 μm) and LPS (E. coli, 0 to 500 μg/ml) (Fig. 4A). Under the conditions used, rTCP96 alone is not detected in the gel, whereas increased amounts of LPS caused a significant increase in complexes migrating as ∼700 kDa and larger (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we measured a significant increase of β-sheet structure/aggregation by detecting thioflavin T1 (ThT) fluorescence in the samples of rTCP96 (5 μm), which were treated with LPS (E. coli) in the concentration range from 10 to 500 μg/ml in Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (Fig. 4B). Based on the results from the ThT experiment, for the next set of experiments, we chose to use 5 μm rTCP96 and 50 μg/ml of TLR ligands in Tris buffer, pH 7.4. We performed the ThT assay to determine the increase of β-sheet structure in rTCP96 treated with the TLR ligands LPS (E. coli), LPS (P. aeruginosa), lipid A (E. coli), LTA (S. aureus), and PGN (S. aureus). We detected a significant increase in the β-sheet secondary structure of rTCP96, as reflected by an increase in ThT fluorescence in rTCP96 subjected to LPS (from E. coli and P. aeruginosa), lipid A (E. coli), and LTA (S. aureus). We did not observe any changes after addition of PGN (S. aureus) (Fig. 4C). Dynamic light scattering analyses corresponded with the results from the ThT assay and the electrophoresis results using Blue Native gel. A significant increase of hydrodynamic radius, compatible with the observed interactions between rTCP96 and the TLR ligands, was detected in the presence of LPS (E. coli), LPS (P. aeruginosa), lipid A (E. coli), and LTA (S. aureus) but not in the presence of PGN (S. aureus) (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we employed microscale thermophoresis to measure the direct interaction between rTCP96 and TLR ligands in the solution (Fig. 4E). The Kd (μg/ml) constants for LPS (E. coli), LPS (P. aeruginosa), lipid A (E. coli), LTA (S. aureus), and PGN (S. aureus) were 14 ± 6, 16 ± 5, 18 ± 7, 15 ± 6, and 1449 ± 375, respectively, demonstrating that rTCP96 exhibited significantly lower binding affinity to PGN when compared with the other TLR ligands (Fig. 4F). Next, we used TEM to visualize amorphous aggregates of rTCP96 (of sizes from 0.5 to 5 μm), which were formed after incubation with the different TLR ligands LPS, Lipid A, and LTA (Fig. 5A). rTCP96 did not aggregate in the presence of PGN. Correspondingly, an increase of β-sheet structure of rTCP96 was detected by CD measurements in the samples incubated with the two LPS forms, lipid A, and LTA (S. aureus). As above, no significant difference in the secondary structure of rTCP96 treated by PGN was observed (Fig. 5B). Inflammatory local environments can have a low pH (16Grinstein S. Swallow C.J.

We therefore next investigated aggregation and structural changes of rTCP96 at pH 5.5. Using the ThT assay we found that LPS, lipid A, and LTA also induced β-sheet formation at low pH (Fig. S3A). Correspondingly, CD analysis at pH 5.5 demonstrated changes in secondary structure of rTCP96 in the presence of the TLR ligands LPS, lipid A, and LTA (Fig. S3B). CG simulations enabled us to study the large-scale aggregation propensity for TCP96 fragments in the presence of the lipid core components from different microbial products, including LPS from P. aeruginosa and E. coli, and LTA from S. aureus. The simulations in the presence of all molecules displayed an increase in aggregation over time, driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 6). Pairwise distance analysis supported visual analysis (Fig. 7), with LPS derived from different species forming stable co-aggregates in a 1:1 ratio. Notably, the 1:2 ratio of TCP96 with LTA lipids exhibited a greater propensity for aggregation compared with the 1:1 ratio, consistent with the smaller size of the lipidic component of LTA compared with that of LPS.Figure 7Mean intermolecular distances between TCP96 fragments following co-aggregation simulations in the presence/absence of various microbial products. The panels indicate pairwise intermolecular distances between all eight TCP96 molecules in the simulation box, ranging from close contact (white) to more separated (black). Bright regions of the panels signify larger contact areas between molecules. Dark areas indicate that the respective molecules do not interact. Increased aggregation is apparent through the appearance of additional bright areas in the system containing LTA/LPS. Note that the bright area through the center of each matrix is due to self-contact. Ec, E. coli; Pa, P. aeruginosa; Sa, S. aureus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The RDF for TCP96-TCP96 interactions was next calculated, as a measure of the mean variation in density as a function of distance from the protein fragments (Fig. S4). The RDFs indicate that TCP96s come into closer contact in the presence of LTA or LPS compared with when they are incubated alone. Based on the first peak in the RDF profiles, these differences in contact distances were shown to be significantly different, and also confirm that for each simulation the co-aggregation process had converged following the first 0.2 μs of simulation (Table S1). Furthermore, the data lend additional support to the observation that a higher concentration of LTA is required compared with LPS for efficient TCP96 aggregation. We next used reporter THP-1 monocytes to detect effects on LPS signaling by rTCP96. rTCP96 significantly reduced the activation of NF-κB/AP-1 triggered by E. coli LPS (Fig. 8A). The MTT viability assay did not show any significant cytotoxic effect of rTCP96 on THP-1 cells, which suggests that the reduction in the NF-κB/AP-1 activation was due to the neutralizing effect of rTCP96 on LPS and not by any rTCP96-mediated toxic effects (Fig. 8A). We next explored whether rTCP96 could suppress LPS-triggered local inflammation in vivo. For this, we utilized the (NF-κB-RE-Luc)-Xen reporter mouse model and studied the effects of rTCP96 on subcutaneous inflammation induced by LPS. (NF-κB-RE-Luc)-Xen reporter mice carry a transgene containing six NF-κB-responsive elements and a modified firefly luciferase cDNA. The reporter gene is inducible by LPS and helps in in vivo studies of transcriptional regulation of the NF-κB gene. LPS (25 μg) was subcutaneously injected into the mice, either alone or with rTCP96 (25 μg). The luminescent signal after subsequent addition of luciferin, reporting NF-κB activation, was recorded using live bioimaging (IVIS Spectrum) (Fig. 8B). We detected a significant reduction of NF-κB activation after 3 h in mice co-treated with rTCP96-LPS when compared with LPS treatment alone. rTCP96 alone did not yield any significant increase in NF-κB activation (Fig. 8C). In the next experimental model, we wanted to simulate a situation of direct contamination with bacteria. Bioluminescent P. aeruginosa or S. aureus bacteria (106 cfu, cfu/animal) were incubated with buffer or rTCP96 and immediately injected subcutaneously in SKH1 mice. In this model, the bacterial dose used causes a transient, and self-limiting bacterial infection. The results showed that rTCP96 reduced the bacterial load of P. aeruginosa, as assessed by in vivo bioimaging (Fig. 8, D and E). However, no significant reduction of S. aureus was observed (Fig. 8, D and E). In this study, we present evidence that rTCP96 aggregates not only Gram-negative E. coli but also other Gram-negative bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa, as well as Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus. Although both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were aggregated in vitro, we observed that bacterial killing was most pronounced for the Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa in vitro. Correspondingly, rTCP96 only reduced P. aeruginosa in an experimental model of subcutaneous inoculation of P. aeruginosa, whereas no effects on S. aureus were observed in the in vivo model. From a clinical perspective, this observation corresponds with the well-established fact that E. coli and P. aeruginosa are less frequent as infective agents in acute surgical wounds. Notably, the majority of surgical site infections are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, of which one major agent is S. aureus (18Dancer S.J. Varon-Lopez C. Moncayo O. Elston A. Humphreys H. Microbiology service centralization: a step too far.J. Hosp.

Although speculative, these observations suggest that TCP-mediated aggregation at physiological conditions, such as in wounds, may preferentially target bacteria, such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa. We also show that TLR4 agonists such as LPS and lipid A from various bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) cause aggregation of rTCP96. Notably, the TLR2 agonist LTA from S. aureus exhibited a similar aggregating effect on rTCP96. On the other hand, PGN (from S. aureus), which is a TLR2 agonist, did not exert any aggregating effects on rTCP96. In this context, it is notable that a major chemical difference between PGN and the other ligands is the lack of an acyl tail component in PGN. Hence, the data suggest that the hydrophobic lipid tails of lipid A, LPS, and LTA seem to be crucial in mediating the aggregation with TCP96, and likewise in binding to TLR hydrophobic pockets. Of particular importance was that we observed an anti-inflammatory effect of rTCP96, as it significantly reduced LPS-induced TLR4 activation of human monocytes in vitro, indicating that confinement of LPS leads to reduced inflammatory signaling. Importantly, this in vitro observation was translated to the in vivo situation, showing that TCP96 can also reduce NF-κB activation in the experimental model of endotoxin-induced inflammation in NF-κB-RE-luc mice. Taken together, the present work on aggregation of TCPs induced by bacteria and their products, therefore, adds a further role to proteolyzed thrombin fragments in aggregation and amyloid formation for rapid confinement of endotoxins and microbes. This connection between host defense and aggregation suggest that control of bacteria and its products is a common theme for many amyloidogenic proteins (20Kagan B.L. Jang H. Capone R. Teran Arce F.

The activities of TCP96 on LPS delineate an endogenous mechanism by which aggregation-prone TCPs facilitate and control inflammation. From an evolutionary perspective, this activity is both logical and beneficial from an organism's point of view, illustrating that it is better to localize and attenuate inflammation than not to contain it (Fig. 9).

The proposed method is appropriate to be applied in clinical practice due to the simple and fast sample preparation based on protein precipitation, the low amount of patient sample necessary for the analysis (10 μL) and the total run time of 6.5 min. It was fully validated according to FDA and EMA guidelines on bioanalytical method validation. The linearity was assessed (R2 within 0.9992–0.9983) over the concentration ranges of 0.3–250 ng/mL for palbociclib, 10–10000 ng/mL for ribociclib and 0.5–500 ng/mL for letrozole that properly cover the therapeutic plasma concentrations. A specific strategy was implemented to reduce the carryover phenomenon, formerly known for these CDKIs. This method was applied to quantify the Cmin of palbociclib, ribociclib and letrozole in plasma samples from patients enrolled in a clinical study. The same set of study samples was analysed twice in separate runs to assess the reproducibility of the method by means of the incurred samples reanalysis. The results corroborated the reliability of the analyte concentrations obtained with the bioanalytical method, already proved by the validation process. The percentage differences were always within ±10% for all the analytes and the R2 of the correlation graph between the two quantifications was equal to 0.9994."

This study investigated responses to spent coffee grounds in a diet-induced rat model of metabolic syndrome. Male Wistar rats aged 8-9 weeks were fed either corn starch-rich diet or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for 16 weeks, which were supplemented with 5% spent coffee grounds during the last 8 weeks. Rats fed non-supplemented diets were used as controls. High-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats developed metabolic syndrome including abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular and liver damage. Body weight, abdominal fat, total body fat mass, systolic blood pressure, and concentrations of plasma triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids were reduced by spent coffee grounds along with improved glucose tolerance and structure and function of heart and liver. Spent coffee grounds increased the diversity of the gut microbiota and decreased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Changes in gut microbiota correlated with the reduction in obesity and improvement in glucose tolerance and systolic blood pressure. These findings indicate that intervention with spent coffee grounds may be useful for managing obesity and metabolic syndrome by altering the gut microbiota, thus increasing the value of this food waste."
https://openalex.org/W3004484935,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is one of the most popular methods of studying the genetic control of traits. This methodology has been intensely performed on inbred genotypes to identify causal variants. Nonetheless, the lack of covariance between the phenotype of inbred lines and their offspring in cross-pollinated species (such as maize) raises questions on the applicability of these findings in a hybrid breeding context. To address this topic, we incorporated previously reported parental lines GWAS information into the prediction of a low heritability trait in hybrids. This was done by marker-assisted selection based on significant markers identified in the lines and by genomic prediction having these markers as fixed effects. Additive-dominance GWAS of hybrids, a non-conventional procedure, was also performed for comparison purposes. Our results suggest that incorporating information from parental inbred lines GWAS led to decreases in the predictive ability of hybrids. Correspondingly, inbred lines and hybrids-based GWAS yielded different results. These findings do not invalidate GWAS on inbred lines for selection purposes, but mean that it may not be directly useful for hybrid breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3004560364,"Plant communities on tropical high islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, are predicted to experience rapid climate change, resulting in novel climates. If increased temperature and/or drought exceed plant species' current tolerances, species that are unable to adapt or shift ranges risk extinction. By definition, habitat generalists have a wide niche breadth and thrive in a variety of habitats, whereas habitat specialists have a narrow niche breadth, and typically thrive under more specific climatic characteristics (e.g., cold). The objectives of this study were to: (1) classify plant species in the Hawaiian Islands along a habitat generalist-specialist continuum; (2) independently test the validity of species rankings, using environmental and biogeographic ranges; and (3) identify species' life-history traits that predict species location along the continuum. We quantified specialization for 170 plant species using species co-occurrence data from over one thousand plots to rank species' realized habitat niche breadth using the Jaccard index. The distribution of species along this continuum differed by species biogeographic origin, with endemic plant species ranked on the specialist end and non-native plant species ranked on the generalist end. Habitat specialization rankings also differed for four of nine tested variables (while controlling for biogeographic origin): number of habitat moisture types, minimum elevation, number of Hawaiian Islands, and life form. Life form was the only trait tested that differed across the continuum, with woody species ranked as stronger generalists than herbaceous species; this pattern was particularly evident for non-native species. This indirect method of estimating species' potential climatic flexibility uses increasingly available large plant community data sets with output rankings which represent species' realized habitat niches. Identifying species and plant communities that are on the habitat specialist end of the continuum allows for their prioritization in conservation planning, as globally the loss of specialists is an indication of degradation."

There were several main findings. First, the efficiency levels of agricultural carbon emissions showed significant regional differentiation among the areas, with that along the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road being much higher than that along the Silk Road Economic Belt. Second, technical efficiency was the key factor that restricted the improvement of the comprehensive efficiency of agricultural carbon. Third, most provinces invested in too many redundant and unreasonably allocated resources, showing a trend of diminishing returns to scale. Last, According to dynamic evolution analysis, the total productivity still demonstrated a diminishing trend.

https://openalex.org/W3004963833,"Background Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein involved in avoidance of different processes that are seen in diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis. These processes include apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling and damage of vessel walls and capillaries. Furthermore, because of its anti-inflammatory effects, alpha-1-antitrypsin has been proposed as a possible therapeutic approach for diabetic retinopathy. Our group tested alpha-1-antitrypsin in a type 1 diabetes mouse model and observed a reduction of inflammation and retinal neurodegeneration. Thus, shedding light on the mechanism of action of alpha-1-antitrypsin at molecular level may explain how it works in the diabetic retinopathy context and show its potential for use in other retinal diseases. Methods In this work, we evaluated alpha-1-antitrypsin in an ARPE-19 human cell line exposed to high glucose. We explored the expression of different mediators on signaling pathways related to pro-inflammatory cytokines production, glucose metabolism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other proteins involved in the normal function of retinal pigment epithelium by RT-qPCR and Western Blot. Results We obtained different expression patterns for evaluated mediators altered with high glucose exposure and corrected with the use of alpha-1-antitrypsin. Conclusions The expression profile obtained in vitro for the evaluated proteins and mRNA allowed us to explain our previous results obtained on mouse models and to hypothesize how alpha-1-antitrypsin hinder diabetic retinopathy progression on a complex network between different signaling pathways. General significance This network helps to understand the way alpha-1-antitrypsin works in diabetic retinopathy and its scope of action."
https://openalex.org/W3005099525,"Assessing invasive species ecology at multiple scales is needed to understand how to focus ecological monitoring and population control. As a widespread invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) frequently disrupt land management programs. We provide a detailed, multi-scaled view of the behavior of wild pigs at Fort Hood, Texas, USA by assessing seasonal and daily movement patterns, and diet. First, we quantified movement behavior through assessment of both seasonal home range size and first passage time movement behavior from 16 GPS-collared wild pigs. Home ranges were relatively large (mean: 10.472 km2, SD: 0.472 km2), and Cox proportional hazard models predicted that pigs moved slowest at temperature extremes (15< °C <30), in the spring, in rougher terrain, and in grassland communities. Secondly, we analyzed wild pig stomach contents to determine diet throughout the year. Diet was primarily plant-based, and showed seasonal variation in such items as hard and soft mast, and the foliage of forbs and woody plants. Integration of both movement and diet analyses indicate that wild pigs are more likely to be lured into baited traps in the winter when movement rates are highest and plant-based food resources are likely less abundant. Wild pigs are likely to have the greatest impact on vegetative communities in grassland habitats during the spring season when movement is restricted. Collectively, this multi-scaled approach provided detailed information on wild pig behavioral ecology in this area that would not have been apparent by looking at any single measure individually or only at a large spatial scale (i.e., home range), and could be a useful approach in other invasive species management programs."

Based on empirical data on China's A-share listed companies in 2013–2016, this paper examines the impact of corporate social responsibility performance on a company's financing costs from the perspective of targeted poverty alleviation. Specifically, we find that enterprises’ engagement in poverty alleviation social responsibility helps to reduce the cost of equity capital. The result is robust to using alternative indicators of the cost of equity capital, propensity score matching method, change model and sample removed financial sector. Furthermore, we find that the negative relationship between enterprises’ engagement in poverty relief and the cost of equity capital is mainly concentrated in private enterprises and in the central and eastern regions of China. Moreover, the negative relationship mainly exists after China’s listed companies were forced to disclose information on poverty alleviation. This paper also finds that institutional investors' shareholding plays a partial mediating role in this reduction effect and that enterprises’ poverty alleviation efforts help companies improve their financial performance and firm value. This study enriches the relevant literature on corporate social responsibility and the cost of equity capital and has reference value for corporate sustainable development.

This was tested by recording 24 female native speakers of German producing 60 sentences. The same participants later rated these recordings for accentedness. Importantly, the recordings had been altered to sound male so that participants were unaware of their own productions in the to-be-rated samples.

https://openalex.org/W3005450702,"Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) mediates the docking and entry of dendritic cells to lymphatic vessels through selective adhesion to its ligand hyaluronan in the leukocyte surface glycocalyx. To bind hyaluronan efficiently, LYVE-1 must undergo surface clustering, a process that is induced efficiently by the large cross-linked assemblages of glycosaminoglycan present within leukocyte pericellular matrices but is induced poorly by the shorter polymer alone. These properties suggested that LYVE-1 may have limited mobility in the endothelial plasma membrane, but no biophysical investigation of these parameters has been carried out to date. Here, using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy combined with biochemical analyses of the receptor in primary lymphatic endothelial cells, we provide the first evidence that LYVE-1 dynamics are indeed restricted by the submembranous actin network. We show that actin disruption not only increases LYVE-1 lateral diffusion but also enhances hyaluronan-binding activity. However, unlike the related leukocyte HA receptor CD44, which uses ERM and ankyrin motifs within its cytoplasmic tail to bind actin, LYVE-1 displays little if any direct interaction with actin, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Instead, as shown by super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy in combination with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, LYVE-1 diffusion is restricted by transient entrapment within submembranous actin corrals.

Here, we found that PRRSV infection upregulated the expression of miR-382-5p, which in turn inhibited polyI:C-induced the production of type I interferon by targeting heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), thus facilitating PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, we found that HSP60 could interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), an important signal transduction protein for inducing production of type I interferon, and promote polyI:C-mediated the production of type I interferon in a MAVS-dependent manner. Finally, we also found that HSP60 could inhibit PRRSV replication in a MAVS-dependent manner, which indicated that HSP60 was a novel antiviral protein against PRRSV replication. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that miR-382-5p was upregulated during PRRSV infection and may promote PRRSV replication by negatively regulating the production of type I interferon, which also indicated that miR-382-5p and HSP60 might be the potential therapeutic targets for anti-PRRSV."
https://openalex.org/W3004842775,"Abamectin is a common biocide used to control agricultural insect pests. However, the water insolubility of abamectin may result in extra organic solvent introduced in the environment. To solve this issue, it is desirable to develop nanoformulations to encapsulate abamectin with environment-friendly polymers. In this study, two polylactic acid based abamectin nanoformulations were prepared. The average particle sizes, measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope, were 240 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The insecticidal activity of these nano-formulated abamectin was examined in the laboratory on the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The acute toxicity of nano-formulated abamectin on non-target aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was also evaluated by topical, residual and oral exposure. The two nano-formulated abamectin had comparable insecticidal effect with commercial abamectin formulation against the pea aphid. Taking median lethal concentration (LC50) as the toxicological endpoint, nanoformulations had higher contact toxicity and lower oral toxicity to first-instar larvae of the predator A. bipunctata. These results are expected to contribute to the application of solvent-free nano-formulated pesticides that comply with the integrated pest management (IPM) strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3004571062,"Latin Americans engage in physical activity (PA) in unique ways and use a wider range of places for PA than those commonly studied in high-income settings. We examined the contribution of a variety of places and domains of PA to meeting PA recommendations among a sample of adults (18-65 y) from all over Mexico. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2017 (n = 3 686). Overall and domain-specific PA was measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Use of places for PA was self-reported. Places were classified as private or public. In 2018, associations between specific places and meeting PA recommendations (≥150 mins/week) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. In total 72.1% met PA recommendations. The proportion meeting recommendations through domain-specific PA was highest for leisure-time PA (50.0%), followed by travel-related (39.1%) and work-related (24.9%) PA. The most commonly reported places for PA were home (43%), parks (40.7%) and streets (39.4%) (public). Use of most public places was positively associated with meeting PA recommendations, mainly through travel-related PA (Streets OR 2.05 [95% CI 1.71-2.45]; Cycling paths OR 1.91 [1.37-2.68]). Using private places was more strongly associated with PA, mainly leisure-time PA (Gyms OR 9.66 [7.34-12.70]); Sports facilities OR 5.03 [3.27-7.74]). In conclusion, public and private places were important contributors to PA. While public places may be a powerful setting for PA promotion, increasing the equitable access for all to private places may also represent an effective strategy to increase PA among Mexican adults."
https://openalex.org/W3005011615,"The hallmark pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains are senile plaques, comprising β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, and neuronal inclusions formed from tau protein. These plaques form 10–20 years before AD symptom onset, whereas robust tau pathology is more closely associated with symptoms and correlates with cognitive status. This temporal sequence of AD pathology development, coupled with repeated clinical failures of Aβ-directed drugs, suggests that molecules that reduce tau inclusions have therapeutic potential. Few tau-directed drugs are presently in clinical testing, in part because of the difficulty in identifying molecules that reduce tau inclusions. We describe here two cell-based assays of tau inclusion formation that we employed to screen for compounds that inhibit tau pathology: a HEK293 cell-based tau overexpression assay, and a primary rat cortical neuron assay with physiological tau expression. Screening a collection of ˜3500 pharmaceutical compounds with the HEK293 cell tau aggregation assay, we obtained only a low number of hit compounds. Moreover, these compounds generally failed to inhibit tau inclusion formation in the cortical neuron assay. We then screened the Prestwick library of mostly approved drugs in the cortical neuron assay, leading to the identification of a greater number of tau inclusion inhibitors. These included four dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, with D2 receptors having previously been suggested to regulate tau inclusions in a Caenorhabditis elegans model.

Several neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as tauopathies, are characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions composed of polymeric fibrils of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within the brain (1Ballatore C.

AD is by far the most prevalent tauopathy, afflicting >5 million individuals in the United States (3Alzheimer's Association 2015 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.Alzheimers Dement. 2015; 11 (25984581): 332-38410.1016/j.jalz.2015.02.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Whereas tau inclusions are the primary neuropathological feature in frontotemporal lobar degenerative (FTLD) disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, and Pick’s disease (2Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev.

These extracellular plaques are composed of Aβ peptides, and a prevailing hypothesis in AD research is that Aβ plaques trigger events that ultimately lead to the development of tau pathology and consequent neurodegeneration (i.e. the amyloid cascade hypothesis) (4Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297 (12130773): 353-35610.1126/science.1072994Crossref PubMed Scopus (10357) Google Scholar, 5Selkoe D.J.

The belief that tau inclusions cause neurodegeneration is supported by genetic data showing inherited forms of FTLD result from tau mutations (6Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S.

As described below, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection compound library was screened in the HEK293 cell tau aggregation assay. Confirmed hits from this screen underwent testing in the neuronal assay of tau inclusion formation, yielding a low confirmation rate. This led to a subsequent screening of the Prestwick library of mostly approved drugs in the neuronal tau inclusion assay, which provided a higher number of validated hits with greater potential biological relevance. These findings suggest the importance of assessing compounds in neuronal models that express physiological levels of tau. Our laboratories previously demonstrated (32Guo J.L. Lee V.M. Seeding of normal tau by pathological tau conformers drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer-like tangles.J. Biol.

Tau gene mutations and their effects.Mov. Disord. 2005; 20 (16092090): S45-S5210.1002/mds.20539Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on this cellular system of tau inclusion formation, an alternative model was developed in which a HEK293 cell line was created that expresses T40PL with a C-terminal GFP tag (T40PL–GFP) to allow visualization of tau inclusions. T40PL–GFP expression in this clonal line is driven by a tetracycline-regulated promoter such that expression can be induced by addition of doxycycline (Dox) to the culture medium. Aggregates of T40PL–GFP were generated in these HEK293 cells through recombinant tau PFF transduction, and it was found that these intracellular aggregates could be propagated with high efficiency to daughter cells as long as cultures were maintained in the presence of Dox (41Guo J.L.

However, initiation of T40PL–GFP expression through re-introduction of Dox after the 7-day withdrawal period resulted in the rapid reformation of T40PL–GFP inclusions within 2 days, indicating that the remaining small tau aggregates were sufficient to “reseed” new tau aggregate growth upon re-expression of soluble tau (41Guo J.L.

The ability to manipulate the tau aggregate burden within T40PL–GFPagg cells led to the creation of a unique screening assay, as depicted in Fig. 1A, where compounds can be added to Dox-deprived T40PL–GFPagg cells with sparse aggregates prior to re-initiation of T40PL–GFP expression. This allows for an assessment of compound activity on tau inclusion formation or clearance. Preliminary studies revealed that soluble T40PL–GFP could be effectively cleared from tau inclusion-bearing cells with 1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTA) extraction, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation, allowing for quantitative imaging of remaining detergent-insoluble T40PL–GFP (Fig. 1B). This tau aggregation model was optimized for a 1536-well plate format, and the efficiency of the HDTA/PFA extraction and fixation method in removing soluble T40PL–GFP prior to imaging were compared with an alternative method in which soluble T40PL–GFP was released from aggregate-bearing cells with the commercial CellTiter-GloTM (CTG) reagent, with the T40PL–GFP being diluted into the surrounding medium such that it did not interfere with imaging of T40PL–GFP inclusions (Fig. 1B). The addition of the CTG reagent allows for the concurrent assessment of cell toxicity through a determination of a luminescent ATP signal (42Titus S.A. Southall N. Marugan J. Austin C.P. Zheng W. High-throughput multiplexed quantitation of protein aggregation and cytotoxicity in a Huntington's disease model.Curr. Chem. Genomics. 2012; 6 (23346268): 79-8610.2174/1875397301206010079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although cell toxicity was ultimately determined by quantifying DAPI-stained cell nuclei that remained after cell extraction. The 1536-well T40PL–GFPagg cellular assay was utilized to screen the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection of ˜3500 approved drugs and investigational compounds, utilizing the protocol summarized in Fig. 1A and described under “Experimental procedures.” All compounds were screened at five concentrations to generate concentration–response data for each compound, and the insoluble T40PL–GFP-integrated fluorescent signal was normalized to DAPI counts. All compounds were tested in two screening protocols, using the HDTA or CTG extraction procedures to remove soluble T40PL–GFP prior to imaging of the remaining insoluble T40PL–GFP tau aggregates. For the HDTA assay, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine–coated plates to reduce cell loss associated with the wash steps (Fig. S1A). Both extraction methodologies yielded similar plate Z′ values (Fig. S1B) (43Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol.

This cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor had been identified during initial assay development to cause a concentration-dependent reduction of soluble T40PL–GFP levels in the T40PL–GFPagg cells, resulting in reduced T40PL–GFP aggregate formation. Although this mechanism of action may be undesirable in a drug candidate, the addition of BMS-265246 to the screening plates provided a quality control standard to confirm proper assay performance. The BMS-265246 inhibition curves from each screening plate are summarized in Fig. S1C, and excellent plate–to–plate reproducibility was observed when using either the HDTA or CTG extraction procedures. Hits from the NCATS screen were defined as compounds that demonstrated a clear concentration-dependent inhibition of T40PL–GFP aggregates using both the HDTA and CTG extraction methods, with tau aggregate inhibitory activity well-separated by at least 1 log unit from cytotoxicity. Generally, compounds that were hits when using the HDTA extraction procedure were also hits when analyzed after CTG"
https://openalex.org/W3005620457,"The North American cheetah population serves as a reservoir for the species, and acts as a research population to help understand the unique biology of the species. Little is known about the intrauterine physiology of the cheetah, including embryo differentiation, implantation, and the development of the placenta. After mating, cheetah females frequently experience (30-65% of matings) a non-pregnant luteal phase where progestogen metabolite levels match those found in pregnant females for the first ~55 days of gestation, but parturition does not occur. Immunoglobulin J chain (IgJ) is a molecule that is involved in the activation of the secretory immune response and has been found to be indicative of pregnancy in the cheetah using fecal monitoring. In this study, western blotting was employed to track IgJ abundance in pooled weekly fecal samples following natural breeding or exogenous stimulation to ovulate, and IgJ levels were compared between individuals undergoing a pregnant (n = 12) and non-pregnant (n = 19) luteal phase. It was revealed that IgJ abundance was increased in pregnant females compared to non-pregnant females at week 4 and week 8 post-breeding, indicating the potential modulation of maternal immunity in response to sensitive events such as implantation and the increased secretory activity of the placenta. IgJ levels also tended to be higher early after breeding in females that were bred naturally with intact males compared to exogenously stimulated females with no exposure to seminal plasma, potentially indicating a response to the act of intromission or the stress of breeding, or possibly demonstrating an immune response resulting in the promotion of maternal tolerance to seminal antigens present upon embryonic implantation. Monitoring fecal IgJ may be a potential method to determine gestational status in the cheetah and will aid future conservation efforts of the species."
https://openalex.org/W3004832950,"Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital malformation with a reduced number of retinal ganglion cell axons in a thin optic nerve. It is a common cause of visual impairment in children and ONH is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, pituitary hormone deficiencies, and brain malformations. In most cases, the aetiology is unknown, but both environmental factors and genetic causes have been described. This study aimed to identify genetic variants underlying ONH in a well-characterised cohort of individuals with ONH. We performed array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing in 29 individuals with ONH. Rare variants were verified by Sanger sequencing and inheritance was assessed in parental samples. We identified 11 rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ten individuals, including a homozygous variant in KIF7 (previously associated with Joubert syndrome), a heterozygous de novo variant in COL4A1 (previously described in an individual with porencephaly), and a homozygous variant in COL4A2. In addition, one individual harboured a heterozygous variant in OPA1 and a heterozygous variant in COL4A1, both were inherited and assessed as variants of unknown clinical significance. Finally, a heterozygous deletion of 341 kb involving exons 7–18 of SOX5 (associated with Lamb-Schaffer syndrome) was identified in one individual. The overall diagnostic yield of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in individuals with ONH using whole genome sequencing was 4/29 (14%). Our results show that there is a genetic heterogeneity in ONH and indicate that genetic causes of ONH are not rare. We conclude that genetic testing is valuable in a substantial proportion of the individuals with ONH, especially in cases with non-isolated ONH."
https://openalex.org/W3005086375,"The objective of this research was to evaluate activation of the ileal brake in broiler chickens using diets containing semi-purified wheat (WS; rapidly and highly digested) and pea (PS; slowly and poorly digested) starch. Diets were formulated to contain six WS:PS ratios (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, 0:100) and each starch ratio was fed to 236 Ross 308 male broilers housed in 4 litter floor pens. At 28 d of age, the effect of PS concentration was assessed on starch digestion, digestive tract morphology, and digesta pH and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) status were assessed in serum (ELISA) and via gene expression in jejunal and ileal tissue (proglucagon for GLP-1). Data were analyzed using regression analyses, and significance was accepted at P ≤ 0.05. Increasing dietary PS resulted in reduced starch digestibility in the small intestine, but had no effect in the colon. Crop content pH responded quadratically to PS level with an estimated minimum at 55% PS. Total SCFA increased linearly in the crop with PS level, but changed in a quadratic fashion in the ileum (estimated maximum at 62% PS). Ceacal SCFA concentrations were highest for the 80 and 100% PS levels. The relative empty weight (crop, small intestine, colon), length (small intestine) and content (crop jejunum, Ileum) of digestive tract sections increased linearly with increasing PS concentration. Dietary treatment did not affect serum GLP-1 or PYY or small intestine transcript abundance. In conclusion, feeding PS increased the presence of L-cell activators (starch, SCFA) and increased trophic development and content of the digestive tract, suggestive of L-cell activation. However, no direct evidence of ileal brake activation was found by measuring venous blood levels of GLP-1 or PYY or corresponding gene expression in small intestine tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3005269518,"In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a dearth of epidemiologic data on the burden of cerebral atherosclerosis. This is explained by the limited availability and the high cost of standard vascular imaging techniques. Neurovascular ultrasound is portable, cheaper and non-invasive and could, therefore, represent a reasonable alternative to fill this knowledge gap. We explored the feasibility of neurovascular ultrasound in Malawian adults with acute stroke-like syndrome to inform the design of future large stroke studies comparing its diagnostic performance to that of gold standard vascular imaging techniques in sub-Saharan Africa.We enrolled consecutive patients diagnosed with acute stroke-like syndrome based on the World Health Organization definition. Clinical and demographic data were recorded, and a comprehensive neurovascular ultrasound was performed. Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to study the relationship between atherosclerosis and potential risk factors.Sixty-six patients were enrolled (mean age: 58.7 years). The frequency of extracranial atherosclerosis was 39.4% (n = 26, 95% CI: 28.6-52.2). There were 12 patients with abnormal carotid intima media thickness (18.2%, 95% CI: 9.8-29.6) and 14 patients with a carotid plaque (21.2%, 95% CI: 12.1-33.0). The frequency of intracranial atherosclerosis was 19.2% (95%CI: 6.6-39.4) in 26 patients with successful transcranial insonation. Hypertension (80.8 versus 52.5%, p = 0.03) and hypercholesterolemia (11.5 versus 0.0%, p = 0.05) were more prevalent in patients with extracranial atherosclerosis.This study demonstrates the feasibility of neurovascular ultrasound to assess cervical arteries in adults with stroke-like syndrome in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a high rate of transcranial insonation failure in this setting, highlighting the need for echocontrast agents."

In the present experiment, 30 Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (41.8 ± 5.7 kg) were exposed to 2 thermal environments varying in temperature-humidity index (THI) from 12 days before mating to 45 days of gestation. The environmental conditions were: gestation under thermal-neutral (TN; THI = 71 ± 3); and gestation under heat stress (HS; THI = 85 ± 3) conditions. At 27 ± 4 days old, female kids exposed to in utero TN (IUTN; n = 16) or in utero HS (IUHS; n = 10) were subjected to 2 tests: arena test (AT) and novel object test (NOT), the latter was repeated at 3 months of age. Additionally, 8 months after birth, a subset of IUTH and IUHS growing goats (n = 8 each; 16.8 ± 3.4 kg BW) were exposed to 2 environmental conditions in 2 consecutive periods: a basal thermal-neutral period (THI = 72 ± 3) for 7 days, and a heat-stress period (THI = 87 ± 2) for 21 days. In both periods, feeding, resting, posture, and thermally-associated behaviors were recorded. The gestation length was shortened by 3 days in GHS goats. In the AT, IUHS kids showed a lower number of sniffs (P < 0.01) compared to IUTN. In the NOT, IUHS kids also tended to show a lower number of sniffs (P = 0.09). During heat exposure, IUTN and IUHS growing goats spent more time resting and exhibited more heat-stress related behaviors such as panting and drinking (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed between both groups. In conclusion, heat stress during the first third of pregnancy shortened gestation length and influenced the exploratory behavior of the kids in the early life. However, behavior responses to heat stress during the adulthood were not affected by the in utero thermal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3006382472,"NK cell migration and activation are crucial elements of tumor immune surveillance. In mammary carcinomas, the number and function of NK cells is diminished, despite being positively associated with clinical outcome. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has been shown to be an important regulator of NK cell activation through its interaction with SHIP-1 downstream of inhibitory NK receptor signaling, but has not been explored in regard to NK cell migration. Here, we explored the migratory potential and function of NK cells in subcutaneous AT3 in mice lacking miR-155. Without tumor, these bic/miR-155-/- mice possess similar numbers of NK cells that exhibit comparable surface levels of cytotoxic receptors as NK cells from wild-type (WT) mice. Isolated miR-155-/- NK cells also exhibit equivalent cytotoxicity towards tumor targets in vitro compared to isolated WT control NK cells, despite overexpression of known miR-155 gene targets. NK cells isolated from miR-155-/- mice exhibit impaired F-actin polymerization and migratory capacity in Boyden-chamber assays in response chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). This migratory capacity could be normalized in the presence of SHIP-1 inhibitors. Of note, miR-155-/- mice challenged with mammary carcinomas exhibited heightened tumor burden which correlated with a lower number of tumor-infiltrating NK1.1+ cells. Our results support a novel, physiological role for SHIP-1 in the control of NK cell tumor trafficking, and implicate miR-155 in the regulation of NK cell chemotaxis, in the context of mammary carcinoma. This may implicate dysfunctional NK cells in the lack of tumor clearance in mice."

BRAF V600E and the latter 4 markers are usually absent in the more aggressive and chemoresistant variant HCLv. To evaluate differences between HCL and HCLv, expression microarrays comparing HCL with HCLv were performed for 24694 genes using 47323 probes. Microarray data from 35 HCL and 27 HCLv purified samples showed the greatest HCL-HCLv difference in the muscle-associated gene MYF6, expressed by its 2 probes 18.5- and 10.8-fold higher in HCL than HCLv (p<0.0001). By real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), 100% of 152 classic HCL samples were MYF6-positive, vs 5 (6%) of 90 blood donors. MYF6-expression was also detected in 18 (35%) of 51 with HCLv, 11 (92%) of 12 with HCL expressing unmutated IGHV4-34, 35 (73%) of 48 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 1 (8%) of 12 with mantle cell lymphoma. Hypomethylation status of MYF6 supported expression in HCL more than HCLv. Posttreatment blood samples becoming negative by flow cytometry remained MYF6+ by RQ-PCR in 42 (48%) of 87 HCL patients, and MYF6 RQ-PCR could detect 1 HCL in 105 normal cells. MYF6, universally expressed in HCL and in most CLL samples, may be a useful biomarker for these leukemias. Further studies are underway to determine the role of MYF6 in HCL."

The aim of the present study was to compare healthy and asthmatic pulmonary acoustics by applying a 1D model of wave propagation on CT-based patient-specific geometries. High-resolution CT lung images were acquired in five healthy volunteers and five asthmatic patients at total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC). Tracheobronchial trees were reconstructed from CT images. Acoustic pressure, impedance and wall radial velocity were measured by simulating acoustic wave propagation of two external, acoustic pressure waves (1 Pa, 200 and 600 Hz) from the trachea level to the 4th generation. In asthmatic patients, acoustic pressure averaged across the last three generations showed a reduction equal to 29.7% (p<0.01) at FRC, at 200 Hz; input and terminal impedance were 34.5% (p<0.05) higher both at FRC and TLC; wall radial velocity was more than 80% (p<0.05) lower in higher generations both at FRC and TLC. Airway differences in asthma alter acoustic parameters at FRC and TLC, with the greatest difference at FRC and 200 Hz. Acoustic wave propagation analysis represents a quantitative approach that has potential to objectively characterize airway differences in individuals with diseases such as asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3004644074,"Introduction This study developed a new Professional Decision-Making in Medicine Measure that assesses the use of effective decision-making strategies: seek help, manage emotions, recognize consequences and rules, and test assumptions and motives. The aim was to develop a content valid measure and obtain initial evidence for construct validity so that the measure could be used in future research or educational assessment. Methods Clinical scenario-based items were developed based on a review of the literature and interviews with physicians. For each item, respondents are tasked with selecting two responses (out of six plausible options) that they would choose in that situation. Three of the six options reflect a decision-making strategy; these responses are scored as correct. Data were collected from a sample of 318 fourth-year medical students in the United States. They completed a 16-item version of the measure (Form A) and measures of social desirability, moral disengagement, and professionalism attitudes. Professionalism ratings from clerkships were also obtained. A sub-group (n = 63) completed a second 16-item measure (Form B) to pilot test the instrument, as two test forms are useful for pre-posttest designs. Results Scores on the new measure indicated that, on average, participants answered 75% of items correctly. Evidence for construct validity included the lack of correlation between scores on the measure and socially desirable responding, negative correlation with moral disengagement, and modest to low correlations with professionalism attitudes. A positive correlation was observed with a clerkship rating focused on professionalism in peer interactions. Conclusions These findings demonstrate modest proficiency in the use of decision-making strategies among fourth-year medical students. Additional research using the Professional Decision-Making Measure should explore scores among physicians in various career stages, and the causes and correlates of scores. Educators could utilize the measure to assess courses that teach decision-making strategies."

Patient demands in each cluster were also examined.Overall patient demands among hemodialysis patients have been demonstrated in numerous reports; however, variables among subgroups have not been explored.Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional survey of 114 hemodialysis patients recruited from dialysis centers in Northern Taiwan. Hope, depression, and symptom disturbance were used as parameters for clustering because they have been shown to be important factors affecting patient demands. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to classify participants into clusters. Patient demands in each cluster were analyzed.Among the 114 participants, there was a negative correlation between hope and depression as well as between hope and symptom disturbance; there was a positive correlation between depression and symptom disturbance. Two clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n = 49) included patients with moderate levels of hope and symptom disturbance, and high levels of depression; and Cluster 2 (n = 65) included patients with low levels of depression and symptom disturbance and high levels of hope. Demographic profiles differed between the two clusters. Regarding patient demands, medical demand showed the highest average score; whereas, occupational demand exhibited the lowest average score. Psychological and occupational demands differed significantly between the two clusters. The two clusters were defined as subgroups: Cluster 1 was labeled ""resting""; Cluster 2 was labeled ""active"".Cluster analysis may further classify hemodialysis patients into distinct subgroups base on their specific patient demands. A better understanding of patient demands may help health professionals to provide a holistic individualized treatment to improve patients' outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3005927283,"Most phospholipids are synthesized via modification reactions of a simple phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA). PA and its modified phospholipids travel between organelle membranes, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial inner membrane, to be converted to the other phospholipids. To gain insight into mechanisms of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, we searched for factors whose loss affects the phospholipid synthesis using an in vitro phospholipid transport assay. Among the various factors that were tested, we noticed that a lack of Pah1, which is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, led to severe defects in phospholipid synthesis, which was not rescued by re-expression of wild-type Pah1. These results indicated other mutations in addition to the deletion of Pah1. Interestingly, we found that stress conditions associated with the yeast transformation process triggered a disruption of the INO4 gene by insertion of the Ty1 retrotransposon in pah1∆ strains. Additionally, we noticed that loss of the diacylglycerol kinase Dgk1, which has an opposing function to Pah1, suppressed the insertional mutation of INO4. These findings suggest that normal Pah1 function is critical for the suppression of insertional mutations by retrotransposon elements."
https://openalex.org/W3004504616,"Several diseases are associated with excess of adipose tissue, and obesity is considered an independent risk factor for the development of cardiac remodeling and heart failure. Dietary aspects have been studied to elucidate the mechanisms involved in these processes. Thus, the purpose was the development and characterization of an obesity experimental model from hypercaloric diets, which resulted in cardiac remodeling and predisposition to heart failure. Thirty- day-old male Wistar rats (n = 52) were randomized into four groups: control (C), high sucrose (HS), high-fat (HF) and high-fat and sucrose (HFHS) for 20 weeks. General characteristics, comorbidities, weights of the heart, left (LV) and right ventricles, atrium, and relationships with the tibia length were evaluated. The LV myocyte cross sectional area and fraction of interstitial collagen were assayed. Cardiac function was determined by hemodynamic analysis and the contractility by cardiomyocyte contractile function. Heart failure was analyzed by pulmonary congestion, right ventricular hypertrophy, and hemodynamic parameters. HF and HFHS models led to obesity by increase in adiposity index (C = 8.3 ± 0.2% vs. HF = 10.9 ± 0.5%, HFHS = 10.2 ± 0.3%). There was no change in the morphological parameters and heart failure signals. HF and HFHS caused a reduction in times to 50% relaxation without cardiomyocyte contractile damage. The HS model presented cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction visualized by lower shortening (C: 8.34 ± 0.32% vs. HS: 6.91 ± 0.28), as well as the Ca2+ transient amplitude was also increased when compared to HFHS. In conclusion, the experimental diets based on high amounts of sugar, lard or a combination of both did not promote cardiac remodeling with predisposition to heart failure under conditions of obesity or excess sucrose. Nevertheless, excess sucrose causes cardiomyocyte contractility dysfunction associated with alterations in the myocyte sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W3004612756,"Will fights erupt when resources are scarce and the rules regulating their distribution are absent or ignored? We conjecture that the answer depends on whether credible information about individuals’ toughness is available. When people send credible signs and signals of their toughness disputes may be solved without violence. We use a laboratory experiment in which subjects create information about their toughness and decide whether to take others’ resources and resist in case others’ attempt to take theirs. Subjects perform a potentially painful but safe physical exercise to create information and to determine who wins and loses fights. This, realistically, ranks subjects according to their toughness and implicates toughness, a quality important in real conflict, in fighting. We find that, consistent with theory, information reduces fighting. This suggests that, in addition to the theories traditionally used to explain prisoner behavior, the availability of credible information about toughness influences prison conflict."
https://openalex.org/W3005214341,"Evolving in groups can either enhance or reduce an individual’s task performance. Still, we know little about the factors underlying group performance, which may be reduced to three major dimensions: (a) the individual’s ability to perform a task, (b) the dependency on environmental conditions, and (c) the perception of, and the reaction to, other group members. In our research, we investigated how these dimensions interrelate in simulated evolution experiments using adaptive agents equipped with Markov brains (“animats”). We evolved the animats to perform a spatial-navigation task under various evolutionary setups. The last generation of each evolution simulation was tested across modified conditions to evaluate and compare the animats’ reliability when faced with change. Moreover, the complexity of the evolved Markov brains was assessed based on measures of information integration. We found that, under the right conditions, specialized animats could be as reliable as animats already evolved for the modified tasks, and that reliability across varying group sizes correlated with evolved fitness in most tested evolutionary setups. Our results moreover suggest that balancing the number of individuals in a group may lead to higher reliability but also lower individual performance. Besides, high brain complexity was associated with balanced group sizes and, thus, high reliability under limited sensory capacity. However, additional sensors allowed for even higher reliability across modified environments without a need for complex, integrated Markov brains. Despite complex dependencies between the individual, the group, and the environment, our computational approach provides a way to study reliability in group behavior under controlled conditions. In all, our study revealed that balancing the group size and individual cognitive abilities prevents over-specialization and can help to evolve better reliability under unknown environmental situations."

The predictor is based on an algorithm for cholesterol metabolism simulation available in literature, implemented and optimized by our group in the R language. The main weakness of the former simulation algorithm was the need of experimental data to simulate mutations in genes altering the cholesterol metabolism. This caveat strongly limited the application of the model in the clinical practice. In this work we present how this limitation could be bypassed thanks to an optimization of model parameters based on patient cholesterol levels retrieved from literature. Prediction performance has been assessed taking into consideration several scoring indices currently used for performance evaluation of machine learning methods. Our assessment shows how the optimization phase improved model performance, compared to the original version available in literature."
