https://openalex.org/W2084053963,"Density functional theory of electronic structure is widely and successfully applied in simulations throughout engineering and sciences. However, for many predicted properties, there are spectacular failures that can be traced to the delocalization error and static correlation error of commonly used approximations. These errors can be characterized and understood through the perspective of fractional charges and fractional spins introduced recently. Reducing these errors will open new frontiers for applications of density functional theory."

We found that the SWNT content can be increased up to 20 weight percent without reducing the mechanical flexibility or softness of the copolymer. The SWNT composite film was coated with dimethyl-siloxane–based rubber, which exhibited a conductivity of 57 siemens per centimeter and a stretchability of 134%. Further, the elastic conductor was integrated with printed organic transistors to fabricate a rubberlike active matrix with an effective area of 20 by 20 square centimeters. The active matrix sheet can be uniaxially and biaxially stretched by 70% without mechanical or electrical damage. The elastic conductor allows for the construction of electronic integrated circuits, which can be mounted anywhere, including arbitrary curved surfaces and movable parts, such as the joints of a robot's arm."

However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2071261094,"Applying an electrical field to a polar polymer may induce a large change in the dipolar ordering, and if the associated entropy changes are large, they can be explored in cooling applications. With the use of the Maxwell relation between the pyroelectric coefficient and the electrocaloric effect (ECE), it was determined that a large ECE can be realized in the ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] copolymer at temperatures above the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition (above 70°C), where an isothermal entropy change of more than 55 joules per kilogram per kelvin degree and adiabatic temperature change of more than 12°C were observed. We further showed that a similar level of ECE near room temperature can be achieved by working with the relaxor ferroelectric polymer of P(VDF-TrFE-chlorofluoroethylene)."
https://openalex.org/W2015022497,"SIRT1, a histone/protein deacetylase, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are key enzymes responsible for longevity and energy homeostasis. We examined whether a mechanistic connection exists between these molecules that involves the major AMPK kinase LKB1. Initial studies demonstrated that LKB1 is acetylated in cultured (HEK293T) cells, mouse white adipose tissue, and rat liver. In the 293T cells, SIRT1 overexpression diminished lysine acetylation of LKB1 and concurrently increased its activity, cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio, and association with the LKB1 activator STRAD. In contrast, short hairpin RNA for SIRT1, where studied, had opposite effects on these parameters. Mass spectrometric analysis established that acetylation of LKB1 occurs on multiple, but specific, lysine residues; however, only mutation of lysine 48 to arginine, which mimics deacetylation, reproduced all of the effects of activated SIRT1. SIRT1 also affected downstream targets of LKB1. Thus its overexpression increased AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation, and conversely, RNA interference-mediated SIRT1 knockdown reduced AMPK phosphorylation and that of another LKB1 target MARK1. Consistent with the results in cultured cells, total LKB1 lysine acetylation was decreased by 60% in the liver of 48-h starved rats compared with starved-refed rats, and this was associated with modest but significant increases in both LKB1 and AMPK activities. These results suggest that LKB1 deacetylation is regulated by SIRT1 and that this in turn influences its intracellular localization, association with STRAD, kinase activity, and ability to activate AMPK. SIRT1, a histone/protein deacetylase, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are key enzymes responsible for longevity and energy homeostasis.

LKB1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates 13 downstream kinases (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), one of which is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), 2The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; LDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; RNAi, RNA interference; WT, wild type. a key enzyme that regulates cellular energy state, growth, inflammation, and mitochondrial function (2Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). LKB1, when not associated with other proteins, is located predominantly in the nucleus because of its N-terminal nuclear localization signal. However, LKB1 activation takes place predominantly in the cytoplasm, after it complexes with STRAD (STE-related adapter) and MO25 (mouse protein 25) (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 3Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Once activated, LKB1 has been demonstrated to phosphorylate AMPK on Thr-172, an event required for its activation (4Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no specific mechanism for regulating the activation and inactivation of the kinase activity of LKB1 has been described. Indeed, it has been suggested that LKB1 may be constitutively active and that its effects on AMPK phosphorylation (e.g. in contracting muscle) may be governed by the action of phosphatases (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 20Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Scott J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 7-15Crossref Scopus (651) Google Scholar). SIRT1, a class III NAD+-dependent histone/protein deacetylase, has been implicated in the longevity induced by caloric restriction in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to rodents (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Sci. Am. 2006; 294 (54-47): 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that it may work in part by activating AMPK (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Sci. Am. 2006; 294 (54-47): 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The expression and deacetylation activities of SIRT1 are enhanced by increases in NAD+ levels or the NAD+/NADH ratio, such as occur during caloric restriction (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Sci. Am. 2006; 294 (54-47): 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). In the investigations described here, we present evidence that SIRT1 deacetylates LKB1 and that this is associated with its movement to the cytoplasm where it is bound to and activated by STRAD. The data also suggest that SIRT1 activates AMPK by this mechanism both in cultured HEK293T cells and in rat liver in vivo. Cell Cultures—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) and HepG2 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in either Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) for 293T or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for HepG2 cells supplemented with 5–10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: total AMPK-α and phospho-Thr-172-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); glutathione S-transferase (GST), LKB1 (N-19, H-75, M-18, and Ley37D/G6), SIRT1, STRAD, and phospho-Ser-428 LKB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; Santa Cruz, CA); acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), phospho-Ser-79-ACC, acetyl-lysine (Millipore/Upstate, Charlottesville, VA); β-actin, FLAG tag (Sigma); and phospho-Thr-336-LKB1 (ImmuQuest; Ingleby Barwick, Cleveland, UK). The following secondary antibodies were used: HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences); HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody, and HRP conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). cDNAs and Plasmids—The following is a list of cDNA accession numbers used in this study. Unless stated otherwise, the plasmids were purchased from ATCC. They include LKB1 (STK11), BC007981 (HIP human kinase collection, DF/HCC DNA Resource Core; Boston, MA); STRAD (LYK5 isoform 4), BC081911; MO25 (CAB39, calcium-binding protein 39), BC020570; SirT1, NM_019812 (Upstate). These cDNAs were subcloned by PCR to produce in-frame fusion expression plasmids. The forward cloning primers start at the ATG site, and the reverse cloning primers end at the stop codon. Each primer has a length of ∼20–25 bp and has a calculated Tm of 60 °C. The 5′-end of the forward and reverse primers also contained additional sequences (forward, GGCTTTAAAGGAACC, and reverse, AAGCTGGGTCTAGAT) so that the cloned cDNAs could undergo in vitro homologous ligation with In-Fusion system plasmids (Clontech). After 18 cycles of PCR with proofreading KOD hot start polymerase (Novagen; San Diego), the PCR product was gel-purified (Qiagen; Valencia, CA), cut with XmnI and EcoRV (Invitrogen), and ligated with the pENTR1A vector that had been cut with the same restriction endonucleases. Subsequently, these entry vectors (in which the target gene is flanked by L1 and L2 Gateway sequences) were incubated with the LR enzyme (Invitrogen) and with pDEST27 (N-terminal GST), pDEST26 (N-terminal His), or pDEST53 (N-terminal GFP) to generate fusion proteins tagged with GST, His, or GFP, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed LKB1 mutagenesis was performed by PCR. Essentially, the PCR mixture containing MgCl2, dNTP, and 10× PCR buffer was given 125 ng each of the respective forward and reverse mutation generating primers, 10 ng of template wtLKB1 pENTR vector, and 2 units of KOD proofreading DNA polymerase. The PCR was performed with the following parameters: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 18 cycles. After PCR, 20 units of DpnI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) were added to the mix and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The DpnI treatment digests only the original methylated template DNA leaving the newly synthesized unmethylated mutated DNA. The digested PCR mix was transformed into Top10 Escherichia coli. The plasmids were purified, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The following is a list of primers used to make LKB1 mutations: K44R forward, 5′-CGC CGC AAG CGG GCC AGG CTC ATC GGC AAG TAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTA CTT GCC GAT GAG CCT GGC CCG CTT GCG GCG-3′; K48R forward, 5′-GCC AAG CTC ATC GGC AGG TAC CTG ATG GGG GAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTC CCC CAT CAG GTA CCT GCC GAT GAG CTT GGC-3′; K96R forward, 5′-AAC GGG GAG GCC AAC GTG AGG AAG GAA ATT CAA CTA CTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAG TAG TTG AAT TTC CTT CCT CAC GTT GGC CTC CCC GTT-3′; K97R forward, 5′-GGG GAG GCC AAC GTG AAG AGG GAA ATT CAA CTA CTG AGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCT CAG TAG TTG AAT TTC CCT CTT CAC GTT GGC CTC CCC-3′. The SirT1 H335Y mutation was made in a similar way by using following primers: forward, 5′-C CAA AGG ATC CTT CAG TGT TAT GGT TCC TTT GCA ACA GCA TC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GA TGC TGT TGC AAA GGA ACC ATA ACA CTG AAG GAT CCT TTG G-3′. Creation of Plasmids Expressing GST Fusion LKB1 Fragment Proteins—Indicated fragments of LKB1 were made by PCR with LKB1 (BC007981) as the template and with the following primers: LKB1-(1–44) forward, 5′-CACC ATG GAG GTG GTG GAC CCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-T TCG ACC CAG ATC TA CTA CT TGG CCC GCTT GCG-3′; LKB1-(45–90) forward, 5′-CACC CTC ATC GGC AAG TAC CTG-3′, and reverse 5′-CTA GTT GGG GAT CCT TCG-3′; LKB1-(189–318) forward, 5′-CACC CTC AAA ATC TCC GAC CTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-T TCG ACC CAG ATC TA CTA TGC TTC AGC CGG AGG-3′; and LKB1-(189–433) forward, 5′-CACC CTC AAA ATC TCC GAC CTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-T TCG ACC CAG ATC TA CTA CAA CTG CTG CTT GCA GGC-3′. PCR products were gel-purified and ligated directly into pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After confirming sequences, GST fusion protein expression vectors were created by LR reaction with pDEST27 vector. Short Hairpin RNA Expressing Lentivirus—The sequence GTATTGCTGAACAGATGGAA was chosen as a potential target sequence for shRNA-mediated RNAi of human sirt1. The pSilencer 2.0 vector (Ambion; Austin, TX) was used as the template for the human U6 promoter that was cloned using the following PCR primers: forward primer (5′-GAATTCCCCAGTGGAAAGACGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAAGGG-3′). An shRNA expression cassette was created by tandem polymerase reaction of the U6 promoter template with one forward and two reverse primers as follows: forward, 5′-CACCGCGCGCCAAGGTCGGGCA-3′, and reverse 1, 5′-CTACACAAACTCCACCTGTTCAGCAATACGGTGTTTCGTCC-3′ and reverse 2 5′-CCAAAAAAGTATTGCTGAACAGATGGAACTACACAAACTC-3′, which contains two GU pairing mutations in the sense strand. The resulting PCR product was inserted into pCR8-GW-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then transferred by LR reaction to pDSL_hpUGIP shRNA lentivirus expression plasmid (ATCC). Six μg of the lentivirus plasmid was calcium phosphate-transfected along with 10 μg of pLp1(gag-pol), 3 μg of pLp2 (reverse), and 2 μg of pLP/VSVG (VSVG) helper vectors into 293T cells grown in a 100-mm dish. 24 h post-transfection the media were changed; 48 h post-transfection 10 ml of supernatant containing lentivirus was collected. The lentivirus was then purified and concentrated by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 90 min after adding 5 μl of 100 mg/ml poly-l-lysine solution. It was reconstituted with 500 μl of PBS, and 100-μl aliquots were frozen at -80 °C until use. The 293T cells or HepG2 cells grown in 6-well plates were infected by incubating each well with 100 μl of lentivirus vector and 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 8 h. And the cells were harvested 72 h later. RNAi Experiments—RNAi-mediated down-regulation of SIRT1 was performed by either siRNA (SIRT1 Smartpool siRNA and control siRNA purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO)) or lentiviral infection of house-made shRNA targeting human sirt1. The effects were assessed 72 h after induction of RNAi. Expression of Tagged Fusion Proteins in HEK293 Cells and Purification of GST-tagged Proteins—Transient transfection of plasmids containing tagged genes was performed with PerFectin transfection reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) or the calcium phosphate method in 293T cells. The indicated quantity of plasmid DNA was transfected per well of a 6-well plate. Post-transfection (48–72 h), the cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. To purify GST-tagged protein, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4 B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed four times with NETN buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 2× LDS, including 10% 0.5 m dithiothreitol. LKB1 Activity Assay—Endogenous LKB1 was immunoprecipitated with the N-19 LKB1 antibody and protein G beads. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 300 μm LKBtide (Upstate) into tubes containing the immunoprecipitated sample. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 or 20 min, supernatant was applied onto P81 paper (Whatman), and 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. GST-tagged LKB1 activities were assessed similar way on GSH beads. SIRT1 Deacetylation of LKB1 in Vitro—GST-LKB1 resuspended in 100 μl of 1× Sir2 assay buffer that came comes with the Cyclex SIRT1 deacetylase kit (CY-1151) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with recombinant SIRT1 1 μl with/without 0.2 mm NAD+. After washing with NETN buffer three times, LKB1 was eluted with 2× LDS-PAGE sample. LKB1 Immunoprecipitation to Detect Acetylation—Because the molecular weight of LKB1 is very close to that of the reduced IgG heavy chain (∼50 kDa), covalent cross-linking of the LKB1 antibody with protein A or G beads (7Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed to eliminate the IgG heavy chain from the Western blot. Briefly, 100 μg of the goat N-19 LKB1 antibody (for 293 cells), rabbit H-75 LKB1 antibody (for mouse adipose tissue), or goat M-18 LKB1 (for rat liver) antibody was incubated with 400 μl of 50% protein G or A beads in PBS pH8.2 at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing with 1 ml of PBS three times and 1 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2, the beads were resuspended with 1 ml of 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate-HCl in 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2, and incubated with mixing for 30 min at room temperature. After aspirating the solution, the beads were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, for 15 min. The cross-linked beads/antibody were washed with TBS-T three times and then resuspended with 2× diluted blocking solution (the same used for immunoblotting) at 4 °C until use. For liver, 500 μl (100 μg) of lysate was first cleared by incubating with protein A beads for 2 h and then incubated with the cross-linked LKB1 antibody overnight. For 293T cells, 300–500 μl of lysate were incubated with cross-linked LKB1 beads overnight. The immunoprecipitated beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and then eluted with 30 μl of elution buffer (Pierce) or 2× LDS sample buffer. GFP-LKB1 Localization Analysis— 0.5 μg of pDEST53-LKB1-WT (or K-mutant GFP-LKB1) alone or in combination with 0.5 μg of SIRT1 (or pDsRed-SIRT1) was transfected into 293T cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. Sixteen hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells (20–30) were randomly chosen, and their fluorescent images were captured for localization analysis of LKB1 using a CCD image camera. The average brightness of GFP of nucleus, cytoplasm, and background were assessed in NIH-image, and the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio was calculated. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—GST-LKB1 fusion proteins (∼80 kDa) were cut into small pieces and subjected to “in gel” digestion with trypsin as described previously (8Adachi T. Pimentel D.R. Heibeck T. Hou X. Lee Y.J. Jiang B. Ido Y. Cohen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29857-29862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS analyses of the digested samples were performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facilities (Boston). Experiments with Rats—Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–170 g were either starved for 48 h or starved for 48 h and refed standard chow for 24 h. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the liver was freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until used for assays. Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and LKB1 activity measurements were performed as described. All studies were done in accordance with protocols approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were done by the GLM procedure using SAS (Cary, NC). All results are expressed as means ± S.E. p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Endogenous and Exogenously Expressed LKB1 Are Acetylated, and the Levels of Acetylation Can Be Modulated by SIRT1 Function—We immunoprecipitated LKB1 from various cells and blotted it for total acetylated lysines. To eliminate the heavily acetylated 50-kDa IgG heavy chain band that runs in close proximity to LKB1, we covalently cross-linked our antibodies to protein A/G beads. When this was done, acetylation of LKB1 was clearly demonstrable in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A) in which Myc-tagged LKB1 was expressed by transient transfection and immunoprecipitated with covalently cross-linked Myc antibody. Using the same procedure, but with an LKB1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology M-18), we also observed acetylation of LKB1 in white adipose tissue of the mouse (supplemental Fig. S1) and in mouse testis. Thus, LKB1 was acetylated both in cultured 293T cells and in vivo. To investigate the effect of SIRT1 on LKB1 acetylation status, GST-tagged LKB1 was expressed together with wild type SIRT1 and catalytically inactive H355Y SIRT1 in 293T cells. Wild type SIRT1 diminished LKB1 acetylation by 50%, whereas H355Y SIRT1 caused a 3-fold increase in its acetylation (Fig. 1B). Similarly, SIRT1 knockdown by shRNA caused a 5.5-fold increase in LKB1 acetylation, and incubation with 50–100 μm resveratrol, a putative Sir2 activator (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Sci. Am. 2006; 294 (54-47): 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), for 0.5–1 h decreased its acetylation by 60% (Fig. 1B). Direct deacetylation of LKB1 by SIRT1 was also observed in a cell-free system in which isolated GST tagged LKB1 was co-incubated with SIRT1 and its substrate NAD+ (Fig. 1C). Acetylation was not observed with GST tag alone or with the control protein, GST-glucuronidase, suggesting that acetylation was exclusively on LKB1 protein. These results strongly suggest that SIRT1 can modulate LKB1 acetylation. SIRT1 Affects LKB1 Binding to STRAD and Its Activity and Phosphorylation—Transient transfection of wild type (WT) SIRT1 in 293T cells increases both STRAD binding to LKB1 (Fig. 1D) and endogenous LKB1 activity, neither of which were observed when the catalytically inactive SIRT1 H355Y mutant was used (Fig. 1E). Conversely, STRAD binding to LKB1 was diminished in cells infected with SIRT1 shRNA (Fig. 1D). Overexpression of WT SIRT1 also increased LKB1 phosphorylation at both Ser-428 and Thr-336 (Fig. 1F), indicative of LKB1 activation as will be discussed later. Changes in the protein abundance of LKB1, STRAD, MO25, and AMPK-α were not observed in these experiments (data not shown). Lys-48 Is a Key Lysine at Which SIRT1 Modulates LKB1 Functions—To determine which of the acetylated lysine residues (AcK) on LKB1 play a role in the regulation of its activity, GST-tagged LKB1 was expressed in 293T cells and subjected to MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/mass spectrometry to determine its acetylation sites. As shown in Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2, at least 9 lysines are acetylated over the three domains (N- and C-terminal regulatory and catalytic) of LKB1. Interaction analysis between a series of LKB1 fragments and SIRT1 revealed that SIRT1 associates with LKB1 on the N-terminal side of its catalytic domain (amino acids 45–90) (Fig. 2B). This association was specific, because no binding was observed between SIRT1 and a negative control protein (GST-glucuronidase). In separate experiments, we also observed an association of endogenous LKB1 and SIRT1 in 293T cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Based on these findings, we created a series of LKB1 point mutants in which specific lysines in the N-terminal catalytic domain were converted to arginine, a change that mimics to some extent the effects of a deacetylated lysine (9Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Science. 1990; 247: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Mutations were created at Lys-44, Lys-48, Lys-96, and Lys-97 in GST fusion protein expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2C, in the 293T cells, only the K48R mutant demonstrated increased phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-428 and Thr-336, as would be predicted if Lys-48 deacetylation was an early event in LKB1 activation. The K48R mutant of LKB1 also caused more AMPK phosphorylation under basal conditions and, as expected, because it lacked lysine at position 48, it was less sensitive to SIRT1 overexpression (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, LKB1 activity of the Lys-48 mutant was 2-fold higher than that of WT LKB1 when not stimulated by SIRT1 (Fig. 2E). In keeping with the importance of Lys-48 deacetylation in mediating the action of SIRT1, we also found that it was deacetylated in cells incubated with resveratrol (supplemental Fig. S2B). Cytosolic Localization of LKB1 Is Increased by Both SIRT1 Overexpression and K48R Mutation of LKB1—To examine further the role of Lys-48, we transfected K48R GFP fusion proteins and compared their localization to that of WT LKB1. The studies were done both under basal conditions and after overexpressing SIRT1. Overexpression of SIRT1 significantly increased the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of WT LKB1. In contrast, the K48R LKB1 mutant was initially more prominent in the cytoplasm, and this was not further altered by exogenous SIRT1 (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, increased cytoplasmic localization of both WT LKB1 and especially the K48R mutant was observed when STRAD was exogenously expressed, suggesting that STRAD levels maybe rate-limiting in these cells (supplemental Fig. S4). The distribution of the negative control K48Q mutant was similar to that of control cells under basal conditions, but, like the latter, it was not affected by exogenous SIRT1. Taken together, these results indicate that deacetylation at Lys-48 is a key event in SIRT1-mediated LKB1 activation, phosphorylation, and cytosolic relocation. SIRT1 Modulates LKB1-induced Phosphorylation of Its Downstream Targets—Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 was increased by overexpression of WT SIRT1 (Fig. 3A), and conversely, transfection of siRNA for SIRT1 down-regulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found that the phosphorylation of another LKB1 target, MARK1, was down-regulated by SIRT1 knockdown in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3C). LKB1 Deacetylation and Activity in Rat Liver Are Increased by Starvation—LKB1 activity was 33% higher (Fig. 4A), and its total acetylation was 60% lower (Fig. 4B) in the liver of rats starved for 48 h than in the liver of starved-refed rats. Furthermore, this increase in LKB1 activity was associated with a greater than 2-fold increase in pAMPK (Fig. 4C) and pACC (not shown) as described previously (10Assifi M.M. Suchankova G. Constant S. Prentki M. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. Metab. 2005; 289: E794-E800Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The principal new findings of this study are that LKB1 can be deacetylated by SIRT1 and that in HEK293T cells such deacetylation correlates with increases in LKB1 activity, cytoplasmic localization, and binding to STRAD, and AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. In contrast, down-regulation of SIRT1 with RNAi diminished LKB1 binding to STRAD and the phosphorylation (activity) of both AMPK and another LKB1 target, MARK1. We also found that similar increases in LKB1 deacetylation and activity and AMPK activation occur in rat liver in vivo during starvation, a state in which activation of SIRT1 has been described previously (6Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Finally, we observed LKB1 acetylation in adipose tissue and testis (not shown) suggesting that acetylation and deacetylation are likely regulated in many organs. To our knowledge, these observations represent the first evidence that changes in the acetylation and deacetylation of LKB1 are mediated by SIRT1 and that they can affect its activity and secondarily that of AMPK. A schema describing the proposed mechanism by which SIRT1 activates LKB1 and secondarily AMPK and MARK1 is depicted in Fig. 5. How LKB1 deacetylation leads to its activation is incompletely understood. LKB1 exists in both the nucleus and cytosol of various cells, and its activation and movement to the cytosol take place when it binds to STRAD and/or MO25 and forms a complex that appears to be constitutively active (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We found that the deacetylation of LKB1 is associated with 2–3-fold increases in its activity, cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio, and its binding to endogenous STRAD. Experiments with 293T cells containing point mutations of lysine to arginine (which mimic the effects of deacetylation) strongly suggested that Lys-48 is a major site that mediates these events. However, the fact that SIRT1 overexpression or mutation of Lys-48 to arginine did not result in total movement of LKB1 to the cytoplasm suggests that Lys-48 deacetylation is not the sole factor governing LKB1 distribution. Because expression of exogenous STRAD enhanced the cytoplasmic localization of WT LKB1 and especially the K48R LKB1 mutant, STRAD levels appear to be rate-limiting for this process. Studies to determine the relationship between Lys-48 acetylation and the STRAD shuttling mechanism that has been reported to control LKB1 movement into and out of the nucleus (11Dorfman J. Macara I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) will clearly be needed. Phosphorylation at Ser-428 (Ser-431 in the mouse) on LKB1 by protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase Cζ and autophosphorylation at Thr-336, both of which occur after LKB1 is activated (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), were used as markers of LKB1 activation in the present study. Phosphorylation at these sites is not needed for LKB1 kinase activation (1Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar); indeed, the splice variant of mouse LKB1 (accession number EU730638) that lacks the Ser-431 sequence is catalytically active and able to phosphorylate AMPK. 3F. Lan, J. M. Cacicedo, N. Ruderman, and Y. Ido, unpublished data. Finally, the physiological significance of each of these phosphorylation events is incompletely understood, although Ser-428 phosphorylation has been linked to such events as tumor suppression (12Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and the cellular localization and activation of AMPK (14Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that SIRT1 knockdown diminishes AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B); however, it has been reported that cells from SIRT1 knock-out mice show either no change (15Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or an increase in AMPK activity (16Lee I.H. Cao L. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Liu J. Bruns N.E. Tsokos M. Alt F.W. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3374-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is unlikely because of an off-target effect associated with RNAi, because we employed two different RNAi preparations, and both gave the same result. A more likely explanation is that an overall low energy state observed in SIRT1 knock-out cells (16Lee I.H. Cao L. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Liu J. Bruns N.E. Tsokos M. Alt F.W. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3374-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) overcomes the effect of LKB1 acetylation. In support of this possibility, it has been reported that SIRT1 knock-out is associated with constitutively high UCP2 expression and a low rate of ATP production by mitochondria (17Bordone L. Motta M.C. Picard F. Robinson A. Jhala U.S. Apfeld J. McDonagh T. Lemieux M. McBurney M. Szilvasi A. Easlon E.J. Lin S.J. Guarente L. Plos Biol. 2006; 4: e31Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed RNAi-mediated down-regulation of SIRT1, and no change in ATP and ADP levels was observed within 72 h, suggesting that the cells were less energy-stressed. This study focused on SIRT1 and its ability to deacetylate LKB1. Whether other sirtuins or class I or II histone deacetylases have a similar effect is not known. In support of this notion, these deacetylases and SIRT1 appear to target some proteins as common substrates. For example, FOXO1 is deacetylated by both SIRT1 (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Sci. Am. 2006; 294 (54-47): 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and SIRT2 (18Jing E. Gesta S. Kahn C.R. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that in some cells sirtuins other than SIRT1 produce the changes in LKB1 described here. In this regard, Dasgupta and Milbrandt (15Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that resveratrol can activate AMPK in neuronal cells and that LKB1 is required for this to occur even when SIRT1 is absent. The possibility that another sirtuin replaces SIRT1 in activating LKB1 in these cells has not been specifically examined; however, resveratrol has been reported to activate SIRT2 in neuronal cells (19Suzuki K. Koike T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To date, studies to determine whether LKB1 activation mediates increases in AMPK activity have principally been carried out in cardiac or skeletal muscle during ischemia, contraction, or chemical stimulation with phenformin or 5-aminomidazole-4-carboxamido-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). The observation that LKB1 activity was not changed in these situations led to the view that it is constitutively active (20Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Scott J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 7-15Crossref Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that these effects may be tissue-specific. Thus, we found that in rat liver, LKB1 activity and acetylation status could be modulated by physiological stimuli (i.e. starvation and starvation-refeeding). Although a causal role of SIRT1 in mediating these events needs to be evaluated in mice with an acute knockdown of SIRT1, our findings suggest that during starvation, a condition associated with increased hepatic SIRT1 activity (6Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), deacetylation of LKB1 may be a key regulator of the LKB1-AMPK cascade. The reason for the apparently differing mechanisms for LKB1 activation in muscle and liver is unclear. Recently, it has been reported that AMPK activation by polyphenols requires both SIRT1 and LKB1 in HepG2 cells and mouse liver (21Hou X. Xu S. Maitland-Toolan K.A. Sato K. Jiang B. Ido Y. Lan F. Walsh K. Wierzbicki M. Verbeuren T.J. Cohen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20015-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The results of this study provide a possible molecular mechanism for this observation, namely that SIRT1, by causing the deacetylation of LKB1, leads to its activation and that of AMPK. As already noted whether this mechanism is tissue-specific will require further studies as will the identification of the situations in which it operates in vivo.

We recruited 55 individuals afflicted with borderline personality disorder (BPD) to play a multiround economic exchange game with healthy partners. Behaviorally, individuals with BPD showed a profound incapacity to maintain cooperation, and were impaired in their ability to repair broken cooperation on the basis of a quantitative measure of coaxing. Neurally, activity in the anterior insula, a region known to respond to norm violations across affective, interoceptive, economic, and social dimensions, strongly differentiated healthy participants from individuals with BPD. Healthy subjects showed a strong linear relation between anterior insula response and both magnitude of monetary offer received from their partner (input) and the amount of money repaid to their partner (output). In stark contrast, activity in the anterior insula of BPD participants was related only to the magnitude of repayment sent back to their partner (output), not to the magnitude of offers received (input). These neural and behavioral data suggest that norms used in perception of social gestures are pathologically perturbed or missing altogether among individuals with BPD.

https://openalex.org/W2079319844,"During intracellular membrane trafficking and remodeling, protein complexes known as the ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) interact with membranes and are required for budding processes directed away from the cytosol, including the budding of intralumenal vesicles to form multivesicular bodies; for the budding of some enveloped viruses; and for daughter cell scission in cytokinesis. We found that the ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2A and CHMP3 (charged multivesicular body proteins 2A and 3) could assemble in vitro into helical tubular structures that expose their membrane interaction sites on the outside of the tubule, whereas the AAA-type adenosine triphosphatase VPS4 could bind on the inside of the tubule and disassemble the tubes upon adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis.

Composed of a dynamically sulfated heparan sulfate (HS) polymer and a protein backbone, HSPGs can be divided into three functionally distinct families: the transmembrane syndecans, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glypicans, and the ECM-associated proteoglycans perlecan, agrin, and collagen XVIII (2Bulow H.E. Hobert O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 375-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A major function of the HS component of HSPGs is to act as a regulatory cofactor for a variety of signaling molecules and morphogens (3Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

HSPG biosynthesis is a non-template-driven process, relying on multiple enzyme activities to generate a glycosaminoglycan polymer with distinct sulfation patterns attached to a protein core. Synthesis begins with the attachment of a tetrasaccharide linker sequence onto a target serine residue, followed by polymerization of alternating GlcA and GlcNAc residues up to 200 disaccharides in length. Once synthesized, the diversity of HS structure is generated by a variety of heparan-modifying enzymes in the Golgi, which epimerize a portion of the GlcA residues to iduronic acid and add sulfate to some of the 2-O-positions of the hexuronic acid (UA) and N- and 6-O-positions of GlcNAc (9Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Importantly, the cumulative action of these biosynthetic enzymes is incomplete, generating a defined HS domain structure composed of highly (S-domains), partially (transition zones), and nonsulfated regions (10Maccarana M.

These patterns of sulfation are cell type- and developmental stage-specific (11Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol.

In order to understand the biological significance of these enzymes during mammalian development, knock-out mouse models were generated and subsequently characterized. Although loss of Sulf1 or Sulf2 was shown to result in relatively mild phenotypes variably affecting lung development as well as growth and viability, the loss of both Sulfs resulted in severe developmental ablations and early post-natal lethality (21Ai X.

Dyn. 2008; 237: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These phenotypic observations, in conjunction with previous analyses of HS material from Sulf knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), support the idea that the Sulfs act cooperatively in vivo to modify HS sulfation patterns and regulate developmental processes (26Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T. Merry C.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite the biological importance of the Sulfs, much remains to be learned about the endogenous activity and HSPG substrate specificity of these enzymes. Indeed, primary Sulf knock-out MEFs have been shown to exhibit changes in multiple sulfate groups not accounted for by in vitro Sulf activity assays employing heparin substrate analogs (15Morimoto-Tomita M.

Further, inconsistent results regarding the ability of the Sulfs to modify HSPG substrates within the ECM have been reported (28Dai Y. Yang Y. MacLeod V. Yue X. Rapraeger A.C. Shriver Z.

To address these issues, in vitro activity analysis using native HS substrates was carried out in conjunction with the characterization of cell surface, GPI-anchored, shed, and ECM-associated HSPGs from immortalized WT and Sulf knock-out cell lines. These studies demonstrate a highly restricted 6-O-sulfate substrate specificity for the Sulfs in vitro, which was contrasted by dynamic effects of Sulf loss on N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated moieties in vivo. This comparative analysis implicates that, in addition to their 6-O-endosulfatase activity, Sulf1 and Sulf2 are able to dynamically modulate the abundance of nonsubstrate N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups on proteoglycans throughout the cell surface and the ECM by influencing the HS biosynthetic machinery. In support of this novel observation, real time PCR expression analysis was able to verify a significant impact of Sulf loss on the abundance of HS sulfotransferase transcripts. Finally, the modulation of HS sulfation patterns resulting from Sulf deficiency observed in this study was shown to elicit significant effects on FGF signaling, underlining the importance of these enzymes in regulating cellular response.

MEF Immortalization and Radioactive Labeling of HS Chains—Generation of Sulf knock-out mice has been described previously (26Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T. Merry C.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MEF cultures of WT, Sulf1-/-, Sulf2-/-, or Sulf1-/-/Sulf2-/- genotypes (embryonic day 12.5) were immortalized via stable transfection with the pMSSVLT vector containing the SV40 large T gene (30Schuermann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4945-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For radioactive labeling, immortalized MEF cell lines were cultured in d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (50 μCi/ml) and Na2[35S]O4 (50 μCi/ml) for 48 h, as previously described (31Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), prior to the proteoglycan fractionation described below. Cell Surface and Shed Proteoglycan Fractionation—Conditioned medium was collected after 48 h, cleared of cellular debris via centrifugation, and pooled as the shed proteoglycan fraction. Cells were subsequently washed twice in PBS and treated for 10 min with trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Cells were pelleted and washed twice in HEPES, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and supernatant samples were pooled together as the cell surface proteoglycan fraction. GPI-anchored Proteoglycan Fractionation—The protocol for GPI-anchored glypican enrichment and purification was based on the protocol of Tumova et al. (32Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9410-9417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing 0.067 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Supernatant was collected, and cells were washed twice with 10 mm HEPES, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. These wash fractions were pooled with the supernatant as the glypican proteoglycan fraction. ECM Proteoglycan Fractionation—MEF cell lines were plated onto 15-cm sterile glass Petri dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml laminin (Sigma). Lipid extraction was carried out based on previous experiments by Heremans et al. (33Heremans A. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4731-4739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, washed three times for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and washed three times for 10 min with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The matrix that remained attached to the glass plates was stringently washed three times with 0.2 m Tris, 2 m NaCl, pH 8.0, before finally being washed three times with 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0. ECM was harvested in PBS containing collagenase II (10 units/ml) (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Disaccharide Composition Analysis—Purified HS chains were digested with a combination of heparinases I, II, and III, and the resultant disaccharides were identified following strong anion exchange-HPLC as previously described (31Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Proteoglycan Profiling—Cells were grown to 100% confluence on a 10-cm plate and were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Cells were homogenized manually with a Dounce homogenizer. Cellular debris was cleared by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fraction. Cell membranes were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES containing 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the Triton-soluble supernatant was collected, diluted to 0.1% Triton with 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, and digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 mIU heparinase II and 2 mIU heparinase III. GPI-anchored Proteoglycan Profiling—Cells were grown to 100% confluence on a 10-cm plate, and GPI-anchored glypican was extracted as described above. Following PI-PLC treatment, conditioned medium was bound to a 1-ml HiTrap DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare), washed with 20 ml of PBS, and eluted with PBS containing 1.5 m NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, and digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 mIU heparinase II and 2 mIU heparinase III. Shed Proteoglycan Profiling—Cells were grown to 100% confluence on a 10-cm plate, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Conditioned medium was bound to a 1-ml HiTrap DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare), washed with 50 ml of PBS, and eluted with PBS containing 1.5 m NaCl. Samples were dialyzed and digested with heparinases II and III, as described above. ECM Proteoglycan Profiling—Confluent cells plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well dish were treated for 2 h with 2 mIU heparinase II and 2 mIU heparinase III in serum-free DMEM followed by ECM extraction, as described above. ECM composition was analyzed via immunofluorescence microscopy according to a standard fixation and staining protocol as previously described (34Frese M.A. Schulz S. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11388-11395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ECM was scraped from the glass coverslips for Western blotting. Cloning of Human Sulf1 and Sulf2 cDNAs and Construction of Expression Vectors—A 5′-truncated Sulf2 cDNA, designated KIAA1247 (35Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was obtained from the Kazusa Institute (Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan). Using primer 1247_His, a RGS-His6 tag-encoding sequence, followed by a HindIII site, was added to the 3′-end of the coding region by PCR (for PCR primers, see Table S1). The product was subcloned as a 1.8-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment into vector pMPSVEH (36Artelt P. Morelle C. Ausmeier M. Fitzek M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The lacking 5′ region of the Sulf2 cDNA was obtained through rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). As gene-specific noncoding primers, 1247_SP3 and, for nested PCR, 1247_SP4 were used. From the obtained 1.0-kb product (Sulf2-N), the 5′-untranslated region was deleted by adding a 5′-NcoI site at the position of the start codon (primer 1247_NcoI), which allowed fusion with the optimized Kozak sequence of a pMPSVEH-based arylsulfatase A expression vector described earlier (37Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Full-length Sulf2-RGS-His6-encoding cDNA was obtained by joining the 5′ and 3′ fragments via the internal EcoRI site, which was amplified also with the rapid amplification of cDNA ends product. For construction of the pCI-neo-based expression vector, the 3′ Sulf2-RGS-His6 fragment was cloned first as an EcoRI/HindIII fragment (blunted at the HindIII end) into pCI-neo (Promega), which had been opened by EcoRI and SmaI, and then assembled with the 5′ EcoRI/EcoRI fragment excised from the pMPSV-Kozak-Sulf2-N construct. Cloning of Sulf1 cDNA also started from a 5′-truncated EST fragment (KIAA1077), which was obtained from the Kazusa Institute (38Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using primer 1077_His, an RGS-His6 tag encoding sequence was added to the 3′-end of the coding region, followed by an MscI site. The obtained 2.3-kb product (Sulf1-C) was subcloned as an AccI/MscI fragment. The lacking 5′ region of Sulf1 cDNA was obtained through rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR using the gene-specific noncoding primer 1077_SP3. From the obtained 0.4-kb Sulf1-N product, the 5′-untranslated region was deleted by adding a 5′ NcoI site at the position of the start codon (primer 1077_NcoI), which allowed generation of an optimized Kozak sequence (as above). Full-length Sulf1-RGS-His6-encoding cDNA was obtained by joining 5′ and 3′ fragments via the internal AccI site. For that purpose, Kozak-Sulf1-N was cloned as an EcoRI/AccI fragment into the MCS of pCI-neo and then assembled with Sulf1-C as an AccI/AccI fragment. Full-length sequencing resulted in the same coding sequences for both Sulf1 and Sulf2 as published by Morimoto-Tomita et al. (15Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To generate plasmids with Sulf cDNAs encoding enzymatically inactive Sulf1-C87A/C88A or Sulf2-C88A/C89A mutants, the QuikChange method (Stratagene) was applied, using complementary mutagenesis primers Sulf1CA or Sulf2CA (each forward and reverse), respectively (for PCR primers see Table S2). Expression and Localization Analysis of Human Sulfs in HT1080 Cells—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were transfected with pCI-neo plasmids containing wild type or mutant Sulf cDNAs using magnet-assisted transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). Stable clones were selected with 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate (PAA Laboratories), and drug-resistant cells were cloned and expanded. Sulf expression in total lysates was analyzed by lysing cells with gentle sonification in 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and Western blotting using anti-RGS-His6 antibodies. Detergent solubility was tested by lysing cells manually with a cell Dounce homogenizer in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, centrifuging 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and subsequently centrifuging the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to isolate the membrane fraction. Membranes were treated with 1 or 2.5% Triton X-100 or Brij98 on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions. For detection of secreted Sulfs in Western blots, confluent Sulf-expressing cell lines were cultivated for 72 h in serum-free DMEM prior to 100× concentration of conditioned medium using Centricon-30 units (Millipore), as previously described (15Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of permeabilized HT1080 cells expressing Sulf1 or Sulf2 was performed as previously described (34Frese M.A. Schulz S. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11388-11395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but without LysoTracker treatment. Alternatively, live cells were stained to specifically label cell surface-localized proteins. Sulf-expressing HT1080 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-RGS-His6 antibodies in serum-free DMEM, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 2% fetal calf serum, the cells were labeled with an Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) and imaged as previously described (34Frese M.A. Schulz S. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11388-11395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In Vitro Sulf Activity Analysis—For in vitro analysis of Sulf activity from cell lysates, Sulf-expressing cells were harvested, pelleted, and lysed with gentle sonification in 20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Cleared cell lysate was added to 100 μl of nickel-Sepharose and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Nickel beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and finally twice in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, activity buffer. Nickel-bound Sulfs were incubated overnight at 37 °C in activity buffer containing 200,000 3H cpm of purified HS isolated from Sulf1/2 double knock-out MEFs. For analysis of secreted Sulf activity, cells were cultivated in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for 72 h prior to (NH4)2SO4 precipitation of conditioned medium. Medium precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed against activity buffer. The sample volume of the dialyzed material was reduced to 10% of the starting volume using a SpeedVac and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200,000 3H cpm of purified HS as above. HS was rebound on 500 μl of DEAE resin and washed with 20 ml of PBS to remove excess proteins prior to elution with 1.5 m NaCl. HS samples were desalted on PD10 columns (GE Healthcare), and disaccharide compositions were analyzed as previously described (31Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from MEF cell lines using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Synthesis of first-strand cDNA from mRNA transcripts was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was carried out using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master (Plus) SYBR Green I Kit and the LightCycler instrument (both from Roche Applied Science). The conditions for denaturation, annealing, and extension were repeated 45 times as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 61 °C for 5 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. All reactions were performed in triplicates. Real time PCR primers are listed in Table S3. Primer specificities were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify amplification of single products of the expected sizes and by melting curve analysis. cDNA dilution series were performed to calculate PCR primer efficiencies. Efficiencies were 90–100% for all primer sets used. Relative quantification of transcripts was carried out according to Pfaffl (39Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar) with data normalized to the housekeeping gene Rpl13a. FACS Analysis—Cells were grown to 100% confluence, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 2 h"
https://openalex.org/W2073326545,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondria as a side product of electron and proton transport through the inner membrane is important for normal cell operation as well as development of pathology. Matrix and cytosol alkalization stabilizes semiquinone radical, a potential superoxide producer, and we hypothesized that proton deficiency under the excess of electron donors enhances reactive oxygen species generation. We tested this hypothesis by measuring pH dependence of reactive oxygen species released by mitochondria. The experiments were performed in the media with pH varying from 6 to 8 in the presence of complex II substrate succinate or under more physiological conditions with complex I substrates glutamate and malate. Matrix pH was manipulated by inorganic phosphate, nigericine, and low concentrations of uncoupler or valinomycin. We found that high pH strongly increased the rate of free radical generation in all of the conditions studied, even when DeltapH=0 in the presence of nigericin. In the absence of inorganic phosphate, when the matrix was the most alkaline, pH shift in the medium above 7 induced permeability transition accompanied by the decrease of ROS production. ROS production increase induced by the alkalization of medium was observed with intact respiring mitochondria as well as in the presence of complex I inhibitor rotenone, which enhanced reactive oxygen species release. The phenomena revealed in this report are important for understanding mechanisms governing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, in particular that related with uncoupling proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2022532021,"Transcription factors of the Sp/Klf (Krüppel-like factor) family regulate biological processes such as hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, and stem cell maintenance. Here we show that Bklf or Klf3 (Basic Krüppel-like factor) represses the Klf8 (Krüppel-like Factor 8) gene in vivo. Conversely, Eklf or Klf1 (Erythroid Krüppel-like factor) activates the Klf8 gene. Klf8 is driven by two promoters, both of which contain multiple CACCC sites. Klf3 can repress Klf1-mediated activation of both promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that Klf3 occupies both Klf8 promoters in vivo. Interestingly, in Klf3 knock-out tissue Klf1 gains access, binds, and activates both Klf8 promoters. These results demonstrate direct competition between activating and repressing Klfs in vivo. Together with previous evidence that Klf1 directly activates the Klf3 gene, the results reveal an elaborate network of cross-talk within the Klf family. The recognition of cross-regulation and potential redundancy between Klf family members is critical to the interpretation of various Klf knock-out mice and the understanding of individual Klfs in particular contexts.

The recognition of cross-regulation and potential redundancy between Klf family members is critical to the interpretation of various Klf knock-out mice and the understanding of individual Klfs in particular contexts. The Klf (Krüppel-like factor) family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins bind GC-rich regions and related CACCC sequences in DNA (1.Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Klf family members contain three conserved DNA-binding C2H2 zinc fingers that recognize similar consensus sites (2.Pearson R. Fleetwood J. Eaton S. Crossley M. Bao S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of the various Klfs vary, and these different domains mediate different molecular functions. Some Klfs function predominantly as activators, such as Eklf/Klf1 (erythroid Klf) (3.Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). A number of additional Klf1 target genes have been recently identified such as Ahsp (α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein) (21.Keys J.R. Tallack M.R. Hodge D.J. Cridland S.O. David R. Perkins A.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 136: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and dematin (22.Hodge D. Coghill E. Keys J. Maguire T. Hartmann B. McDowall A. Weiss M. Grimmond S. Perkins A. Blood. 2006; 107: 3359-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a cytoskeletal protein required for erythrocyte membrane integrity. These were validated as direct Klf1 target genes through the use of a Klf1 knock-out erythroid cell line, B1.6, rescued by an inducible form of Klf1 (23.Coghill E. Eccleston S. Fox V. Cerruti L. Brown C. Cunningham J. Jane S. Perkins A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The B1.6 cells have also been used to identify another direct Klf1 target gene, Bklf/Klf3 (24.Funnell A.P. Maloney C.A. Thompson L.J. Keys J. Tallack M. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2777-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Bklf (now known as Klf3) was originally identified through a low stringency cDNA screen using the zinc fingers of Klf1 as a probe (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Klf3 is widely expressed but is particularly abundant in erythroid tissues (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Klf3 has been demonstrated to act as a potent transcriptional repressor that recruits the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to mediate gene repression (4.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A critical PVDLT motif in the N-terminal repression domain of Klf3 directly contacts CtBP. Mutation of this motif dramatically reduces Klf3-mediated repression (4.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here we have used microarrays to compare wild type and Klf3 knock-out fetal liver mRNA in order to identify Klf3 target genes. Klf8 was identified as a gene potentially repressed by Klf3. Klf8 is also a member of the Klf family. It is closely related to Klf3, with the zinc fingers of Klf3 and Klf8 showing 96% homology. Like Klf3, Klf8 binds strongly to CACCC boxes in vitro and is widely expressed (7.van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Klf8 also acts as a transcriptional repressor and interacts with the co-repressor CtBP through a PVDLS motif (7.van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There are two reports implicating Klf8 in γ-globin gene repression (25.Zhang P. Basu P. Redmond L.C. Morris P.E. Rupon J.W. Ginder G.D. Lloyd J.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2005; 35: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Hu J.H. Navas P. Cao H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Song C.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Klf8 has also been implicated in cell cycle progression and has been shown to be a downstream target of the cell cycle regulator focal adhesion kinase (27.Zhao J. Bian Z.C. Yee K. Chen B.P.C. Chien S. Guan J.-L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1503-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been found to be up-regulated in a number of human cancer cells and primary tumor tissues, and induction of Klf8 in NIH3T3 cells results in accelerated cell growth (28.Wang X. Zhao J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Klf8 can induce motility and invasiveness in normal epithelial cell lines through regulation of the E-cadherin gene (29.Wang X. Zheng M. Liu G. Xia W. McKeown-Longo P.J. Hung M.C. Zhao J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7184-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Klf8 has also been implicated in the repression of Klf4 (30.Wei H. Wang X. Gan B. Urvalek A.M. Melkoumian Z.K. Guan J.-L. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16664-16671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a gene that has a well documented role in cell cycle control (31.Ghaleb A.M. Nandan M.O. Chanchevalap S. Dalton W.B. Hisamuddin I.M. Yang V.W. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) as well as being one of the four transcription factors that can reprogram mouse fibroblasts to embryonic stem cells (18.Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18206) Google Scholar). Here we report that Klf8 is repressed by Klf3 in vivo and is up-regulated by Klf1. Transcript analysis indicates that Klf8 has two promoters, both containing multiple CACCC elements. Transactivation assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Klf3 represses Klf8 directly and that Klf1 activates Klf8 directly. Interestingly it appears that the activating and repressing Klfs, Klf1 and Klf3, respectively, compete for binding sites in the Klf8 promoters and that in the presence of Klf3, there is little Klf1 occupancy at either Klf8 promoter in vivo. Accordingly, Klf8 levels are low in normal erythroid tissues but high in erythroid cells from Klf3 knock-out mice. Genotyping—Genotyping of the Klf3-null, heterozygous, and wild type mice was performed by PCR of both Klf3 (primers 5′-AAATGCACCTGGGAAGGCTGCAC-3′ (forward), 5′-CAGACTAGCATGTGGCGTTTCCTG-3′ (reverse)) and Neo (primers 5′-TGATGCAATGCGGCGGCTGCATAC-3′ (forward), 5′-CAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGGCGA-3′ (reverse)). RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from freshly homogenized E14.5 fetal livers, CD71hi/TER-119hi sorted E15.5 fetal liver cells, Ctbp–/– and Ctbp+/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), or B1.6 (23.Coghill E. Eccleston S. Fox V. Cerruti L. Brown C. Cunningham J. Jane S. Perkins A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) cell lines as described previously (24.Funnell A.P. Maloney C.A. Thompson L.J. Keys J. Tallack M. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2777-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Total RNA from Klf3–/– and Klf3+/+ E14.5 fetal livers were hybridized to an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) mouse genome survey microarray, and the arrays were scanned using the Applied Biosystems AB1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray analyzer at Human Genetic Signatures (Macquarie Park, Australia). Real Time RT-PCR—Extracted RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis which was then used for quantitative real time RT-PCR as described previously (24.Funnell A.P. Maloney C.A. Thompson L.J. Keys J. Tallack M. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2777-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR Primers—Paired primers were designed as described previously (24.Funnell A.P. Maloney C.A. Thompson L.J. Keys J. Tallack M. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Mol.

Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—E15.5 fetal liver cells were stained with anti-CD71-PE and anti-TER-119 PE-Cy7 antibodies (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). CD71hi/TER-119hi cells were then purified by FACSAria sorting (BD Biosciences). Antibody Generation—Anti-Klf1 and anti-Klf3 antibodies have been described previously (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding full-length mKlf8 was amplified from 450 ng of heart cDNA by PCR using the primers 5′-ATTACTCGAGCAGTGGCTTGGAAAGTCAGATAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTAGAATTCCAGCGTGCCTGCTGTG-3′ (reverse) and was cloned into EcoRI/XhoI pMT3 to form pMT3-mKlf8. cDNA encoding residues 1–260 of mKlf8 was amplified from pMT3-mKlf8 by PCR using the primers 5′-ATTAGGATCCATGGATAAATTCATAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTAGAATTCCTCTTCTCCCTGCATGTGGAC-3′ (reverse), and the product was cloned in frame downstream of GST in the bacterial expression vector BamHI/EcoRI pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The GST-mKlf8 fusion protein was overexpressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione beads as described previously (32.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Rabbits were inoculated with GST-mKlf8 protein, and serum was collected by the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (Adelaide, Australia). Western Blotting—Western blot assays were performed to assess the relative levels of Klf8 in nuclear extracts from B1.6 cells and E14.5 fetal livers as has been described previously for other proteins (33.Perdomo J. Verger A. Turner J. Crossley M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After analysis with anti-Klf8 antibody, the membrane was stripped in a solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol at 70 °C for 30 min. It was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in several changes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 and was then probed with an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) as a loading control as described above. EMSAs—Nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSAs were carried out as described previously (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) When detecting Klf8, equal quantities of nuclear extracts were loaded in a total volume of 30 μl containing 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 4.4 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.07 mm EDTA, 6.67% glycerol, 1.33 mm MnCl2, 3.33 mm NaCl, 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3.33 μm EGTA, 0.007% Brij35, 1 μl of preimmune serum or antibody (as appropriate) and radiolabeled probe.

Ctbp1–/–Ctbp2–/– MEFs were infected with pMSCV-puro-FLAGmCtbp2 and selected in puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 5 days. Resistant cells were pooled, and expression of FLAG-tagged mCtbp2 was assayed by Western blotting. For translation inhibition analyses, cycloheximide (made up in ethanol) was added as described previously (24.Funnell A.P. Maloney C.A. Thompson L.J. Keys J. Tallack M. Perkins A.C. Crossley M. Mol.

Zero or 1000 ng of pPac-Eklf and 0, 10, 100, or 1000 ng of pPac-Bklf were transfected along with 1 μg of pGL4.10[luc2], pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1(–83 + 38), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1a(–350 + 38), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1a(–700 + 38), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1a(–990 + 38), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1c(–60 + 52), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1c(–127 + 52), pGL4.10[luc2]-Klf8prom1c(–241 + 52), or pGL4. 10[luc2]-Klf8prom1c(–353 + 52). For all transfections, 1 μg of pGL4.74[hRluc/TK] (Promega) was included as a transfection control. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity by using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, reporter activity was normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase levels. Klf8 Is De-repressed in the Absence of Klf3—To identify Klf3 target genes, microarray analysis comparing Klf3+/+ and Klf3–/– E14.5 fetal liver mRNA was undertaken. The fetal liver was chosen as a target tissue because Klf3 is highly abundant in this tissue (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Klf8 mRNA was found to be significantly up-regulated (more than 10-fold) in the Klf3–/– samples. This result was confirmed by real time RT-PCR. Analysis of Klf8 mRNA in Klf3+/+, Klf3+/–, and Klf3–/– E14.5 fetal livers by real time RT-PCR showed that Klf8 is de-repressed in the absence of Klf3 (Fig. 1A). mRNA from Klf3+/– and Klf3–/– CD71hi/TER-119hi sorted fetal liver cells was also analyzed using real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). A highly significant de-repression of Klf8 was observed in the absence of Klf3 in these sorted erythroid cells (50-fold increase in expression in Klf3–/– erythroid cells compared with 10-fold in unsorted fetal liver cells). We wished to determine whether up-regulation of Klf8 also occurred at the protein level in Klf3–/– animals. Western blotting revealed that Klf8 protein levels were elevated ∼5-fold in the absence of Klf3 in E14.5 fetal livers (Fig. 1C). Both Klf3 and Klf8 have been previously shown to bind to the critical CACCC box of the β-major globin promoter (6.Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7.van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Klf8 DNA binding activity was assessed in both Klf3+/+ and Klf3–/– E14.5 fetal liver samples by band retardation experiments (Fig. 1D). Because Klf3 and Klf8 co-migrate in these experiments, Klf3 antibody was used to shift away the Klf3 protein to reveal the band produced by Klf8 protein. Upon inspection, a band corresponding to Klf8 can be detected in the Klf3–/– fetal liver samples (Fig. 1D, lane 7). This band is supershifted by the addition of Klf8 antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 8). No such supershift was observed in the Klf3+/+ samples, suggesting that there is no detectable Klf8 DNA binding activity in the Klf3+/+ samples (the residual bands observed are not Klf8 and are presumably generated by an as yet uncharacterized CACCC-binding protein). Taken together these data suggest that Klf3 represses Klf8 expression either directly or indirectly. Klf8 Is De-repressed in the Absence of CtBP Proteins—CtBP proteins are transcriptional co-factors that bind transcription factors and repress gene expression. In mammals there are two CtBP proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2. They bind to a number of transcription factors including Klf3, Klf8, and Klf12 through Pro-Xaa-Asp-Leu-Ser (PXDLS) and related motifs (4.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7.van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27944-27949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations in a PVDLT motif in Klf3 prevent it from binding to CtBP and impair Klf3-mediated repression in cellular assays (4.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CtBPs were involved in Klf3-mediated repression of Klf8, we assessed Klf8 levels in Ctbp+/– (i.e. Ctbp1+/– Ctbp2+/–) and Ctbp–/– (i.e. Ctbp1–/– Ctbp2–/–) MEFs (34.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We also assessed Ctbp–/– MEFs that had been rescued with murine Ctbp2. Klf8 mRNA was found to be significantly de-repressed in Ctbp–/– MEFs compared with Ctbp+/– MEFs by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2). Moreover Ctbp–/– MEFs rescued with CtBP2 showed a down-regulation of Klf8 mRNA. Thus Klf8 expression is regulated by CtBP, and Klf3 and CtBP appear to"
https://openalex.org/W2083347540,"We have previously shown that genistein could inhibit Akt activation and down-regulate AR (androgen receptor) and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. However, pure genistein showed increased lymph node metastasis in an animal model, but such an adverse effect was not seen with isoflavone, suggesting that further mechanistic studies are needed for elucidating the role of isoflavone in PCa. It is known that FOXO3a and GSK-3β, targets of Akt, regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, FOXO3a, GSK-3β, and Src are AR regulators and regulate transactivation of AR, mediating the development and progression of PCa. Therefore, we investigated the molecular effects of isoflavone on the Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling network in hormone-sensitive LNCaP and hormone-insensitive C4-2B PCa cells. We found that isoflavone inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, regulated the phosphorylation of Src, and increased the expression of GSK-3β, leading to the down-regulation of AR and its target gene PSA. We also found that isoflavone inhibited AR nuclear translocation and promoted FOXO3a translocation to the nucleus. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that isoflavone inhibited FOXO3a binding to the promoter of AR and increased FOXO3a binding to the p27KIP1 promoter, resulting in the alteration of AR and p27KIP1 expression, the inhibition of cell proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis in both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive PCa cells. These results suggest that isoflavone-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis are partly mediated through the regulation of the Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling network. In conclusion, our data suggest that isoflavone could be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of PCa.

In conclusion, our data suggest that isoflavone could be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of PCa. Androgen and AR (androgen receptor) are required for both normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis. Androgen ablation therapy for prostate cancer, although initially effective, nearly always leads to treatment failure and progression to hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), 2The abbreviations used are: HRPC, hormone-refractory prostate cancer; PCa, prostate cancer; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. for which there is no curative therapy. It is still unclear how the prostate cancer cells progress to androgen independence. However, more evidence indicates that the mechanism involved in the escape of prostate cancer (PCa) from androgen control include mutation and overexpression of the AR gene or ligand-independent AR activation by other signaling pathways, including Akt and Src (1Chen C.D.

Most HRPC cells express AR and the androgen-inducible PSA (prostate-specific antigen), suggesting that AR signaling plays an important role in the development and progression of HRPC (5Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In prostate epithelial cells, ligand-free AR is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Binding of androgen to the AR induces AR conformational change. The AR then forms a homodimer and is phosphorylated. This phosphorylation stabilizes the ligand-AR complex, allowing its translocation to the nucleus for its activity (6Edwards J. Bartlett J.M. BJU Int. 2005; 95: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The activated AR then initiates gene transcription by binding to specific androgen-response elements in the promoter regions of target genes, including PSA. More evidences have shown that instead of androgen, other molecules in cell signaling pathways can also transactivate AR (7Balk S.P. Urology. 2002; 60: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It has been found that Akt and Src can phosphorylate the AR and transactivate the activity of AR (3Asim M. Siddiqui I.A. Hafeez B.B. Baniahmad A. Mukhtar H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3596-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Akt has also been found to phosphorylate AR and suppress AR transactivation (8Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Further study has shown that Akt pathway can suppress AR activity in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with low passage numbers; however, Akt can also enhance AR activity in LNCaP cells with high passage numbers, suggesting that Akt pathway may have distinct mechanisms to modulate AR functions in various stages of prostate cancer cells (9Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yang L. Altuwaijri S. Chen Y.T. Kang H.Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50902-50907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, Akt could be an important regulator of AR required for the progression of PCa cells to HRPC. The activated Akt can inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival by direct phosphorylation of its downstream targets (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). FOXO3a (Forkhead transcription factor class O3a) is one of the main targets of activated Akt. By binding to the nuclear importer, active FOXO3a translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA, and promotes the transcription of its target genes, including p27KIP1, inducing either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (11Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, activated Akt regulates transcription of FOXO3a target genes through phosphorylation of FOXO3a, leading to the release of FOXO3a from DNA and translocation to the cytoplasm (11Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). It has been found that FOXO3a also promotes the transcription of AR (13Yang L. Xie S. Jamaluddin M.S. Altuwaijri S. Ni J. Kim E. Chen Y.T. Hu Y.C. Wang L. Chuang K.H. Wu C.T. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33558-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, Akt/ FOXO3a/AR signaling appears to play important roles in the development and progression of HRPC. GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) is another main Akt target gene critically involved in the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). GSK-3β also controls cell survival through regulation of β-catenin, one of the key molecules in Wnt signaling (14Kikuchi A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, GSK-3β is an AR regulator that inhibits transcriptional activity of AR, forming a signal network with Akt/FOXO3a/AR (15Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Wu H. Nelson C.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Salas T.R. Kim J. Vakar-Lopez F. Sabichi A.L. Troncoso P. Jenster G. Kikuchi A. Chen S.Y. Shemshedini L. Suraokar M.

In addition, Src, one of the important intracellular oncogenic signals, can activate Akt through the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17Cheng J.Q. Lindsley C.W. Cheng G.Z. Yang H. Nicosia S.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and transactivate AR through the phosphorylation of AR (2Guo Z. Dai B. Jiang T. Xu K. Xie Y. Kim O. Nesheiwat I. Kong X. Melamed J. Handratta V.D. Njar V.C. Brodie A.M. Yu L.R. Veenstra T.D. Chen H. Qiu Y. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), suggesting that Src is also a member of the Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling network. These findings suggest that Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling network may play important roles in the development and progression of HRPC. Therefore, specific targeting of the molecules in this signaling network by a novel approach could be important for killing HRPC cells, and thus, such a strategy could be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of not only primary PCa but most importantly HRPC and metastatic disease. We and others have previously found that genistein, one of the most active isoflavones found in soybeans, exerts a potent antiproliferative effect on various cancers, including PCa (18Barnes S. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 777S-783SPubMed Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Upadhyay S. Bhuiyan M. Sarkar F.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3166-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We have also reported that genistein induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in PCa cells through the down-regulation of Akt (20Li Y. Sarkar F.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2369-2377PubMed Google Scholar), AR, and PSA (21Davis J.N. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hillman et al. (22Hillman G.G. Wang Y. Kucuk O. Che M. Doerge D.R. Yudelev M. Joiner M.C. Marples B. Forman J.D. Sarkar F.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1271-1279PubMed Google Scholar) from our group have found that pure genistein alone could increase lymph node metastases in an orthotopic model of PCa induced by PC-3 cells; however, such a phenomenon was not found when soy isoflavone formulation was used (23Raffoul J.J. Banerjee S. Che M. Knoll Z.E. Doerge D.R. Abrams J. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Hillman G.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that isoflavone formulation is more suitable for cancer prevention and treatment studies; however, no such studies have been reported to date to elucidate the effect and molecular mechanisms of isoflavone's action on the Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling network in PCa cells, especially in HRPC cells. Recently, we found that 3,3′-diindolylmethane, one of the chemopreventive agents, could inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells through the inhibition of Akt/FOXO3a/β-catenin signaling (24Li Y. Wang Z. Kong D. Murthy S. Dou Q.P. Sheng S. Reddy G.P. Sarkar F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21542-21550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we report, for the first time, that isoflavone mixture is a second class of potent agent for inducing growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B PCa cells, which is partly mediated through the regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/AR signaling. From these results, we conclude that isoflavone rather than pure genistein should be exploited for the prevention and/or treatment of PCa but most importantly in HRPC, for which there is no curative therapy. Cell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies—Human PCa cell lines, including LNCaP and C4-2B cells, were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Isoflavone mixture (83.3% genistein, 14.6% daidzein, and 0.26% glycitein; manufactured by Organic Technologies and obtained from the National Institutes of Health) was dissolved in DMSO to make a stock solution containing 50 mm genistein. The concentrations of isoflavone we described in this article all refer to the concentration of genistein in the isoflavone mixture. It has been reported that the concentration of genistein in plasma can reach up to 27.46 ± 15.38 μm without clinical toxicity after a single-dose administration of soy isoflavones to healthy men (25Busby M.G. Jeffcoat A.R. Bloedon L.T. Koch M.A. Black T. Dix K.J. Heizer W.D. Thomas B.F. Hill J.M. Crowell J.A. Zeisel S.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 75: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and that prostate tissue can concentrate genistein after oral isoflavone supplementation in PCa patients (26Rannikko A. Petas A. Rannikko S. Adlercreutz H. Prostate. 2006; 66: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose 25 and 50 μm isoflavone (equivalent to 25 and 50 μm genistein) for treatments in this study. IGF-1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Testosterone and LY294002 were from Sigma. Anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) (Cell Signaling), anti-FOXO3a (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-FOXO3a Ser253 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-FOXO3a Thr32 (Cell Signaling), anti-GSK-3β (Cell Signaling), anti-pGSK-3β Ser9 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-β-catenin (Cell Signaling), anti-karyopherin α (BD Biosciences), anti-karyopherin β (BD Biosciences), anti-PSA (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), anti-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Src (Cell Signaling), anti-Src (Tyr416) (Cell Signaling), anti-Src (Tyr527) (Cell Signaling), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, or immunofluorescent staining. Cell Proliferation Studies by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) and 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine Assays—Human LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 50 μm isoflavone, or 50 μm isoflavone plus 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 48 h. Control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control). After treatment, the cells were subject to an MTT assay, as described previously (27Li Y. Ahmed F. Ali S. Philip P.A. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6934-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and a 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine assay using the BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The growth inhibition of LNCaP and C4-2B cells by isoflavone treatment was statistically evaluated with Student's t test using GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Hoechst Staining, Histone/DNA Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay, and Caspase-3 Assay for Detection of Apoptosis—LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 50 μm isoflavone, or 50 μm isoflavone plus 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 48 h, as described above. After treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in ethanol for 1 h. The cells were then stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst for 30 min and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Bright condensed, punctuate, or granular nuclei were considered apoptotic. We also quantitatively compared the apoptotic cells in control or IGF-1- or isoflavone-treated cells using the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described previously (27Li Y. Ahmed F. Ali S. Philip P.A. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6934-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The activity of caspase-3 in each sample was measured by using the EnzChek caspase-3 assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), following the manufacturer's protocol. The cleavage and activation of caspase-3 were also accessed by Western blot analysis using anti-caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling). The induction of apoptosis by isoflavone treatment of LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells was statistically evaluated with Student's t test using GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Lysates—LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were treated with 50 μm isoflavone for 48 and 72 h. After treatment and harvesting, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.08 m KCl, 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m sucrose, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mm dithiothreitol) and frozen at -80 °C overnight. The cell suspension was thawed and passed through a 28-gauge needle three times. A small aliquot of the cells were checked for cell membrane breakage using trypan blue. Then the cell suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was saved as cytoplasmic lysate. The pellet was suspended in lysis buffer, and the nuclei were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatant was saved as nuclear lysate. The protein concentration in the lysates was measured by a Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear lysate (500 μg) and cytoplasmic lysate (800 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation by adding 2.5–5 μg of anti-AR, anti-FOXO3a, or anti-β-catenin antibody and incubation overnight at 4 °C. After adding 50 μl of Protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged. The agarose pellet was then washed three times, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Boiled samples were centrifuged, and supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated with 25 or 50 μm isoflavone for 1–8 or 24–72 h. Whole cell lysate of the cells was prepared by sonicating the cells lysed in 62 mm Tris-HCl and 2% SDS. In another set of experiments, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were also extracted. The protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates, whole cell lysates, and cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins were subjected to standard Western blot analysis, as described previously (27Li Y. Ahmed F. Ali S. Philip P.A. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6934-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The signal of Western blot was scanned and quantified by using AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The signal ratio of each protein over loading control was calculated by standardizing the ratios of each control to the unit value. Transient Transfection with Akt cDNA Constructs—pLNCX-Akt (wild type Akt), pLNCX-Myr-Akt (constitutively activated Akt), pLNCX-Akt-K179M (dominant negative), and pLNCX (control empty vector) were generously provided by Dr. Sellers (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The pLNCX-Akt, pLNCX-Myr-Akt, pLNCX-Akt-K179M, or pLNCX was transiently transfected into LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells using ExGen 500 (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). After 5 h, the transfected cells were washed and incubated with complete RPMI 1640 medium overnight, followed by treatment with 50 μm isoflavone for 48 h. Subsequently, the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins from transfected and untransfected cells were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. siRNA Transfection—C4-2B and LNCaP PCa cells were transfected with Akt siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control RNA duplex (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation, the total cellular proteins from each sample were extracted. The level of phospho-FOXO3a, phospho-Akt, Akt, GSK-3β, phospho-AR, and PSA expression was detected by Western blot analysis. C4-2B cells were also transfected with AR, p27, and control siRNA and incubated for 48 h. The effects of siRNAs on cell proliferation were measured by an MTT assay. Immunofluorescence Staining—LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were cultured on chamber slides and treated with 50 μm isoflavone for 24–72 h. Cells were then fixed with acetone for 15 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-AR or anti-FOXO3a antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. Cell images were observed under a fluorescent microscope and photographed under the same exposure and magnification (×200) settings. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was conducted to measure the activity of FOXO3a binding to AR or p27KIP1 promoter in isoflavone-treated and -untreated cells. LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were treated with 50 μm isoflavone for 24–72 h. Following treatment, nuclear protein from cells was extracted and subject to DNA binding and gel analysis as we described previously (27Li Y. Ahmed F. Ali S. Philip P.A. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6934-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The sequences of IRDye-labeled oligonucleotide (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), which contains AR or p27KIP1 promoter sequences with a consensus FOXO3a DNA binding site, are as follows: 5′-ATTATGTCCTTGTTTCAGCCTGTT-3′ for AR and 5′-ATGTGTAGCTTGTTTTCTTAGCCAC-3′ for p27KIP1 (13Yang L.

Supershift using FOXO3a antibody was also conducted to confirm the specificity of FOXO3a DNA binding activity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—A ChIP assay was performed to test the effect of isoflavone on FOXO3a binding to AR or p27KIP1 promoter under an in vivo environment. Briefly, LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells were treated with 50 μm isoflavone for 48 h. After formaldehyde cross-linking and quenching, the cells were incubated in cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the nuclear lysates were sonicated to generate an average DNA size of ∼600 bp, and protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 800 μg of each sample were incubated with FOXO3a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The FOXO3a antibody-bound DNA complexes were pelleted with Protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing and elution, the immunoprecipitated complexes and input were reversed from cross-linking. The input DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA were then precipitated and purified. Real time and conventional PCRs were performed using the purified DNA and the following primers: AR promoter (forward, 5′-AGCCTTTCCCAAATGACAATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCACAGCCAAACATCATAGG-3′), p27KIP1 promoter (forward, 5′-GTCCCTTCCAGCTGTCACAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAAACCAACCTTCCGTTCT-3′), β-actin (forward, 5′-CCACACTGTGCCCATCTACG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAG-3′). For real time PCR, data were analyzed according to the comparative Ct method, and the amount of FOXO3a-bound AR or p27KIP1 promoter DNA was normalized by input β-actin DNA. For conventional PCR, PCR product was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Inhibition of FOXO3a Phosphorylation, Up-regulation of GSK-3β Expression, and Down-regulation of AR Expression and Phosphorylation by Isoflavone—We have previously reported that genistein inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt in PC-3 PCa cells and the expression of PSA in LNCaP PCa cells (20Li Y. Sarkar F.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2369-2377PubMed Google Scholar, 21Davis J.N. Kucuk O. Sarkar F.H. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether isoflavone could suppress the expression of PSA through the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and the inactivation of AR, we tested the effects of isoflavone on Akt, FOXO3a, and AR in IGF-1-stimulated and -unstimulated conditions. We observed that phosphorylation of Akt, FOXO3a, and AR was up-regulated by IGF-1 in PCa cells, as expected (Fig. 1A). However, isoflavone inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, FOXO3a, and AR in the cytoplasm and nucleus of C4-2B and LNCaP PCa cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, isoflavone abrogated the up-regulation of Akt, FOXO3a, and AR phosphorylation induced by IGF-1 (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 sites was inhibited by isoflavone (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, we found that isoflavone inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO3a at both Thr32 and Ser253 sites and FOXO1 at Thr24 in LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells (Fig. 1D). We have also observed that the level of FOXO3a was increased in nuclear lysate after isoflavone treatment (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the increased ratio of FOXO3a over phospho-FOXO3a in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa cells could retain a greater amount of active FOXO3a in the nuclear compartment to inhibit cancer cell growth. To further confirm the effects of isoflavone on FOXO3a and AR, we conducted studies using Akt siRNA. We found that Akt siRNA transfection decreased the levels of Akt, phospho-Akt, phospho-FOXO3a, phospho-AR, and PSA (Fig. 1F), similar to the effects of isoflavone, suggesting that the effect of isoflavone on FOXO3a and AR is mediated through the Akt signaling. We also exposed the PCa cells to a lower concentration of isoflavone for a short time (1–8 h) and observed similar results (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the down-regulation of phospho-FOXO3a by isoflavone observed in our studies was not the consequence of cell death. In addition, we also found that testosterone stimulated AR expression and phosphorylation, whereas isoflavone decreased AR expression and phosphorylation under both testosterone-stimulated and -unstimulated conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we tested the effects of isoflavone on FOXO3a and AR after Akt transfection. After transfection with wild-type Akt and constitutively activated Akt cDNA, we observed up-regulation of phospho-Akt and phospho-FOXO3a proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus of C4-2B PCa cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We also observed up-regulated AR phosphorylation in nucleus and increased level of PSA in the cytosol after Akt transfection (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, we found that isoflavone could abrogate the up-regulation of phospho-Akt, phospho-FOXO3a, phospho-AR, and PSA induced by wild-type Akt or constitutively activated Akt cDNA transfection and increased the levels of FOXO3a in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2, A and B). By immunoprecipitation, we found that isoflavone inhibited the formation of Akt and FOXO3a complex in the cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa cells (Fig. 2, C and D), consistent with Akt inactivation and subsequent decrease in FOXO3a phosphorylation by isoflavone treatment. We also found that isoflavone decreased the formation of FOXO3a and AR complex, which could inhibit FOXO3a activity, in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that higher levels of active FOXO3a proteins in the nuclear com"

The grand challenge is to develop an approach that enables accurate predictive calculations of reactions involving electronically excited states with potential curve crossings. This challenge is all the more daunting because collisions involving molecules heavier than H 2 may be accompanied by substantial energy exchange with the surface vibrations (phonons), and because an electronic structure approach that allows molecule-surface interaction energies to be computed with chemical accuracy (1 kilocalorie per mole) is not yet available even for the electronic ground state of molecule-metal surface systems."

For thousands of years, tea has been the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water. Historically, tea has been credited with various beneficial health effects, including medicinal efficacy in the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases. Thus, longevity and good health have often been associated with the habit of drinking tea (1Yang C.S. Maliakal P. Meng X. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Several investigators have reported that green tea exerts cancer preventive activity at a variety of organ sites, including skin, lung, oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, and mammary gland (1Yang C.S.

However, the mechanisms explaining the cancer preventive activity of tea and tea polyphenols are still not clearly understood. The ζ-associated 70-kDa protein (ZAP-70) is a Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) family tyrosine kinase, which is associated with the ζ subunit of the T cell receptor (TCR). The ZAP-70 protein is primarily expressed in T cells and natural killer cells and plays an essential role in signaling through the T cell antigen receptor (5Jin L. Pluskey S. Petrella E.C. Cantin S.M. Gorga J.C. Rynkiewicz M.J. Pandey P. Strickler J.E. Babine R.E. Weaver D.T. Seidl K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TCRs are associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins resulting in activation of various signaling pathways causing alterations in gene expression, increased T cell proliferation, and secretion of cytokines (6Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor plays a role in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates. An important substrate of ZAP-70 is the TCR ζ chain, which can mediate the transduction of extracellular stimuli into cellular effector functions (7Cantrell D. Annu. Rev.

Despite advances in T cell leukemia therapy, only a minority of patients achieve long term tumor-free survival with conventional chemotherapy but at the cost of significant, irreversible toxic side effects, which often limit effective treatment (17Bremer E. ten Cate B. Samplonius D.F. de Leij L.F. Helfrich W. Blood. 2006; 107: 2863-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, new therapeutic approaches with enhanced tumor selectivity and more favorable toxicity profiles are urgently needed. EGCG, a major active constituent of green tea, has been shown to stimulate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in various cancer cell lines, including prostate, colon, lung, leukemias, and lymphomas (3Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 18Nakazato T. Ito K. Miyakawa Y. Kinjo K. Yamada T. Hozumi N. Ikeda Y. Kizaki M. Haematologica. 2005; 90: 317-325PubMed Google Scholar). However, the anticancer mechanisms and molecular targets of EGCG are poorly understood, especially in T cell-mediated leukemias and lymphomas. Here we demonstrate that EGCG might be a potential immunomodulator for the management of ZAP-70-dependent T cell activation in human leukemias and lymphomas. The effects of EGCG were extensively investigated in a ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T cell line (P116 cells) and a cell line in which ZAP-70 activity was recovered (P116.cl39 cells). Results suggested that ZAP-70 antagonists could be useful immunomodulatory therapeutic agents. Materials—All media were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and fetal bovine serum was from Gemini Bio-Products (Calabasas, CA). CNBr-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

The TnT® Quick Coupled transcription/translation system was from Promega (Madison, WI). EGCG, EC, ECG, and EGC were generous gifts from Dr. Chi-Tang Ho (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). Cell Culture—The Jurkat (clone E6–1) human T cell leukemia, ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat mutant P116, and ZAP-70 recovered P116 mutant P116.cl39 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Robert T. Abraham (Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (19Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Jurkat and P116 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the P116.cl39 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Construction of Deletion Mutants and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A cDNA encoding ZAP-70 was generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Amersham Biosciences) to produce the ZAP-70 protein. The deletion mutants of ZAP-70 were generated from ZAP-70 wild type and inserted in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pcDNA4/HisMax vector. The products were cut with BamHI and EcoRI and then subcloned into pcDNA4/HisMax, generating the constructs ZAP-70(1–256), ZAP-70(1–415), and ZAP-70-(1–466) according to the insert sizes. cDNAs encoding the Glu415, Lys369, Asp479, Glu386, and Arg465 mutants of ZAP-70 were generated using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned into the pcDNA4/HisMax vector as follows: ZAP-70 E415Q, ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R, ZAP-70 E415Q/D479N, ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R/D479N, and ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R/D479N/E386Q/R465K. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ). In Vitro EGCG-Sepharose 4B and ATP-Agarose 4B Pulldown Assays—This method has been described previously (20Ermakova S. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Kang B.S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16882-16890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of each ZAP-70 point mutant using the jetPEI (Polyplus-Transfection SA, San Marcos, CA) reagent following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The cellular supernatant fraction (Jurkat, P116, P116.cl39, or transfected cells), recombinant ZAP-70, or plasmids (pcDNA4/HIS/Max-ZAP-70 and deletion mutants of ZAP-70) were translated in vivo with l-[35S]methionine. Respective proteins were incubated with EGCG-Sepharose 4B beads or ATP-agarose 4B beads in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× proteinase inhibitor). The beads were washed five times with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by autoradiography or immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Physical Binding and Kd Measurement—ZAP-70 binding assays were carried out as described (20Ermakova S. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Kang B.S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16882-16890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For analyzing concentration-dependent uptake, 1 nm to 10 μm concentrations of EGCG were applied. The Kd value was determined through nonlinear regression analysis using the Prizm 4.0 software program (Graphpad Inc., San Diego). Molecular Modeling of the Interactions of EGCG with ZAP-70—Molecular docking studies were carried out using the Maestro software suite (Maestro, version 7.5, Schrödinger, New York). The EGCG molecule was drawn using the builder tool in Maestro and then optimized for docking in Ligprep. The ZAP-70 crystal structure complexed with staurosporine (Protein Data Bank code 1u59) was prepared for docking following the Glide standard procedure (21Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6462) Google Scholar). Grids defining the protein receptor were generated considering the binding mode of staurosporine. Many protein-binding sites undergo structural rearrangements upon ligand binding, the so-called “induced fit” allows the binding site to follow the shape of the ligand with resulting better interactions. Consequently, molecular docking was performed with the induced fit docking protocol (Schrödinger Suite 2006). The induced fit docking is a part of the Maestro software suite that attempts to reproduce the protein conformational rearrangement upon binding. Initially, EGCG was docked with Glide in extra-precision mode using a softened potential: scaling the receptor (0.70) and the ligand (0.50) van der Waals radius. The best 20 EGCG poses were retained. Then the receptor side chains within 5 Å distance from the ligand were predicted and minimized for each protein-ligand complex, and then another round of minimizations was performed on each protein-ligand complex pose. Finally, Glide redocking in extra-precision mode of each protein-ligand complex within 30.0 kcal/mol of the lowest energy structure was performed. Herein the best-docked representative structure is presented. Kinase Assay—The ZAP-70 kinase assay was performed at 30°C for 2 h in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij), 1 μg of recombinant ZAP-70, 5 μg of the kinase substrate (poly(Glu4-Tyr) peptide, biotin conjugate), EGCG (0.5–20 μm), 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by adding 12.5 μl of termination buffer, and samples were quantified (counts/min) by scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The P116 and P116.cl39 cells (5 × 105/ml) were grown in 75-cm3 flasks for 24 h and then serum-starved for 14 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with EGCG (4 or 8 μm) for 2 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml mouse IgG1κ monoclonal immunoglobulin isotype control and 2 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD3. The reactions were stopped by adding cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation for subsequent lysis. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies and protein A/G Plus-agarose beads. After centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer and were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Eluted immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and then incubated with appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected by subsequent incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies and visualized by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Shim J.H. Cho K.J. Lee K.A. Kim S.H. Myung P.K. Choe Y.K. Yoon D.Y. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were treated and prepared as described above for Western blotting and then disrupted with a hypotonic buffer. The nuclei pellet was disrupted in a hypertonic buffer, and the nuclear extracts were retained for use in the DNA binding assay. A double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to AP (activator protein)-1 responsive elements (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated in binding buffer for 15 min with poly(dI·dC) and the 32P-labeled DNA probe. The DNA binding activity was separated from free probe using a TBE Ready Gel Precast Gel (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Measurement of IL-2 Production—Quantification of interleukin (IL)-2 production from P116 and P116.cI39 cells was performed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Pharmingen). The cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were resuspended in fresh medium in a 48-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated with various concentrations of EGCG and 2 μg/ml mouse IgG1κ monoclonal immunoglobulin isotype control or 2 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD3 for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C. The levels of IL-2 in the supernatant fractions were subsequently measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MTS Assay—Cells (1 × 104) were seeded in a 96-well plate and then incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of EGCG (0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 μm) or EC, ECG, or EGC (4 μm) for 72 h. The effect of EGCG on viability was estimated using the Cell-Titer 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay solution was added to each well, and absorbance (492 nm and 690 background) was read with a 96-well plate reader (Labsystem Multiskan MS, Labsystem, Finland). Annexin V Staining—Apoptosis was performed using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit as recommended by the manufacturer (MBL International Corp., Watertown, MA). Apoptosis was compared in P116 and P116.cl39 cells that were treated or not treated with 4 or 8 μm EGCG for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. The cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with annexin V-FITC plus propidium iodide following the protocol included in the kit. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples from at least three independent experiments. Differences between means were assessed by one-way analysis of variance, and the minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. EGCG Binds with ZAP-70 ex Vivo and in Vitro—Expression of ZAP-70 was recently reported to be a reliable prognostic marker among patients with CLL (14Crespo M. Bosch F. Villamor N. Bellosillo B. Colomer D. Rozman M. Marce S. Lopez-Guillermo A. Campo E. Montserrat E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In a kinase screening experiment (kinase profiler specificity testing service, Upstate), EGCG (5 μm) was found to inhibit ZAP-70 kinase activity. We therefore studied the potential interaction of EGCG and ZAP-70 in wild type Jurkat cells, Jurkat cells (P116) that do not express ZAP-70, and in P116 cells (P116.cl39) in which ZAP-70 protein expression has been restored (Fig. 1A). The interaction of ZAP-70 and EGCG was determined in an EGCG-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography experiment combined with immunoblotting with anti-ZAP-70. Results indicated that EGCG formed a complex with ZAP-70 in P116.cl39 cells but not in P116 cells (Fig. 1B). To characterize the physical binding between EGCG and ZAP-70, we measured the binding affinity (Kd) of the complex using a GST pulldown assay and 3H-labeled EGCG. The Kd value of ZAP-70 and EGCG binding was determined to be 0.6207 μmol/liter (Fig. 1C). Identification of the EGCG-binding Site of ZAP-70—The ZAP-70 protein has a kinase domain, an SH2-kinase linker region, an inter-SH2 linker region, a C-terminal SH2 domain, and an N-terminal SH2 domain (6Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine the binding region of ZAP-70 specific for EGCG, we created three serially deleted ZAP-70 mutants s follows: ZAP-70 D1 (amino acids 1–466), ZAP-70 D2 (amino acids 1–415), and ZAP-70 D3 (amino acids 1–256) (Fig. 1D). These mutants were used in combination with the EGCG-Sepharose 4B pulldown assay to determine the area of ZAP-70 to which EGCG binds. Results indicated that EGCG binds strongly with full-length ZAP-70 (ZAP-70FL) and the ZAP-70 D1 (amino acids 1–466) domain. On the other hand, ZAP-70 D2 (amino acids 1–415) showed weak binding with EGCG, whereas ZAP-70 D3 (amino acids 1–256) did not bind with EGCG, which suggested that EGCG binds primarily with the kinase domain (Fig. 1E). Structural Analysis of the Interaction between EGCG and ZAP-70—To better characterize the possible interaction between EGCG and the kinase/ATP binding domain of ZAP-70, we used the x-ray co-crystal structure of ZAP-70 complexed with staurosporine (Protein Data Bank code 1u59) as a starting point for a docking experiment. The accuracy of small molecule/protein docking increases when considering holo-proteins (23McGovern S.L. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2895-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and staurosporine is a rigid and flat molecule that creates an open conformation to the ZAP-70 ATP binding pocket. An open conformation is usually adopted by kinases when bound to small ligands, such as EGCG. In our docking model, EGCG presented a calculated binding affinity of -13.07 kcal/mol. One of the hydroxyl groups of the EGCG A ring, similar to other known kinase inhibitors, appears to form two hydrogen bonds with the kinase hinge region and, in particular, with the backbone carbonyl group of Glu415 and the amide group of Ala417 (Fig. 2A). The A–C ring system acts as an adenine mimic and likewise interacts with the front cleft hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2B). The gallate moiety (D ring) occupies mainly the hydrophilic and solvent-exposed pocket covered by the G-loop, which is believed to be less important for ligand affinity (24Fabbro D. Ruetz S. Buchdunger E. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Liebetanz J. Mestan J. O'Reilly T. Traxler P. Chaudhuri B. Fretz H. Zimmermann J. Meyer T. Caravatti G. Furet P. Manley P.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The side chains of lysine (Lys369) and aspartate (Asp479) may form a network of hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the B ring. In addition, the side chain of Glu386 is expected to form a hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups of this ring (Fig. 2, A and B). This docking experiment suggested that disrupting specific hydrogen bonding networks by point mutation should affect the ability of EGCG to bind with ZAP-70 as modeled. Therefore, to continue to assess the importance of the interaction between EGCG and the ZAP-70 kinase/ATP-binding site, we generated a variety of ZAP-70 point mutants, including ZAP-70 E415Q, ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R, ZAP-70 E415Q/D479N, ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R/D479N, and ZAP-70 E415Q/K369R/D479N/E386Q/R465K. The various ZAP-70 mutants were each transfected into HEK 293 cells to determine the effect on ZAP-70 binding with EGCG using EGCG-Sepharose 4B or Sepharose 4B combined with Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). As predicted, the E415Q substitution did not affect the binding because EGCG forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms in the hinge region. The binding seems to be dependent on the interactions of EGCG with Lys369 and Asp479, which we predicted would form a network of hydrogen bonds with the ligand B ring. The bulkier arginine in the K369R mutant very likely affects potential hydrogen bonding with EGCG but also may alter the shape of the cavity, preventing the ligand from assuming the correct orientation for satisfying all the necessary connections with the binding site. Replacing aspartate 479 with asparagine (D479N) also affects the ability of EGCG to bind. We predicted a hydrogen bond between the B ring and the aspartate side chain. The mutant, in which both Lys369 and Asp479 were substituted, consistently showed inhibition of EGCG binding. Thus, these data suggested that ZAP-70 Asp479 and Lys369 are required for the essential interactions of ZAP-70 with EGCG within the catalytic site. The information from the docking experiment suggested that EGCG might effectively inhibit ATP binding to active ZAP-70. Thus, we examined the effect of EGCG on ATP binding by pulldown assay using ATP-agarose 4B and the active ZAP-70 protein. Results confirmed that the binding of ATP with ZAP-70 decreased with increasing amounts of EGCG (Fig. 3A). This suggested that EGCG might inhibit ZAP-70 kinase activity by competing with ATP binding. We next determined whether EGCG could prevent ZAP-70 phosphorylation and/or suppress kinase activity. Kinase activity was analyzed using an in vitro kinase assay with active ZAP-70 and the preferred kinase substrate, poly(Glu4-Tyr) peptide. Results indicated that increasing concentrations of EGCG markedly suppressed ZAP-70 kinase activity, and 3 μm EGCG significantly inhibited ZAP-70 kinase activity by 50% (Fig. 3B). ZAP-70 is recruited to the phosphorylated CD3 and ζ subunits after TCR stimulation (25Kersh E.N. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Science. 1998; 281: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the signal-transducing antigen receptor subunit (CD3 and ζ) are phosphorylated by Src PTK thus allowing the Syk family PTK ZAP-70 to bind to the ITAM (26Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGCG had no effect on CD3-induced phosphorylation of CD3ζ (Fig. 3C). TCR-mediated Lck activity leads to phosphorylation of ZAP-70 on Tyr493 in the regulatory loop of the PTK domain resulting in the up-regulation of ZAP-70 kinase activity (27Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Our data showed that EGCG had no effect on phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (Tyr493) (Fig. 3C). Tyrosine 319 is a key phosphorylati"

Its regulated subunit, HIF-1α, is controlled by oxygen levels and major signaling pathways. We reported previously that phosphorylation of Ser641/643 by p42/44 MAPK is essential for HIF-1α nuclear accumulation and activity. We now show that a fragment of HIF-1α (amino acids 616–658), termed MAPK target domain, contains a nuclear export signal (NES), which has atypical hydrophobic residue spacing. Localization, reporter gene, and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that the identified NES interacts with CRM1 in a phosphorylation-sensitive manner. Furthermore, disruption of the NES (I637A/L638A/I639A) restores nuclear localization and activity of nonphosphorylated HIF-1α and renders it largely resistant to inhibition of MAPK, an effect reproduced by a phosphomimetic mutation (S641E). As these data predict, overexpression of wild-type or mutant (S641A/S643A) MAPK target domain in HeLa cells modulates the activity and subcellular distribution of endogenous HIF-1α. We suggest that control of HIF-1α nuclear transport represents an important MAPK-dependent regulatory mechanism.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor 1; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; LMB, leptomycin B; MTD, MAPK target domain; NES, nuclear export signal; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a transcriptional activator and the key mediator of cellular response to hypoxia. HIF-1 binds to regulatory DNA sequences called hypoxia-response elements and controls the expression of genes involved in cell metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. It is therefore essential not only for cell survival under low oxygen but also for embryogenesis and tumor progression (1Semenza, G. L. (2007) Sci. STKE 2007, CM8Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (or ARNT), both members of the basic helix-loop-helix Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) family of transcription factors. Whereas ARNT is expressed constitutively, HIF-1α is highly regulated and a major target of anti-cancer therapy (2Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5371) Google Scholar). Under normal oxygen concentration, HIF-1α protein levels are kept low by von Hippel-Lindau-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Interaction with von Hippel-Lindau requires the hydroxylation of two proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α (3Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The proline hydroxylases that participate in this process depend on iron and require molecular oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as substrates. When oxygen concentration is low, hydroxylation is impaired allowing HIF-1α to be stabilized, enter the nucleus, bind to ARNT and DNA, and induce the expression of target genes. This latter process is also regulated by oxygen tension as HIF-1α hydroxylation at Asn803 by FIH-1 compromises its association with the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 (4Lancaster D.E. McDonough M.A. Schofield C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species produced under hypoxia as well as intermediate products of cell metabolism can also affect hydroxylation and, consequently, modulate HIF-1 activity (5Kietzmann T. Gorlach A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Pan Y. Mansfield K.D. Bertozzi C.C. Rudenko V. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell.

HIF-1α expression and transcriptional activity are additionally controlled, irrespective of oxygen levels, by major signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAPK, which are induced by growth factors, cytokines, and oncogenes (8Bardos J.I. Ashcroft M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dery M.A. Michaud M.D. Richard D.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway leads to enhanced levels of HIF-1α protein synthesis (10Bernardi R. Guernah I. Jin D. Grisendi S. Alimonti A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Cordon-Cardo C. Simon M.C. Rafii S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2006; 442: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whereas MAPK activation promotes predominantly HIF-1 transcriptional activity via direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α (11Richard D.E.

We have recently revealed that p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) modifies HIF-1α residues Ser641 and Ser643 and showed that inhibition of this phosphorylation by mutagenesis, MAPK pathway inhibitors, or treatment with flavonoids impairs activity and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α (12Mylonis I.

Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of HIF-1α has been suggested previously to be regulated (15Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kubis H.P. Hanke N. Scheibe R.J. Gros G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the ability of human HIF-1α to also exit the nucleus and be a shuttling protein has been documented (17Groulx I. Lee S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5319-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Berra E. Roux D. Richard D.E. Pouyssegur J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the transport signals or factors regulating its nuclear export have remained so far unknown. In this work we characterize an atypical but CRM1-dependent NES in human HIF-1α. We further show that the identified NES responds to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and therefore provides additional means of HIF-1α regulation.

The cDNA fragments corresponding to HIF-1α MTD (amino acids 616–658) were obtained by PCR using as template pGEX-HIF-1α (wild-type or mutant forms).

Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) followed by ECL. Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa, HEK293-T, and Huh7 cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged full-length HIF-1α, its MTD fragment, or their mutant forms, and 24 h post-transfection were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature.

Phosphomimetic S641E Mutation Stimulates HIF-1α Activity and Renders It Resistant to MAPK Inhibition—We have recently reported that mutation of HIF-1α Ser641 and/or Ser643 inhibited its phosphorylation by p42/44 MAPK and impaired its activity and nuclear accumulation by stimulating its nuclear export, suggesting that these sites are the predominant, if not the only, MAPK targets on HIF-1α (12Mylonis I. Chachami G. Samiotaki M. Panayotou G. Paraskeva E. Kalousi A. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33095-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To positively demonstrate the role of this modification in the regulation of HIF-1α nuclear transport, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert Ser641 to Glu (S→E), which mimics the charge of phosphorylated serine. Ser641 was chosen randomly between Ser641 and Ser643 because mutations in either of them caused identical phenotypes in terms of inhibition of transcriptional activity and nuclear accumulation (12Mylonis I. Chachami G. Samiotaki M. Panayotou G. Paraskeva E. Kalousi A. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33095-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Wild-type as well as mutant HIF-1α(S→E) were expressed as GFP fusions in HeLa cells. As expected, both wild-type GFP-HIF-1α and GFP-HIF-1α(S→E) were nuclear in all cells examined (Fig. 1A, panels a and c). Incubation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 caused partial redistribution of GFP-HIF-1α to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, panel b), but it did not affect the localization of GFP-HIF-1α(S→E), which remained exclusively inside the nucleus of all the cells that expressed it (Fig. 1A, panel d). Determination of transcriptional activities by reporter gene assays showed that GFP-HIF-1α(S→E) exhibited significantly enhanced transcriptional activity compared with the wild-type form (Fig. 1B). Moreover, GFP-HIF-1α(S→E) retained most of its activity in the presence of PD98059, whereas the same conditions reduced dramatically the activity of the wild-type form (Fig. 1B). We conclude that phosphorylation at Ser641 is both essential and sufficient for MAPK-dependent stimulation of HIF-1α nuclear accumulation and activity. However, the significant, albeit minor, effect of PD98059 on the S→E mutant suggests an additional effect of MAPK on HIF-1-mediated transcription (see also “Discussion”). Identification of a Phosphorylation- and CRM1-dependent NES in HIF-1α—To gain mechanistic insight into the phosphorylation-dependent subcellular localization of HIF-1α, we examined the amino acid sequences neighboring the MAPK sites for the presence of nuclear transport signals. We noticed a number of conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A) that, despite their atypical spacing and composition, were reminiscent of a leucine-rich NES (21Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To study the function of this sequence and its possible reliance on phosphorylation, we cloned a fragment of HIF-1α encompassing residues 616–658 (Fig. 2A) and expressed it in bacteria fused to the C terminus of GST. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 3, 7, and 11), this 43-amino acid-long fragment of HIF-1α retained the ability to be efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by either p42 MAPK or HeLa cell nuclear extracts and was, therefore, termed MAPK Target Domain (MTD). We also created mutant MTD forms lacking the phosphorylation sites (conversion of both Ser641 and Ser643 to Ala; S→A) or the three hydrophobic residues of the putative NES (triple mutation I637A/L638A/I639A; I→A) or both (I→A/S→A) (Fig. 2A, lower panel). As anticipated, MTD(S→A) could no longer be phosphorylated by p42 MAPK or HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 2B, lanes 4, 8 and 12). We next examined the possibility that MTD contains an autonomous NES. Wild-type and mutant forms of MTD were fused to GFP and expressed in HeLa cells. In all cells examined, wild-type GFP-MTD was mostly nuclear (Fig. 2C, panel b), whereas the S→A mutant was found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C, panel c), which was suggestive of efficient nuclear export in the absence of phosphorylation. Concomitant mutation of the putative NES in the I→A/S→A form re-localized most of the protein inside the nucleus (Fig. 2C, panel d) showing that residues 637ILI639 are required for efficient nuclear export. Finally, destruction of the NES alone in the I→A mutant, as expected, retained the nuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 2C, panel e). These data suggest that the conserved hydrophobic sequence in MTD can indeed function as an NES, but only when the neighboring phosphoacceptor sites remain unmodified. To test whether the identified NES directs HIF-1α MTD to the major nuclear export pathway involving CRM1 (21Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), HeLa cells expressing GFP-MTD(S→A) were treated with the specific CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). Incubation with LMB reversed the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-MTD(S→A) in all of the expressing cells and caused its accumulation inside the nucleus (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether MTD interacts with CRM1, HeLa cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of GFP-MTD were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP serum. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed a weak interaction of endogenous CRM1 with wild-type MTD (Fig. 3B, lane 1). However, this interaction was considerably strengthened in the case of the S→A mutant (Fig. 3B, lane 2). On the other hand, destruction of the NES in the I→A and I→A/S→A mutants completely abolished the interaction with CRM1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblotting with the same anti-GFP serum used for the immunoprecipitation confirmed similar recoveries of GFP-MTD forms in the precipitates (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). In the same way, we examined the interaction between full-length HIF-1α and CRM1 in HeLa cells expressing wild-type and mutant forms of GFP-HIF-1α. Although we could not detect an interaction of CRM1 with wild-type HIF-1α, binding of CRM1 to the phosphorylation-deficient mutant S→A was readily detectable (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). As in the case of MTD, interaction to CRM1 was blocked when the NES sequence was additionally mutated in the I→A/S→A form (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Immunoblotting with an anti-HIF-1α antibody verified similar recoveries of GFP-HIF1α forms in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). To confirm these findings with endogenous wild-type HIF-1α, HeLa cells were treated with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a hypoxia-mimetic chemical that induces HIF-1α by inhibiting its hydroxylation (3Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), exposed to the MEK inhibitor PD98059, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-HIF-1α antibody. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that CRM1 associated with endogenous wild-type HIF-1α only under conditions that inhibit the MAPK pathway (Fig. 3D, top panel, lane 4), verifying that phosphorylation of HIF-1α by MAPK inhibits its interaction with CRM1. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the MTD of HIF-1α contains an atypical hydrophobic NES that interacts with CRM1 in a MAPK-phosphorylation sensitive manner. As we were not able to convincingly demonstrate stable binding of CRM1 to MTD using recombinant proteins in vitro (data not shown), the interaction between CRM1 and the identified atypical NES may be of low affinity or require additional cellular factors (see also “Discussion”). Identified NES Mediates Sensitivity of HIF-1α to MAPK-dependent Phosphorylation—As shown in Fig. 1, both localization and activity of HIF-1α are sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibition. Therefore, we tested if this sensitivity involves the identified NES by analyzing the subcellular distribution and transcriptional activity of GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant forms of HIF-1α expressed in HeLa cells. As we have already reported, wild-type GFP-HIF-1α was localized inside the nucleus (Fig. 4A, panel b), whereas the phosphorylation-deficient S→A mutant was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A, panel c). However, parallel destruction of the NES resulted in the redistribution of the phosphorylation-deficient I→A/S→A mutant inside the nucleus in all transformed cells (Fig. 4A, panel d). Treating the cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 impaired the nuclear accumulation of wild-type GFP-HIF-1α (Fig. 4A, panel g) but did not affect the nuclear localization of the I→A form that carried a mutant NES (Fig. 4A, panel j). As we have already described previously (12Mylonis I. Chachami G. Samiotaki M. Panayotou G. Paraskeva E. Kalousi A. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33095-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the effect of PD98059 on the localization of wild-type GFP-HIF-1α is not as strong as the effect of the S→A mutation, most likely because incubation with PD98059 under our conditions significantly decreases but does not completely abolish constitutive activation of MAPK in HeLa cells (see Fig. 5C in Ref. 12Mylonis I. Chachami G. Samiotaki M. Panayotou G. Paraskeva E. Kalousi A. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33095-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In agreement with the localization studies at the single cell level, analysis of the whole transformed cell population by a reporter gene assay demonstrated that the phosphorylation-deficient cytoplasmic S→A form showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity, whereas the NES-defective nuclear I→A/S→A and I→A forms preserved their activity at levels similar to that of wild-type GFP-HIF-1α (Fig. 4B). Inhibiting MAPK activation by PD98059 minimized wild-type GFP-HIF-1α activity to the level of the mutant S→A form but had only a small effect on the transcriptional activity of the I→A/S→A and I→A mutants (Fig. 4B). These data show that disruption of the NES (the I→A mutation) can rescue the lack of phosphorylation (the S→A mutation). In accordance, the I→A mutation also phenocopies the phosphomimetic S→E mutation as far as resistance of HIF-1α to PD98059 is concerned (compare Figs. 1 and 4). To substantiate these findings in additional cell types, human embryonic kidney (HEK293-T) and hepatoma (Huh7) cells were transiently transfected with full-length GFP-HIF-1α or its mutant forms and examined by fluorescence microscopy. In full agreement with the results previously obtained in HeLa cells, Fig. 5 shows that wild-type GFP-HIF-1α was predominantly nuclear (panels b), the phosphorylation-deficient form S→A was mislocalized into the cytoplasm (panels c), and the I→A/S→A mutant form, lacking both the NES and the MAPK-phosphorylation sites, re-accumulated inside the nucleus (panels d) in all transfected cells of both cell lines. Taken together, these data show that disruption of the HIF-1α NES suppresses the mutation at the MAPK phosphoacceptor site and activates the phosphorylation-deficient mutants of HIF-1α. Moreover, the HIF-1α NES mutants become largely resistant to elimination of phosphorylation resulting from either mutation in HIF-1α or MAPK pathway inhibition. This strongly suggests that the phosphorylation-sensitive HIF-1α NES characterized in this work is an important mediator of the control that the MAPK pathway exerts on HIF-1 activity. Overexpression of Wild-type and Mutant MTD Modulates the Localization and Activity of Endogenous HeLa Cell HIF-1α— To extend our analysis, we studied the effect of wild-type or mutant MTD on the localization and activity of endogenous HeLa cell HIF-1α. As wild-type MTD is a good phosphorylation substrate for MAPK but a weak interaction partner of CRM1 (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3B), our results would predict that, when overexpressed, it should compete with endogenous HIF-1α for MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, thus impairing nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. On the other hand, overexpression of MTD(S→A), which is a bad MAPK substrate but interacts readily with CRM1, should inhibit the interaction between unmodified endogenous HIF-1α and CRM1, thus causing nuclear retention and stimulation of HIF-1α under conditions that eliminate MAPK activity (i.e. upon treatment with PD98059). To test these predictions, HeLa cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged MTD or MTD(S→A) were induced to express endogenous HIF-1α by DMOG and were then subjected to double immunofluorescence staining with anti-HIF-1α and anti-FLAG antibodies or analyzed in reporter gene assays. In nontransfected cells, endogenous DMOG-induced HIF-1α was found exclusively inside the nucleus, whereas in cells overexpressing FLAG-MTD, HIF-1α was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 6A, panels a–d). Accordingly, overexpression of FLAG-MTD caused dramatic reduction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6B), corroborating our prediction that MTD should inhibit both phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α. When the cells were treated with PD98059, DMOG-induced HIF-1α and FLAG-MTD were distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 6A, panels e–h), indicating that inhibition of the MAPK pathway caused nuclear export not only of endogenous HIF-1α but also of FLAG-MTD. In cells overexpressing the phosphorylation-deficient FLAG-MTD(S→A) form, the nuclear accumulation of endogenous HIF-1α was not affected, whereas FLAG-MTD(S→A) was itself largely cytoplasmic (Fig. 6A, panels i–l). Exposing the cells to PD98059 caused the partial redistribution of endogenous HIF-1α to the cytoplasm, except in the cells that overexpressed FLAG-MTD(S→A), in which HIF-1α remained exclusively nuclear (Fig. 6A, panels m–p). In agreement, when MTD(S→A) was overexpressed, endogenous HIF-1 activity was not only mostly preserved but also became largely insensitive to inhibition of the MAPK pathway (Fig. 6B). This supports our hypothesis that MTD(S→A), by its ability to interact with CRM1, should inhibit nuclear export of unphosphorylated HIF-1α. Thus, overexpression of MTD or MTD(S→A) affects HIF-1α localization and modulates HIF-1 activity by interfering with MAPK- or CRM1-dependent functions, respectively. Two major ways to control HIF-1α have been previously widely described. The first relies on hydroxylation-dependent degradation/inactivation and appears to be the preferential means of matching HIF-1 activity to oxygen and metabolite levels (6Pan Y. Mansfield K.D. Bertozzi C.C. Rudenko V. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The second does not depend directly on oxygen levels, involves control of HIF-1α protein synthesis via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, and may link HIF-1 activity to the growth state of the cell (10Bernardi R. Guernah I. Jin D. Grisendi S. Alimonti A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Cordon-Cardo C. Simon M.C. Rafii S. Pandolfi P.P.

Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). Our work now suggests an additional oxygen-independent mechanism that operates downstream of the synthesis and stabilization steps, involves regulated nuclear export of HIF-1α, responds to MAPK pathway activation, and may thus connect HIF-1 activity to cell proliferation. Its principal component lies in the MTD of HIF-1α in a form of an atypical hydrophobic CRM1-dependent NES which is “masked” when one or two proximal serine residues are phosphorylated by p42/44 MAPK. As also shown for a few other shuttling transcription factors (24Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 25Lee H. Bai W. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2006; 24: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), inhibition of nuclear export by phosphorylation can be a very efficient way to ensure exclusive nuclear localization and full activation of HIF-1α. This may occur after growth factor stimulation at normoxia or under hypoxia which can also activate itself the MAPK pathway (28Bardos J.I. Ashcroft M. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Bilton R.L. Booker G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The identified NES in HIF-1α (MEDIKILI; conserved hydrophobic residues in boldface) deviates from the recently proposed wide CRM1-dependent hydrophobic NES consensus (ΦX2–3ΦX2–3ΦXΦ; Φ= Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, Met; X = any amino acid; 21, 30) by being atypical in terms of hydrophobic residue composition and spacing. Nevertheless, localization experiments in the presence of leptomycin B (Fig. 3A) as well as immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3, B–D) suggest that this NES physically interacts with CRM1 when the neighboring SP sites are not phosphorylated. We were, however, unable to provide evidence for direct binding of CRM1 to the HIF-1α NES in the presence of Ran-GTP using recombinant bacterially expressed proteins in vitro (data not shown). It is known that many NESs that depend on CRM1 bind to it with low affinity making in vitro reconstitution of nuclear export complexes extremely difficult (21Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Kutay U. Guttinger S. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This may also be the case for the atypical HIF-1α NES. Alternatively, its interaction with CRM1 may require additional cellular factors, such as RanBP3 (21Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Kutay U. Guttinger S. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), or be indirect through an unknown adaptor protein that recognizes the conserved hydrophobic residues. Our work does not exclude additional effects of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation on the HIF-1α pathway. Although the transcriptional inactivity of the HIF-1α S→A mutant matches closely its nuclear exclusion, the reduction in the activity of wild-type HIF-1α in the presence of PD98059 or FLAG-MTD (Fig. 1B, Fig. 4B, and Fig. 6B) is disproportionate to its cytoplasmic mis-localization (Fig. 1A, panel b, Fig. 4A, panel g, and Fig. 6A, panels a–d; respectively). Steady-state distribution of HIF-1α should normally represent a snapshot of a dynamic transport process that involves continuous and rapid shuttling in and out of the nucleus. It is therefore possible that when nuclear export of HIF-1α is stimulated by MAPK inhibition, the nuclear resident time of HIF-1α may still be long enough for optical detection but too short for efficient heterodimerization, binding to DNA, and transcriptional activation. Alternatively, it is also possible that inhibition of HIF-1α phosphorylation by PD98059 or FLAG-MTD negatively affects additional steps such as the interaction of HIF-1α with co-transcriptional activators. In support of this second hypothesis, both FLAG-MTD and GFP-MTD accumulate inside the nucleus (Fig. 2C, panel b, and Fig. 6A, panel b), although their small size should allow free diffusion between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. This indicates that HIF-1α MTD may contain, in addition to the NES, an uncharted sequence that upon phosphorylation promotes docking to an unknown nuclear factor required for optimal HIF-1α activity. Finally, treatment with PD98059 causes minor but significant inhibition of activity even in the cases of the phosphomimetic S→E (Fig. 1B) or NES I→A (Fig. 4B) HIF-1α mutants suggesting indirect effects of MAPK on HIF-1-mediated transcription, such as phosphorylation of CBP/p300 and stimulation of its interaction with HIF-1α (31Sang N.

In any case, the characterization of the MAPK-targeted NES on HIF-1α opens up the way for further investigation of HIF-1α nuclear transport and its significance for regulating the hypoxia response pathway, especially under conditions that stimulate the MAPK pathway and cellular proliferation. Our findings also offer proof-of-principle that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking may be an intriguing target for controlling HIF-1 activity under pathological conditions involving tissue hypoxia. We are grateful to the other members of our laboratories for their help and useful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2073672336,"Increased distal nephron sodium absorption in response to aldosterone involves Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, which blocks its ability to ubiquitylate ENaC and increases apical membrane channel density by reducing its endocytosis. Our prior work (Liang, X., Peters, K. W., Butterworth, M. B., and Frizzell, R. A. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 16323-16332) showed that aldosterone selectively increased 14-3-3 protein isoform expression and that the association of 14-3-3beta with phospho-Nedd4-2 was required for sodium transport stimulation. The knockdown of 14-3-3beta alone nearly eliminated the response to aldosterone, despite the expression of other 14-3-3 isoforms in cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. To further examine this marked effect of 14-3-3beta knockdown, we evaluated the hypothesis that phospho-Nedd4-2 binding prefers a heterodimer composed of two different 14-3-3 isoforms. We tested this concept in polarized CCD cells using RNA interference and assays of sodium transport and of the interaction of Nedd4-2 with 14-3-3epsilon, a second aldosterone-induced isoform. As observed previously for 14-3-3beta knockdown, small interfering RNA-induced reduction of 14-3-3epsilon markedly attenuated aldosterone-stimulated ENaC expression and sodium transport and increased the interaction of Nedd4-2 with ENaC toward prealdosterone levels. After aldosterone induction, 14-3-3beta and 14-3-3epsilon were quantitatively co-immunoprecipitated from CCD cell lysates, and the association of both isoforms with Nedd4-2 increased. Finally, the knockdown of either 14-3-3beta or 14-3-3epsilon reduced the association of Nedd4-2 with the other isoform. We conclude that the two aldosterone-induced 14-3-3 isoforms, beta and epsilon, interact with phospho-Nedd4-2 as an obligatory heterodimer, blocking its interaction with ENaC and thereby increasing apical ENaC density and sodium transport."

TRPM channels, including TRPM2, show considerable permeability to Ca2+ and other divalent cations, with the exception of TRPM4/5 channels that are selective for monovalent cations (8Perraud A.L.

Such residues are determinants of selective permeation to cations, especially Ca2+, in several ion channels (15Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 27Hille B. Ionic Channels in Excitable Membranes. Third Ed.

Indeed these residues are recognized to be important in TRPV channels (19Garcia-Martinez C. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Merino J.M. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol.

Alanine substitution in TRPM4 (D984A) or TRPM6 (D1031A) leads to loss of function (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Wang C. Zhu M.X. Voets T. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TRPM7 channel carrying the D1054A mutation is functional and has virtually the same pore properties as wild type (WT), including the Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeation (23Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Neutralization of Glu-1029 in TRPM6 or Glu-1052 in TRPM7 in the linker region between the pore helix and the selective filter significantly reduces Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeability. Conversely, incorporation of negative charge to the equivalent Gln-977 in TRPM4 or Gln-914 in TRPM8 substantially increases Ca2+ permeability (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Wang C.

We found that the residues Glu-960, Gln-981, and Asp-987 contribute significantly to defining Ca2+ permeation and Glu-1022 to Mg2+ permeation of the TRPM2 channel. Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfection—The construct encoding human TRPM2 (8Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P.

Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used. Mutations were introduced using QuikChange system (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The constructs encoding subunit concatemers with a C-terminal EE epitope were made as follows. Firstly, the sequence (nucleotides 1–700) encoding part of the TRPM2 N terminus (TRPM2N) was amplified by PCR using Pfu and forward primer 5′-TCTCTAGAATGGAGCCCTCAGCCCTGAGG-3′ (XbaI sequence underlined and TRPM2 sequence in italic) and reverse primer 5′-TCAGTACAGGTAGAGCAAGGTGTCC-3′. The resultant PCR product containing XbaI site was inserted into pCR2.1 following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) to generate TRPM2N-pCR2.1. Secondly, the vector sequence between EcoRI and XbaI and the TRPM2 sequence between XbaI and SacI were separately excised from TRPM2N-pCR2.1 and ligated with the sequence between SacI and EcoRI from TRPM2-EE-pcDNA3.1 to generate TRPM2-EE-pCR2.1. Finally, the TRPM2-EE sequence between XbaI and HindIII was excised from TRPM2-EE-pCR2.1 to replace the sequence between XbaI and PmeI in TRPM2-Myc-pcDNA3.1 to produce the constructs encoding concatenated subunits (see Fig. 4A). Maintenance of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and transient transfection with plasmids were described previously (29Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J.

Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and detected using primary rabbit anti-EE antibody (1:2000 dilution; Bethyl Laboratories) and secondary goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Electrophysiological Recording—Whole-cell recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B amplifier at room temperature 24–48 h after transfection as described previously (29Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H.

Cells were held at –40 mV and voltage ramps with a 1-s duration from –120 mV to 80 mV were applied every 5 s. The currents at –80 mV denoted in the figures by circles (see Figs. 1, B and C, 3, A–D, and 4, C and D) were obtained from the current responses to voltage ramps. In some experiments, cells were held constantly at –40 mV or 40 mV, and the currents were plotted as continuous lines (see Fig. 3E).

After cell-attached configuration was established in standard extracellular solution, application of voltage ramps started and continued throughout experiments, during which whole-cell configuration was achieved at least 2 min after the external solution was replaced with the indicated extracellular solutions. The flufenamic acid/anthranilic acid-insensitive current components were negligible (e.g. Fig. 1B), and no subtraction from the total currents was made. The reversal potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials as we described previously (33Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol.

Ion activities were used, converted from ion concentrations using the following coefficients: γNa = 0.75, γCa = 0.28, and γMg = 0.34. The relative permeability PX/PNa (X = calcium or magnesium) were derived using the Goldman-HodgkinKatz equation (8Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q.

Data Analysis—All the data, where appropriate, are presented as mean ± S.E. The calcium inhibition was estimated by fitting to the Hill equation: I/I (%) = (100–C)/[1+ ([calcium]/IC50)n], where I is the sustained current as a percentage of the peak current (Ip), C is the Ca2+-insensitive current component, IC50 is the concentration producing half-maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. Curve fitting was carried using Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Comparisons were made using the Student's t test between two groups or analysis of variance (post hoc Tukey) between multiple groups with significance at the level of p < 0.05. Effects of Mutating Acidic Pore Residues on Functional Channel Expression—Cells expressing WT TRPM2 channels responded to a supramaximal concentration of intracellular ADPR (1 mm) with robust currents that exhibited typical linear I/V relationship (Fig. 1B), as reported previously (29Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Mei Z.Z. Xia R. Beech D.J. Jiang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38748-38756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression of D1002A and E1010A mutants yielded current responses and I/V relationships that were virtually the same as WT (Fig. 1, B and C). D964A, E994A, and D1012A mutants showed similar currents (Fig. 1C) and I/V relationships (data not shown). There were no currents in cells expressing E960A and D987A mutants. Currents for the E1022A mutant were significantly reduced when compared with WT (Fig. 1C) despite normal surface expression shown by biotin-labeling analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). We made further substitutions at positions 960 and 987 (Fig. 1C). Although the charge-conserving mutation E960D led to complete loss of function, D987E was functional, albeit the currents being slightly smaller. Channel function was abolished by charge neutralization of Glu-960 or Asp-987 by substitution with other residues (Fig. 1C). Effects of Mutating Acidic Pore Residues on Ca2+ and Mg2+ Permeability—We next examined Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeability relative to Na+ permeability of WT and functional mutant channels. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. The WT channel showed substantial permeation to both Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PCa/PNa ∼ 0.9 and PMg/PNa ∼ 0.5), as described previously (8Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 9Sano Y. Inamura K.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All the functional alanine mutants, except E1022A, displayed similar Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeability to WT. E1022A mutation resulted in doubling of the Mg2+ permeability with no change in the Ca2+ permeability. In contrast, D987E mutation conferred significant increase in the Ca2+ permeability with no effect on the Mg2+ permeability. These data suggest that Glu-1022 and Asp-987 have distinct roles in the Mg2+ and Ca2+ permeation of the TRPM2 channel. An Additional Residue Differentially Influencing Ca2+ and Mg2+ Permeability—We also examined the role of Gln-981 located in the linker region of the TRPM2 channel. This residue is also present in TRPM4/5/8 channels but is replaced with glutamate in the more Ca2+-permeable TRPM1/3/6/7 channels (Fig. 1A). Q981E mutant was functional (Fig. 1, B and C) and exhibited significant increase in the Ca2+ permeability with no change in the Mg2+ permeability (Fig. 2). Ca2+ Inhibition of Na+-carrying Currents of D987E Mutant—Unlike the sustained currents observed at WT, the currents for D987E mutant were transient in extracellular solution containing Na+ as the major cation and low concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Ca2+, the currents for both WT and D987E mutant were stable but considerably smaller (supplemental Fig. 2), likely reflecting the lack of Ca2+-dependent facilitation (34McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.Z. Perraud A.L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11002-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 35Starkus J. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (but absence of Mg2+), the currents for D987E mutant were large and also declined. The current decline was, however, readily reversed upon the subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the current decline primarily results from the inhibition rather than desensitization of the ion-conducting channels. Further analysis showed that the current inhibition by Ca2+ was concentration-dependent, with an IC50 of 580 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.7 (Fig. 3, C and D). We also measured currents in isotonic CaCl2 solution. Currents carried by Ca2+ were largely sustained for WT but diminished rapidly for D987E mutant (supplemental Fig. 3). To explore whether the current inhibition by Ca2+ resulted from entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the pore, we measured Na+ outward currents at +40 mV to prevent extracellular Ca2+ from entering the pore. We also measured Na+ inward currents at –40 mV, when extracellular Ca2+ can readily enter the pore. As illustrated in Fig. 3E, the outward currents at +40 mV showed minimal decline, whereas the inward currents at –40 mV were transient. Ca2+ and Mg2+ Permeability of Subunit Concatemer Channels—Loss of channel function resulting from mutation of Glu-960 (E960D/Q) and Asp-987 (D987N) prevented us from further studying the role of these two highly conserved residues in Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeation of TRPM2 channel. In an effort to overcome the difficulty, we concatenated WT and mutant subunits (WT-E960D, WT-E960Q, and WT-D987N) (Fig. 4A) and sought to express functional channels comprising WT and mutant subunits. We also made WT-WT and WT-D987E concatemers. As shown by Western blotting, the protein expression was similar among the concatemers but significantly lower when compared with WT or mutant subunit alone (Fig. 4B). Expression of all the concatemers, except WT-E960Q, resulted in ADPR-evoked currents with typical linear I/V (Fig. 4, C and D). The same results were obtained with concatemers in which mutations were introduced in the first subunit (E960D-WT, E960Q-WT, and D987N-WT) (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that both WT and mutant subunits contribute to the channel assembly. Furthermore, the WT-WT concatemer exhibited the same Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeability as WT (Fig. 5C), providing functional evidence indicating that subunit concatenation imposes negligible constraints affecting the ion-conducting pore. The concatemers containing D987E mutant subunit (WT-D987E and D987E-WT) were more permeable to Ca2+ than WT-WT, consistent with the idea that D987E mutation increased the Ca2+ permeability. However, the concatemers having D987N mutant subunit (WT-D987N and D987N-WT) displayed similar Ca2+ permeability to WT-WT (Fig. 5B). These contrasting data support the notion that the side-chain length of residue at position 987 influences the Ca2+ permeation. Most interestingly, the concatemers containing E960D mutant subunit (WT-E960D and E960D-WT) became significantly less Ca2+-permeable (Fig. 5B), indicating that E960D mutation reduced the Ca2+ permeability. Glu-960 and Asp-987 Are Important for Functional Expression of TRPM2 Channel—Charge-conserving or charge-neutralizing mutation of Glu-960 prevented channel function (Fig. 1), despite negligible effects on total and membrane protein expression (supplemental Fig. 1). Loss of function resulting from the E960D mutation is intriguing, considering the fact that aspartate is present in the corresponding position of TRPM4/5 channels. The exact reasons are unclear and could relate to subtle differences in the local structure due to adjacent residues including proline (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the WT-E960D but not WT-E960Q concatemer formed functional channels. Such differentiating results suggest that glutamate at this position and particularly its negative charge are vital for functional expression of TRPM2 channel. As for Glu-960, alanine substitution of Asp-987 had no effect on cell surface expression and yet imparted functional lethality (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). These results are comparable with those reported in studies of Asp-984 in TRPM4 (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Wang C. Zhu M.X. Voets T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22899-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Asp-1031 in TRPM6 (25Topala C.N. Groenestege W.T. Thébault S. van den Berg D. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but differ from those of Asp-1052 in TRPM7 (23Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25817-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that substitution of Asp-987 with several other residues, except negatively charged glutamate, also resulted in loss of function (Fig. 1C). Thus the results from present and previous studies indicate that aspartate at this position is important for functional expression of TRPM2/4/6 channels. Glu-960, Asp-987, and Gln-981 as Determinants of Ca2+ Permeability—Glu-960, or its equivalent, is conserved in Ca2+-permeable TRPM channels but is replaced by aspartate in the Ca2+-impermeable TRPM4/5 channels (Fig. 1A). Thus it would be informative if the E960D mutant were functional. Although it was not, we adopted the subunit concatenation strategy and showed that the concatemer channels carrying the E960D mutation (WT-E960D and E960D-WT) exhibited reduced Ca2+ permeability (Fig. 5), consistent with a significant role of Glu-960 or the equivalent residue in defining the Ca2+ permeation of TRPM channels. Glu-960 is close to the extracellular end of S5 and therefore is possibly situated on the wide external pore vestibule (15Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified residues in this microdomain that interact with and mediate functional modulation of TRP channels by extracellular cations. These include Glu-543 in potentiation of TRPC5 by La3+ and H+ (36Jung S. Mühle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol.

S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and His-896 in recovery from H+-enhanced inactivation of TRPM5 (39Liu D. Zhang Z. Liman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Glu-960 may also directly interact with extracellular Ca2+. E960D mutation shortens the side chain by one CH2 group and may, for this reason, reduce its interaction with Ca2+. Asp-987 is the only fully conserved negatively charged residue in the ion-selective filter of TRPM channels and also the only negatively charged residue in the ion-selective filter of TRPM2 channel (Fig. 1A). The ion-selective filter is located at the narrow part of the ion-conducting pathway and is known to play a major role in the ion-selective permeation of TRPV and TRPM channels (15Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, the role of the conserved aspartate residue in the Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeation of TRPM channels has not been demonstrated due to difficulties associated with loss of function by alanine substitution (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Wang C. Zhu M.X. Voets T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22899-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Topala C.N. Groenestege W.T. Thébault S. van den Berg D. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). We have shown here that functional D987E mutant exhibited significantly increased Ca2+ permeability (Fig. 2B). The D987E mutation also conferred concentration-dependent inhibition of Na+ currents by Ca2+. The inhibition was reversed by removing extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3B) or prevented by a positive membrane potential (Fig. 3E). The simplest interpretation is that Asp-987 interacts with permeant Ca2+ and that the D987E mutation, which lengthens the side chain, enhances the interaction with Ca2+ by extending the negative charge further into the ion-conducting pathway. Such an interpretation is supported by the findings that the WT-D987E but not WT-D987N concatemer showed increased Ca2+ permeability and Ca2+ inhibition of Na+ currents (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 5). Lack of effects on Ca2+ permeability and Ca2+ inhibition of Na+ currents for the WT-D987N concatemer, however, should not be taken as evidence against the importance of the negative charge of Asp-987 because the concatemer channels still carry two WT subunits that may suffice to retain the ion permeation properties. TRPM2/4/5/8 channels contain glutamine (position 981 in TRPM2) in the linker region between the pore helix and the ion-selective filter; it is replaced with glutamate in other TRPM channels that are more permeable to Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). As expected, the Q981E mutation significantly enhanced the Ca2+ permeability (Fig. 2C) (24Mederos y Schnitzler M. Wäring J. Gudermann T. Chubanov V. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution with glutamate of Gln-977 in TRPM4 or Gln-914 in TRPM8 increases the Ca2+ permeability, whereas neutralization of the corresponding Glu-1029 in TRPM6 or Glu-1052 in TRPM7 decreases the Ca2+ permeability (22Nilius B.

Wäring J. Gudermann T. Chubanov V. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results strongly support that this position also contributes significantly to defining the Ca2+ permeation property of TRPM channels. Glu-1022 as a Determinant of Mg2+ Permeability—With the exception of TRPM4/5, TRPM channels are also permeable to Mg2+ (13Togashi K. Hara Y. Tominaga T. Higashi T. Konishi Y. Mori Y. Tominaga M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1804-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23Li M. Du J. Jiang J. Ratzan W. Su L.T. Runnels L.W. Yue L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22540-22548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Here we observed no change in the Mg2+ permeability in any of the TRPM2 mutant channels except E1022A (Fig. 2). Like Q981E mutation in TRPM2, Q914E mutation in TRPM8 had no effect on the Mg2+ permeability despite significant increase in the Ca2+ permeability (24Mederos y Schnitzler M. Wäring J. Gudermann T. Chubanov V. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that permeation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ engages distinct and yet overlapping sets of residues. This notion is consistent with the finding that E1022A mutation only increased the Mg2+ permeability (Fig. 2D). In summary, we have provided evidence that three pore residues (Glu-960, Gln-981, and Asp-987) contribute significantly to defining the Ca2+ permeation of TRPM2 channel, and a fourth residue (Glu-1022) contributes to Mg2+ permeation. Combined with results from previous studies (18Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2072087379,"When acutely exposed to a cold environment, mammals shiver to generate heat. During prolonged cold exposure, shivering is replaced by adaptive adrenergic nonshivering thermogenesis with increased heat production in brown adipose tissue due to activation of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). This cold acclimation is associated with chronically increased sympathetic stimulation of skeletal muscle, which may increase the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak via destabilized ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) channel complexes. Here, we use genetically engineered UCP1-deficient (UCP1-KO) mice that rely completely on shivering in the cold. We examine soleus muscle, which participates in shivering, and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle, a distal and superficial muscle that does not shiver. Soleus muscles of cold-acclimated UCP1-KO mice exhibited severe RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion, as well as markedly decreased SR Ca(2+) release and force during contractions. In stark contrast, the RyR1 channel complexes were little affected, and Ca(2+) and force were not decreased in FDB muscles of cold-acclimated UCP1-KO mice. These results indicate that activation of UCP1-mediated heat production in brown adipose tissue during cold exposure reduces the necessity for shivering and thus prevents the development of severe dysfunction in shivering muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2020591070,"Based on a structure-assisted sequence alignment we designed 11 focused libraries at residues in the active site of transaldolase B from Escherichia coli and screened them for their ability to synthesize fructose 6-phosphate from dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate using a newly developed color assay. We found one positive variant exhibiting a replacement of Phe(178) to Tyr. This mutant variant is able not only to transfer a dihydroxyacetone moiety from a ketose donor, fructose 6-phosphate, onto an aldehyde acceptor, erythrose 4-phosphate (14 units/mg), but to use it as a substrate directly in an aldolase reaction (7 units/mg). With a single amino acid replacement the fructose-6-phosphate aldolase activity was increased considerably (>70-fold compared with wild-type). Structural studies of the wild-type and mutant protein suggest that this is due to a different H-bond pattern in the active site leading to a destabilization of the Schiff base intermediate. Furthermore, we show that a homologous replacement has a similar effect in the human transaldolase Taldo1 (aldolase activity, 14 units/mg). We also demonstrate that both enzymes TalB and Taldo1 are recognized by the same polyclonal antibody."

https://openalex.org/W1984710714,"In this study, we analyzed the roles for AML1/RUNX1 in the regulation of the c-mpl promoter. Wild-type AML1 activated the c-mpl promoter through the proximal AML-binding site in luciferase assays using 293T and HeLa cells. In accord with this result, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AML1 bound to this site. Next, we analyzed the function of AML1 using a mutant of AML1 lacking the C terminus (AML1dC), which was originally found in a patient with myelodysplastic syndromes. AML1dC dominant-negatively suppressed transcriptional activity of wild-type AML1. However, unexpectedly, AML1dC-transduced murine c-Kit(+)Sca1(+)Lineage(-) cells expressed c-mpl mRNA and c-Mpl protein more abundantly than mock-transduced cells, which led to the enhanced thrombopoietin-mediated proliferation. Moreover, when AML1dC was induced to express during the development of hematopoietic cells from embryonic stem (ES) cells, AML1dC augmented the c-Mpl expression on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, we found that early hematopoietic cells that derived from AML1(+/-) ES cells expressed c-Mpl more intensely than those that developed from wild-type ES cells. In contrast, AML1dC hardly affected c-Mpl expression and maturation of megakaryocytes. As for the mechanism of the different roles of AML1 in the regulation of the c-mpl promoter, we found that AML1 forms a complex with a transcription repressor mSin3A on the c-mpl promoter in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, although it forms a complex with a transcription activator p300 on the same promoter in megakaryocytic cells. Together, these data indicate that AML1 can regulate the c-mpl promoter both positively and negatively by changing the binding partner according to cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2108337464,"A subset of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the thrombin receptor (PAR1), elicits mitogenic responses. Thrombin also activates Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and activating protein (AP-1) -mediated gene expression in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, whereas the nonmitogenic agonist carbachol does not. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore differential gene induction by these agonists and revealed that the matricellular protein cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) is selectively induced by thrombin. The ability of GPCR agonists to induce Cyr61 parallels their ability to activate RhoA; agonist-stimulated Cyr61 expression is inhibited by C3 toxin. When Cyr61 is down-regulated using short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), thrombin-induced DNA synthesis is significantly attenuated. When Cyr61 expression is induced, it appears in the extracellular compartment and on the cell surface. Extracellular Cyr61 interacts with alpha(5), alpha(6), and beta(1) integrins on these cells, and monoclonal antibodies directed against alpha(5) and beta(1) integrins inhibit thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. Functional blockade of Cyr61 with soluble heparin or anti-Cyr61 antibodies also inhibits thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. Thus Cyr61 is a highly inducible, secreted extracellular factor through which GPCR and RhoA signaling pathways engage integrins that contribute to GPCR-mediated proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2049334725,"Molecular fragmentation into three products poses an analytical challenge to theory and experiment alike. We used translational spectroscopy and high-level ab initio calculations to explore the highly debated three-body dissociation of sym-triazine to three hydrogen cyanide molecules. Dissociation was induced by charge exchange between the sym-triazine radical cation and cesium. Calculated state energies and electronic couplings suggest that reduction initially produces a population of sym-triazine partitioned between the 3s Rydberg and pi* <-- n electronically excited manifolds. Analysis of the topology of these manifolds, along with momentum correlation in the dissociation products, suggests that a conical intersection of two potential energy surfaces in the 3s Rydberg manifold leads to stepwise dissociation, whereas a four-fold glancing intersection in the pi* <-- n manifold leads to a symmetric concerted reaction."

This is the first structural report for a bivalve lectin. Lectins are multivalent carbohydrate-binding proteins that play important roles in the social life of cells. A growing repertoire of lectins has been identified in invertebrates (1Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Odom E.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), where these molecules are involved in self/nonself recognition (2Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Fink N.E. Elola M.T. Marsh A.G. Snowden A. Odom E.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 55-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, lectins play a role in aggregation mechanisms in corals and sponges (3Muller W.E. Dorn A. Uhlenbruck G. Acta Histochem. Suppl. 1985; 31: 37-46PubMed Google Scholar) or in sperm-egg recognition in oysters (4Moy G.W. Springer S.A. Adams S.L. Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1993-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Lectin mediation of symbiosis with algae or bacteria has been observed in coral (5Jimbo M. Koike K. Sakai R. Muramoto K.

Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the most common function assessed for lectins in marine invertebrates is their role in innate immunity by specific binding of polysaccharide-coated pathogenic bacteria (7Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 38: 128-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vasta G.R. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Glycoconjugates: Composition, Structure, and Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 593-634Google Scholar). Different lectins have been identified in bivalves and they most frequently belong to the C-type lectin family. Proteins from this group of calcium-dependent lectins have been reported in oysters (9Minamikawa M. Hine M. Russell S. Huber P. Duignan P. Lumsden J.S.

C-type lectins are characterized by a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) 3The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; αMeMan, α-methyl-mannoside; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; nona-Asn, asparagine-linked complex type nonasaccharide; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HA, hemagglutination; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion. with a conserved fold and the involvement of a calcium ion in carbohydrate binding (14Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mannose-binding protein was the first one to be described (15Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The CRD belongs to a larger family sharing a common fold and is referred to as the C-type lectin-like domain (16Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Codakine is a 14-kDa C-type lectin purified from the gill of the tropical clam Codakia orbicularis (Linné 1758) by affinity chromatography on a mannose-agarose column (17Gourdine J.-P. Smith-Ravin E.J. Prep. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2002; 32: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It forms homodimers and heterodimers with isoforms 1 (NCBI accession number AAX19697) and 2 (NCBI accession number ABQ40396) (13Gourdine J.-P. Smith-Ravin E.J. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2007; 22: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 19-amino acid peptide signal suggests that the lectin travels through a secretory pathway. The 129-amino acid sequence of the mature protein has significant sequence similarities to various fish lectins (33%). Sequence homologies have, moreover, been observed between codakine and mermaid nematodes (18Gourdine J.-P. Markiv A. Smith-Ravin J. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2007; 23: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results point to the probable role for the gill-located codakine in either antibacterial protection or in the recognition of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, symbionts that are needed for the survival of C. orbicularis in sandy anaerobic environments (19Berg C.J. Alatalo P. Aquaculture. 1984; 39: 165-179Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present data on the specificity and affinity of codakine for various monosaccharides and oligosaccharides using inhibition of hemagglutination, glycan microarrays, and microcalorimetry. The native crystal structure displays a new covalent dimerization mode. The structure of the complex with a high affinity biantennary N-glycan displays a new oligosaccharide binding mode where both antennae are in contact with the protein. Protein Purification—The previously described protein purification protocol (13Gourdine J.-P. Smith-Ravin E.J. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2007; 22: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Briefly, about 5 g of nitrogen frozen gill tissue of C. orbicularis was crushed with a pestle in 50 ml of buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (T buffer). After a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against fresh T-buffer four times. Insoluble matter was pelleted by centrifugation as described above. The 0.25-μm filtered supernatant was loaded onto a mannose-agarose column pre-equilibrated with T-buffer. After washing with T-buffer containing 1 m NaCl, codakine was eluted by 0.1 m EDTA in T-buffer. The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively during 2 days at 4 °C against T-buffer. The electrophoretic profile of eluted fractions was checked on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient and optical density at 280 nm were used to determine the concentration of codakine. Hemagglutination Assays—Hemagglutination tests were performed using microtiter plates with U-bottom wells by the 2-fold serial dilution method. 25 μl of rabbit erythrocytes (2% in NaCl; Biomérieux) were mixed with serially diluted codakine in T-buffer (described above), starting with a concentration of 1 mg/ml. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the plates were read. One unit of hemagglutination activity was defined as the highest dilution of lectin giving a complete hemagglutination (HA unit, μg/ml). For the inhibition tests, a dilution of codakine equivalent to four units of HA, corresponding to 15.6 μg/ml, was used. Inhibition of hemagglutination was assayed by 2-fold serial dilutions of the following sugars in T-buffer: d-mannose, d-galactose, d-glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, l-fucose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and d-rhamnose, each starting at a concentration of 100 mm. Glycan Microarray Analysis—Purified codakine (1 mg/ml) was labeled with the Alexa Fluor® 488 protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The purification of Alexa-labeled codakine was performed by mannose-agarose chromatography, as described above. Glycan microarray tests were carried out by the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (21Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Preparation of Nonasaccharide-Asn 1—The protected compound Fmoc-1 was prepared from egg yolk by acid hydrolysis of the disialylated derivative of Fmoc-1 in analogy to the published procedures (22Kajihara Y. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto N. Sasaki K. Sakakibara T. Juneja L.R. Chemistry. 2004; 10: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Seko A. Kotetsu M. Nishizono M. Enoki Y. Ibrahim H.R. Juneja L.R. Kim M. Yamamoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For Fmoc deprotection (Scheme 1), a 5-mg portion of Fmoc-1 was dissolved in H2O/MeOH (75 μl; 30:9), and 0.5 m NaOH (20 μl) was added in four portions. After shaking for 10 min (TLC; 2-propanol, 1 m ammonium acetate), the suspension was acidified to pH 4–5 with 10% acetic acid. Subsequently, the suspension was diluted with 0.1 m NH4HCO3 to a final volume of 200 μl. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 30 (16: 60); flow rate, 1 ml/min; eluent, 0.1 m NH4HCO3; detection, 214 and 260 nm). The peak eluting at 76 min was collected and lyophilized five times to yield 3.3 mg of nonasaccharide-Asn 1 (74.4%). The purity of 1 (22Kajihara Y. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto N. Sasaki K. Sakakibara T. Juneja L.R. Chemistry. 2004; 10: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was confirmed by 360-MHz 1H NMR in D2O (Fig. S1). Titration Microcalorimetry—Thermodynamic parameters were estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a Microcal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All experiments were carried out at 298 K. Ligands and lectins were prepared in T-buffer (described above). Titration of codakine binding was performed in a cell with a volume of 1.447 ml by 30 injections of 10 μl of ligand with 5-min intervals while stirring at 310 rpm. Blank titration with buffer was used as a reference. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal with ΔH (enthalpy change), Ka (association constant), and n (number of binding sites/monomer) as adjustable parameters, from the classical relationship (24Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). For each ligand, experiments were repeated two or three times. Crystallization and Data Collection—Native codakine was concentrated to 15 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm α-methyl-mannoside on Vivaspin 5 kDa (Vivascience). All crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 2-μl drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of protein and reservoir solution at 20 °C. Initial crystallization screening was performed using the JCSG+ suite (Qiagen). After three months, crystals were obtained with a solution containing 0.2 m diammonium citrate, pH 5, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. A range of related conditions were used for co-crystallization of the complex between codakine (22 mg/ml in the same buffer) and nona-Asn (10 mm). One large cube-shaped crystal was obtained with 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.5, and 15% polyethylene glycol 4000 from a well with a broken lamella. Glycerol was added to 20% (v/v) to the crystallization solution as cryoprotectant prior to freezing crystals in a gaseous nitrogen stream at 100 K. Native and complex data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector (Quantum Corp.) on beamline ID14-1 and an ADSC Q315R detector on beamline ID29, respectively. Diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (25Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26Google Scholar).

A homology model was then constructed using FUGUE and ORCHESTRAR (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Among profile families identified by the FUGUE program, four templates with more than 25% identity with codakine were selected: human E-selectin (27Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C.

Structurally conserved regions were built by ORCHESTRAR, and loops were modeled by an ab initio approach. The conserved disulfide bridges and calcium ions were incorporated in the model that has been deposited in the Protein Model Data Base with accession number PM0074967. This model was then used for solving the codakine structure by molecular replacement with the program Phaser (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Win M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14552) Google Scholar). The program Acorn (32Foadi J. Woolfson M.M. Dodson E.J. Wilson K.S. Jia-xing Y. Chao-de Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was subsequently used to improve the electron density. A few correctly placed segments were chosen from the molecular replacement solution and used as starting coordinates for Acorn phasing. Among the smallest fragments tested, Acorn was able to phase the structure starting from the positions of eight sulfur atoms. The very high resolution (1.3 Å) of the native crystals allowed the program to calculate an excellent electron density map where ARpWarp (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) built the complete model. In the carbohydrate binding site, clear density could be observed for one calcium atom. Two glycerol molecules and one citrate molecule were also included in the model. The structure in complex with the nona-Asn was solved by molecular replacement with Molrep (34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar), using the native codakine structure as a search model. After the addition of a calcium ion and solvent molecules, clear residual electron density was visible for at least five sugar monomers. The oligosaccharide was docked manually into the electron density according to its chemical structure; no ambiguity at the glycosidic linkages was observed. For the refinement of each structure, 5% of the observations were immediately set aside for cross-validation analysis (35Brünger A. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and were used to monitor various refinement strategies. Manual corrections of the models using Coot (36Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23377) Google Scholar) were interspersed with cycles of maximum likelihood refinement with REFMAC (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). The two models were validated with the WhatIf suite (38Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) and deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 2vuv and 2vuz for the native codakine and the nonasaccharide complexes, respectively. The refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Miscellaneous Methods—Areas of buried surfaces were calculated with PISA (39Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol.

Overall Structure of Codakine—In the presence of α-methyl-mannoside (αMeMan), codakine crystallized in rock-shaped crystals of space group C2 that diffract to 1.3 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains one monomer, and a disulfide bond dimer is generated by the 2-fold axis. The monomer consists of a typical C-type lectin CRD with two parts: the lower part contains the two helices and three strands, and the upper part is composed of four strands and long loops (Fig. 1A) (40Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As predicted previously by bioinformatics, the mature protein lacks the 19-amino acid signal peptide present in the nucleotide sequence. The first two β-sheets and the last one run antiparallel, and a salt bridge is observed linking the termini of the peptide chain. For the C-terminal amino acid, clear density for the backbone was found but not for the side chain. Apart from this, all amino acids could be modeled in the density map. Additional density was observed near Cγ of Pro91, which appears to be a 4-hydroxyproline. Three intramolecular disulfide bonds are observed (Cys2–Cys13, Cys30–Cys124, Cys103–Cys116). The last two disulfide bridges are conserved in C-type lectins, linking the first helix to the last strand and one strand to a loop, respectively. The first bridge is present in long form C-type lectin-like domain (41Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One free cysteine, Cys53, is observed on the α2-helix. Cys44, the residue involved in the unique dimerization mode observed in this C-type lectin, is located at the beginning of the same helix. The dimer is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds from His51 and Glu55 to Asp11 and Gln8 on the other chain. Hydrophobic interactions were found for His51 stacking against Leu10 from the other chain and Leu10 against Phe9. Through the 2-fold symmetry, this creates a chain of contact between the 6 hydrophobic residues that extends to 20 Å; this results in a dimer interface area of about 400 Å2. C-type lectins usually contain two calcium ions in conserved binding sites referred to as site 1 and site 2 (40Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the present structure, only one calcium ion is present in site 2 that corresponds to the monosaccharide binding site. The calcium is coordinated to the acidic oxygen of Glu93, Glu101, and Asp113; to the oxygen atoms from amide Asn95 and Asn112; and to the main chain oxygen of Asp113. Analysis of the electron density indicates that αMeMan is not present in the site but is instead replaced by a well ordered glycerol molecule. Additional density was also observed and attributed to another glycerol molecule and a citrate molecule. Analysis of the glycerol located in the carbohydrate binding site indicates that two oxygen atoms establish the contacts classically observed for the carbohydrate ligand. These two oxygens complete the coordination sphere of the calcium. The first oxygen shows hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Asn95, Glu93, and Asn112, the second oxygen to the side chains of Glu101 and Asn112 and to the backbone oxygen of Asp113 (Fig. 1C). Affinity and Specificity for Monosaccharides—Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed using rabbit erythrocytes. Codakine shows a hemagglutination activity for a minimum of 3.9 μg/ml (one unit of HA). Inhibition of interaction between the lectin and the red blood cells was assayed with a range of monosaccharides. The highest inhibition power (using 4 HA units of codakine) was observed for d-mannose and l-fucose) (25 mm). Glucose and GlcNAc have a weaker effect (100 mm), and no inhibition was observed for d-galactose, d-rhamnose, d-neuraminic acid even at the higher concentration. Codakine can therefore be confirmed as a mannose/fucose-specific lectin, as was predicted from the EPN peptide signature in the carbohydrate binding site (40Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For a complete characterization of the interaction between codakine and the most efficient monosaccharides used in the hemagglutination assay, affinity and thermodynamic parameters were measured using ITC (Table 2). Mannose and GlcNAc have a rather low affinity with a dissociation constant of 0.27 and 0.46 mm, respectively. No affinity could be measured for galactose. The dissociation constant obtained for αMeMan is 52 μm, which is about 20 times more potent than the interaction with mannose, an increase frequently observed in lectin-carbohydrate interactions. The α-methyl-fucoside also appears to be a good inhibitor, as observed in hemagglutination assays. In all cases, the association is driven by enthalpy. The entropy term is weak and slightly favorable except for αMeMan. In this latter case, the strong enthalpy contribution (ΔH = -33.6 kJ/mol) is partly opposed by an entropy barrier (TΔS =-9.1 kJ/mol), as classically observed in protein-carbohydrate interactions (42Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Thermodynamic of the binding of codakine to carbohydrates S.D. values are in the range of 10%.SugarnKaKdΔGΔH–TΔS× 104 m–1μmkJ/molkJ/molkJ/molMannose1aFixed value during fitting procedure0.37270–20.3–18.7–1.6GlcNAc1aFixed value during fitting procedure0.21465–19.0–14.6–4.4α–MeMan1aFixed value during fitting procedure1.9352–24.5–33.69.1α–Methyl-fucoside1aFixed value during fitting procedure1.6760–24.1–20.3–3.8Trimannoside0.91.2780–23.4–41.918.5Nona-Asn0.942320.432–36.2–45.38.9a Fixed value during fitting procedure Open table in a new tab Affinity and Specificity for Oligosaccharides—The specificity of the fluorescence-labeled lectin was evaluated by binding to the 320 oligosaccharides present on the glycan array available at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (Fig. 2). Only 13 oligosaccharides are recognized with high affinity; they all represent complex-type biantennary N-glycans (complete data available as supplemental material). The shortest ligand is the core pentasaccharide, consisting of a chitobiose and a trimannoside with α1–3 and α1–6 linkage. Larger N-glycans elongated by the successive addition of GlcNAc, galactose, and sialic acid are also recognized by the lectin. Fucosylation at position 3 of the antennary GlcNAc moieties (Lewis x) is tolerated, but not fucosylation of the chitobiose core. In order to characterize the thermodynamic and structural basis of this very narrow specificity, a biantennary nonasaccharide N-glycan linked to Asn (Scheme 1) was prepared from egg yolk. Codakine dissociation constants were measured for this compound and also for trimannoside in order to evaluate the influence of the internal chitobiose moiety on the high affinity (Fig. 3). The affinity for the trimannoside (Kd = 80 μm) is of the same order of magnitude as the one measured for αMeMan (Table 2). In contrast, the affinity for nona-Asn is submicromolar (Kd = 432 nm). To our knowledge, this is the highest affinity reported for a C-type lectin, excluding multivalency effects. The 200-fold increase observed for nona-Asn compared with the trimannoside could be due to either the terminal N-acetyllactosamine on each antenna or to the presence of internal chitobiose. Since the core pentasaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 is efficiently recognized in the glycan array, it could be concluded that the internal chitobiose has a crucial effect on the affinity. When analyzing the thermodynamic contributions, the binding of codakine to nona-Asn shows a higher enthalpy contribution (ΔH = -45.3 kJ/mol) than to trimannoside (ΔH = -41.9 kJ/mol). However, the difference in free energy (and therefore in affinity) is mainly due to the different entropy terms. Both oligosaccharides display an unfavorable entropy contribution, but the entropy for binding the trimannoside (TΔS =-18.5 kJ/mol) is much stronger than for the nonasaccharide (TΔS =-8.9 kJ/mol). Crystal Structure of Codakine·Nona-Asn—Cocrystallization of codakine with nona-Asn yielded one rock-shaped crystal diffracting to 1.7 Å in the C2221 space group. The overall shape of each monomer is similar to what is observed in the structure of codakine complexed with glycerol. The intermonomer disulfide bridge also occurs, albeit with a longer S–S bond distance (2.33 Å instead of 2.05 Å). Such a deviation from normality might be due to radiation damage. This variation, associated with rotational flexibility of this linkage, induces a slightly different orientation of the second monomer with respect to the first one (supplemental Fig. S2). Electron density could be readily identified for one calcium ion and 5 carbohydrate residues. After building the βGlcNAc12αMan13(βGlcNAc12αMan16) Man pentasaccharide, the two extra GlcNAc could be added at position 1 of the central βMan. The galactose residues capping the two ant"
https://openalex.org/W1990849545,"In zebrafish, the expression of long-wavelength cone (LC) opsin mRNA fluctuated rhythmically between the day and night. In a 24-h period, expression was high in the afternoon and low in the early morning. This pattern of fluctuation persisted in zebrafish that were kept in constant darkness, suggesting an involvement of circadian clocks. Functional expression of Clock, a circadian clock gene that contributes to the central circadian pacemaker, was found to play an important role in maintaining the circadian rhythms of LC opsin mRNA expression. In zebrafish embryos, in which the translation of Clock was inhibited by anti-Clock morpholinos, the circadian rhythms of LC opsin mRNA expression diminished. CLOCK may regulate the circadian rhythms of LC opsin mRNA expression via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. In control retinas, the concentration of cAMP was high in the early morning and low in the remainder of the day and night. Inhibition of Clock translation abolished the fluctuation in the concentration of cAMP, thereby diminishing the circadian rhythms of opsin mRNA expression. Transient increase of cAMP concentrations in the early morning (i.e. by treating the embryos with 8-bromo-cAMP) restored the circadian rhythms of LC opsin mRNA expression in morpholino-treated embryos. Together, the data suggest that Clock plays important roles in regulating the circadian rhythms in photoreceptor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061829684,"The hantaviruses are emerging infectious viruses that in humans can cause a cardiopulmonary syndrome or a hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The nucleocapsid (N) is the most abundant viral protein, and during viral assembly, the N protein forms trimers and packages the viral RNA genome. Here, we report the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-74, called N1-74) of the Andes hantavirus N protein. N1-74 forms two long helices (alpha1 and alpha2) that intertwine into a coiled coil domain. The conserved hydrophobic residues at the helix alpha1-alpha2 interface stabilize the coiled coil; however, there are many conserved surface residues whose function is not known. Site-directed mutagenesis, CD spectroscopy, and immunocytochemistry reveal that a point mutation in the conserved basic surface formed by Arg22 or Lys26 lead to antibody recognition based on the subcellular localization of the N protein. Thus, Arg22 and Lys26 are likely involved in a conformational change or molecular recognition when the N protein is trafficked from the cytoplasm to the Golgi, the site of viral assembly and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2036466550,"UCP2, an inner membrane mitochondrial protein, has been implicated in bioenergetics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulation. High levels of UCP2 mRNA were recently found in erythroid cells where UCP2 is hypothesized to function as a facilitator of heme synthesis and iron metabolism by reducing ROS production. We examined UCP2 protein expression and role in mice erythropoiesis in vivo. UCP2 was mainly expressed at early stages of erythroid maturation when cells are not fully committed in heme synthesis. Iron incorporation into heme was unaltered in reticulocytes from UCP2-deficient mice. Although heme synthesis was not influenced by UCP2 deficiency, mice lacking UCP2 had a delayed recovery from chemically induced hemolytic anemia. Analysis of progenitor cells from bone marrow and fetal liver both in vitro and in vivo revealed that UCP2 deficiency results in a significant decrease in cell proliferation at the erythropoietin-dependent phase of erythropoiesis. This was accompanied by reduction in the phosphorylated form of ERK, a ROS-dependent cytosolic regulator of cell proliferation. Analysis of ROS in UCP2 null erythroid cells revealed altered distribution of ROS, resulting in decreased cytosolic and increased mitochondrial ROS. Restoration of the cytosol oxidative state of erythroid progenitor cells by the pro-oxidant Paraquat reversed the effect of UCP2 deficiency on cell proliferation in in vitro differentiation assays.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). UCP2 may play a protective role during erythroid differentiation where ROS may be generated by the large quantities of iron imported into the mitochondria during the process of heme biosynthesis (28Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Indeed, mitochondrial oxidative stress was found to play a key role in sideroblastic anemia and the myelodysplastic syndrome in humans and in zebrafish (29Greenberg P.L. Young N.S. Gattermann N.

Additionally, it has been proposed that through uncoupling, UCP2 may facilitate heme synthesis by creating a local low oxygen environment in the mitochondrial matrix (29Greenberg P.L. Young N.S. Gattermann N. Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2002; 2002: 136-161Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), thereby maintaining iron in the reduced ferrous iron (Fe2+) state, keeping it available for ferrochelatase. Although it has been proposed that UCP2 plays a role in heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation, this hypothesis has not been tested thus far. In the present study we have examined the role of UCP2 during the process of erythropoiesis using UCP2 null mice. Although we found that deficiency of UCP2 does not affect heme biosynthesis, UCP2 null mice exhibited a lower proliferation rate of the proerythroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts during the EPO-dependent phase. Interestingly, our results indicate that UCP2 is modulating proliferation through ERK, a signaling pathway that has been implicated in cell proliferation during erythropoiesis and is regulated by ROS (38Zhang J.

Cell Lines—G1E-ER cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's media (Invitrogen-Invitrogen) containing 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2% pen/strep (Invitrogen), 120 nm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 2 units/ml EPO (StemCell Tech), and 50 ng/ml SCF/KL (StemCell Tech). Cell density was kept below 1 × 106 cells/ml. Upon activation of GATA-1 by 10–6 m β-estradiol, G1E-ER cells undergo synchronous cell cycle arrest followed by terminal erythroid maturation. Animals—12–16-week-old UCP2 KO (9Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. ves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D.

All procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for Animal Care at Tufts University (IACUC no. 11-04) in compliance with United States Public Health Service Regulations. Bone Marrow and Fetal Liver Isolation—Fetal liver cells were isolated from E13.5 UCP2 KO and WT embryos and mechanically dissociated by pipetting in isolation media (Iscove modified Dulbecco's medium, 2% fetal bovine serum). Bone marrow cells were harvested by flushing femurs with isolation media. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by drawing medium and cells up and down through a 1-ml syringe and 27-gauge needle and then passed through 40-μm cell strainers (41Zhang J. Socolovsky M.

Osmotic Fragility Assay—Osmotic fragility of erythrocytes was measured on freshly collected blood from 12–16-week-old UCP2 KO and WT mice. Red blood cells (RBCs) were washed with PBS and suspended in varying concentrations of NaCl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm with appropriate controls. The lysis percentage of RBCs was calculated from the absorbance, and a fragility curve was generated by plotting varying salt concentrations versus hemolysis (43Rossi R. Giustarini D.

Induction of Hemolytic Anemia with Phenylhydrazine—Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg phenylhydrazine (PH)/kg body weight on experimental days 0, 1, and 3. PH chloride (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS (5 μg/μl) and filtered through 0.22-μm membrane. Blood and bone marrow were collected for analysis on experimental days 0, 3, 6, and 9 unless stated otherwise (41Zhang J. Socolovsky M. Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2003; 102: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 45Socolovsky M. Nam H. Fleming M.D. Haase V.H. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3261-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). 59Fe Heme Incorporation—Heme incorporation was performed as described in Zhang et al. (46Zhang A.S. Sheftel A.D. Ponka P. Blood. 2005; 105: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice reticulocytes were exposed to 2 μm [59Fe]transferrin on ice to saturate membrane receptors. Endocytosis was allowed by transferring the samples to 37 °C. Total protein fraction was obtained and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C and washed twice in 7% trichloroacetic acid. 59Fe radioactivity counting was performed in both pellet and supernatant fractions utilizing the 1470 WIZARD automatic gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Percentage of iron incorporated into heme fraction was calculated as follows: (59Fe pellet/reticulocyte number) × 100/((59Fe pellet + 59Fe supernatant)/reticulocyte number). 59FeCl3 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK), Apo-Tf (Sigma) was labeled with 59Fe using 59Fe-labeled citrate as described in Martinez-Medellin and Schulman (47Martinez-Medellin J. Schulman H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 264: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Bone marrow or fetal liver cells (∼1 × 105) were immunostained simultaneously with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-TER119 (1:100) (BD Pharmingen) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD71 (1:100) (BD Pharmingen) and either allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-C-KIT (1:100) (BD Pharmingen) antibodies in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) as previously described (41Zhang J. Socolovsky M. Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2003; 102: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) or annexin V (3:100) (APC-conjugated, BD Pharmingen). For apoptosis analysis the polycaspases FLICA (6-carboxyfluorescein-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone) substrate (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC) was used according to manufacture's instructions. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience), and R1-R5 gating was selected according to Rooke and Orkin (48Rooke H.M. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2006; 107: 3527-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). FACS data analysis was performed with FACS Express V3 software. Cell debris was excluded by gating on the forward and side scatter plot. Erythroid Differentiation in Vitro—Total fetal liver or bone marrow cells previously treated with ACK lysis buffer (0.8% NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) were labeled with biotin-conjugated anti-TER119 or anti C-KIT antibody (1:100) (BD Pharmingen), respectively. TER119– or C-KIT+ cells were purified through a StemSep column as per the manufacturer's instructions (StemCell Technologies). Purified cells were seeded in fibronectin-coated wells (BD Discovery Labware) at a cell density of 1 × 105/ml. On the first day the purified cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 20% BIT 9500 (StemCell Technologies), 10–4 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 units/ml EPO (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). On the second day this medium was replaced with erythroid differentiation media according to Zhang et al. (41Zhang J. Socolovsky M. Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2003; 102: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Isolation—Mitochondrial isolation was achieved using a mitochondrial isolation kit for tissue (Pierce, catalog #89801) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Oxidation Detection—To detect oxidized proteins we used the Oxyblot™ protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon International) according to manufacturer's manual. It is based on detection of carbonyl groups which are introduced into protein side chains when proteins are exposed to oxidative stress. Reactive Radical Species Detection—Bone marrow was collected as described, and 1 × 106 cells were stained with 5 μm dihydroethidium (Invitrogen) or Mitosox (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Mitosox-stained samples were also treated simultaneously with 10 μm Verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich). After the incubation time, cells were washed twice in warm FACS buffer and immunostained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD71 antibody as described above and analyzed by FACS. Western Blot—Samples were prepared according to Kefaloyianni et al. (49Kefaloyianni E. Gaitanaki C. Beis I. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and fractionated in 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer machine. UCP2 (Santa Cruz), Porin (Calbiochem), β-actin (Novus Biologicals), Complex III (Mitosciences), and ERK (Cell signaling) antibodies were used according to manufacturer's instruction. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance (α = 0.05) with the GraphPad Prism software. UCP2 Expression in Erythroid Cells—If UCP2 is involved in heme synthesis, we expected the expression levels of the protein to peak when cells are heavily involved in heme production. UCP2 expression was analyzed in three main populations of primary erythropoietic cells; Ter119 negative (BFU-E, CFU-E, proerythroblast; not actively involved in heme synthesis), Ter119 positive cells (early and late basophilic erythroblasts; involved in heme synthesis; highly proliferative), and reticulocytes (actively involved in heme synthesis; non proliferative). Ter119+ and Ter119– cells were derived from E13.5 fetal livers and reticulocytes from the peripheral blood of PH-treated mice as described (“Experimental Procedures”). Unexpectedly, UCP2 protein was expressed in the early progenitors (Ter119–) and reached its maximum level of expression in the basophilic erythroblasts (Ter119+). Reticulocytes expressed very low levels of UCP2 (Fig. 1A). To determine the temporal relationship between UCP2 expression and heme production, we investigated the kinetics of UCP2 protein expression in G1E-ER cells. G1E-ER cells are arrested at proerythroblast stage due to the lack of endogenous GATA-1 and, thus, offer an excellent model to track early erythroid differentiation. After induction with β-estradiol, cells were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, and UCP2 expression was analyzed. Interestingly, UCP2 protein peaks at 12 h and decreases thereafter (p = 0.0084 for the decrease between 12 and 48 h, Fig. 1B). The induction of UCP2 during the first 12–24 h correlates with early erythropoiesis, which is characterized by an increased rate of cell division and very limited hemoglobin synthesis (50Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h cells no longer divide and are at the stage characterized by high hemoglobin synthesis activity. The biphasic pattern of UCP2 expression in G1E-ER cells reflects the pattern found in primary cells during the transition from TER119– to reticulocytes. This pattern of induction early in erythroid differentiation also supports that UCP2 expression is induced by the GATA-1 transcription factor. UCP2 Function in Erythropoiesis—To determine the role of UCP2 in erythropoiesis in vivo, WT and UCP2 KO C57BL/6J mice were induced to develop hemolytic anemia, and the progression of reticulocytosis was monitored. Thirty male mice (12–16-week-old) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg PH and 10 mice with PBS (control) at experimental days 0 (D0), 1 (D1), and 3 (D3), and samples were collected at D0, D3, D6, and D9 (n = 5 per treatment). Blood profile was analyzed at 3 different stages: (i) immediately before treatment (D0), (ii) acute marrow response (D3), and (iii) recovery phase (D6 and D9). At D0 (PBS-injected mice) WT and UCP2 KO mice presented a similar complete blood count profile, and the PH treatment resulted in an acute decline in RBC count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin in both genotypes (supplemental Fig. S1). The acute marrow response was characterized by reticulocytosis that developed on D3 (Fig. 2A). During this phase, reticulocyte production was attenuated in the UCP2 KO and reached only 47.22% that of the WT (p = 0.0271). During the recovery phase, reticulocyte count of UCP2 and WT reached similar values. This difference in kinetics supports a UCP2 role in expansion rather than maturation of the erythroid cells. Serum chemistry analysis was also performed, and no differences were found between UCP2 KO and WT mice (supplemental Table S1). To determine the mechanism responsible for the attenuated acute marrow response, we analyzed the response of bone marrow progenitors to PH treatment in terms of differentiation, expansion, maturation, and survival. Differentiation and maturation of erythroid progenitors was determined by FACS analysis of the relative size of five populations of cells that were identified by the expression of a combination of the membrane markers CD71 and TER119 (Fig. 2B). The five cell populations represent primitive progenitor cells, including BFU-E and CFU-E (R1, CD71med, TER119low), proerythroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts (R2, CD71high, TER119low), early and late basophilic erythroblasts (R3, CD71high, TER119high), polychromatophilic erythroblasts (R4, CD71med, TER119high) and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts (R5, CD71low, TER119High) (41Zhang J.

Note that in the PH-induced acute marrow response (D3), the R5 population is decreased, and R2 population is increased. R5 reappears at the recovery phase (D6), and by D9 it is fully recovered (supplemental Fig. S2). Bone marrow cell expansion and maturation throughout erythropoiesis are presented as cumulative percentage of each erythroid population (Fig. 2C). The acute marrow response at D3 is delayed at the level of R2-R3 populations in the UCP2 KO mice (Fig. 2C). Further analysis showed that R3 was reduced by 24.19% (p = 0.0040) in the KO mice as compared with WT (Fig. 2D). This reduction in R3 was not due to increased cell death or reduced number of earlier progenitors BFU-E and CFU-E. FACS analysis of C-KIT+ cells (supplemental Fig. S2) and colony assay in methyl-cellulose (data not shown) did not show a reduction in the amount of BFU-E or CFU-E. Analysis of annexin V staining did not demonstrate any increase in the rate of apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S2). The possibility that UCP2 deficiency inhibits the generation of R3 was tested using a two step in vitro differentiation assay. C-KIT+ cells were isolated from UCP2 KO and WT bone marrow samples and allowed to differentiate over 2 days. Cells were cultured in the presence of EPO to induce differentiation to late basophilic erythroblast, i.e. the R3 population. After the first 24 h, EPO was removed from the media, and R3 cells progressed until terminal maturation. In vitro differentiation revealed that C-KIT+ cells f"

Theoretical and empirical evidence shows that maternal condition affects relative investment in sons and daughters; however, the effect of parasitism on sex ratio in vertebrates is seldom considered. We demonstrate experimentally that parasitism constrains the ability of mothers to rear sons in a long-lived seabird, the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis . The effect contributes to the decline in offspring survival as the breeding season progresses and hence has important population-level consequences for this, and potentially other, seasonal breeders."
https://openalex.org/W2138286960,"The thermophilic filamentous fungus Talaromyces emersonii secretes a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that are of interest for processing of biomass into fuel. Many carbohydrases have been isolated and characterized from this fungus, but no studies had been performed on peptidases. In this study, two acid-acting endopeptidases were isolated and characterized from the culture filtrate of T. emersonii. One of these enzymes was identified as a member of the recently classified glutamic peptidase family and was subsequently named T. emersonii glutamic peptidase 1 (TGP1). The second enzyme was identified as an aspartyl peptidase (PEP1). TGP1 was cloned and sequenced and shown to exhibit 64 and 47% protein identity to peptidases from Aspergillus niger and Scytalidium lignocolum, respectively. Substrate profiling of 16 peptides determined that TGP1 has broad specificity with a preference for large residues in the P1 site, particularly Met, Gln, Phe, Lys, Glu, and small amino acids at P1' such as Ala, Gly, Ser, or Thr. This enzyme efficiently cleaves an internally quenched fluorescent substrate containing the zymogen activation sequence (k(cat)/K(m)=2 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)). Maximum hydrolysis occurs at pH 3.4 and 50 degrees C. The reaction is strongly inhibited by a transition state peptide analog, TA1 (K(i)=1.5 nM), as well as a portion of the propeptide sequence, PT1 (K(i)=32 nM). Ex vivo studies show that hyphal extension of T. emersonii in complex media is unaffected by the aspartyl peptidase inhibitor pepstatin but is inhibited by TA1 and PT1. This study provides insight into the functional role of the glutamic peptidase TGP1 for growth of T. emersonii."
https://openalex.org/W1988201205,"Recent studies using SOCS family knock-out mice have suggested that SOCS proteins have multiple biological functions in addition to their role as negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling. To explore these other functions of this family of proteins, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to find proteins interacting with human SOCS-3. We identified the transcriptional factor DP-1 as a SOCS-3-interacting protein involved in regulation of the cell cycle. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot assay showed that this interaction between these endogenous proteins occurred in cells both in vitro and in vivo. SOCS-3 interacted with the C-terminal region of DP-1, and amino acids 156-172 of SOCS-3 were required for this interaction. Confocal microscopy revealed that SOCS-3 and DP-1 were primarily colocalized in the cytoplasm. SOCS-3 inhibited E2F/DP-1 transcriptional activity under the cyclin-E promoter and actually inhibited cell cycle progression and cell growth under E2F/DP-1 control. In contrast, DP-1 almost completely eliminated the inhibitory action of SOCS-3 on LIF-stimulated STAT-3 transcriptional activity in JAK-STAT signaling. Interestingly, the alternative regulatory action of SOCS-3 and DP-1 was dramatically eliminated by each siRNA. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SOCS-3 acts as a negative regulator of the cell cycle progression under E2F/DP-1 control by interfering with heterodimer formation between DP-1 and E2F and also that DP-1 plays an important role in controlling JAK-STAT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1974645686,"Understanding how the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes are optimized through evolution remains a major challenge in molecular biology. The concept of co-evolution implicates that compensatory mutations occur to preserve the structure and function of proteins. We have combined statistical analysis of protein sequences with the sensitivity of single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to probe how catalysis is affected by structurally distant correlated mutations in Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Our findings show that evolutionary anti-correlated mutations have an inhibitory effect on enzyme catalysis, whereas positively correlated mutations rescue the catalytic activity. We interpret these results in terms of an evolutionary tuning of both the enzyme-substrate binding process and the chemistry of the active site. Our results constitute a direct observation of distant residue co-evolution in enzyme catalysis. Understanding how the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes are optimized through evolution remains a major challenge in molecular biology. The concept of co-evolution implicates that compensatory mutations occur to preserve the structure and function of proteins. We have combined statistical analysis of protein sequences with the sensitivity of single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to probe how catalysis is affected by structurally distant correlated mutations in Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Our findings show that evolutionary anti-correlated mutations have an inhibitory effect on enzyme catalysis, whereas positively correlated mutations rescue the catalytic activity. We interpret these results in terms of an evolutionary tuning of both the enzyme-substrate binding process and the chemistry of the active site. Our results constitute a direct observation of distant residue co-evolution in enzyme catalysis. The acquisition of adequate activity by an enzyme is the result of natural selection through mutagenesis (1.Patthy L. Protein Evolution. Blackwell Science, Oxford, Malden, MA1999: 80-83Google Scholar). Mutations that represent a functional advantage may prevail, reflecting not only the optimization of function but also the emergence of a new enzymatic mechanism (1.Patthy L. Protein Evolution. Blackwell Science, Oxford, Malden, MA1999: 80-83Google Scholar, 2.Jurgens C. Strom A. Wegener D. Hettwer S. Wilmanns M. Sterner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 202: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as proposed by the concept of co-evolution. This hypothesis suggests that pairs of positions in the sequence evolve together in such a way that mutations in one of the residues induce a coherent response in the other to compensate for a certain functional or structural effect (5.Altschuh D. Lesk A.M. Bloomer A.C. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 7.Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Over the last decades, numerous statistical methods have been applied to detect residue co-evolution in protein sequences (9.Fares M.A. Travers S.A. Genetics. 2006; 173: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10.Lee B.C. Park K. Kim D. Proteins. 2008; 72: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of co-evolving residues has been used to explore functional coupling in processes like protein-protein interaction (11.Pazos F. Helmer-Citterich M. Ausiello G. Valencia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), gating of potassium channels (12.Fleishman S.J. Yifrach O. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and allosteric communications in proteins (13.Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Experimental validation has been provided for the identification of networks of energetically coupled residues mediating allostery (14.Shulman A.I. Larson C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Ranganathan R. Cell. 2004; 116: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15.Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R.

A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in the case of enzyme catalysis, only theoretical studies have been reported (17.Estabrook R.A. Luo J. Purdy M.M. Sharma V. Weakliem P. Bruice T.C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The limitation of the available techniques in providing insights into the mechanism of catalysis has made it difficult to experimentally validate co-evolution as a natural means of catalysis optimization. Here, we have combined statistical sequence analysis and single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to probe the effect of evolutionary correlated mutations in the Escherichia coli Trx catalytic mechanism, a ubiquitous disulfide bond reductase.In a previous study, we developed single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy as a novel sensitive tool to study the mechanism of the catalytic reaction of E. coli Trx (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We showed that Trx reduces disulfide bonds using two distinct force-dependent catalytic mechanisms. The first mechanism is favored at low forces (up to 200 pN), 3The abbreviations used are: pN, piconewtons; Trx, thioredoxin; MSA, multiple sequence alignment; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 3The abbreviations used are: pN, piconewtons; Trx, thioredoxin; MSA, multiple sequence alignment; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). whereas the second mechanism is predominant at high forces (over 200 pN). These two chemical reduction mechanisms are likely to have evolved to allow for the thiol/disulfide exchange reaction to proceed under very different types of stress environments. Understanding the underlying mechanism of disulfide reduction under force is of great interest because force-dependent thiol reactions in cytoskeletal proteins have been shown to occur in cells (19.Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Additionally, we also showed that the active site mutation P34H, a natural mutation occurring in some members of the Trx superfamily, had a negative effect in the low force mechanism, whereas the high force mechanism remained unchanged. These studies show that force-clamp spectroscopy is an ideal tool to investigate the sequence-function relationship in Trx because it distinguishes different enzymatic mechanisms and reports precise chemical changes upon sequence alteration.Considering that the P34H mutation significantly impaired the chemistry of E. coli Trx, we have used a simple statistical tool for sequence alignment analysis to investigate the presence of co-evolving residues (20.Perez-Jimenez R. Godoy-Ruiz R. Parody-Morreale A. Ibarra-Molero B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 119: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have found that residues Asp26 and Gly74 show the highest positive and highest negative values of correlation with residue Pro34, respectively. Interestingly both residues are situated over 10 Å far away from residue Pro34. Our force-clamp experiments, using the single and double mutant forms, show a correlation between the activity of the Trx mutant forms and the co-variance value, which cannot be detected by regular bulk enzymatic assays. Significant changes in the force dependence of the reduction rate for these mutant forms can be detected. Whereas the anti-correlated mutations had a negative effect on the Trx activity, the positively correlated mutations returned the activity to that of the wild type form. We thus corroborate not only that the accumulation of disadvantageous mutations has been avoided by purifying selection to maintain a minimum level of activity but also that mutations that perturb the enzymatic mechanism can and have been reverted by noninteracting mutations. These results are in agreement with the existence of an activity threshold (21.Bershtein S. Segal M. Bekerman R. Tokuriki N. Tawfik D.S. Nature. 2006; 444: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because residues Pro34 and Gly74 are positioned within the catalytic groove and residue Asp26 influences the protonation state of the reactive cysteine Cys32, we interpret these results in terms of both an evolutionary optimization of the enzyme-substrate binding affinity and the protonation state of the Trx active site. These results represent an important advance in obtaining information on enzyme catalysis by combining the evolutionary analysis of sequences with the experimental study of catalysis at the single molecule level, a method that could be applied to enzyme design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSequence Alignments—We used BLAST 2 to search the non-redundant data base UniProt/Swiss-Prot with the E. coli Trx sequence as query and the default options of the search. The sequences found were aligned to the Trx sequence using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (22.Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7032) Google Scholar), and those with similarity with the query higher than 0.25 were selected obtaining a total of 239 sequences. We assumed that most of the retained sequences share the fold of the query protein.Single Molecule Force-Clamp Spectroscopy and Data Analysis—The details of our custom-made atomic force microscopy apparatus have been previously described (23.Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Data acquisition cards 6052E and 6703 (National Instruments) were used to control the atomic force microscopy head. Si3N4 cantilevers (Veeco) were calibrated in solution using the equipartition theorem. The typical spring constant was ∼20 pN/nm. The atomic force microscopy was used in force-clamp mode with an extension resolution of ∼0.5 nm and a feedback response of ∼5 ms. All of the experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NADPH, pH 7.2. Before the experiment, Trx reductase was added to a final concentration of 50 nm. The different forms of Trx used were added to yield the desired final concentration. A double-pulse protocol was used to collect data. The first pulse was set at 185 pN of pulling force and held for 0.4 s. The second pulse could be set at different forces and was held for over 10 s. To capture every possible reduction event, the second pulse was maintained for over 25 s in the case of slower kinetics. In addition, we performed the experiments with the double mutant P34H/G74S at different concentrations to ensure the accuracy of our fitting in the low-force regime. In each force the traces were averaged and fitted to a single exponential. Standard errors in the reduction rates were calculated using the bootstrapping method. The kinetic model used for the interpretation of the experimental data (see Fig. 4A) has been extensively described elsewhere (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We used software written in IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics) for data collection and analysis.Protein Expression and Purification—Preparation of (I27SS)8 polyprotein was prepared as described previously (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24.Wiita A.P. Ainavarapu S.R. Huang H.H. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7222-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with a few differences. Two residues were mutated in the I27 module using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to engineer a buried intracellular disulfide bond. Concretely, the mutations are G32C and A75C. Then we followed a multistep cloning procedure to construct an N-C-linked polyprotein gene with eight domains (25.Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), (I27G32C-A75C)8-. This gene was inserted into the pQE80 vector and transformed and expressed in the recombination-defective E. coli strain BLR (DE3) (Novagene). The His6-tagged proteins were purified first in a Co2+ column (Clontech) using a Talon resin (BD Biosciences) and second by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were then stored at 4 °C in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2.Preparation of mutant forms of E. coli thioredoxin was carried out as described elsewhere (26.Perez-Jimenez R. Godoy-Ruiz R. Ibarra-Molero B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2414-2429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Thioredoxin gene was cloned in a pET30a vector, and the mutations were carried out in the same way as for I27, using the QuikChange kit. The plasmid in each case was transformed and expressed in BL21(DE3) supercompetent cells and grown in LB medium with 40 μg/ml of kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Trizma buffer, pH 8.3, and a French press was used for lysis. After centrifugation, the nucleic acids in the supernatant were precipitated by stirring with streptomycin sulfate (10% w/v) at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 40 min, filtered, and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Trizma buffer, pH 8.3. Afterward, a second ion exchange column was used, and Fractogel® EMD DEAE (M) (Merck) equilibrated in 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Trizma buffer, pH 8.3, was used. The protein was eluted by a linear gradient between 0 and 0.5 m NaCl, and SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was used to verify the purity of the proteins. The protein fractions were dialyzed into a buffer of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and stored at -20 °C. Trx concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13700 m-1 cm-1.Thioredoxin Bulk Enzymatic Assays—We tested the effect of the mutations by traditional bulk experiments. We carried out two different assays for all the mutant forms and the WT. The first one is the insulin turbimetric assay (27.Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay thioredoxin catalyzes the reduction of insulin by DTT. The reaction is initiated by combining 0.5 mg/ml of bovine pancreatic insulin, 5 μm Trx, and then adding DTT to a final concentration of 500 μm. The rate of precipitation of the β-chain of insulin can be monitored at 650 nm.The second test is the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) assay (28.Slaby I. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay the disulfide bond of Trx is reduced in the presence of NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by Trx reductase. The reaction is initiated by adding 50 nm Trx reductase, 0.25 mm NADPH, 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 5 μm Trx, and 500 μm of DTT. The reduced form of thioredoxin can then reduce DTNB giving rise to TNB, the formation of which was monitored at 412 nm. The effect of the mutation P34H had been tested earlier with the DTNB assay (29.Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSStatistical Basis for Selection of E. coli Trx Mutants—Previous studies have demonstrated the functional importance of residue Pro34 in E. coli Trx (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 29.Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that mutations in this position during evolution should reflect co-evolving alterations in the Trx sequence with a functional meaning. To depict co-evolving residues in the Trx sequence and particularly with residue Pro34, we have carried out a statistical analysis of the Trx multiple sequence alignment (MSA). We have obtained the distance distribution of correlated mutations using as a correlation measure the co-variance between each pair of positions in the Trx MSA (5778 pairs in total) (20.Perez-Jimenez R. Godoy-Ruiz R. Parody-Morreale A. Ibarra-Molero B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 119: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Considering the distance between residues (Cα-Cα distances from the Protein Data Bank file), we can discriminate between correlations among contact residues (∼5 Å) and distant residues. Correlations between proximal residues have been suggested to preserve the structure and stability, whereas correlations between distant sites have a functional significance (9.Fares M.A. Travers S.A. Genetics. 2006; 173: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The co-variance measures the extent to which two positions (i and j) vary together and can be defined as follows, Covi,j=∑sequences(δi-〈δi〉)·(δj-〈δj〉)NS=〈δj·δj〉-〈δi〉·〈δj〉 where NS is the total number of sequences, and the sum is over all sequences. The value of δP (with P equal to i or j) is 1 for a given sequence if the residue at position P in the sequence is the same as in the Trx sequence and takes a value of 0 otherwise, <δP> is the average value of δP (i.e. ΣδP/NS). The co-variance calculation can be considered itself a measure of the evolutionary pressure because high values of co-variance reveal a high degree of residue co-evolution.We have found that residue Pro34 shows the highest positive and the highest negative values of co-variance with residues Asp26, located at ∼12 Å, and Gly74, located at ∼11 Å from Pro34, respectively (position 7 presents a higher negative value of co-variance with residue 34 that position 74, but we did not consider it because it contains numerous gaps in the MSA) (Fig. 1, A and B). In other words, a double mutation in positions 34 and 74 is very unlikely, whereas a mutation in position 34 is very often accompanied by a mutation in position 26. The fact that mutations in positions 26, 34, and 74 naturally occur following the pattern captured by the co-variance suggests that those positions are under evolutionary pressure.FIGURE 1Identification of co-evolving residues in the enzyme Trx.A, plot of inter-residue distance versus co-variance for E. coli Trx. In particular, the black circles mark the co-variance between residue Pro34 and the rest of the sequence. Residues Asp26 and Gly74 present the highest positive and highest negative values of co-variance with Pro34, respectively. Both of these residues are about a nanometer away from the active site. Because of multiple gaps in the Trx MSA, we did not consider the double mutant in positions 7 and 34 indicated by parentheses. B, E. coli Trx structure (Protein Data Bank code 2trx). Correlated residues Asp26, Pro34, and Gly74 are highlighted. The distance between each pair of residues is indicated. Active site cysteines are colored yellow. C, residue frequencies from the Trx MSA in position 26 (upper panel) and position 74 (lower panel) before (black bars) and after (gray bars) a perturbation in residue Pro34. In position 26 the residue distribution sharply shifts from Asp to Glu, whereas position 74 becomes almost solely occupied by Gly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The residue Asp26 plays an important role in the protonation state of the active site acting as an acid in oxidation reactions and a base in reduction reactions catalyzed by Trx (30.Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31.Chivers P.T. Prehoda K.E. Volkman B.F. Kim B.M. Markley J.L. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14985-14991Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of residue Gly74, there is no evidence of its role in disulfide reduction, but it has been suggested to have importance in the interaction between bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and E. coli Trx (32.Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19999-20008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), because it may represent an interaction point. In addition, position 74 has been proposed to be determinant in the Trx substrate specificity (33.Masip L. Klein-Marcuschamer D. Quan S. Bardwell J.C.A. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 840-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because of the individual functional importance of each residue, these correlations suggest an association between these residues that may have driven the functional optimization and/or diversification of Trx through evolution.A residue frequency analysis in positions 26, 34, and 74 shows that the most common mutation in each case is, respectively, Asp26→Glu, Pro34→His, and Gly74→Ser (supplemental Fig. S1). A perturbation of Pro34 can be created by extracting from the MSA a subalignment that contains only His at this position (15.Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The perturbation clearly alters the residue frequency in positions 26 and 74. Position 26 shifts drastically from Asp to Glu and position 74 becomes almost exclusively occupied by Gly (Fig. 1C). Concretely, this analysis corroborates that a double mutation D26E/P34H commonly occurs during evolution, whereas double mutation P34H/G74S is extremely unlikely. We hypothesize that this natural tendency is reflected in Trx activity. Residue co-evolution has been extensively studied in terms of energetic coupling (13.Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 15.Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 16.Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34.Russ W.P. Lowery D.M. Mishra P. Yaffe M.B. Ranganathan R. Nature. 2005; 437: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this work, the co-variance calculation reflects statistical coupling that is not necessarily associated with energetic coupling (35.Chi C.N. Elfstrom L. Shi Y. Snall T. Engstrom A. Jemth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4679-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In addition to studying P34H Trx, we obtained single mutants D26E and G74S and double mutants D26E/P34H and P34H/G74S and tested their activity. To rule out the possibility of structural effects caused by the mutations, we compared the crystal structure of WT Trx (Protein Data Bank 2trx) with the crystal structures of P34H Trx (Protein Data Bank code 2fd3; resolution, 2.45Å; R value, 0.185; Rfree, 0,305) and G74S Trx (Protein Data Bank code 2fch; resolution, 2.60Å; R value, 0.203; Rfree, 0.276) (supplemental Fig. S2). Even though the crystal structures cannot exclude the possibility of chemical changes on the sub-Ångström level, the basic statement here is that the proteins maintain the thioredoxin fold.Force-Clamp Experiments—Atomic force microscopy has become a powerful tool to study the mechanical properties of proteins at the single molecule level. In the force-clamp mode, a controlled pulling force can be directly applied to a single molecule, which makes it possible to monitor its unfolding and refolding trajectories as a function of time (36.Fernandez J.M. Li H.B. Science. 2004; 303: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 37.Garcia-Manyes S. Brujic J. Badilla C.L. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2436-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although previous works have shown the ability of atomic force microscopy to study single bond ruptures (38.Grandbois M. Beyer M. Rief M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Gaub H.E. Science. 1999; 283: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 39.Carl P. Kwok C.H. Manderson G. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we have recently developed force-clamp as a new tool to study mechanochemistry. By applying a calibrated force to a disulfide bonded substrate and in the presence of a particular reducing agent, single disulfide reduction kinetics can be determined, offering new insights into the chemistry and mechanism of disulfide reduction either by small molecules (e.g. DTT or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) or by an enzyme as Trx (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24.Wiita A.P. Ainavarapu S.R.

Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Langmuir. 2007; 24: 1356-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have used the force-clamp technique to show that Trx regulates the geometry of the participating sulfur atoms in the enzymatic reaction. Our technique is able to capture dynamic sub-Ångström conformational changes during catalysis that are undetectable with any other technique (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J. Holmgren A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Given the ability of force-clamp in reporting mechanistic information on enzyme catalysis, we have studied the force-dependent chemical kinetics of all Trx mutant forms to determine whether the co-variance calculation has a functional significance. Similar to previous works, we have first constructed a polyprotein that was used as a substrate for Trx disulfide reduction (18.Wiita A.P. Perez-Jimenez R. Walther K.A. Grater F. Berne B.J.

Fernandez J.M. Langmuir. 2007; 24: 1356-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The polyprotein is composed of eight modules of the 27th domain of the human cardiac titin (I27), which was modified to introduce a disulfide bond between the 32nd and 75th positions in each module (see supplemental data). We applied an initial force pulse to mechanically unfold the I27 modules up to the disulfide bond (Fig. 2A). The individual unfolding events are detected by a series of steps of about 10.5 nm/module (supplemental Fig. S3). This pulse also exposes the previously buried disulfide bond in each module to the solvent environment. This bond remains intact because forces of over 2 nanonewton are needed to break a covalent bond (38.Grandbois M. Beyer M. Rief M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Gaub H.E. Science. 1999; 283: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). We then applied a second pulse of force to monitor the reduction of single disulfide bonds by the reduced Trx molecules present in the sample (Fig. 2A). These disulfide bond reduction events resulted in a second series of steps of about 13.5 nm/module (Fig. 2, B and C). In this assay, the reduced Trx is generated by the Trx system composed of Trx, Trx reductase, and NADPH (41.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We collected multiple traces that were averaged and fitted with a single exponential with a time constant τ, from which we then obtained the reduction rate (r = 1/τ) at the corresponding force (Fig. 3). Thus, we obtained the reduction rate dependence on force for a given Trx. Considering the number of traces collected per force (15–50 traces), a single exponential is a good approximation and adequately describes the process over the entire range of forces.FIGURE 2Detecting catalytic co-evolution at the single mol"

https://openalex.org/W1986362483,"CprK from Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans is the first characterized transcriptional regulator of anaerobic dehalorespiration and is controlled at two levels: redox and effector binding. In the reduced state and in the presence of chlorinated aromatic compounds, CprK positively regulates expression of the cpr gene cluster. One of the products of the cpr gene cluster is CprA, which catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. Redox regulation of CprK occurs through a thiol/disulfide redox switch, which includes two classes of cysteine residues. Under oxidizing conditions, Cys11 and Cys200 form an intermolecular disulfide bond, whereas Cys105 and Cys111 form an intramolecular disulfide. Here, we report that Cys11 is involved in redox inactivation in vivo. Upon replacement of Cys11 with serine, alanine, or aspartate, CprK loses its DNA binding activity. C11A is unstable; however, circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the stability and overall secondary structures of CprK and the C11S and C11D variants are similar. Furthermore, effector binding remains intact in the C11S and C11D variants. However, fluorescence spectroscopic results reveal that the tertiary structures of the C11S and C11D variants differ from that of the wild type protein. Thus, Cys11 plays a dual role as a redox switch and in maintaining the correct tertiary structure that promotes DNA binding.

Thus, Cys11 plays a dual role as a redox switch and in maintaining the correct tertiary structure that promotes DNA binding. Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans, one of the most extensively studied reductive dehalogenating bacteria, was identified 13 years ago (1Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium with low G+C content (2Villemur R. Lanthier M. Beaudet R. Lepine F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 706-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). D. dehalogenans can use 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (CHPA) 2The abbreviations used are: CHPA, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate; DA, diamide; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. and several other chlorinated aromatic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, as electron acceptors (3Wiegel J. Zhang X. Wu Q. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wiegel J. Wu Q.Z. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2000; 32: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in an energy yielding process called dehalorespiration (1Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Smidt H. de Vos W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 43-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In the absence of chlorinated aromatics, this organism can also utilize sulfite, thiosulfate, fumarate, and nitrite as electron acceptors (1Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Genes that encode proteins involved in dehalorespiration are present within the cpr (chlorophenol reduction) gene cluster, which contains eight genes, cprT, cprK, cprZ, cprE, cprB, cprA, cprC, and cprD, which are located in five transcriptional units (cprK, cprT, cprZE, and cprBA or cprBACD) controlled by three promoters (6Smidt H. van Leest M. van der Oost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CprK is constitutively expressed at low levels and acts as a transcriptional regulator for the cpr gene cluster (7Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CprA catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated aromatic compounds and CprB is an integral membrane protein that binds CprA, whereas CprT, CprB, CprC, and CprD seem to be involved in maturation of CprA (2Villemur R. Lanthier M. Beaudet R. Lepine F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 706-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The function of CprZ is unknown. CprK belongs to the superfamily of CRP-FNR (cAMP-binding protein-fumarate nitrate reduction regulatory protein) transcription regulators (8Korner H. Sofia H.J. Zumft W.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 559-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Like other family members, CprK has a C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (9Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 231-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an N-terminal effector binding motif. CHPA binds to the effector domain in CprK, which triggers a conformational change (10Joyce, M. G., Levy, C., Gabor, K., Pop, S. M., Biehl, B. D., Doukov, T. I., Ryter, J. M., Mazon, H., Smidt, H., van den Heuvel, R. H. H., Ragsdale, S. W., van der Oost, J., and Leys, D. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 28318–28325Google Scholar) that promotes the interaction of CprK with a nearly palindromic DNA sequence called a “dehalobox” (11Gabor K. Verissimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that is located in the promoter regions of the cprT, cprZ, and cprB genes in the cpr gene cluster (7Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on studies of a related transcriptional activator (CprK1) from Desulfitobacterium hafniense, the optimal and consensus dehalobox sequence appears to be a perfect inverted repeat, TTAATX4ATTAA (11Gabor K. Verissimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), that resembles the FNR consensus sequence (TTGATX4ATCAA) (12Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 6: 399-428PubMed Google Scholar). The effector (a chlorinated aromatic) can bind to CprK in both the reduced and oxidized states, but the protein must be in the reduced state to bind DNA (13Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Mazon H. Gabor K. Leys D. Heck A.J. van der Oost J. van den Heuvel R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11281-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, dehalorespiration is regulated at the transcriptional level by effector binding and by redox state. As shown in Fig. 1, transcription only occurs under reducing conditions and when effector (the chlorinated aromatic substrate for the dehalogenase, CprA) is present. CprK from D. dehalogenans has five cysteine residues: Cys11, Cys105, Cys111, Cys161, and Cys200. All cysteines except Cys161 are involved in redox-regulation of CprK. Upon oxidation, CprK loses DNA binding activity (7Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) because of the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys200 and/or an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys105 and Cys111 (13Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of oxidized D. hafniense CprK1 and reduced D. dehalogenans CprK, an inactive state is stabilized by linkage of the effector domain to the DNA-binding domain by the intermolecular disulfide bond. In addition, mass spectrometric studies reveal that several regions of the structure exhibit enhanced dynamics upon reduction (14Mazon H. Gabor K. Leys D. Heck A.J. van der Oost J. van den Heuvel R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11281-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys200 in redox regulation has been questioned (11Gabor K. Verissimo C.S. Cyran B.C. Ter Horst P. Meijer N.P. Smidt H. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys200 is observed in vivo upon exposure of Escherichia coli cells overexpressing CprK to oxidative stress conditions. We also show that replacement of Cys11 with Ser or Asp results in a stable but inactive protein. The results of fluorescence spectroscopic studies and electrophoreic mobility shift assays (EMSA) reveal that the C11D and C11S variants can still bind effector with high affinity but are unable to bind DNA. Changes in the fluorescence spectrum of the variants reveal that the loss of DNA binding activity in the Cys11 variants is related to a change in the tertiary structure of the protein. Thus, Cys11 plays a dual role in maintaining the correct structure for DNA binding and in redox regulation of CprK. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of CprK—DNA isolation and manipulation were performed by standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Construction of the overexpression plasmid and purification of CprK were described previously (7Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of CprK—Cys11 was substituted with alanine, serine, and aspartate residues by performing site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pQE60:cprK plasmid was the template for PCR, and the primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The DNA sequences of all PCR-generated DNA fragments were confirmed using dye terminator chemistry and automated sequencing of both DNA strands with a Beckman/Coulter CEQ2000XL 8-capillary DNA sequencer at the Genomics Core Research Facility (University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE). Construction of Strains for lacZ Reporter Assays—To measure in vivo activity of CprK, a two-plasmid reporter system was constructed in which an arabinose-inducible cprK gene on one plasmid and a cpr promoter-lacZ fusion on another plasmid are cotransformed into an ara- E. coli strain. Wild type CprK was cloned into the pBAD-Myc-HisA expression vector (Invitrogen), generating pBAD/Myc/HisA::cprK. To express the native protein lacking the His tag, the native stop codon was included before the sequence that encodes the His tag. Cys11 variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the same construct. A cpr promoter-lacZ fusion was generated by cloning the promoter region of cprB into the EcoRI cloning site of pRS551 (16Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) to yield pRS551::PcprB, which was used to transform the ara- E. coli strain LMG194 (Invitrogen). Then the pBAD/Myc/HisA::cprK construct (and the corresponding C11A, C11S, and C11D variants) was transformed into the LMG194 cells containing pRS551::PcprB to generate the two-plasmid reporter system. The pBAD system provides tight control of CprK expression (17Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), and the E. coli strain provides a background that lacks dehalorespiration genes. Assay of in Vivo Activity of CprK—Promoter activity was measured in vivo by the β-galactosidase assay. Overnight cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C in RM medium plus 50 μm CHPA, 0.2% arabinose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When required, diamide (1 mm final concentration) was added to the culture at an A600 of ∼0.2. Growth was stopped during exponential phase by placing the cultures on ice when the A600 reached 0.4-0.6. After 20 min, 500 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 40 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), 50 ml of 0.1% SDS, and two drops of chloroform were added to 500 μl of culture, and the solution was incubated at 28 °C for at least 5 min when 200 μl of 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (final concentration, 0.8 mg/ml) was added. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 when the reaction mixture began to turn yellow, and the time of reaction was recorded. The absorbances at 420 and 550 nm were then measured to calculate the promoter activity in Miller units as described (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Each reaction was performed in quadruplicate. In Vivo Intermolecular Disulfide Bond Detection—E. coli strains containing the cprK gene were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. At an A600 of ∼0.6, a 0.5-ml sample was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diamide (1 mm, final concentration) was added to the rest of the culture, and 0.5 ml samples were collected from the culture after 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, centrifuged, and frozen as just described. Nonreducing loading buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was then added to the cell pellets at varying volumes to provide samples with final equal cell density (based on the absorbance at 600 nm). Finally, 10 μl of each sample was loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with an anti-CprK antibody. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was first incubated with primary rabbit anti-CprK antibody (Cocalico Biologicals Inc., Reamstown, PA) that had been purified by chromatography on a CprK-actigel ALD Superflow affinity column (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc., Carlsbad, CA). The membrane was then treated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; Sigma-Aldrich), and the presence of CprK was detected by chemiluminescence, using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were performed as described (7Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with increasing amounts of IRDye 700-labeled oligonucleotides (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln). The data were analyzed by infrared imaging with an ODYSSEY infrared imager (LI-COR). Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The intact protein was analyzed at the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (University of Nebraska, Lincoln) by an liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system comprised of a Shimadzu (SCL-10A) high pressure liquid chromatography system, a 4000 Qtrap (ABS) mass spectrometry system, and a turbo ion-spray source probe. Protein samples (20 ml) were loaded onto a Micro-Tech Scientific C18 column (1.0 (inner diameter) × 50 mm (length), 5 μm (particle size)) by a PE 200 Autosampler and eluted at a flow rate of 100 μl/min at room temperature with a gradient of 0.3% formic acid in H2O (Solvent A) and 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile (Solvent B). The percentage of Solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 70% over a 5-min elution time. The data were acquired and processed with Analyst 1.4.1 software. The data were acquired in the Q1 (quadrupole one) positive ion mode as the mass range (m/z) of 850-1150 atomic mass units was scanned in 4 s. The total run time for each sample was 20 min. The molecular mass of the protein was calculated by analyzing several multiply charged peaks with the Bayesian Protein Reconstruct option in Bioanalyst 1.4.1 software. Intrinsic Fluorescence Quenching and CD Analysis—For the CHPA binding assay shown in Fig. 5, 180-500 nm CprK was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy with a Shimadzu RF-530 1 PC Spectrofluorophotometer (Columbia, MD) at room temperature as described (3Wiegel J. Zhang X. Wu Q. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All of the fluorescence data were corrected for the inner filter effect (19Kubista M. Sjoback R. Eriksson S. Albinsson B. Analyst. 1994; 119: 417-419Crossref Google Scholar). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of wild type CprK, C11S, and C11D variants shown in Fig. 8 were recorded on an OLIS RSM1000F (OLIS, Inc., Bogart, GA).FIGURE 8Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of CprK. Spectra were recorded for wild type (WT) CprK, C11S and C11D in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (A), or the same buffer containing 50 mm DTT (B). Emission spectra were scanned from 300 to 400 nm. The data presented here are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of CHPA by CprK causes quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Dissociation constants were calculated by fitting the fluorescence quenching data to Equation 1 or 2, where Kd represents the dissociation constant for the ligand (L, CHPA), [L] is the total ligand concentration, [P] equals the total protein concentration, ΔF is the observed fluorescence quenching, F0 equals the initial fluorescence, and ΔFmax is the maximum quenching that would be observed at infinite ligand concentrations. These equations assume a single binding site on CprK for CHPA. The [L] in Equation 1, which describes a standard one-site binding isotherm, should be free ligand, and because the free ligand concentration is unknown, we assumed that the free and total ligand concentrations are equal. However, when the [L] is in the range of the Kd, the fraction of bound ligand becomes significant; therefore, the data were also fit to quadratic Equation 2, which accounts for ligand depletion at low CHPA concentrations. We also estimated the free ligand concentration by subtracting bound ligand ([P] * ΔF/Fmax) from [L] and fit this data to Equation 1. ΔF=(ΔFmax*Kd)/([L]+Kd)(Eq. 1) ΔFF0=ΔFmax2F0[P][([P]+[L]+Kd)-([P]+[L]+Kd)2-4[P][L]](Eq. 2) The different one-site treatments gave similar dissociation constants, whereas a two-site model gave a Kd1 in the low nanomolar range with high errors and a Kd2 that was similar to the Kd value obtained from the one-site model. The R2 values were also slightly better for the one-site model. Thus, we conclude that binding of CHPA to CprK follows a one-site binding model. CD measurements were performed at 4 °C with a JASCO J-715 instrument (Jasco Inc.). The spectra were scanned from 260 to 190 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min with a data pitch of 1 nm. Forty scans at a 2-s response time and a 5-nm bandwidth were averaged for each sample. For secondary structure analysis, experiments were performed in a 0.1-mm-path length cell with 0.7 mg/ml CprK in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The melting temperature of CprK was determined by measuring the CD spectrum of 0.2 mg/ml protein (in 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) over a temperature range of 20-80 °C in a 1-mm-path length cell. The data were obtained in millidegrees and converted into molar ellipticity by JASCO software. The Continll program (20Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) within the CDpro software (21Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar) was used for secondary structure analysis. Evidence for in Vivo Disulfide Bond Formation between Cys11 and Cys200—E. coli strains overexpressing CprK were grown in the presence or absence of oxidant (diamide or hydrogen peroxide), and samples were collected at 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. When standard reducing and denaturing PAGE was performed, the wild type or variant (C11A, C11S, C200S, and C200A) proteins were observed at the position of the monomer (25 kDa); the samples were prepared for nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the oligomeric state of CprK, omitting DTT, as described under “Materials and Methods.” When cells were treated in the absence of oxidant, CprK was predominantly in the monomeric state (Fig. 2A, first lane). However, when the cells were treated with 1 mm diamide, CprK was rapidly converted from the monomeric to the dimeric form (second through sixth lanes). Dimer formation was also observed when cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2B). Treatment of the C11S variant with diamide did not result in dimer formation (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the C200S variant remained predominantly in the monomeric state after treatment with diamide (Fig. 2D), with a small proportion of the dimeric form, as was observed in earlier in vitro experiments (13Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another band in the 15-20-kDa region appeared in the C200S variant, which might reflect a degradation product. In summary, these results indicate that in vivo Cys11 and Cys200 exist as the free thiol(ates) under normal growth conditions and that they form an intermolecular disulfide bond when exposed to oxidants. Mass spectrometric analyses of the purified Cys11 variants revealed that the C11S and C11D variants are full-length proteins just like the wild type CprK (supplemental Fig. S1), with the only observed differences being the site-directed amino acid replacements. Substitutions of Cys11 Inactivate CprK—To analyze the role of Cys11, in vivo β-galactosidase and in vitro DNA binding assays were performed with C11S and C11D variants. Attempts to purify the C11A variant failed, whereas the C11D and C11S variants could be purified at levels of 10-20 mg/liter of culture. EMSA assays were performed on the wild type and variant forms of CprK in the presence of effector. Neither the C11S nor C11D variants showed any mobility shift of pCprB (Fig. 3). Similarly, in vivo analysis by the cprB promoter-lacZ fusion assay demonstrated that the C11S, C11A, and C11D variants were severely compromised in DNA binding, with 2-3% β-galactosidase activity of the wild type protein (Fig. 4). Diamide-treated wild type CprK showed 10% activity, indicating that oxidative stress inactivates CprK in vivo and that the reducing conditions within the cell compete with diamide oxidation to restore the active protein. Diamide treatment of C11A, C11S, and C11D variants further decreased the DNA binding activity to background levels. Because formation of the Cys11-Cys200 disulfide bond is prevented in these variants, the additional decrease in activity could result from oxidation of Cys105 and Cys111 to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Loss of DNA Binding Activity but Unimpaired Effector Binding of Cys11 Variants—To determine whether inactivity of the C11S and C11D variants is due to loss of effector or of DNA binding, effector binding affinity was measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5, the oxidized and reduced states of CprK, as well as the Cys11 variants bind CHPA with high affinity, and the data for the wild type and Cys11 variant proteins are virtually superimposable. The binding data for the wild type protein and the Cys11 muteins best fit a single binding site model. The ranges of Kd values are 0.29-0.49 and 0.34-0.68 μm for the oxidized and reduced proteins, respectively. In fact, composite fits that include all the data for the oxidized proteins or the reduced proteins give standard deviations that are similar to those for the individual fits. In addition, similar Kd values are obtained by fitting the data to the standard binding isotherm given in Equation 1 (Fig. 5, dashed line) as with the more rigorous quadratic Equation 2 (solid line) that takes ligand depletion at low CHPA concentrations into account. Therefore, based on the composite fits, the Kd values for CHPA of the oxidized and reduced states of CprK are between 0.3 and 0.5 μm.TABLE 1Dissociation constants for the complex between CprK (and variants) and CHPAProteinRedox stateKdaThese values were calculated by fits to Equation 2, which accounts for ligand depletion at low concentrations of CHPA.μmWild typeReduced0.52 ± 0.18Oxidized0.49 ± 0.16C11DReduced0.68 ± 0.11Oxidized0.31 ± 0.14C11SReduced0.34 ± 0.11Oxidized0.29 ± 0.11CombinedbThese values were obtained by fitting the combined data sets for wild type, C11S, and C11D.Reduced0.50 ± 0.09Oxidized0.30 ± 0.09a These values were calculated by fits to Equation 2, which accounts for ligand depletion at low concentrations of CHPA.b These values were obtained by fitting the combined data sets for wild type, C11S, and C11D. Open table in a new tab Because the CprK variants with substitutions at Cys11 retain high affinity for CHPA, the inactivity of these variants was presumed to result from loss of DNA binding ability. We compared the affinity of the Cys11 variants for DNA with that of the wild type protein by performing EMSA at increasing DNA concentrations. The C11S variant requires greater than 50-fold more DNA to obtain the same amount of CprK-DNA complex as with the wild type protein (Fig. 6). Thus, only marginal activity is observed when the thiol of Cys11 is replaced by a hydroxide (in C11S). With the C11D variant (data not shown), no gel shift was observed even at 500 nm DNA, indicating either that the negative charge or the increased steric bulk of Asp at residue 11 strongly inhibits DNA binding. Thus, CprK promoter binding activity appears to require the Cys11 thiol(ate) functionality. Loss of DNA Binding Activity May Reflect a Change in Tertiary Structure of Cprk—Although the first 18 amino acid residues were disordered and not seen in the crystal structure of the reduced protein, the structure of oxidized CprK reveals Cys11 to be positioned near the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 7) (10Joyce, M. G., Levy, C., Gabor, K., Pop, S. M., Biehl, B. D., Doukov, T. I., Ryter, J. M., Mazon, H., Smidt, H., van den Heuvel, R. H. H., Ragsdale, S. W., van der Oost, J., and Leys, D. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 28318–28325Google Scholar). To determine whether the loss of DNA binding activity in the Cys11 variants is associated with a change in the structure of CprK, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded of oxidized and DTT-reduced CprK and of the Cys11 variants (Fig. 8). As observed earlier, reduction of CprK leads to quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (13Pop S.M. Gupta N. Raza A.S. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating that the single Trp at position 106 becomes more solvent-exposed upon reduction (Fig. 8). The fluorescence spectra of the DTT-reduced forms of C11S and C11D coincide, with a significantly lower intensity than that of the reduced wild type protein (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that the tertiary structures of the reduced Cys11 variants (at least in the region of Trp106) are different from that of wild type CprK. The fluorescence spectrum of the oxidized C11S variant is similar to that of the reduced state of wild type CprK (Fig. 8A), indicating that Trp106 in C11S is already rather solvent-exposed in the oxidized protein. The fluorescence spectrum of oxidized C11D is similar to that of oxidized wild type CprK (Fig. 8A), whereas reduction of C11D leads to a marked (∼40%) quenching of fluorescence (Fig. 8B). Based on CD analysis, substitutions at Cys11 cause only marginal changes in secondary structure (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table 2), which are within or near the error limits of the experiment. Table 2 shows the results obtained from the secondary structure analysis for wild type CprK and the Cys11 variants. The normalized root mean squared deviation values for all of the fits are below 0.1, which indicates that the experimental data are well fit by parameters calculated by the Continll program.TABLE 2Secondary structure analysis of wild type CprK and variantsProteinα-Helixβ-SheetTurnUnorderedNRMSDaNRMSD, normalized root mean square difference.Wild type0.4210.1670.1540.2580.018C11S0.409 (2.8%)0.159 (4.8%)0.150 (2.6%)0.2810.026C11D0.415 (1.4%)0.139 ("
