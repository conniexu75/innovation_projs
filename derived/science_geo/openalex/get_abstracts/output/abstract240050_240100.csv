https://openalex.org/W2147510335,"The compound BIRB796 inhibits the stress-activated protein kinases p38α and p38β and is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Here we report that BIRB796 also inhibits the activity and the activation of SAPK3/p38γ. This occurs at higher concentrations of BIRB796 than those that inhibit p38α and p38β and at lower concentrations than those that inhibit the activation of JNK isoforms. We also show that at these concentrations, BIRB796 blocks the stress-induced phosphorylation of the scaffold protein SAP97, further establishing that this is a physiological substrate of SAPK3/p38γ. Our results demonstrate that BIRB796, in combination with SB203580, a compound that inhibits p38α and p38β, but not the other p38 isoforms, can be used to identify physiological substrates of SAPK3/p38γ as well as those of p38α and p38β."
https://openalex.org/W2075520328,"DNA hypomethylation is a hallmark of many types of solid tumors. However, it remains elusive how DNA hypomethylation may contribute to tumorigenesis. In this study, we have investigated how targeted disruption of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b affects the growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our studies led to the following observations. 1) Constitutive or conditional deletion of <i>Dnmt3b</i>, but not <i>Dnmt3a</i>, resulted in partial loss of DNA methylation throughout the genome, suggesting that Dnmt3b, in addition to the major maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, is required for maintaining DNA methylation in MEF cells. 2) Dnmt3b-deficient MEF cells showed aneuploidy and polyploidy, chromosomal breaks, and fusions. 3) Inactivation of <i>Dnmt3b</i> resulted in either premature senescence or spontaneous immortalization of MEF cells. 4) The G<sub>1</sub> to S-phase checkpoint was intact in primary and spontaneously immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs because the p53 protein was inducible by DNA damage. Interestingly, protein levels of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 were increased in immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs even in the absence of p53 induction. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation may induce genomic instability, which in turn leads to spontaneous immortalization or premature senescence of Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs via a p53-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2140512094,"Both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers. Here we propose that simultaneous targeting of both receptors with a bispecific antibody would lead to enhanced antitumor activity. To this end, we produced a recombinant human IgG-like bispecific antibody, a Di-diabody, using the variable regions from two antagonistic antibodies: IMC-11F8 to EGFR and IMC-A12 to IGFR. The Di-diabody binds to both EGFR and IGFR and effectively blocked both EGF- and IGF-stimulated receptor activation and tumor cell proliferation. The Di-diabody also inherited the biological properties from both of its parent antibodies; it triggers rapid and significant IGFR internalization and degradation and mediates effective antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cells. Finally, the Di-diabody strongly inhibited the growth of two different human tumor xenografts in vivo. Our results underscore the benefits of simultaneous targeting of two tumor targets with bispecific antibodies.

Our results underscore the benefits of simultaneous targeting of two tumor targets with bispecific antibodies. The lack of specificity of currently available chemo- and radiotherapeutic agents constitutes the major obstacle to the effective treatment of cancer. The common use of the combinatorial therapeutic regimens comprising several cytotoxic agents, e.g. various chemotherapeutics and radiations that hit cancer cells via different mechanisms, is often associated with severe toxicities to the patients. Because of their exclusive specificity and high affinity toward defined targets, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibodies; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IGFR, insulin-like growth factor receptor; BsAb, bispecific antibodies; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; VL, variable light; VH, variable heavy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. are emerging as a promising new class of effective cancer therapeutics (1Glennie M.J.

So far the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved eight antibody-based products, including unmodified (or naked) antibodies (Rituxan®, Herceptin®, Campath®, Erbitux®, and Avastin®), radiolabeled antibodies (Zevalin® and Bexxar®), and an antibody conjugate (Mylotarg®), for several oncology indications. Because of limited intrinsic cytotoxicity, unmodified mAb, when used alone, usually only yielded from marginal (e.g. Herceptin® and Avastin®) to 10–12% (e.g. Erbitux®) objective responses in patients with solid malignancies (3Baselga J. Oncology. 2001; 61: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Lenz H.J. Mayer R.J. Gold P.J. Mirtsching B. Stella P.J. Cohn A.L. Pippas A.W. Azarnia N. Needle M.N. Van Cutsem E. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22 (Abstr. 3510): 247sGoogle Scholar). The therapeutic efficacy of these antibodies is significantly enhanced when combined with conventional chemotherapeutics and/or radiation, for example, Erbitux® plus a regimen of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin in third line refractory colorectal cancer patients yielded a 22.9% of objective response rate compared with that of 11% in patients treated with Erbitux® alone (5Cunningham D. Humblet Y. Siena S. Khayat D. Bleiberg H. Santoro A. Bets D. Mueser M. Harstrick A. Verslype C. Chau I. Van Cutsem E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar), and when combined with high dose radiation Erbitux® significantly prolonged the survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (6Bonner J.A. Giralt J. Harari P.M. Cohen R. Jones C. Sur R.K. Rabin D. Azarnia N. Needle M.N. Ang K.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22 (Abstr. 5507): 489sCrossref Google Scholar). The dose-limiting toxicities of these combined therapies are usually associated with the cytotoxic components in the regimens. Because of their high specificity and low toxicity, it is generally believed that combination of the antitumor antibodies directed against different tumor-associated targets may yield enhanced therapeutic activity without adding significant toxicity. Clinical application of antibody combination is, however, greatly hindered by a number of factors, including limited availability of antibody products, high cost of each product, and the Food and Drug Administration-associated regulatory issues; it is most likely that each antibody has to be separately tested and approved before being tested and approved in combination. To this end, the development of bispecific or multi-specific antibodies that target two or more tumor-associated antigens simultaneously may offer a novel and promising solution. In past years, both laboratory and early clinical studies have demonstrated that bispecific antibodies (BsAb) may have significant potential applications in cancer therapy by targeting tumor cells with cytotoxic agents including effector cells, radionuclides, drugs, and toxins (7van Spriel A.B. van Ojik H.H. van de Winkel J.G.J.

Here we explored a new concept of utilizing BsAb by constructing a novel IgG-like antibody molecule that targets two different (but relevant) tumor targets, i.e. growth factor receptors, thus blocking simultaneously two receptor activation and their downstream signaling pathways. In this “proof-of-concept” study, we chose the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) as our model targets. Both receptors have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of a variety of human cancers (10Baserge R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Werner H. Le Roith D.

Targeted inhibition of EGFR with mAb or small molecular kinase inhibitors, including Erbitux® and Iressa® (ZD1839), has shown great anticancer activity in a number of animal models as well as in various clinical studies (for reviews, see Refs. 16Waksal H.W.

Similarly, significant tumor inhibition has also been achieved in animal models with several IGFR targeting strategies including antisense oligonucleotides (21Lee C.T. Wu S. Gabrilovich D. Chen H.

Using the variable domains of two neutralizing human antibodies as the “building blocks,” one directed against EGFR and the other against IGFR, we constructed and produced an IgG-like tetravalent BsAb, a so-called “Di-diabody.” The Di-diabody bound to both EGFR and IGFR, blocked the receptors from interacting with their respective ligands, and inhibited both EGF- and IGF-stimulated activation of the receptors as well as the receptor-associated downstream signaling pathways. Further, the Di-diabody was able to trigger rapid and efficient IGFR internalization and degradation and mediate effective immune effector function such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Finally, the Di-diabody strongly inhibited the growth of human tumor xenografts in vivo. Cell Lines and Proteins—Human tumor cell lines, DiFi and HT29 (colorectal carcinoma), A413 (cervical carcinoma), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and BxPC3 (pancreatic carcinoma) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Recombinant extracellular domain of IGFR and its ligand, IGF-I, and EGF were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant EGFR extracellular domain was produced at ImClone Systems Inc. (New York, NY). Identification from an antibody phage display library and production from mammalian cells of the anti-EGFR antibody, IMC-11F8, and the anti-IGFR antibody, IMC-A12, have been previously described (23Burtrum D.

IMC-C225, a clinical grade anti-EGFR antibody, and IMC-1121, a human anti-human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antibody (28Lu D. Shen J. Vil M.D. Zhang H. Jimenez X. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43496-43507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), were produced at ImClone Systems Inc. Construction and Production of the Bispecific Di-diabody—The variable light (VL) and the variable heavy (VH) domains of IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 were cloned and assembled into two cross-over scFv fragments, A12VL-linker-11F8 VH and 11F8VL-linker-A12VH, following a procedure previously described (29Lu D. Jimenez X. Witte L. Zhu Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 5-amino acid sequence, Arg-Thr-Val-Ala-Ala, representing the first 5 residues from the N terminus of human κ light chain constant domain, was used as the linker (29Lu D. Jimenez X. Witte L. Zhu Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To construct the tetravalent bispecific Di-diabody, a gene encoding one of the “cross-over” scFv chains, 11F8VL-linker-A12VH, was further fused on its C terminus by overlapping PCR to a gene encoding the Fc fragment (CH2-CH3 domains) of an IgG, via the hinge region, to form a fusion polypeptide, 11F8VL-linker-A12VH-hinge-Fc chain. The fusion polypeptide chain was then subcloned into an expression vector along with its partner, the other cross-over scFv chain, A12VL-linker-11F8 VH (see Fig. 1 for details). The expression vector was transfected into NS0 cells, followed by expression of the soluble Di-diabody in serum-free cell culture and purification of the antibody with protein A chromatography. The purity of the Di-diabody was assayed via SDS-PAGE analysis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Receptor Binding Assays—Two different assays were carried out to examine the binding specificity and efficiency of the Di-diabody. In the first assay, the cross-linking assay, the Di-diabody was tested for its capability in simultaneously binding two target antigens. Briefly, the Di-diabody or the monospecific antibodies (5 nm) were first incubated with a biotin-labeled IGFR (100 ng) in solution and then transferred to a microtiter plate coated with EGFR (100 ng/well), followed by incubation with streptoavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to measure the plate-bound biotin activity. In the second assay, the direct binding assay, various amounts of antibodies were added to triplicate wells of 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) precoated with human IGFR1 or EGFR extracellular domain (100 ng/well) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 μl of a rabbit anti-human IgG Fc-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA). The plates were washed, peroxidase substrate was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read following a previously described procedure (27Lu D. Zhang H. Ludwig D. Persaud A. Jimenez X. Burtrum D. Balderes P. Liu M. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2856-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assays—1 × 104 DiFi cells in 100 μl of complete medium were seeded in each well of 96-well plates and cultured overnight. Various amounts of antibodies were added in triplicate wells and allowed to culture for 4 days, after which 10 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (5 mg/ml; Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for additional 4 h. The plates were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 100 μl of HCl/isopropanol (40 mm) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by optical density reading at 570 nm. Receptor Phosphorylation and Signal Transduction Assay—Tumor cells were plated into 75-mm dishes and grown to 70–80% confluence, after which the cells were washed twice in PBS and cultured overnight in serum free medium. The cells were first incubated with various antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by stimulation with EGF, IGF, or both at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by centrifugation of the lysate at 12, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Both EGFR and IGFR1 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate supernatant by using a mixture of IMC-C225 and IMC-A12, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitated receptor proteins were resolved on a 4–12% Nupage Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phospho-EGFR and phospho-IGFR were detected on the blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total receptor proteins loaded on the gel were assayed with a mixture of an anti-EGFR (clone 1005) and an anti-IGFRβ antibody (clone C20) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% acrylamide gel, and the phospho-Akt and phospho-p44/p42 were detected with an antibody mixture containing an anti-phospho-Akt and an anti-phospho-p44/p42 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), followed by an anti-mouse antibody-HRP conjugate. Total Akt and p44/p42 proteins were assayed with a mixture of an anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-p44/p42 antibody (Cell Signaling). All of the signals were visualized with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor Degradation Analysis—The cells were plated and incubated overnight in serum-free medium. IGF-I (50 nm), EGF (50 nm) (R & D Systems), or various antibodies were then added and incubated at 37 °C for up to 4 h. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, lysed, and loaded onto a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). The proteins were electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane following standard protocols. IGFR and EGFR were detected by Western blotting using antibody C-20 against IGFRβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and IMC-11F8, followed by an anti-rabbit (for C-20) or anti-human (for IMC-11F8)-HRP conjugate. The signals were visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody-dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) Assay—Blood was collected from normal volunteers and mixed with an equal volume of Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+. The mixture was layered onto a Lymphoprep gradient (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Irvine, CA) and centrifuged at 800 relative centrifugal force × g for 20 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at the interface and washed in HEPES-buffered saline. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and stimulated by incubation with 200 units/ml interleukin-2 for 1–7 days. DiFi cells were plated at a density of 10000 cells/well in 50 μl in a 96-well U-bottomed plate and incubated with IMC-11F8, IMC-A12, the Di-diabody, or a normal human IgG (Sigma) (50 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to triplicate wells in a volume of 50 μl at an effector/tumor cell ratios of 100/1 and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min, 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to a 96-well flat bottom plate, followed by the addition of 100 μl/well lactate dehydrogenase assay reagent (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and a reading of the absorbance at 490 nm. Target maximum absorbance was determined by lysing the cells with 50 μl of 4% Triton X-100, whereas target spontaneous absorbance was determined in the absence of antibody and effector cells, and effector spontaneous absorbance was determined in the absence of antibody and target cells. Total cytotoxicity was calculated as: the percentage of cell lysis = (experimental OD490 nm - effector spontaneous - target spontaneous)/(target maximum - target spontaneous) × 100. The percentage of specific cell lysis mediated by the antibodies was determined as: the percentage of cell lysis in the antibody-treated group - the percentage of cell lysis in the normal human IgG group. In Vivo Efficacy Studies—Female athymic nu/nu mice, 6–8 weeks of age (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), were injected subcutaneously on the lateral dorsal surface with BxPC3 (2 × 106/mouse) or HT-29 (5 × 106/mouse) tumor cells. When tumors reached ∼200–300 mm3, mice were randomized by tumor size and divided into treatment groups. The mice were treated by IMC-11F8 (or the equivalent IMC-C225), IMC-A12, IMC-11F8 (or IMC-C225) plus IMC-A12, the Di-diabody, or the control articles (saline or normal human IgG). Each antibody was administered by intraperitoneal injections at 40 mg/kg (or 80 mg/kg for the Di-diabody in the HT29 model) twice a week. Tumor growth was evaluated twice weekly with tumor volume calculated as: π/6 × (length × width2), where length = longest diameter and width = diameter perpendicular to length. Statistical analysis of tumor growth inhibition was performed using a Repeated Measures analysis of variance program (JMP 5.0.1). Construction and Production of the Di-diabody—The variable regions of two previously characterized antagonistic antibodies, the anti-EGFR IMC-11F8 and the anti-IGFR IMC-A12, were used as the “building blocks” to construct the IgG-like tetravalent BsAb, the Di-diabody. A bispecific diabody was first constructed, followed by fusion of one of the diabody cross-over scFv chains to the Fc domain of an IgG (see Fig. 1, A and B, for details). Coexpression in mammalian cells of the Fc fusion along with the other cross-over scFv resulted in an IgG-like tetravalent molecule with two binding specificities (Fig. 1B). The Di-diabody was produced by stably transfected NS0 cells in serum-free conditions and purified from the cell culture supernatant via a protein A affinity column. No significant aggregation was observed when the purified Di-diabody preparation was assayed by an analytical size exclusion chromatography light scattering analysis. Electrophoresis analysis of the Di-diabody under nonreducing conditions yielded two major protein bands with expected mobility, the Fc fusion (the top band) in dimer form (molecular mass, ∼100 kDa) and the cross-over scFv (the lower band) in monomer form (molecular mass, ∼25 kDa) (Fig. 1C, lane 2). IMC-11F8, an IgG, yielded a single protein band of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Under reducing conditions, the Di-diabody also gave rise to two bands: the top band at ∼50 kDa (representing the Fc fusion in monomer form) and the lower band at ∼25 kDa (the cross-over scFv) (Fig. 1D, lane 2). As controls, IMC-11F8 gave two major bands: the IgG heavy chain (50 kDa) and the IgG light chain (25 kDa) (Fig. 1D, lane 1). The Di-diabody Binds to Both EGFR and IGFR—Two assays were used to demonstrate that the Di-diabody was capable of binding to both EGFR and IGFR. In the first assay, the cross-linking assay, we examined whether the Di-diabody could bind to both of its targets simultaneously. Various antibodies were first incubated with a biotin-labeled IGFR in solution and then transferred to a 96-well plate coated with EGFR, followed by incubation with streptoavidin-HRP to measure the plate-bound biotin activity, i.e. the amount of IGFR that was cross-linked to the immobilized EGFR by the antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, only the Di-diabody, but not the monospecific IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12, was able to cross-link IGFR in solution with the immobilized EGFR, as demonstrated by the plate-associated biotin activity. In the second direct binding assay, the Di-diabody was compared with its monospecific counterparts in antigen-binding efficiency. IMC-A12 and IMC-11F8 bound only to their respective targets, whereas the Di-diabody reacted to both immobilized EGFR and IGFR, with moderately lower efficiencies compared with their monospecific counterparts (Fig. 2, B and C). The ED50 values, i.e. the antibody concentrations that yield 50% of maximum binding, to EGFR were 0.05 nm for IMC-11F8 and 0.1–0.2 nm for the Di-diabody, and to IGFR were 0.1 nm for IMC-A12 and 0.25–0.5 nm for the Di-diabody. Inhibition of Tumor Cell Proliferation in Vitro by the Di-diabody—Next we examined the efficacy of the Di-diabody in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vitro in comparison with their monospecific counterparts, using a well characterized tumor cell line, DiFi, which is known to depend on EGFR for survival and growth (30Wu X. Fan Z. Masui H. Rosen N. Mendelsohn J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The anti-EGFR IMC-11F8 significantly inhibited the proliferation of DiFi cells, whereas the anti-IGFR IMC-A12, as well as the control antibody (IMC-1121), showed no effect (Fig. 3). Combination of both IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 yielded similar activity to that of IMC-11F8 alone. The Di-diabody demonstrated a much weaker anti-proliferative activity compared with the mono-specific IMC-11F8; the IC50 values, i.e. the antibody concentrations required for 50% tumor growth inhibition, were ∼1, 1, and 25 nm for IMC-11F8 (alone), IMC-11F8 (plus IMC-A12), and the Di-diabody, respectively. The Di-diabody Blocks Signaling Pathways Stimulated by Both EGF and IGF—The Di-diabody was examined on it efficacy in blocking EGF- and IGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream signal transduction. Although incubation of MCF-7 cells with individual growth factor, EGF or IGF, results in significant levels of phosphorylation of the respective receptor, combination of EGF and IGF yields activation of both EGFR and IGFR (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4). As expected, when the tumor cells were stimulated with both EGF and IGF, treatment with either IMC-A12 or IMC-11F8 only inhibited phosphorylation of the individual receptor (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, the Di-diabody, like the mixture of both IMC-11F8 and IMC-12, significantly blocked activation of both receptors (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8). The control antibody, IMC-1121, showed no effect on the phosphorylation of EGFR and IGFR (Fig. 4, lane 9). The effect of IMC-11F8, IMC-A12 and the Di-diabody on the two major downstream signal transduction molecules associated with both EGFR and IGFR, Akt and p44/p42 MAP kinases, were also studied in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4). Stimulation with IGF results in significant phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4, lane 2), whereas EGF causes strong phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK (Fig. 4, lane 3). As expected, combination of IGF to EGF leads to activation of both Akt and p44/p42 MAPK (Fig. 4, lane 4). In the presence of both EGF and IGF, IMC-11F8 significantly inhibited the activation of MAPK but only moderately reduced the activation of Akt (Fig. 4, lane 7), whereas IMC-A12 strongly reduced Akt phosphorylation but was less effective in p44/p42 MAPK activation (Fig. 4, lane 6). Similar to the observation with the receptors, a combination of IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12, either as a mixture or as the Di-diabody, effectively blocked phosphorylation of both Akt and p44/p42 MAPK induced by EGF and IGF (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8). The Di-diabody Triggers Efficient IGFR Internalization and Degradation—We previously demonstrated that IMC-A12 was capable of down-regulating tumor cell surface expression of IGFR by inducing rapid and efficient receptor internalization and degradation (23Burtrum D. Zhu Z. Lu D. Anderson D.M. Prewett M. Pereira D.S. Bassi R. Abdullah R. Hooper A.T. Koo H. Jimenez X. Johnson D. Apblett R. Kussie P. Bohlen P. Witte L. Hicklin D.J. Ludwig D.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8912-8921PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether the Di-diabody retained the receptor modulation activity of IMC-A12 on tumor cells. Consistent with our previous observation, IMC-A12 triggered significant IGFR internalization and degradation in MCF-7 cells after incubation at 37 °C for 4 h (Fig. 5, A and B). Incubation with the Di-diabody led to significant degradation of IGFR in both MCF-7 and BxPC3 cells (Fig. 5). This IGFR modulation effect of the Di-diabody is both dose-dependent, with the maximum effect, similar to that of IMC-A12, achieved at an antibody concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 5A), and time-dependent; greater than 90% of the IGFR was degraded in BxPC3 cells after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 5C). The ligand IGF, IMC-11F8, and the control antibody, IMC-1121, did not show any effects on IGFR modulation. In contrast to their activity on IGFR, none of the treatments, including the ligand EGF, the Di-diabody, and IMC-11F8 (alone or in combination with IMC-A12), demonstrated any modulation effects on the total level of EGFR in both MCF7 and BxPc3 cells (Fig. 5). The Di-diabody Mediates Effective ADCC on Tumor Cells—In addition to blocking growth signals by interfering with growth factor/receptor interaction and down-regulating receptor surface expression, antitumor IgG antibodies can also cause direct tumor cell killing via mediating effective ADCC. Here we examined whether the Fc-containing Di-diabody is capable of mediating tumor cell killing in the presence of human effector cells. As shown in Fig. 6, IMC-11F8 showed good lysis activity to both A431 and BxPC3 cells but was ineffective to MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, IMC-A12 was only effective toward MCF-7 cells but failed to kill A431 and BxPC3 cells. The Di-diabody, similar to the combination of both IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12, was equally potent in mediating cell killing to all three tumor lines. The Di-diabody Inhibits the Growth of Human Tumor Xenografts in Nude Mice—We previously showed that both IMC-A12 and IMC-11F8, when used alone, were very efficacious agents in inhibiting the growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice (23Burtrum D.

https://openalex.org/W2145907407,"Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways triggered by interleukin (IL)-1 and Toll-like receptors in several steps of innate host defense. A crucial event in this signaling pathway is represented by dimerization of MyD88, which allows the recruitment of downstream kinases like IRAK-1 and IRAK-4. Herein, we have investigated the function of the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain in MyD88 homodimerization in cell-free and in vitro experimental settings by using epta-peptides that mimic the BB-loop region of the conserved TIR domain of different proteins. By using a pull-down assay with purified glutathione S-transferase-MyD88 TIR or co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that epta-peptides derived from the TIR domain of MyD88 and IL-18R are the most effective in inhibiting homodimerization with either the isolated TIR or full-length MyD88. Moreover, we demonstrated that a cell permeable analog of MyD88 epta-peptide inhibits homodimerization of MyD88 TIR domains in an in vitro cell system and significantly reduces IL-1 signaling, as assayed by activation of the downstream transcription factor NF-κB. Our results indicate that the BB-loop in TIR domain of MyD88 is a good target for specific inhibition of MyD88-mediated signaling in vivo.

Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) 1The abbreviations used are: MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithio-dl-threitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; DD, death domain; TIR, Toll/IL-1 receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; aa, amino acids; RP, reverse-phase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PLB, passive lysis buffer; RAcP, receptor accessory protein. is a crucial adaptor protein that functions to recruit signaling proteins to receptors of the Toll-like or interleukin-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) superfamily (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 2O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling pathways downstream of this class of receptors is fundamental for several aspects of host defense. The MyD88 protein has a modular structure composed of a death domain (DD) at the N terminus and a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain at the C terminus separated by a short linker region, referred to as intermediary domain (3Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2467-2475PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, MyD88 is recruited to the membrane by interaction of its TIR domain with the analogous domain in the IL-1R or TLR receptors (4Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MyD88 forms homodimers (5Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and promotes the recruitment to the plasma membrane and the activation of two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases: IRAK-4 and IRAK-1. A homophilic interaction between MyD88 DD and the homologous DD found at the N terminus of the kinases is required for such event (6Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A recent model proposes that MyD88 binds to IRAK-4 and promotes phoshorylation of critical IRAK-1 residues by IRAK-4 (7Janssens S. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 474-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These events stimulate IRAK-1 autophosphorylation and its interaction with TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6), leading to activation of both the inhibitory κB kinase (IKK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) JNK and p38. These kinases are pivotal in the ultimate activation of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP-1), which elicit the production of essential effector molecules for immune and inflammatory responses (8Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The generation of MyD88-deficient mice (9Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) has shown that this protein is required for the proliferative response of T-cells to IL-1, for the IL-18-mediated production of interferon-γ by Th1 cells, and for the activation of natural killer cells. Thus, MyD88 is an essential mediator for the response of several immune cells to cytokines. Moreover, MyD88-knock-out mice are insensitive to LPS-induced death and fail to secrete cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in vivo (10Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Most notably, this study also revealed that LPS-induced activation of both NF-κB and MAPK was delayed, rather than abolished, in these mice (11Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), highlighting the existence of a MyD88-independent pathway of TLR-4 signaling (12O'Neill L.A.J. Science. 2004; 303: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, loss of MyD88 expression has an anti-inflammatory effect in early atherosclerosis (13Björkbacka H. Kunjathoor V.V. Moore K.J. Koehn S. Ordija C.M. Lee M.A. Means T. Halmen K. Luster A.D. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), whereas additional studies have further underlined the key inflammatory role of MyD88 in arthritis. Indeed, MyD88-deficient mice do not develop streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis (14Joosten L.A. Koenders M.I. Smeets R.L. Heuvelmans-Jacobs M. Helsen M.M. Takeda K. Akira S. Lubberts E. van de Loo F.A. van den Berg W.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) nor a visually detectable synovitis after transfer of arthritogenic sera (15Choe J.Y. Crain B. Wu S.R. Corr M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that targeting the TLR/IL-1R pathway by interfering with the function of MyD88 may be a novel approach in the therapy of chronic inflammatory disorders. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether it was feasible to attenuate MyD88 signaling by means of peptide-mediated interference of MyD88 TIR domain homodimerization. Computational Methods—The MyD88 sequence was aligned by PSI-Blast to retrieve homologs and the selected sequences were aligned using ClustalW algorithm on the NPS server (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr). Consensus secondary structure prediction was performed on the Predict-Protein server using different algorithms: Jpred, Psi-pred, PHD, Prof (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein). A structural alignment between the target sequence (GenBank™ accession number: NP_002459) and the sequences with known crystal structures was performed using FUGUE program and manually adjusted based on secondary structure prediction and conserved regions found (www.cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/prfsearch.html). The position of gaps and insertions was disfavored within conserved secondary structures. By using a homology modeling technique and Swiss-PDBViewer software (17Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional model of MyD88 TIR domain (aa 161–295) was built using TLR2 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1fyx) as template, extracted from Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Molecular dynamics simulation, followed by simulated annealing technique was performed using MacroModel software (AMBER force field, GB/SA solvent model for water, 100 ps each step at different levels of constraint) (18Schrödinger LLC MacroModel 8.5. Schrödinger LLC, Portland, OR2003Google Scholar). Quality evaluation of the model regarding variable regions and loops was done by the PROCHECK program (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Models of MyD88 homodimers were generated using geometry and hydrophobicity complementary search algorithm GRAMM (20Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The docking parameters were set to: step grid at 1.7 Å, repulsion potential at 30.0, and intervals of rotation at 10°. The 30 lower energy models were clustered to select the most representative ones and then they were minimized to obtain seven different homodimers. Peptide Synthesis—The peptides were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase method (16Bodanszky M. Principles of Peptide Synthesis. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) on Rink-amide (amino methyl)-polystyrene resin using an ABi 431 A (Applied Biosystems) automatic peptide synthesizer and then cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triisopropylsilane/1,2-ethanedithiol at 92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5 (v/v). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC-RP) on C12 reverse-phase Jupiter-Proteo (Phenomenex) semipreparative columns. The intermediates and product analysis were performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy by HPLC-RP on C18 reverse-phase Luna (Phenomenex) and mass spectroscopy with Thermofinnigan LCQ-Duo to confirm their molecular weight. The final peptide purity was 90–99%. Plasmids—AU1-tagged MyD88 and AU1-tagged TIR domain of MyD88 expressing plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Marta Muzio (”Mario Negri“Institute, Milan, Italy). cDNA encoding the TIR domain of MyD88 was amplified by PCR using pCDNA3-AU1-MyD88 as template and oligonucleotides 5′-AGGGATCCCCGACCCCCTGGGGCATATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGAATTCTCAGGGCAGGGACAAGGC-3′ (reverse). The cDNA obtained was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of either pCDNA3-N2-Myc or pGEX-3X expression vectors for Myc- or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged TIR domain, respectively. For the NF-κB reporter assays, the NF-κB luciferase and Renilla luciferase constructs were used according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cell Culture and Transfections—The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and HeLa cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and grown in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293-TLR3 cells (InvivoGen), stably transfected with human TLR3, were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (InvivoGen). The HEK293 cells were cultured in 10-cm-diameter dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5–15 μg of the appropriate plasmids. The Antennapedia43–58-fused MyD88196–202 peptides were added to the medium 24 h after transfection. GST-MyD88 TIR Domain Fusion Protein Synthesis and Purification—Escherichia coli cells (BL21) transformed with pGEX-3X-TIR construct were grown at 30 °C in LB medium to an optical density (A600 nm) of 0.6. GST-TIR fusion protein expression was induced by 3-h induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich). Bacterial pellets were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, by probe sonication. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and supernatant fractions were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. After several washes in PBS, GST-fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, containing 10 mm glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich). Purified proteins were stored at –80 °C in the same buffer containing 10% glycerol. Protein purity and integrity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells were collected 24 h after transfection, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors. After 10 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and cytosolic fractions collected for immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts (800 μg of total proteins) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-AU1 antibody (Babco) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. Following incubation, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with PBS, and then incubated with 0.5 μg GST-TIR and 200 μm TIR peptides in PBS for 1 h under constant shaking at 4 °C. Sepharose bead-bound immunocomplexes were washed twice with PBS and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) for Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cell extracts (700 μg of total proteins) prepared as described above were precleared by incubation for 1 h with a mixture of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) under constant shaking at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 1 μg of mouse anti-Myc (E910, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated for 1 h with a mixture of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) in lysis buffer containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) under constant shaking at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer/0.05% BSA and then incubated with precleared cell extracts for 2 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. Sepharose bead-bound immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted in SDS sample buffer as described above and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were saturated with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the following primary antibody (1: 1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C: mouse anti-AU1 (for AU1-TIR, from Babco), mouse anti-Myc (for Myc-TIR, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GST (for GST-TIR, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature at a 1:10,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunostained bands were detected by the chemiluminescence method (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NF-κB Reporter Assay—HeLa cells or HEK293-TLR3 (2.5 × 105) were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene and Renilla luciferase reporter gene (8 ng) as an internal control using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostic) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, Antennapedia43–58-fused MyD88196–202 peptides were added to the medium. After 2 additional hours, either 5 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D Systems) (HeLa cells) or 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) (InvivoGen) (HEK293-TLR3) were added to the same medium. After additional 6 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (PLB) (dual-luciferase reporter assay system, Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were cleared for 30 s by centrifugation at top speed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge and transferred to a fresh tube prior to reporter enzyme analysis. Ten μl of cell lysates were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent II (Promega), and the NF-κB-firefly luciferase activity was determined using a biocounter luminometer. For the assessment of the Renilla luciferase activity, 100 μl of Stop & Glo® reagent were added to the same sample. Data are normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity with that of Renilla luciferase. Data are expressed as mean -fold induction ± S.D. from a minimum of three separate experiments. Recruitment of MyD88 to receptors belonging to the TLR/IL-1R superfamily requires a direct TIR-TIR domain interaction (21Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 22Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol.

Albeit most of the conserved residues in TIR domains lie within the core of the fold, some are solvent-exposed residues and may thus allow homotypic and/or heterotypic interactions to occur among different partners. Actually, a loop referred to as the BB-loop connecting the second β-strand and second α-helix (BB in Fig. 1A), and that includes a proline → histidine mutation, renders the mice harboring this mutation hyporesponsive to LPS (24Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). Moreover, the corresponding change also abolishes the ability of TLR2 to interact with MyD88 in vitro (25Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hence, we asked whether inhibition of MyD88 signaling might be achieved by interfering with its TIR homodimerization domain using specific peptides that mimic the BB-loop. To better understand how the BB-loop could be located at the interface, we have modeled the TIR domain of MyD88 and generated homodimers using the GRAMM software. Shown in Fig. 1B is the best ranked and the eighth ranked solution, representing two different modes of interaction of the BB-loop, namely, docking either to Box 3 (aa 284–293, top) or to itself by an antiparallel packing (bottom). To experimentally assess the importance of this protein portion for homodimerization we produced a series of synthetic peptides (Table I).Table ISynthetic peptides mimicking the BB-loopIDSequenceMrNotesST 2348Ac-R-D-V-L-P-G-T-NH2797.9Ac-MyD88196-202-NH2ST 2404Ac-P-T-D-L-V-R-G-NH2797.9Ac-MyD88196-202 scrambled-NH2ST 2350Ac-R-D-V-V-P-G-G-NH2739.2Ac-IL-18R417-423-NH2ST 2349Ac-R-D-S-L-P-G-G-NH2739.2Ac-IL-1RAcP442-448-NH2ST 2351Ac-E-R-N-F-V-P-G-NH2859.0Ac-TLR1670-676-NH2ST 2345Ac-R-Q-I-K-I-W-F-Q-N-R-R-M-K-W-K-K-R-D-V-L-P-G-T-NH23026.7Ac-Antennapedia43-58-MyD88196-202-NH2ST 2403Ac-R-Q-I-K-I-W-F-Q-N-R-R-M-K-W-K-K-P-T-D-L-V-R-G-NH23026.7Ac-Antennapedia43-58-MyD88196-202 scrambled-NH2 Open table in a new tab As a first approach, we tested the ability of such peptides to interfere with the dimerization of MyD88 TIR domains in vitro. Recombinant AU1-tagged MyD88 was expressed in HEK293 cells and isolated by immunoprecipitation. Hence, a purified GST fusion protein containing the TIR domain of MyD88 (aa 152–296) was incubated with the beads preadsorbed to AU1-MyD88 in the absence or presence of the peptides described in Table I. As expected, GST-TIR was able to associate to full-length MyD88. Interestingly, we observed that an epta-peptide (ST 2348) with the MyD88 sequence comprising aa 196–202 strongly inhibited this interaction (71% inhibition, see Fig. 2, A and B), whereas a scrambled peptide (ST 2404) with the same aa composition was inactive (2% inhibition). In the same analysis, we found that an epta-peptide (ST 2350) based on the IL-18 receptor sequence (aa 417–423) was even more potent (86% inhibition), whereas similar epta-peptides based on the sequence of IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP, aa 442–448) (ST 2349) or TLR1 (aa 670–676) (ST 2351) were either less effective (30% inhibition for IL-1RAcP) or completely inactive (0% inhibition for TLR1). The results of this analysis are listed in Fig. 2, A and B, and indicate an elevated sequence specificity in the inhibitory potential of TIR-domain based epta-peptides. A comparison of peptides, referred to as ST 2348 (MyD88), ST 2349 (IL-1RacP), and ST 2350 (IL-18R), indicates that the 7 amino acids can be subdivided into three different portions: an N-terminal conserved charged portion (RD), a C-terminal conserved β-turn portion (PG), and a central linker in which the most relevant differences are found. In particular, a nonconservative substitution (V198S) distinguishes ST 2348 from ST 2349 whereas ST 2350 has a conservative substitution (L199V) in this position. According to our homodymer model (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), the first substitution might negatively affect the putative hydrophobic interaction between Val198 and Arg196, while the substitution in ST 2350 would not affect the homodimerization. Thus, the experimental results shown in Fig. 2B lend great support to the model depicted in Fig. 1B (bottom panel). To confirm the ability of the MyD88 and IL-18R epta-peptides to interfere with dimerization of the TIR domains, we sought an alternative method, namely, the co-immunoprecipitation procedure. The TIR domain of MyD88 (aa 152–296) was subcloned in expression vectors containing either a Myc or an AU1 epitope tag. When Myc-TIR and AU1-TIR were co-expressed in HEK293 cells they could specifically interact, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (lane 3 in Fig. 3A). Both the MyD88 (ST 2348) and the IL-18R (ST 2350) epta-peptides were capable of similarly inhibiting this interaction and only trace amounts of AU1-TIR were co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-TIR when these peptides were added to the cell extracts before immunoprecipitation (lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 3A). In control experiments, a scrambled peptide (ST 2404) containing amino acids identical, though reshuffled, to those of MyD88196–202 did not significantly interfere with TIR domain dimerization (Fig. 3B). Next, we tested the effect of the MyD88 epta-peptide (ST 2348) on live cells by fusing it to a short basic peptide sequence from the third helix of Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain (aa 43–58, RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) to facilitate its delivery into cells (26Kueltzo L.A. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 1754-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Peptide effectiveness was measured as its ability to interfere with dimerization of the MyD88-TIR domains expressed in HEK293 cells. Hence, Myc-TIR and AU1-TIR were co-expressed in the presence of either the cell permeable MyD88 epta-peptide (ST 2345) or its scrambled control (ST 2403). In agreement with the results from previous experiments, we found that the cell permeable MyD88 peptide (ST 2345) inhibited the dimerization of the TIR domains (61%), whereas the scrambled peptide (ST 2403) exerted only a minor effect (17% inhibition, Fig. 4, A and B). This experiment suggests that the epta-peptide MyD88196–202 is capable of specifically interfering with dimerization of the TIR domains of MyD88 occurring in cells. Since the MyD88 epta-peptide interferes with dimerization of the TIR domains in cells, we sought to determine whether it might interfere with the functional activation of the IL-1 signaling pathway. The downstream event of stimulation with IL-1 is transcriptional activation of NF-κB, and dimerization of MyD88 is crucial for efficient propagation of this signaling cascade. Hence, we transfected HeLa cells, which express IL-1R and MyD88 (data not shown), with a reporter NF-κB-luciferase construct and then treated cells with IL-1 (5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of either Antennapedia43–58-fused MyD88196–202 (ST 2345) or its scrambled control (ST 2403). Activation of the pathway was determined by measuring luciferase activity in cell extracts 6 h after stimulation. We observed that IL-1 triggered a strong induction (70-fold) of luciferase activity in HeLa cells treated without peptide (Fig. 4C). Remarkably, the cell-permeable MyD88196–202 peptide (ST 2345) reduced NF-κB induction to 45-fold (35% reduction), whereas the scrambled peptide (ST 2403) had no significant effect (Fig. 4C). This result indicates that the IL-1 biological response is selectively inhibited by interfering with dimerization of the TIR domain of MyD88. To determine whether the interfering action of the MyD88196–202 peptide was specific, we checked its effect on the NF-κB activation exerted by the TLR-3 receptor, which signals through a MyD88-independent pathway (27Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H. Silva A.M. Williams B.R. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16713-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When HEK293 stably transfected with TLR-3 were stimulated with poly(I:C) (25 μg/ml), a 7-fold induction of NF-κB activity was observed. However, neither the MyD88196–202 peptide nor its scrambled control inhibited this activation, indicating that ST 2345 specifically interferes with MyD88-dependent signaling pathways (Fig. 4D). Our results suggest that the region of MyD88 in the extended loop, which is highly conserved in the TIR domains of different proteins, is a good candidate for drug design aimed at interfering with MyD88 signaling. Interestingly, we observed by dimerization assays that the most effective epta-peptides for blocking MyD88 TIR/TIR homophilic association were those deduced from the sequence of the TIR domains of IL-18R and MyD88 itself. A previous report (28Bartfai T. Behrens M.M. Gaidarova S. Pemberton J. Shivanyuk A. Rebek Jr., J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7971-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) showed that a low molecular weight mimic of the three protruding amino acids in the BB-loop (consensus for several IL-1RI, MyD88, and Toll receptors) can successfully inhibit interactions between IL-1RI and MyD88. We have shown here that the extended loop, besides intervening in association with the receptor(s), is also important for dimerization of MyD88 as detected in both cell-free and in vitro cell systems. Moreover, since these active eptapeptides are capable of inhibiting the activation of NF-κB by IL-1, molecules that mimic the structure of MyD88 may become valuable tools for investigating the in vivo role of this protein in cytokine signaling possibly leading to the design of new therapeutics (29Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2130845654,"Ubiquitination serves as a key sorting signal in the lysosomal degradation of endocytosed receptors through the ability of ubiquitinated membrane proteins to be recognized and sorted by ubiquitin-binding proteins along the endocytic route. The ESCRT-II complex in yeast contains one such protein, Vps36, which harbors a ubiquitin-binding NZF domain and is required for vacuolar sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Surprisingly, the presumptive mammalian ortholog Eap45 lacks the ubiquitin-binding module of Vps36, and it is thus not clear whether mammalian ESCRT-II functions to bind ubiquitinated cargo. In this paper, we provide evidence that Eap45 contains a novel ubiquitin-binding domain, GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin-binding in Eap45), which binds ubiquitin with similar affinity and specificity as other ubiquitin-binding domains. The GLUE domain shares similarities in its primary and predicted secondary structures to phosphoinositide-binding GRAM and PH domains. Accordingly, we find that Eap45 binds to a subset of 3-phosphoinositides, suggesting that ubiquitin recognition could be coordinated with phosphoinositide binding. Furthermore, we show that Eap45 colocalizes with ubiquitinated proteins on late endosomes. These results are consistent with a role for Eap45 in endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2075430896,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, elevated airspace levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and flooding of the alveolar spaces with protein-rich edema fluid. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the most biologically active cytokines in the distal airspaces of patients with ALI. IL-1β has been shown to increase lung epithelial and endothelial permeability. In this study, we hypothesized that IL-1β would decrease vectorial ion and water transport across the distal lung epithelium. Therefore, we measured the effects of IL-1β on transepithelial current, resistance, and sodium transport in primary cultures of alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells. IL-1β significantly reduced the amiloride-sensitive fraction of the transepithelial current and sodium transport across rat ATII cell monolayers. Moreover, IL-1β decreased basal and dexamethasone-induced epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (αENaC) mRNA levels and total and cell-surface protein expression. The inhibitory effect of IL-1β on αENaC expression was mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK in both rat and human ATII cells and was independent of the activation of αvβ6 integrin and transforming growth factor-β. These results indicate that IL-1β may contribute to alveolar edema in ALI by reducing distal lung epithelial sodium absorption. This reduction in ion and water transport across the lung epithelium is in large part due to a decrease in αENaC expression through p38 MAPK-dependent inhibition of αENaC promoter activity and to an alteration in ENaC trafficking to the apical membrane of ATII cells.

The acute phase of ALI is characterized by the influx of protein-rich edema fluid that impairs gas exchange, causing arterial hypoxemia and respiratory failure with an overall mortality rate of 30–40% (1Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1334-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Along with an increase in lung endothelial and epithelial permeability to protein, this syndrome is associated with abnormal surfactant production and decreased vectorial fluid transport across the lung epithelial barrier (2Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 3Matthay M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A number of inflammatory mediators have been found to be elevated in the alveolar space during the early phase of ALI, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-8 (4Pugin J. Verghese G. Widmer M.C. Matthay M.A. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). IL-1β is one of the most biologically active cytokines in pulmonary edema and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of patients with ALI (4Pugin J. Verghese G. Widmer M.C. Matthay M.A. Crit.

Hybertson B.M. Cho H.G. Terada L.S. Cho O. Repine A.J. Repine J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L75-L80PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β also enhances alveolar epithelial repair by increasing cell spreading (8Geiser T. Jarreau P.H. Atabai K. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1184-L1190PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblast activation and proliferation (5Olman M.A. White K.E. Ware L.B. Simmons W.L. Benveniste E.N. Zhu S. Pugin J. Matthay M.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of IL-1β in distal lung epithelial ion transport remains unclear. In other epithelia such as the colonic epithelium, IL-1β inhibits aldosterone-induced electrogenic sodium absorption and attenuates aldosterone-induced up-regulation of β- and γ-subunit mRNA expression (9Barmeyer C. Amasheh S. Tavalali S. Mankertz J. Zeitz M. Fromm M. Schulzke J.-D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the renal collecting duct, IL-1β inhibits sodium absorption and stimulates anion secretion (10Zeidel M.L. Brady H.R. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1013-F1016PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, IL-1β has been shown to reduce amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (11Gray T. Coakley R. Hirsh A. Thornton D. Kirkham S. Koo J.-S. Burch L. Boucher R. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L320-L330Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the effect of IL-1β on vectorial sodium transport across the alveolar lung epithelium is unknown. We report here that IL-1β inhibits alveolar epithelial sodium transport across the distal lung epithelium secondary to a reduction in epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) mRNA and protein expression in alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells. IL-1β affects αENaC transcription by inhibiting its promoter activity via a p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism, resulting in a decrease in the steady-state levels of both total and apical membrane αENaC proteins.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Cationic liposomes (FuGENE 6) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The following two plasmids were a kind gift from André Dagenais (Université de Montreal, Montreal, Canada): plasmid pGL-3 containing the luciferase gene subcloned downstream of the full-length murine αENaC promoter (pGL3-basic/αmENaC) and plasmid pGL-3 containing the luciferase gene subcloned downstream of the murine αENaC promoter with a deletion in the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) (pGL3-basic/αmENaCΔAVR-XhOI). The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit or a BCA kit (Pierce). Cell Culture—Primary cultures of rat and human alveolar epithelial cells were used for the in vitro studies. Rat ATII cells were isolated as described previously (18Dobbs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: L134-L147PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were isolated by elastase digestion, followed by negative selection using four monoclonal antibodies against cell-surface molecules expressed on rat macrophages (CD4, CD32, CD45, and rat macrophage activator) purchased from Pharmingen. These monoclonal antibodies were preincubated with Dynabeads M-450 (magnetic beads with sheep anti-mouse IgG; Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After removing unbound monoclonal antibodies, rat ATII cells were mixed with the bead suspension and rocked gently for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound cells were isolated and plated on polycarbonate Transwell dishes (0.4-μm pore size; Corning). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/H21 medium containing 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 environment. Twenty-four hours later, non-adherent epithelial cells were removed by washing with PBS, and fresh medium was added to the lower compartments of the Transwell dishes, thus maintaining the ATII cell monolayers with an air-liquid interface on their apical side. After 72–96 h, cells that formed confluent monolayers reaching a transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) >1500 ohms/cm2 were used for experimentation. Human ATII cells were isolated using a modification of the method described previously (20Fang X. Song Y. Zemans R. Hirsch J. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L104-L110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, alveolar type II cells were isolated from human lungs that were not used by the Northern California Transplant Donor Network. Our studies indicated that these lungs were in good condition, both physiologically and pathologically (21Ware L.B. Wang Y. Fang X. Warnock M. Sakuma T. Hall T.S. Matthay M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 619-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were isolated after the lungs had been preserved for 4–8 h at 4 °C. A lobe of human lung that had no evidence of injury on the pre-harvest chest radiograph, that could be normally inflated, and that had no area of consolidation or hemorrhage was selected. The pulmonary artery for this segment was perfused with 37 °C PBS solution, and the distal airspaces of a segmental bronchus were lavaged 10 times with 37 °C Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS solution containing 0.5 mm each EGTA and EDTA. Sixty to ninety milliliters of pancreatic porcine elastase (8 units/ml) diluted in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced saline solution were instilled into the airspaces of 50 g of the chosen segment of lung tissue. The lung was incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 37 °C and minced finely in the presence of fetal bovine serum and DNase I (500 μg/ml). The cell-rich fraction was filtered sequentially through one- and two-layer gauze and 150- and 30-μm nylon mesh. The cell suspension was then layered onto a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (1.04–1.09 g/ml) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 20 min to remove red blood cells. The cells that accumulated at the interface of the solution and the Percoll were a mixture of type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. These cells were recovered by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 antibody (Dynabeads M-450 CD14, Dynal Biotech ASA) at 4 °C for 40 min under constant mixing to eliminate macrophages. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The purity of isolated human alveolar type II cells was checked by Papanicolaou staining or by staining with anti-human type II cell antibody (obtained from Leland Dobbs, University of California, San Francisco), and the purity was consistently >90% (data not shown). Human alveolar type II cells were seeded on collagen I-coated Transwell dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2. Five days after the cells were seeded, the monolayer developed a TER >1500 ohms/cm2, as reported for rat ATII cell monolayers. Cell Viability—Cell viability after exposure to different experimental conditions was measured by the Alamar Blue assay (22Tiballi R. He X. Zarins L. Revankar S. Kauffman C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 915-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell media were replaced with medium containing 10% Alamar Blue and placed at 37 °C in a cell incubator for 2–3 h. The media were then collected and read on a plate reader at 530 nm. Measurement of Monolayer Bioelectric Properties—The TER (kilo-ohms/cm2) and potential difference (PD; millivolts, apical side as reference) were measured using the Millicell-ERS Voltohmmeter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Transepithelial current (Isc; microamps/cm2) was calculated from the relationship Isc = PD/Rt (Ohm's law). The effect of IL-1β (10–3 to 10 ng/ml for 1–24 h) or its vehicle on the bioelectric properties of ATII cell monolayers was evaluated on day 4 in culture. IL-1β was also added on the apical or basolateral side or on both sides of the cell monolayer. Sodium Uptake Measurements—The activity of the sodium transport pathway on the apical membrane of rat ATII cells was determined by unidirectional tracer uptake measurements using the technique described by Mairbaurl et al. (23Mairbaurl H. Wodopia R. Eckes S. Schulz S. Bartsch P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L797-L806PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after exposure to IL-1β or its vehicle on both sides of the Transwell, the cells were washed twice with wash medium (150 mm NaCl and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C and equilibrated with flux medium (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C. After equilibration, only the apical medium was replaced with fresh flux medium containing 22Na+ at a final activity of 5 μCi/ml and ouabain (3 mm). After 6 min, cell monolayers were washed three times by overflow with cold wash medium to eliminate 22Na+ not taken up by the cells and to stop further uptake. The last wash solution was measured for 22Na+ and verified not to contain any radioactivity. The cells were then lysed with 0.1% NaOH, and the radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a β-counter. Protein determination was used for normalization of the results. Control experiments showed that the tracer uptake was linear over a range of 10 min. Thus, only one 6-min time point was taken. All fluxes were measured in triplicate. Transepithelial Sodium Transport Measurements—The activity of the amiloride-sensitive sodium transport pathway across rat ATII cell monolayers was determined by unidirectional tracer transport measurements adapted from the technique described by Mairbaurl et al. (23Mairbaurl H. Wodopia R. Eckes S. Schulz S. Bartsch P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L797-L806PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after exposure to IL-1β or its vehicle on both sides of the Transwell, the cells were washed twice with wash medium at 37 °C and equilibrated with flux medium for 10 min at 37 °C. After equilibration, only the apical medium was replaced with fresh flux medium containing 22Na+ at a final activity of 5 μCi/ml. After 10 min, the basolateral medium was obtained, and the radioactivity was measured in a β-counter. The cells were then lysed with 0.1% NaOH, and the protein concentration was determined for normalization of the results. All fluxes were measured in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Pittet J.-F. Griffiths M.J. Geiser T. Kaminski N. Dalton S.L. Huang X. Brown L.A. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V.E. Matthay M.A. Sheppard D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1537-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). After equal amounts of protein were loaded on each lane and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and αENaC was detected using an affinity-purified antibody at 1:1000 dilution and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at 1:10,000 dilution. Anti-p38 MAPK and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. The protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Quantification was done using a ChemiImager digital image analysis system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Membrane Protein Biotinylation—Biotinylation and recovery of apical membrane proteins were performed as described previously (25Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the BCA kit. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added to equal amounts of total protein to recover the biotinylated proteins. The amount of added beads was adjusted to ensure complete recovery of biotinylated proteins from lysates. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 90 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Actin, a cytoskeletal protein, was used as a control for the specificity of surface biotinylation. This protein was detected in cell lysates, but not in the pool of protein recovered after apical surface biotinylation. αENaC Promoter Reporter Cells and Luciferase Assay—Rat ATII cells were transiently transfected with the pGL3-basic/αmENaC or pGL3-basic/αmENaCΔAVR-XhOI plasmid. After rat ATII cells were plated on Transwell dishes (5 × 105 cells/Transwell) and grown in an air-liquid interface for 24 h, they were transfected in triplicate by incubation with cationic liposomes (6 μl of FuGENE 6 and 1 μg of DNA/Transwell). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were exposed to IL-1β or its vehicle for 8 or 24 h. In some experiments, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK or dexamethasone (100 nm) with or without mifepristone (RU486; 5 μm), a known GR antagonist, was added to the cell medium 1 h prior to exposure to IL-1β or its vehicle. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was corrected for total cellular protein and is reported as percent of the control cells (cells that were transfected but not treated with IL-1β). Cells were also cotransfected with a β-galactosidase plasmid, and β-galactosidase activity was determined to verify that the efficiency of transfection was comparable within and between experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Rat alveolar type II cells were plated in 24-mm filter insert culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/well and cultured for 4 days in an air-liquid interface. Cells were subjected to dexamethasone with or without IL-1β and a p38 MAPK inhibitor for 5 h. For nuclear protein isolation, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then harvested by scraping. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 10 min, crude nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed; 3 cell pellet volumes of high salt extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added; and the suspension was incubated on a rotary shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; the supernatant (containing extracted nuclear proteins) was collected; the protein concentration was determined; and the lysate was stored at –70 °C until further use. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a GRE consensus oligonucleotide probe (designed based on GenBank™/EBI accession number AF081783 (26Otulakowski G. Rafii B. Bremner H.R. O'Brodovich H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) that was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (see Table I). After labeling, forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed slowly from 95 °C to room temperature. Nuclear protein (5 μg) was incubated with 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled GRE consensus nucleotide for 20 min in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The specificity of the DNA/protein binding was determined by competition reactions in which a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GRE oligonucleotide was added. After incubation, the samples were analyzed by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography.Table IPrimers and probes used in this studyDesignationSequenceGenBank™ accession no.Human GAPDHBC029618Forward5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGG-3′Reverse5′-AGAGTTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTG-3′Probe5′-TTTGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGG-3′Human αENaCNM_001038Forward5′-CTGGGCAGTGCTGTGGC-3′Reverse5′-CCGAAAAGCAGGCCGAAT-3′Probe5′-CTGCACCTTTGGCATGATGTACTGGC-3′Rat GAPDHAB017801Forward5′-CTGCCAAGTATGATGACATCAAGAA-3′Reverse5′-AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT-3′Probe5′-TCGGCCGCCTGCTTCACCA-3′Rat αENaCNM_031548Forward5′-TGATTGAATTCCACCGCTCC-3′Reverse5′-CCCGTGGATGGTGGTGTT-3′Probe5′-CGGGAGCTCTTCCAGTTCTTCTGCAA-3′Rat βENaCNM_012648Forward5′-CCAAGAAGAAGGCCATGTGG-3′Reverse5′-CTGCCAGCACACCAGGC-3′Probe5′-CCTGCTCACGCTGCTCTTCGCC-3′Rat γENaCNM_017046Forward5′-CTGTGGATCGCGTTCACG-3′Reverse5′-AAGACGAGGAGGGCGCA-3′Probe5′-CTGCAGTGGCCCTCATTATCTGGCA-3′Rat αENaC GREAF081783Forward5′-AAAAAGAACAGAATGTCCTAGGAC-3′Reverse5′-GTCCTAGGACATTCTGTTCTTTTT-3′Rat Na+-K+-ATPase α1-subunitNM_012504Forward5′-GGCTGTCATCTTCCTCATTGG-3′Reverse5′-CGGTGGCCAGCAAACC-3′Probe5′-ATCATCGTAGCCAACGTGCCGGA-3′Rat Na+-K+-ATPase β1-subunitNM_013113Forward5′-GCCCAGAAGGACGACATGAT-3′Reverse5′-CCCGCTCCTTGGGTTCA-3′Probe5′-TTCGAGGATTGTGGCAGTATGCCCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Primers and Probes—Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR primers and probes (Table I) were designed using Primer Express software (PE-Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom). The TaqMan probes were labeled with a fluorophore reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) at the 5′-end and a Black Hole Quencher dye (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.) at the 3′-end. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from rat or human ATII cells cultured for 4 days in an air-liquid interface using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). RT-PCRs were performed, and the results were analyzed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PE-Applied Biosystems). Briefly, RT-PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PE-Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 10 pmol of primers, 5 pmol of TaqMan probe, and an equivalent of 100 ng of total RNA for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The number of cycles to threshold of fluorescence detection was normalized to the number of cycles to threshold of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for each sample tested. Results are expressed as a percentage of cDNA abundance compared with the control. The percentages were used for all statistical comparisons. Statistics—All data are summarized as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance and Fisher's exact t test were used to compare experimental and control groups. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IL-1β Decreases Sodium Transport across Rat Lung Epithelial Cell Monolayers—We first determined whether IL-1β affects the PD, TER, or apical Na+ uptake across primary cultures of rat ATII cell monolayers. Exposure to IL-1β (0.01–10 ng/ml) significantly decreased the PD, an effect that was completely blocked by IL-1RA. IL-1β had no effect on the measured TER, resulting in a significant reduction in the calculated transepithelial current (TEC) (Fig. 1, A–C). The IL-1β-dependent reduction of the PD and TEC across ATII cell monolayers was observed as soon as 6 h after exposure to the cytokine (Fig. 1, D–F). IL-1β affected both the basal and dexamethasone-dependent TECs across ATII cell monolayers independently of whether IL-1β was tested on the apical or basal surface (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, IL-1β affected mostly the amiloride-sensitive fraction of TEC (Fig. 2C). Measurements of the PD and TER in ATII monolayers before and after addition of amiloride showed a decrease in the PD with no change in the TER (data not shown), indicating that the resistance of ATII monolayers is determined mostly by the tight junctions. We then hypothesized that the IL-1β-mediated decrease in the calculated TEC is explained by a decrease in transepithelial ion transport. Therefore, we measured the effect of IL-1β on both 22Na+ uptake across the apical membrane of rat ATII cells and 22Na+ transepithelial transport across the cell monolayers. Exposure to IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 6 h induced a significant decrease in the apical sodium uptake and the transepithelial 22Na+ transport across ATII monolayers, which were not further affected by addition of amiloride at a saturating concentration (10–4m) (Fig. 2, D and E). Taken together, the data indicate that IL-1β significantly decreased the amiloride-sensitive fraction of the transepithelial sodium transport across rat ATII monolayers.Fig. 2IL-1β decreases basal and dexamethasone-induced sodium transport across rat lung epithelial cell monolayers.

https://openalex.org/W2012284076,"Carbonic anhydrases catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate. This activity is universally required for fatty acid biosynthesis as well as for the production of a number of small molecules, pH homeostasis, and other functions. At least three different carbonic anhydrase families are known to exist, of which the α-class found in humans has been studied in most detail. In the present work, we describe the structures of two of the three β-class carbonic anhydrases that have been identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, i.e. Rv1284 and Rv3588c. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement and then refined to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.75 Å, respectively. The active site of Rv1284 is small and almost completely shielded from solvent, whereas that of Rv3588c is larger and quite open to solution. Differences in coordination of the active site metal are also observed. In Rv3588c, an aspartic acid side chain displaces a water molecule and coordinates directly to the zinc ion, thereby closing the zinc coordination sphere and breaking the salt link to a nearby arginine that is a feature of Rv1284. The two carbonic anhydrases thus exhibit both of the metal coordination geometries that have previously been observed for structures in this family. Activity studies demonstrate that Rv3588c is a completely functional carbonic anhydrase. The apparent lack of activity of Rv1284 in the present assay system is likely exacerbated by the observed depletion of zinc in the preparation.

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.8 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with 8 million new cases and 2 million deaths per year. The so-called “short-term” antibiotic treatment currently available lasts 6 months and does not seem to offer much hope for eradicating the disease in the long run. In the milestone publication of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence, Cole et al. (1Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.-A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar) were able to assign functions to some 60% of the gene products. Subsequent studies have attempted to identify genes that are likely to be required for bacterial survival and infection (e.g. studies by Sassetti and Rubin (2Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) and Sassetti et al. (3Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar)). We have used such investigations as the basis for identifying M. tuberculosis gene products that are interesting subjects for detailed structural and functional studies. The gene Rv1284 is annotated at the Pasteur Institute TubercuList server (genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList) as coding for a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function, that is, it is found in related species and presumably has an essential role in their survival, although it is not clear what function is involved. Furthermore, Rv1284 was judged to be essential by Himar1-based transposon mutagenesis in strain H37Rv (3Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), and its transcription was highly up-regulated under the starvation conditions used to model persistent bacteria (4Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic studies of putative carbonic anhydrases (CAs) 1The abbreviations used are: CA, carbonic anhydrase; TAPS, 3-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid; SSPE, saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. (EC 4.2.1.1) suggested that Rv1284 in fact encodes a β-CA and uncovered distant relationships to two other M. tuberculosis proteins, those produced by the Rv3588c gene and the C-terminal region of Rv3273 (5Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.S. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Rv3588c has been identified as being required for mycobacterial growth in vivo by Sassetti and Rubin (2Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), whereas Rv3273 is not essential (2Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 3Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Human carbonic anhydrases belong to the α-class, which has a completely different structure; both α- and β-classes, however, are comprised of zinc-based enzymes (see Ref. 6Lindskog S. Liljas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 915-920Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar for a review of carbonic anhydrase structures). This difference as well as the success of drug design for the α-CAs (reviewed in Ref. 7Supuran C.T. Scozzafava A. Casini A. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 146-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) prompted us to carry out a detailed analysis of the mycobacterial enzymes. In the present publication we report structural and functional studies of the Rv1284 and Rv3588c gene products. The results demonstrate that Rv3588c is indeed a β-CA and that Rv1284 is a β-CA-like protein. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The sequences corresponding to the open reading frames of Rv1284 and Rv3588c were amplified by PCR from M. tuberculosis DNA strain H37Rv (1Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar) with Pfu polymerase using the primer pair 5′-GTGACGGTTACCGACGACTACCTG-3′ (Rv1284.forward) and 5′-TATGGTTATTGCCATCTATGCAAC-3′ (Rv1284.reverse) for Rv1284 and 5′-GTGAGGCATGCCCAACACCAATCCGGTA-3′ (Rv3588c.forward) and 5′-TCCCGGGTACCTATTAGACCTCCTCGCCGATGTT-3′ (Rv3588c.reverse) for Rv3588c. A second PCR to introduce an N-terminal His6 tag into each construct was performed with the same reverse primer and a new forward primer, Rv1284.his (5′-ATGGCCCATCATCATCATCATCATTCTGGTACGGTTACCG-ACGACTACCTG-3′) and Rv3588c.his (5′-ATGGCTCATCATCATCATCATCATGGTCCCAACACCAATCCGGTAGCCGCG-3′), respectively, using the products from the first PCRs as templates. The PCR products were incubated with deoxynucleotide triphosphates and Taq polymerase to create an A-overhang, purified, and ligated into vector pCR®T7 using the TOPO® Cloning pCR® kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Top10 cells (Invitrogen) by heat shock and grown on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Positive clones were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21/AI in which protein was overexpressed after induction with 0.02% arabinose at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed with 1× SSPE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at –70 °C. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. For purification, thawed cells were re-suspended in native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH8, 300mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol) with 0.01 mg/ml RNase, 0.02 mg/ml DNase, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed using a One Shot cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Ltd). Cell-free extracts were incubated with preequilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) slurry for 45 min at 4 °C; resin was then washed, and protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein fractions were applied to size-exclusion chromatography columns (Hiload™ 16/60 Superdex™ 75; Amersham Biosciences) using a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol. For Rv1284, the buffer also included 5mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purified protein solutions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE (PhastSystem™; Amersham Biosciences). Protein samples were concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. Final storage buffer was 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for Rv1284 and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol for Rv3588c. Assays and Metal Analysis—Esterase activity was measured as p-nitrophenylacetate hydrolysis at 25 °C, using a modification of previously published methods (8Armstrong J.M. Myers D.V. Verpoorte J.A. Edsall J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5137-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3 mm stock of p-nitrophenylacetate was freshly prepared by dissolving the compound in acetone and then diluting it 25-fold with water. The uncatalyzed reaction was measured by adding 1.9 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to 1 ml of this substrate solution and recording the change in A348. After 3 min, 100 μl of enzyme solution was added, and the catalyzed reaction was monitored for an additional 3 min. A non-enzymatic control (using bovine serum albumin) was included in each set of measurements; bovine carbonic anhydrase II (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Carbonic anhydrase activity was assayed by measuring changes in pH during the reaction with a dye indicator method (9Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were again performed at 25 °C. The buffer/indicator pairs used were (a) 25 mm HEPES plus 100 mm phenol red (pH 7.5, A558) and (b)25mm TAPS plus 100 μm m-cresol purple (pH 8.4–9.0, A578); both solutions also contained 100 mm sodium sulfate to maintain a relatively constant ionic strength of the reaction medium. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 ml of CO2-saturated water to 0.5 ml of a 2× buffer/indicator solution containing enzyme (final protein concentration, 2.5 μm). Nonenzymatic and positive controls were included as described for the esterase assay. Data were acquired at the appropriate wavelength at 0.1-s intervals using a Beckmann DU-600 spectrophotometer with time t = 0 coinciding with manual addition of substrate. Metal content analysis (Analytica AB) (www.analytica.se/) was performed by inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectroscopy for all elements except Hg, which was analyzed by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Rv1284 crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method (10McPherson A.J. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. John Wiley and Sons, New York1982Google Scholar) at 20 °C. The crystallization drop setup consisted of 2 μl of protein sample (14.5 mg/ml) mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium thiocyanate, pH 7.5, and 8% polyethylene glycol 2000. Needle-like crystals appeared after 1 day. Prior to data collection, the crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant solution comprising reservoir solution with 30% glycerol and then immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 100 K at beamline ID14-1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (11Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. 1999; D55: 1696-1702Google Scholar) and reduced and scaled in SCALA (12Evans P.R. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend on Data Collection & Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England, United Kingdom1993: 114-122Google Scholar) using the CCP4 program suite (13Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). Rv3588c was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Final conditions for crystallization were as follows: 1 μl of protein solution (34 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 200 mm MgCl2, 35% polyethylene glycol 400, and 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.0. Crystals grew to 0.1–0.2 mm in diameter in 5–8 days and could be flash-frozen directly from the mother liquor. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline I711 at the MAXII synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. The data were processed and scaled using Denzo and Scalepack (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics for both crystal forms are shown in Table I. Structure Determination and Refinement—The Rv1284 structure was solved by molecular replacement in AMoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using a dimer of the carbonic anhydrase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Protein Data Bank code 1G5C) (16Strop P. Smith K.S. Iverson T.M. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10299-10305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as a template for the search model. All residues with sequence identity were kept unchanged, whereas other non-alanine and non-glycine residues were mutated to serine using SEAMAN (17Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar). The first 25 residues of both molecules in the dimer were removed from the model. Because a strong translation peak appeared in the native Patterson map, the same top rotation solution was used to locate a second dimer. Rigid body refinement was then performed in REFMAC5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) with each molecule defined as a rigid unit. NCS phased refinement in NCSref (within the CCP4 interface) (19Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. 2003; D59: 1131-1137Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) was used to generate an averaged map. Additional features not present in the search model and consistent with the M. tuberculosis sequence appeared in the averaged electron density. By alternating NCS phased refinement, model rebuilding in O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and data extension to 2.0 Å, the complete M. tuberculosis sequence could eventually be placed in density. NCS restraints were then released, and the refinement proceeded with alternating cycles of REFMAC5 and manual rebuilding of the four separate subunits. Each dimer was used to define a separate TLS group (21Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N.

The search model was constructed from the two structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank having the highest sequence identity: Protein Data Bank code 1I6O (23Cronk J.D. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk M.R.

The final search model consisted of four polyalanine chain segments containing 136 residues in total. Both enantiomorphic space groups, P41212 and P43212, were evaluated; the best solution was found in P41212. Packing analysis showed that the top solution produced a correct dimer with a symmetry-related molecule and plausible crystal packing. Rigid body refinement to 3-Å resolution was followed by alternating cycles of REFMAC5 refinement and manual rebuilding. During refinement, density inconsistent with protein or solvent became apparent in the vicinity of His199. This was modeled as a magnesium ion octahedrally coordinated by the histidine ring, the carbonyl oxygen of the His199 backbone, and four water molecules. Mg was chosen because of its high concentration (200 mm) in the mother liquor; the coordination geometry and atomic temperature factors are consistent with this assignment. Because this ion is distant from the active site and dimer interfaces, we presume it lacks functional significance. The final refinement statistics for both structures are given in Table I. Atomic coordinates and structure factor data have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (25Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar) with accession codes 1YLK and 1YM3. Overall Structures of Rv1284 and Rv3588c—His-tagged full-length Rv1284 and Rv3588c were expressed, purified, and crystallized, and their structures were determined by molecular replacement. Both structures have been refined to 2-Å resolution or better, with the statistics reported in Table I. The Rv1284 crystal contains two dimers in the asymmetric unit, each of which is part of a tetramer formed via a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Rv3588c, on the other hand, contains just a single subunit that forms a dimer by the interaction around a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The Rv1284 structure shows continuous electron density for the entire sequence, i.e. from residue 1 to residue 163. Rv3588c, however, has no density for residues 1–3, 32–41, and 207. Both structures have the β-CA α/β fold anticipated from sequence analysis. Each subunit consists of a five stranded β-sheet, in which strands 1–4 are parallel and ordered 2-1-3-4. The fifth strand is anti-parallel and connected to the fourth by a short reverse turn. The connecting loops are of different length and structure in the two proteins. The β1-β2 loop is short and irregular in both cases. The β2-β3 connection includes a regular α-helix (α2) packing on the surface of the sheet. The β3-β4 loop is much longer, containing two helices in Rv1284 and four helices in Rv3588c. One of these helices (α4in Rv1284) packs on the sheet near β4 in both proteins. The remaining portion of the loop stretches across the surface of the dimer to interact with the 2-fold related helix linking β2 and β3. In Rv1284, the first α-helix clearly packs on the sheet of the other subunit, as was observed in three of the four known β-CA structures (16Strop P. Smith K.S. Iverson T.M. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. J.

Because of the density break in Rv3588c we cannot rule out the possibility that its first helix packs in the same manner, but the positioning of the abutting residues suggests that it is not domain-swapped (Fig. 1B). The subunits of Rv1284 and Rv3588c can be superimposed such that 106 Cα pairs have an r.m.s.d. of 1.45 Å (27Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), consistent with their structure-based sequence identity of ∼15%. The largest structural variation is observed in the β3-β4 loop, as described above. Active Sites—The active site of a β-CA lies near a switch point at the C-terminal edge of its parallel β-sheet, as has been observed for other α/β proteins (28Branden C.I. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, New York1999Google Scholar). Although neither of the present crystallization reagents included metal ions, both structures show strong electron density at the position where one would normally expect a zinc ion in an active β-CA enzyme. In each case we have modeled this density as a zinc atom, although the peak height in Rv3588c is twice that in Rv1284 (6.3 and 3.3 electrons/Å3, respectively, with both structures having density r.m.s.d. values of 0.32 electrons/Å3). Coordination of the active site ion is, however, different in the two proteins. In Rv1284, all of the metal ligands are contributed by one subunit of the dimer, although much of the active site cavity is shaped by the other subunit, in particular β2′ (i.e. β2 in the other chain in the dimer), the helix between β2 and β3, and residues in the long loop connecting the N-terminal helix to β1′. Residues Cys35, His88, Cys91, and a water molecule coordinate the metal ion, whereas the neighboring Asp37 and Arg39 form a well-defined salt bridge (Fig. 2A). The interactions of the ligands in Rv1284 are thus essentially identical to those described by Kimber and Pai for the enzyme from Pisum sativum (26Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sγ atoms of the cysteines hydrogen bond with main chain amides, whereas the Nδ1 of His88 interacts with a main chain carbonyl oxygen. The water ligand forms a tight hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Asp37. A thiocyanate molecule is also positioned in the active site pocket of Rv1284, although it is not coordinated to the metal ion. The Rv1284 active site pocket is small (accessible surface volume, ∼7 Å3) and almost completely shielded from solvent; its shape is a perfect match for that of the observed thiocyanate. It contains only one other ionizable side chain, His54′ from the second subunit. In Rv3588c, the active site residue Asp53 displaces the water molecule and coordinates directly to the zinc ion, thus breaking a potential salt link to Arg55 (Fig. 2, B and C). The two M. tuberculosis β-CAs, therefore, exhibit both of the coordination variants reported for β-CAs elsewhere (16Strop P. Smith K.S. Iverson T.M. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10299-10305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Cronk J.D. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk M.R. O'Neill J.W. Zhang K.Y.

There is an additional hydrogen-bonding group in the active site cavity of Rv3588c, Tyr89, which is positioned 6.7 Å from the Asp53 ligand; this residue is structurally conserved in three of the four other structures. The Rv3588c active site is much more open than that of Rv1284 and directly accessible to the solvent. This difference may be primarily due to the lack of an ordered loop between the N-terminal helix and β1. In Rv3588c the greatest deviations from tetrahedral geometry at the zinc atom involve the aspartyl ligand, with one angle differing from the ideal by 18°. The geometry of the protein ligands in Rv1284 appears more strained: the angle subtended at the metal by the Sγ atoms again deviates by ∼18° from the ideal, and the ion is also ∼0.7 Å out of the plane of the imidazole ring. Comparisons to Other β-CAs—Four β-CA structures have previously been reported in the literature. They can be aligned to the Rv1284 dimer with 220–240 matching Cα pairs having r.m.s.d. values of 1.4–1.6 Å using our standard alignment criteria (27Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (see Table II). The sequence identity of the aligned residues is very low (∼15%), except in the case of the M. thermoautotrophicum enzyme, to which it has 29% identity. By contrast, similar alignments to Rv3588c indicate that it is much more similar to the other three CA structures (Table III).Table IIComparison of Rv1284 with other β-CA structuresCA sourceNraNr, number of residues in the dimer; Nc, numbers of atoms within a 3.5-Å cutoff; Ir, sequence identity in conserved region/number of residues in Rv1284; r.m.s. distance., root mean square distance to Rv1284; Z, Dali Z-score; PDB, Protein Data Bank.NcIr (%)r.m.s. distanceZPDB codeZn-coordinating amino acidsEquiv. to Cys35Equiv. to His88Equiv. to Cys91Equiv. to Asp37M. thermoautotrophicum31623929.11.38218.31G5CCys32His87Cys90Asp34P. sativum42323516.01.55914.01EKJCys160His220Cys223Asp162E. coli42823314.71.37513.91I6PCys42His98Cys101Asp44M. tuberculosis, Rv3588c38623813.51.81212.51YM3Cys51His104Cys107Asp53P. purpureum48122214.71.58411.81DDZCys403His459Cys462Asp405a Nr, number of residues in the dimer; Nc, numbers of atoms within a 3.5-Å cutoff; Ir, sequence identity in conserved region/number of residues in Rv1284; r.m.s. distance., root mean square distance to Rv1284; Z, Dali Z-score; PDB, Protein Data Bank.

https://openalex.org/W2029947230,"The retinoid cycle is a recycling system that replenishes the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments. Photoreceptor-specific retinol dehydrogenase (prRDH) catalyzes reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol and is thought to be a key enzyme in the retinoid cycle. We disrupted mouse prRDH (human gene symbol RDH8) gene expression by targeted recombination and generated a homozygous prRDH knock-out (prRDH–/–) mouse. Histological analysis and electron microscopy of retinas from 6- to 8-week-old prRDH–/– mice revealed no structural differences of the photoreceptors or inner retina. For brief light exposure, absence of prRDH did not affect the rate of 11-cis-retinal regeneration or the decay of Meta II, the activated form of rhodopsin. Absence of prRDH, however, caused significant accumulation of all-trans-retinal following exposure to bright lights and delayed recovery of rod function as measured by electroretinograms and single cell recordings. Retention of all-trans-retinal resulted in slight overproduction of A2E, a condensation product of all-trans-retinal and phosphatidylethanolamine. We conclude that prRDH is an enzyme that catalyzes reduction of all-trans-retinal in the rod outer segment, most noticeably at higher light intensities and prolonged illumination, but is not an essential enzyme of the retinoid cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2037757497,"σ32 is the first alternative σ factor discovered in Escherichia coli and can direct transcription of many genes in response to heat shock stress. To define the physiological role of σ32, we have used transcription profiling experiments to identify, on a genome-wide basis, genes under the control of σ32 in E. coli by moderate induction of a plasmid-borne rpoH gene under defined, steady-state growth conditions. Together with a bioinformatics approach, we successfully confirmed genes known previously to be directly under the control of σ32 and also assigned many additional genes to the σ32 regulon. In addition, to understand better the functional relevance of the increased amount of σ32 to changes in the transcriptional level of σ32-dependent genes, we measured the protein level of σ32 both before and after induction by a newly developed quantitative Western blot method. At a normal constant growth temperature (37 °C), we found that the σ32 protein level rapidly increased, plateaued, and then gradually decreased after induction, indicating σ32 can be regulated by genes in its regulon and that the mechanisms of σ32 synthesis, inactivation, and degradation are not strictly temperature-dependent. The decrease in the transcriptional level of σ32-dependent genes occurs earlier than the decrease in full-length σ32 in the wild type strain, and the decrease in the transcriptional level of σ32-dependent genes is greatly diminished in a ΔDnaK strain, suggesting that DnaK can act as an anti-σ factor to functionally inactivate σ32 and thus reduce σ32-dependent transcription in vivo. σ32 is the first alternative σ factor discovered in Escherichia coli and can direct transcription of many genes in response to heat shock stress.

Escherichia coli core DNA-dependent RNA polymerase consists of four different subunits and has the composition α2ββ′ω. Core RNA polymerase (E) together with a σ factor constitutes a holoenzyme complex (Eσ) (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Fed. Proc. 1970; 29: 1164-1169PubMed Google Scholar). The holoenzyme complex is able to initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences termed promoters. Since the discovery of σ70 36 years ago, numerous σ factors have been described in E. coli and other prokaryotic organisms (3Wosten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 5Haldenwang W.G.

The seven known E. coli σ factors are σ70, σ54, σ32, σS, σF, σE, and σfecI. The major σ factor, σ70, is involved in the transcription of the majority of genes in the cell. The other σ factors are alternative σ factors that enable RNA polymerase to transcribe genes required for cellular adaptation to changes in the external environment. Each σ factor recognizes and directs RNA polymerase to a different set of promoters. Among the six known alternative σ factors, σ32, which is encoded by rpoH (htpR, hin, and fam), was the first minor σ factor to be discovered in E. coli. For heat shock and some other general stress responses (such as sublethal concentrations of ethanol, viral infection, etc.), transcription initiation is regulated largely by σ32. The first step of the transcription initiation pathway is the binding of σ32 to core RNA polymerase to form an Eσ32 holoenzyme complex. This binding results in the expression of many heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPs, heat shock proteins; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; ORF, open reading frame; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RNAP, RNA polymerase. that play important roles in protein folding, repair, and degradation under normal and stress conditions. Because σ32 plays an important role in heat shock stress, early work on σ32-dependent genes was focused on the induction of a group of genes upon heat shock stress. Most known σ32-dependent genes were identified either by monitoring synthesis rates of individual proteins before and after heat shock on two-dimensional gels (8Lemaux P.G. Herendeen S.L. Bloch P.L. Neidhardt F.C. Cell. 1978; 13: 427-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or by hybridizing cDNA (generated mRNA from heat-shocked cells) with membrane filters containing an ordered E. coli genomic library (9Chuang S.E. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2026-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in response to temperature upshift, the induction of σS was shown in a Western blot experiment, and the induction of σS-dependent genes was confirmed by using a σS-dependent promoter-lacZ fusion approach (10Muffler A. Barth M. Marschall C. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 445-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Taylor and co-workers (11Kuczynska-Wisnik D. Laskowska E. Taylor A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found σ54-controlled genes are another group of genes that can be induced by heat shock in addition to σ32 and σE regulons (12Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the heat shock response is mainly mediated by σ32, there are some other global gene regulators that increase and turn on genes during the heat shock response. This makes the heat shock stimulon a complicated group of different regulons. Here we report the results of using transcription profiling experiments to identify the σ32 regulon in E. coli. Our basic strategy is to minimally perturb steady-state growth (E. coli MG1655 growing exponentially in minimum medium at 37 °C) by moderate induction of σ32. We then monitor global RNA transcript abundance changes as a function of time using Affymetrix GeneChipR E. coli antisense genome arrays. This approach allows us to reduce the possibility of induction of genes under the control of other σ factors that was found in the previous heat shock response studies. Meanwhile, to characterize how the transcriptional level of σ32-dependent genes is regulated by the amount of σ32 in vivo, we measure the protein level of σ32 both before and at various time points after induction by a quantitative Western blot analysis. On the basis of this first systematic study of the σ32 regulon in E. coli including σ32 protein level determination, we gain insight into the complex network regulated by σ32 and how it contributes physiological adaptation to changes in the external environment. Reagents and Media—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. 10× MOPS minimal media was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. (13Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The media were filter-sterilized through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at 4 °C. The defined media for cell log-phase growth contained 1× MOPS minimal media, 0.1% glucose, 0.66 mm K2HPO4. Bacteria Strains and Plasmids—To controllably and quantitatively overexpress σ32 in E. coli, we constructed an overexpression vector derived from the pZ vectors developed by Lutz and Bujard (14Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The pZ-vector system features a tightly regulated low copy number plasmid with a widely controllable regulatory range. A DNA fragment containing the entire σ32 protein-coding region was cloned into the KpnI and AvaII sites of pZA31-luc plasmid, putting the entire rpoH ORF under the control of the PLtet promoter to produce the σ32 overexpression vector pTet32. A Tet repressor (TetR) expression plasmid, pIL4, carrying the entire TetR gene served as the PCR template. A 690-bp-long Tet repressor gene was PCR-amplified by using primers TetRUp (5′-AACTGCAGAACCAATGCATTGGTGGTAAAATAACTCTATCAA-3′; PstI site underlined) and TetRDown (5′-TCCCCCGGGGGATTTTAAGACCCACTTTCACATT-3′; SmaI site underlined). A kanamycin resistance (Km) coding sequence was amplified from plasmid pACYC177 by PCR using primer pairs of KmUp (5′-GGAATTCCCGTTCGTAAGCCATTTCC-3′; EcoRI site underlined) and KmDown (5′-GGGGTACCCCGTCCCGTCAAGTCAGCGTAA-3′; KpnI site underlined). Both resulting PCR products were cloned into pMOD-2 transposon construction vector (Epicenter). Because the E. coli Genechip probe set is based on the sequenced E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (λ– F– ilvG– rfb–50 rph-1, prototroph) (15Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar), we chose this bacterial strain to use in our study. For tight control of the PLtet promoter, we constructed a derivative E. coli strain MG1655K1, integrating Tet repressor gene and a selectable marker kanamycin resistance gene into the MG1655 chromosome. Tn5 transposon and transposase were used following the procedure of Goryshin and Reznikoff (16Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Growth Conditions and Preparation of Cell Lysates—All cultures were grown in a New Brunswick gyratory water bath shaker (model G76) with vigorous aeration (225 rpm) unless otherwise indicated. For cultures of cells carrying antibiotic resistance markers, the media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) where appropriate. For induction of σ32 under the control of the anhydrotetracycline-regulated promoter, anhydrotetracycline was added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. E. coli strain MG1655K1 containing a σ32 overexpression plasmid (pTet32) was grown overnight in MOPS minimal media at 37 °C in an air shaker. 2 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh MOPS minimal medium. When the culture density reached an optical density of 0.2, a 1000-μl portion of culture was harvested into a pre-chilled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and then immediately put on ice for 1 min. This sample served as the control for Western blot analysis. To measure changes in the σ32 intracellular level, cells were then harvested every 5 min after induction, immediately put on ice for 1 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g (12,000 rpm for Beckman MicrofugeR) for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended immediately in 40 μl of lysis buffer (1× SDS) and heated at 75 °C for 5 min to quickly lyse the cells and prevent changes in the intracellular levels of the σ factors being measured. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, Labeling, and Hybridization—For preparing the total RNA for microarray experiments, 15-ml samples of cells were taken at 5, 10, and 15 min after induction, immediately mixed with a double volume of RNAprotect bacterial reagent (Qiagen), and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged at 5,800 × g for 20 min, and cell pellets were stored at –80 °C prior to RNA extraction. Total nucleic acid was isolated using Master-Pure kits (Epicenter) as described by the manufacturer. DNase I (Epicenter) was used to remove genomic DNA contamination. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA were checked by visualizing the 23 S and 16 S rRNA bands on a 2% agarose gel. 10 μg of total RNA was mixed with 500 ng of random hexamers and then was reverse-transcribed for first strand cDNA by using the Superscript II system (Invitrogen). RNA was removed by using RNase H (Invitrogen) and RNase A (Epicenter). cDNA was purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by partial DNase I digestion to fragment cDNA to an average length of 50–100 bp. The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled by using terminal transferase (New England Biolabs) and biotin-N6-ddATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and was added to the hybridization solution to load onto the Affymetrix GeneChipR E. coli antisense genome arrays. Hybridization was carried out at 45 °C for 16 h. The arrays were then washed and subsequently stained with streptavidin, biotin-bound anti-streptavidin antibody, and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) to enhance the signal. Arrays were scanned at 570 nm with a 3-μm resolution using a confocal laser scanner (Hewlett-Packard). For each time point, two independent cultures were prepared, and the RNA was analyzed in microarray experiments. Data Analysis—Image analysis was carried out by Affymetrix® Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Cell intensity files were first generated from the image data files. An absolute expression analysis then computes the detection call, detection p value, and signal (background-subtracted and adjusted for noise) for each gene. Genes were considered up-regulated relative to the 0-min time point (before induction) sample if they had a 2-fold increase in signal intensity, and the signal intensity in the experiment had a log2 value of at least 8.0 with a “present” detection call. The higher log2 intensity values were used to limit the analysis to those genes for which we have a high degree of confidence in their level of expression. Purification and Fluorescence Labeling of Proteins and mAbs—Purified core RNA polymerase was made from E. coli MG1655 according to the method of Thompson et al. (17Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified σ factors and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made as described by Anthony et al. (18Anthony L.C. Foley K.M. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mouse mAbs used in this experiment were anti-α (4RA2), anti-β′ (NT73), anti-σ70(2G10), and anti-σ32 (3RH3). Fluorescence dye, IC5-OSu (Dojindo), was used to label the primary antibodies according to methods described previously (19Bergendahl V. Glaser B.T. Burgess R.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The IC5-labeled mAbs, stored at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, were diluted 1:2000 for use in this experiment. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Assay—Lysate samples were electrophoresed on a 4–12% NuPAGE gel. The purified core RNA polymerase as well as the purified σ factor protein was also loaded on the same gel to serve as controls. The gel was run at a constant voltage of 125 V until the bromphenol blue loading dye had almost run off the bottom of the gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane at 50 V for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Blotto) for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blot was then probed in Blotto for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescence-labeled mAbs specific to the σ factor under study and a subunit of core RNA polymerase. The blot was rinsed three times with 25 ml of PBS buffer and scanned with a Typhoon FluoroImager in the red fluorescence-scanning mode. Signal intensities of the bands were quantified using the ImageQuant program. To measure soluble protein levels in vivo, the cell pellet was harvested and resuspended in buffer A as described by Anthony et al. (18Anthony L.C. Foley K.M. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) before lysozyme was added to facilitate cell breakage. Cells were then sonicated for 90 s to completely break cell walls, and the sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Any insoluble inclusion bodies plus cell debris would be in the pellet. The supernatant containing soluble protein was then measured in Western blot assay. Real Time PCR—Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and were synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Two steps of real time quantitative RT-PCR were performed. 5 μg of the DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed for first strand cDNA by using the Superscript II system (Invitrogen) as mentioned above. Reactions were then performed using 1 ng of cDNA and 100 nm of each primer in a 50-μl volume with 1× SYBR Green I mixture. Controls lacking AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase or template were used. Reactions were run on an ABI 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling parameters: 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Relative gene expression data analysis was carried out with the standard curve method (20Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Changes in expression will be calculated using the time 0 sample as the reference. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The DNA fragments (∼300 bp) used for gel mobility shift assays were amplified by PCR from the upstream sequence of five genes (yceP, ldhA, macB, mutM, and ybbN) that were highly up-regulated in our microarray data. The DNA was labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 45 min. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing the labeling reaction mixture through a G-50 Sephadex microspin column (Amersham Biosciences). Core RNA polymerase and σ32 were purified using the procedures described earlier (18Anthony L.C. Foley K.M. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The labeled DNA fragment (1.15 nm) was incubated with different concentrations of core RNA polymerase and σ32 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 20 μl. The mixtures were left on ice for 30 min before being incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The samples were loaded directly onto a 4–10% native Tris-glycine NOVEX Gel (Invitrogen) and were run at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine (pH 8.3) at 200 V for 1 h. The gel was fixed in a solution of 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol for 15 min and dried at 80 °C on a Slab Dryer (Bio-Rad). BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) was used for autoradiography. The gels were scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the intensities of the bands were determined by using ImageQuant version 5.2 software. The Construction of E. coli Strain MG1655K1—The sequenced E. coli K12 strain MG1655 (λ– F– ilvG– rfb–50 rph-1, prototroph) (15Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar), on which the E. coli Affymetrix Genechip probe design is based, was chosen for our studies. For controllable induction of individual σ factors in vivo, we used the PLtet promoter to construct an overexpression vector (14Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The PLtet promoter is controlled by the repressor TetR. A downstream gene can be induced in the presence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline. The TetR repressor gene as well as the kanamycin resistance gene were cloned into the pMOD-2 transposon construction vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To ensure stable and defined conditions for the synthesis and maintenance of the regulatory protein TetR, the gene encoding this repressor molecular was integrated into the chromosome of this sequenced E. coli strain by using the Tn5 transposon as described by Goryshin and Reznikoff (16Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Analysis of several kanamycin-resistant colonies by PCR and Southern blots showed that the transcription unit encoding TetR as well as the kanamycin resistance marker were stably integrated into the MG1655 genome (data not shown). Quantitation of σ32 after Induction—A newly developed quantitative Western blot method (19Bergendahl V. Glaser B.T. Burgess R.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the intracellular level of σ32 in vivo before and after induction. The α-or β′-subunits of core RNA polymerase were also examined to serve as internal controls because their intracellular levels remain constant under various conditions (21Jishage M. Iwata A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The signal intensities of the proteins were immunodetected by the corresponding IC5-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Our results (Fig. 1A) show that although the signal intensities of α-or β′-subunits were quite constant at all the time points before and after induction, σ32 levels varied at different time points. Generally, the σ32 protein level, which is normalized to the β′-subunit of RNA polymerase, rapidly increased 5 min after induction with an almost 7.4-fold change and then stayed at a high level for 10 min (∼8.2-fold) before it gradually decreased (Fig. 1B). To eliminate the possibility that this decrease of σ32 20 min after induction was due to our overexpression system, we performed the same experiment for σ70 overexpression by cloning the entire σ70 protein-coding region under the control of the same inducible PLtet promoter. The same experiment was performed to test the intracellular level of σ70 after induction. We extended our induction time to 60 min and found the σ70 protein level kept increasing as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Apparently, there was no decrease in σ70 protein level. From this comparison, we can conclude that this decrease in σ32 protein after induction was not due to the overexpression system that we used in the experiment, and there might be a feedback regulatory system in vivo that caused this decrease (see below). The more significant increase (fold change) of σ32 at the 5-min time point, compared with σ70 induction level, was due to the fact that the experiment was performed at log-phase (A600 = 0.2) in minimum medium, in which σ70 is the dominant σ factor and has a much higher protein level than σ32 before induction. Thus, although the two σ factors are under the same PLtet promoter control, the fold change of σ32 was much higher because of its lower initial protein level. Known σ32-dependent Genes Are Induced after σ32 Overexpression—To characterize the effect of the increasing σ32 protein level in vivo on gene expression, global RNA transcript abundance was monitored at 5, 10, and 15 min after σ32 induction with cells grown in log-phase (A600 = 0.2) in MOPS minimal medium at 37 °C. Transcriptional profiles were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sample at time 0 was used as the reference to identify genes whose transcript abundance had significantly changed after σ32 overexpression. DNA microarray results showed most of the well characterized genes belonging to the σ32 regulon were induced following σ32 overexpression. Several known σ32-dependent genes (such as rpoD, a σ32-dependent gene, whose transcriptional level increased 1.9-fold after 5 min of induction) were not included in our data set because of our cut-off level (2-fold increase). In Table I, we show some known σ32-dependent genes that were up-regulated at least 2-fold in 5 min, and we also list the transcriptional levels of these genes at 10 and 15 min. Most of those genes were initially identified in heat shock stress and can be divided into three functional groups as shown in Table I as follows: 1) adaptation (heat shock-related, atypical); 2) proteases (degradation of proteins/peptides); 3) chaperones.Table ITranscriptional levels of most known σ32-dependent genes are upregulatedb no.ab no. indicates Blattner number.GeneProductFunction5 min10 min15 minb3686ibpBbIt is possible that one gene has several different gene names.Small heat shock proteinAdaptations, atypical conditions20.5cNumbers indicate -fold change relative to pre- σ32 induction.10.16.2b3687ibpASmall heat shock proteinAdaptations, atypical conditions12.99.55.1b1379hslJHeat shock protein hslJAdaptations, atypical conditions9.77.33.9b1829htpXHeat shock protein, integral membrane proteinAdaptations, atypical conditions5.22.61.4b3989htrCHeat shock protein htrCAdaptations, atypical conditions2.12.62.7b2592clpBATP-dependent protease, part of multichaperone system with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpEDegradation of proteins, peptides16.611.36.6b3931hslUATPase component of the HslUV protease, also functions as molecular chaperoneDegradation of proteins, peptides10.27.14.6b3932hslVPeptidase component of the HslUV proteaseDegradation of proteins, peptides6.93.93.1b4175hflCWith HflK, part of modulator for protease specific for FtsH phage λcII repressorDegradation of proteins, peptides5.44.03.1b3178hflBATP-dependent zinc-metalloproteaseDegradation of proteins, peptides4.43.22.1b0438clpXATPase, chaperone subunit of serine proteaseDegradation of proteins, peptides2.82.81.1b1779gapAGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase AEnergy metabolism (carbon)2.12.01.8b3179ftsJ23 S rRNA methyltransferaseCell division4.52.92.9b0473htpGChaperone Hsp90, heat shock protein C 62.5Chaperones31.818.920.4b4143mopAChaperone Hsp60 with peptide-dependent ATPase activity, affects cell divisionChaperones7.66.44.1b4142mopBChaperone Hsp10, affects cell divisionChaperones4.84.93.5b0014dnaKChaperone Hsp70 in DNA biosynthesis/cell divisionChaperones4.84.33.1b0015dnaJHeat shock protein (Hsp40), co-chaperone with DnaKChaperones2.32.31.5b0439lonDNA-binding ATP-dependent protease La; heat shock K-proteinGlobal regulatory functions3.62.21.6b2614grpEHsp 24 nucleotide exchange factorPhage-related functions10.58.35.7b3401yrfIHeat shock protein 33, redox-regulated chaperoneUnknown5.73.92.5b3913b3913Periplasmic repressor of cpx regulon by interaction with CpxAUnknown2.21.31.7a b no. indicates Blattner number.b It is possible that one gene has several different gene names.c Numbers indicate -fold change relative to pre- σ32 induction. Open table in a new tab Because our Western blot assay showed that σ32 protein is degraded in vivo after induction, we paid specific attention to the genes belonging to proteases and chaperones groups. We observed that Lon, the first ATP-dependent protease isolated from E. coli (23Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Markovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1981; 78: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) that plays an important role in general protein degradation, increased 3.6-fold after 5 min of induction. Meanwhile, the transcriptional levels of the Clp family genes, which encode the two-component Clp protease (the catalytic subunits ClpP and ClpQ[HslV] and the regulatory subunits ClpX, ClpY[HslU], and possibly ClpB), are significantly induced after induction. These cytoplasmic proteases can degrade a variety of proteins as well as some specific substrates in vivo (25Gottesman S. Annu. Rev.

Although p53 was also shown to mediate apoptosis in a manner independent of its transactivation activity, the mechanism and conditions that trigger such cell death have remained largely unknown. We have now shown that inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription by α-amanitin or RNA interference induced p53-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of pol II-mediated transcription resulted in down-regulation of p21Cip1, which was caused by both transcriptional suppression and protein degradation, despite eliciting p53 accumulation, allowing the cells to progress into S phase and then to undergo apoptosis. This cell death did not require the transcription of p53 target genes and was preceded by translocation of the accumulated p53 to mitochondria. Our data thus suggested that blockade of pol II-mediated transcription induced p53 accumulation in mitochondria and was the critical factor for eliciting p53-dependent but transcription-independent apoptosis.

Apoptosis is a genetically controlled mechanism of cell death that is essential for the elimination of unwanted cells during normal development and for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The tumor suppressor protein p53 induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia (1Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 221-227PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 function therefore results in failure to remove damaged cells and contributes both to tumor development and to the resistance of cancer cells to therapies based on the induction of DNA damage.It is well established that p53 is a transcriptional regulator and that p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage is predominantly attributable both to the transcriptional activation of genes that encode apoptotic effectors, such as the BH3-only proteins Noxa and PUMA, Bax, p53AIP1, and PERP (4Oda E.

A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and survivin (11Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In addition to such transcriptional regulation, however, recent evidence has suggested the existence of a transcription-independent pathway of p53-mediated apoptosis (12Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 13Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). A fraction of the p53 molecules that accumulate in damaged cells translocates to mitochondria, and this translocation is sufficient for p53 to induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane through formation of complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (14Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 15Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P.

The mechanism by which the relative activities of the transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways of p53-mediated apoptosis are regulated, however, has remained unclear.Lesions in the transcribed strand of DNA induced by high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or by high doses of UV radiation trigger the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of the large subunit (LS) 1The abbreviations used are: LS, large subunit; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DSB, DNA double-strand break; PCNA, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen; PI, propidium iodide; pol II, RNA polymerase II; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNAs; RNAi, RNA interference; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT, reverse transcription; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related.1The abbreviations used are: LS, large subunit; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DSB, DNA double-strand break; PCNA, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen; PI, propidium iodide; pol II, RNA polymerase II; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNAs; RNAi, RNA interference; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT, reverse transcription; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related. of RNA polymerase II (pol II), resulting in transcriptional collapse and the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16Luo Z.

A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A prolonged blockage of pol II-dependent transcription caused by failure to repair such DNA lesions results in cell death by apoptosis (18Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-amanitin, a specific inhibitor of pol II-dependent transcription, also induces apoptosis (19Andera L. Wasylyk B. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 852-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that pol II is responsible for the transcription of most protein-coding genes, new transcription of proapoptotic genes would not be expected to contribute to apoptosis induced by pol II inhibition or degradation. Although it is possible that such cell death is triggered by impaired expression of downstream survival factors, the precise mechanism of apoptosis elicited by transcriptional blockade remains unknown.We have now investigated the molecular mechanism of apoptosis that occurs in response to transcriptional block caused by exposure of cells to α-amanitin, RNA interference, or to a high dose of UV radiation. Inhibition of transcription resulted in accumulation of p53 and massive cell death both in normal fibroblasts and in HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (p53+/+) without the induction of apparent DNA damage. Although new transcription of various p53 target genes was blocked as a result of pol II inhibition, the accumulation of p53 was required for apoptosis. We also found that a fraction of the accumulated p53 molecules, including those phosphorylated on Ser15 or Ser46, translocated to mitochondria. In addition, we found that pol II inhibition induces the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 (p21WAF1), which is a target gene product of p53, allowing cells to enter S phase and to undergo apoptosis. Our observations support the notion that blockage of pol II-dependent transcription triggers p53-mediated, transcription-independent apoptosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Cell Culture—Parental (p53+/+ and p21+/+), p53-/-, and p21-/- HCT116 cells (kindly provided by B. Vogelstein) and MRC-5 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (without antibiotics) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Unless designated otherwise, HCT116 cells used in experiments were the parental cells. Cells were incubated with α-amanitin (Sigma), MG132 (Calbiochem), adriamycin (Sigma), aphidicolin (Wako, Osaka, Japan), Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA), or actinomycin D (Sigma) as indicated.Expression Plasmids and siRNA Transfection—A plasmid for expressing wild type p53 or a truncated form of p53 (p53(Δ1-39), deletion of N terminus 39 amino acid) was constructed by subcloning the corresponding cDNA fragment into pcDNA3. These expression plasmids were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Colonies were selected in complete medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml; Invitrogen).RNAi experiments were conducted as described previously (20Arima Y. Hirota T. Bronner C. Mousli M. Fujiwara T. Niwa S. Ishikawa H. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We used the following target sequence for pol II large subunit siRNA, 475aactgaagcgaatgtctgtga495. The 21-nucleotide chimeric RNA-DNA duplexes were obtained from Japan BioServices Co., Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). Cells were transfected with annealed siRNAs with the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). As a control we used the GL-2 duplex to target the luciferase gene (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar).UV Irradiation—Cells were washed with PBS, exposed to UV radiation (254 nm) at a dose of 2, 30, or 40 J/m2, and then incubated in fresh medium for the indicated times. Where indicated, they were incubated with 100 nm pifithrin-α (Calbiochem) for 3 h before and after UV irradiation.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were collected by exposure to trypsin, washed with PBS, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, and stored at -20 °C. They were subsequently washed twice with PBS, incubated for 30 min at room temperature with RNase A (100 μg/ml), and stained with PI (25 μg/ml) for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed with a FACSCalibur instrument, and data were analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For assay of BrdUrd incorporation, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd, fixed, denatured for 30 min at room temperature with PBS containing 2 n HCl, and washed with PBS. They were then incubated for 30 min with a 1:1 dilution of a fluorescein-conjugated mouse mAb to BrdUrd (BD Biosciences), counterstained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry.Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometric determination of the fraction of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content as well as by detection of DNA fragmentation with the use of a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plus assay kit (Roche Applied Science). For detection of cells in the early stage of apoptosis, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained for 60 min at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of the M30 CytoDeath antibody (Roche Applied Science), which recognizes a specific caspase cleavage product of cytokeratin 18, in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, counterstained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry.Immunoblot Analysis—Details of immunoblot analysis and various antibodies used are described in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were washed with TBS, incubated for 2 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed again with TBS, and fixed with 80% methanol for 5 min at room temperature. They were then stained with the following primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: mouse mAb DO-1 to p53 (1:1000 dilution); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p53 (1:100 dilution; FL393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to pol II LS (N-20, 1:500 dilution); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to γ-H2AX (1: 100 dilution; Trevigen). After washing with TBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, counterstained with PI, mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octaneglycerol, and observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus) Mitochondria were stained by MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes). For staining of BrdUrd, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 24 h before harvesting, fixed, denatured for 15 min with 2 n HCl, washed with TBS, and incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated mouse mAb to BrdUrd.Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells with the use of an RNeasy spin column kit (Qiagen), and 2.5 μg were converted to cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The exponential phase of PCR was determined from 22 to 30 cycles to allow semiquantitative comparisons among cDNA samples subjected to identical reactions. Each PCR protocol included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles (pol II LS), 25 cycles (p53, p21Cip1, Bax, GADD45, p53DINP1α), or 22 cycles (Noxa and GAPDH)) of 95 °C for 1 min, 55-60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and was performed with a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels.Adenovirus Infection—The four replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors used in the present study were described previously (22Zhang W.W. Fang X. Branch C.D. Mazur W. French B.A. Roth J.A. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 868-872PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I.

Ad5CMV-p53, Ad5CMV-p21Cip1, and Ad5CMV-p27Kip1 encode wild-type human p53, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1, respectively, under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. The Ad5CMV-Luc vector encoding luciferase was used as a control. Adenoviruses were propagated and titrated in the permissive 293 cell line. Viral infection titers were determined as described previously (24Miyake H. Hanada N. Nakamura H. Kagawa S. Fujiwara T. Hara I. Eto H. Gohji K. Arakawa S. Kamidono S. Saya H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 105) were plated 24 h before infection and cultured for the indicated times with each adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units per cell.Subcellular Fractionation—Adherent and floating cells (2 × 107) were harvested and washed with PBS, and mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated with the use of an Optiprep Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Pierce, reagent-based method). The mitochondrial pellet was lysed in SDS sample buffer, and the cytosolic supernatant was concentrated with a Microcon device (Millipore, size cut-off of 10 kDa) before analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSInhibition of pol II-dependent Transcription Induces p53-mediated Apoptosis—To evaluate the role of p53 in transcriptional blockade-mediated cell death, we treated p53 knock-out HCT116 cells (25Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) versus their parental control cells with α-amanitin, a specific inhibitor of pol II-dependent transcription. α-Amanitin binds directly to the LS of pol II (26Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and specifically induces its ubiquitination and consequent degradation (27Nguyen V.T. Giannoni F. Dubois M.F. Seo S.J. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2924-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations (28Ljungman M. Zhang F. Chen F. Rainbow A.J. McKay B.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), cells treated with α-amanitin manifested a time-dependent decrease in the total amount of mRNA and were unable to resume mRNA synthesis. 2Y. Arima and H. Saya, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 1A, flow cytometry revealed that exposure of parental HCT116 (p53+/+) cells to α-amanitin resulted in a substantial increase in the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population. However, knock-out of p53 (p53-/-) markedly reduced the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to death induced by α-amanitin, indicating that the apoptosis elicited by these pol II inhibitors is p53-dependent.To validate further these results, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to abrogate expression of the pol II large subunit, which is an alternative approach to inhibit pol II-dependent transcription. Transfection of cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific for the pol II large subunit resulted in reduction in levels of the protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Similar to the data obtained by α-amanitin, depletion of pol II significantly induced apoptosis in p53+/+ HCT116 cells but not in p53-/- HCT116 cells (Fig. 1A).To confirm whether α-amanitin induces cell death by activation of apoptotic pathways, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay that measures the level of cytoplasmic nucleosomal DNA fragments (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the data obtained by flow cytometry, α-amanitin induced a substantially larger increase in the amount of cytoplasmic DNA fragments in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the p53-/- cells. Microscopic observation of HCT116 cells stained with PI also revealed that α-amanitin induced a marked increase in the proportion of cells with fragmented chromatin (supplemental Fig. S2), a characteristic of apoptosis. Given that p53-/- HCT116 cells are resistant to α-amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B), we next examined whether restoration of p53 expression in these cells renders them sensitive to this effect of α-amanitin. Adenovirus-mediated expression of p53, but not that of luciferase, indeed restored the sensitivity of p53-/- cells to α-amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S3), supporting the notion that p53 expression is required for this effect of α-amanitin. In addition, the apoptosis induced by α-amanitin was completely blocked by the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fmk (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that inhibition of pol II-dependent transcription promotes p53- and caspase-dependent apoptosis.α-Amanitin Induces pol II Degradation and p53 Accumulation without DNA Double-strand Breaks—α-Amanitin induces the ubiquitination of the C-terminal domain of the LS of pol II (29Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and consequent proteasome-mediated protein degradation (27Nguyen V.T. Giannoni F. Dubois M.F. Seo S.J. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2924-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of α-amanitin on the abundance of the LS of pol II in p53+/+ or p53-/- HCT116 cells by immunoblot (Fig. 2A) and immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. S4) analyses. The toxin induced degradation of pol II LS in both types of HCT116 cells, suggesting that p53 does not contribute to α-amanitin-induced pol II degradation.Fig. 2Induction of pol II LS degradation and of p53 phosphorylation and accumulation in HCT116 cells by α-amanitin. A, α-amanitin-induced pol II LS degradation and p53 accumulation. Cells (p53+/+ or p53-/-) were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of α-amanitin for 24 h, after which cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against pol II LS, p53 (DO-1), and α-tubulin (loading control). IIo, hyperphosphorylated form of pol II; IIa, hypophosphorylated form of pol II. B, α-amanitin does not induce DNA double-strand breaks. Cells (p53+/+) were treated with α-amanitin (10 μg/ml) or adriamycin (500 ng/ml) for 18 h and then both stained with antibodies to γ-H2AX (green) and counterstained with PI (red). The merged images are shown in the right panels. Scale bars, 20 μm. C, phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 induced by adriamycin or α-amanitin.

The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) to show equal loading of the samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that apoptosis induced by α-amanitin was shown to be p53-dependent, we next examined the effect of the drug on the amount of p53. Consistent with previous observations (19Andera L. Wasylyk B. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 852-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ljungman M. Zhang F. Chen F. Rainbow A.J. McKay B.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2775-2784PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis revealed that α-amanitin elicited the accumulation of p53 in p53+/+ HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A). Accumulation of p53 by inhibition of pol II was also confirmed by depletion of pol II large subunit using siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1).To verify that the p53 accumulation elicited by α-amanitin was not attributable to the induction of DNA damage, we checked for the presence of the γ-H2AX complex, which can be a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (31Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 32Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar), in α-amanitin-treated HCT116 cells by immunofluorescence analysis. To avoid the detection of DSBs attributable to apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we examined cells for the presence of γ-H2AX foci 18 h after exposure to drugs (Fig. 2B). Whereas adriamycin induced the formation of γ-H2AX foci, α-amanitin did not, even though substantial p53 accumulation was apparent at this time point. These results suggest that the accumulation of p53 induced by α-amanitin is not caused by the induction of DSBs.The accumulation and activation of p53 are regulated by post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and acetylation (33Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Given that phosphorylation of p53 contributes to both the stabilization and activation of the protein, we examined the time course of p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and Ser46 in p53+/+ HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or α-amanitin (Fig. 2C). Adriamycin-induced Ser15 phosphorylation was apparent at 3 h, as was p53 accumulation; an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of Ser46 was not apparent until 6 h, consistent with the delay in the phosphorylation of this residue compared with that of Ser15 observed previously in adriamycin-treated cells (6Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In contrast, an increase in the extent of Ser46 phosphorylation was apparent at 12 h, coincident with the onset of p53 accumulation, and Ser15 phosphorylation was not detected until 24 h in cells treated with α-amanitin. These results thus suggest that α-amanitin triggers a slower p53 response in comparison to adriamycin and may activate a signaling pathway that differs from that responsible for the p53 stabilization in response to DNA damage.Transcription of p53 Target Genes Is Blocked in α-Amanitin-treated Cells—α-Amanitin blocks pol II-dependent gene transcription. Therefore, we next confirmed that p53-mediated apoptosis induced by α-amanitin is independent of the transactivation activity of p53. With the use of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, we determined the amounts of mRNAs derived from various p53 target genes, including those for p21Cip1, Bax, Noxa, GADD45 (34Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), in HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or α-amanitin for 24 h (Fig. 3). Whereas adriamycin increased the abundance of the mRNAs for all p53 target genes examined, α-amanitin did not. The abundance of p53 mRNA was reduced by treatment of cells with α-amanitin but not by exposure to adriamycin. Additionally, our time course experiments showed that the expression of these p53 target genes was not up-regulated in α-amanitin-treated cells throughout the treatment period (data not shown). These data suggest that transcriptional blockade triggers a p53-dependent apoptosis that is not dependent upon p53-mediated changes in gene expression.Fig. 3Inhibition by α-amanitin of transcription of 53 target genes. HCT116 cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of adriamycin (500 ng/ml) or α-amanitin (10 μg/ml), after which the abundance of mRNAs for the indicated proteins was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and that a fraction of p53 molecules that accumulate in response to DNA damage translocates to mitochondria and thereby promotes apoptosis (14Marchenko N.D.

Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to mitochondria. Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out by using MRC-5 human normal fibroblasts that have wild-type p53. MRC-5 cells are suitable for investigating the subcellular distribution of endogenous p53 because the cells have flat and large morphology and can be easily observed cytoplasmic structures. We also confirmed that α-amanitin elicits p53 accumulation and apoptosis in MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B) as observed in HCT116 cells. Although p53 protein was detectable at a low level in the nuclei of untreated cells, it was present in increased amounts in α-amanitin-treated cells and was localized to mitochondria in a substantial proportion of these cells (Fig. 4A). Cell fractionation experiments also demonstrate that p53 accumulated by α-amanitin treatment is primarily detected in mitochondrial fractions, and those mitochondrial p53 molecules are phosphorylated on Ser15 and/or Ser46 (Fig. 4B). These findings thus suggest that p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to the mitochondria, which may activate the apoptotic program.Fig. 4Translocation of p53 to mitochondria in r"

In this study, the molecular mechanisms of this enhanced immune response were investigated. We found that levels of nitric oxide measured in either plasma or isolated macrophages from Ucp2-/- mice are significantly elevated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide challenge compared with similarly treated Ucp2+/+ mice. Likewise, expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and inflammatory cytokines is higher in Ucp2-/- mice in vivo and in vitro. Key steps in the activation cascade of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, including IκB kinase and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, are all remarkably enhanced in Ucp2-/- mice, most notably even under basal conditions. The elevated basal activity of IκB kinase in macrophages from Ucp2-/- mice can be blocked by cell-permeable inhibitors of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation, but not by a specific inhibitor for inducible nitric-oxide synthase. Isolated mitochondria from Ucp2-/- cells produced more superoxide/hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that mitochrondrially derived reactive oxygen from Ucp2-/- cells constitutively activates NF-κB, resulting in a “primed” state to both potentiate and amplify the inflammatory response upon subsequent stimulation.

Several features of UCP2 led us to initially propose that it was a bona fide uncoupling protein involved in the dissipation of excess metabolic fuel as heat. These aspects of UCP2 included its structural resemblance to UCP1, its ability to uncouple respiration in model assay systems, and a chromosomal location to a region with genetic linkage to obesity and hyperinsulinemia (1Fleury C.

We showed that macrophages from Ucp2-/- mice produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay and hypothesized that UCP2 plays a role in host immune defense by regulating the production of ROS. A broad definition of ROS can include reactive oxygen as well as nitrogen species, and macrophages are known to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) in addition to superoxide. However, the nitro blue tetrazolium assay cannot distinguish between the ROS and RNS generated (12Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or the mechanisms responsible for it. In the present study we explored the molecular basis of this amplified immune response in Ucp2-/- mice using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria that is a well-established activator of both the “reactive oxygen” and “reactive nitrogen” generating pathways (13Park H.S.

A. 1985; 82: 7738-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). We show that in response to LPS challenge, Ucp2-/- mice produce large amounts of nitric oxide and cytokines both in vivo and from isolated macrophages in vitro as compared with wild-type mice. As one of the major transcription factors responsible for increasing the expression of iNOS and inflammatory cytokines, we find that in spleen or isolated macrophages of Ucp2-/- mice, the NF-κB system is activated at several steps in its pathway (importantly, even under basal conditions). NF-κB is most frequently composed of two DNA-binding subunits, p50 and p65, which exist as an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein (IκB). Almost all of the signals that lead to activation of NF-κB converge on IκB kinase (IKK). Activation of IKK leads to the phosphorylation of IκBs, which targets them for ubiquitination and degradation, thus allowing the NF-κB dimer to translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (15Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that IKK activity is elevated in spleen as well as isolated macrophages from Ucp2-/- mice, even under basal conditions, and isolated mitochondria from Ucp2-/- spleen produce significantly more hydrogen peroxide as compared with wild-type mice. Together with the finding that cell-permeable preparations of the ROS inhibitors superoxide dismutase and catalase could block the basal elevation of IKK activity in isolated macrophages, our results support the idea that deficiency of UCP2 results in greaterO2⋅¯/H2O2release from mitochondria (16Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), leading in turn to persistent activation of NF-κB and exacerbation of subsequent inflammatory challenges. Animals and Sample Collection—Generation of Ucp2-/- mice was described previously (9Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Twelve-week-old male mice were used that had been backcrossed from the mixed C57Bl/6J-129Sv/J strain background to C57Bl/6J mice for 10 generations. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Duke University and CIIT Centers for Health Research. LPS (Sigma) was administered to mice at a dose of 4 μg/g or 15 μg/g body weight (bw) (17Reichardt H.M. Umland T. Bauer A. Kretz O. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9009-9017Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) in 100 μl of PBS by intraperitoneal injection or given PBS vehicle. Blood samples were collected 6 or 16 h later under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 μg/g bw). Plasma was separated in Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences), and plasma protein was quantified by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Plasma NO levels and cytokines were measured as described below. For isolation of resident peritoneal macrophages, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and the peritoneal cavity was gently flushed three times with chilled Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (Highveld). Lavage fluid was pooled together (5–7 ml), centrifuged at 500 × g for 8 min, and resuspended in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm Hepes, and 10 mm l-glutamine. Cells were seeded into either 24-well plates for measurement of NO production or 6-well plates for Western blot and kinase assays. Following incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for times ranging from 4 h to overnight and removal of any non-adherent cells, the remaining cells (>90% macrophages) were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS or PBS for the indicated times (19Werner E.R. Bahrami S. Heller R. Werner-Felmayer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10129-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and treated overnight with 200 units/ml polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase and 400 units/ml polyethylene glycol-catalase or 50 μm 1400W as indicated in specific experiments. Supernatants were collected for measuring NO levels, and cells were lysed for measuring iNOS protein expression. The number of cells per well was determined by a modified method of Mosmann (20Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar) (Promega), and NO in macrophage supernatants from the Griess assay was normalized to cell numbers. Subcellular protein fractions were prepared from freshly isolated spleen by homogenization at 4 °C in TES buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml bestatin, 50 μg/ml TPCK, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or lysis buffer for IKK activity (21Bayon Y. Ortiz M.A. Lopez-Hernandez F.J. Gao F. Karin M. Pfahl M. Piedrafita F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were used for nuclear protein isolation by the NE-PER method (Pierce). Supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatants were collected as the cytoplasmic fraction, and membrane proteins in the pellet were obtained by resuspension with 50 μl of lysis buffer as described previously (22Kim S.H. Won S.J. Sohn S. Kwon H.J. Lee J.Y. Park J.H. Gwag B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nitrite/Nitrate Determination using Griess Assay—NO formation in plasma or macrophage culture supernatants was detected as nitrite/nitrate by the method of Green et al. (23Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar), with slight modification (24Pi J. Horiguchi S. Sun Y. Nikaido M. Shimojo N. Hayashi T. Yamauchi H. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Sun G. Waalkes M.P. Kumagai Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—All primary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., with the exception of antibodies against iNOS and β-actin, which were from Sigma. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated in 10% Tris-glycine mini gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in wash buffer (PBS/0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at 4 °C and probed with primary antibodies overnight at dilutions recommended by the suppliers. Membranes were washed three times with wash buffer (15 min/wash) before incubation with second antibodies (1 h at room temperature). Blots were scanned and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Typhoon; Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Quantity One). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from spleen with Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc). A total of 10–25 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes as previously described (25Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). Images were visualized and quantified in a PhosphorImager. All measurements were normalized to the internal standard cyclophilin or 18S RNA. Cytokine Measurements by ELISA—Plasma samples for ELISA were collected as described under “Animals and Sample Collection.” Detection of IFN-γ and TNF-α was performed using sandwich ELISA reagents from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Microarray Hybridization—Atlas Mouse Inflammatory/Stress cDNA expression microarray analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Ucp2+/+ and Ucp2-/- mice for this experiment were treated with 15 μg LPS/g bw or left untreated. All hybridizations were carried out in quadruplicate. Before labeling, RNA samples from two biological replicates were pooled in equal amounts. Briefly, total RNA was converted to [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probe using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and the Atlas Mouse Inflammatory/Stress CDS primer mix. The 32P-labeled cDNA probe was purified using NucleoSpin columns (Clontech). The membrane was pre-hybridized with Expresshyb (Clontech) for 60 min at 68 °C, followed by hybridization with probe overnight at 68 °C. The arrays were washed four times in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS (30 min each) and two times in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS. The arrays were then sealed in plastic wrap and exposed to an Amersham Biosciences PhosphoImage screen or to radiographic film. The images were analyzed densitometrically using AtlasImage software (Clontech). The gene expression intensities were normalized with a total of nine housekeeping genes present on the array. Comparisons between sample groups were made by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and either used immediately or stored at –70 °C. Single-stranded oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) were annealed by polymerase chain reaction to form consensus oligomers containing the underlined NF-κB-binding site (5′-ATATGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′ and 5′-ATACCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCA-3′) and two other oligomers containing the underlined iNOS promoter-specific NF-κB-binding site (NFκB(d), 5′-ACTGGGGACTCTCCCTTTGGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCAAAGGGAGAGTCCCCA-3′; NFκB(u), 5′-GCTAGGGGGATTTTCCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGAGGGAAAATCCCCCTA3′) and their mutant oligonucleotides (italicized) (5′-ACTGCTCACTCTCCCTTTGGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCAAAGGGAGAGTGAGCA3′; 5′-GCTAGGCTCATTTTCCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGAGGGAAAATGAGCCTA3′, respectively) (26Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed by incubating nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature with 8 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Antibodies against NF-κB p50 or p65 were added for the supershift for 30 min at 4 °C before the incubation with oligonucleotides. As a control for nonspecific binding, some samples were processed using antisera against cytochrome c. The DNA-protein complex was separated in 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5% Tris-glycine (Invitrogen) and dried under vacuum. IκB Kinase Assay—Kinase activity for IKK was measured as previously described (21Bayon Y. Ortiz M.A. Lopez-Hernandez F.J. Gao F. Karin M. Pfahl M. Piedrafita F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic protein from spleen (1.5 mg) or total protein from macrophage (150 μg) was incubated with 0.75 or 0.4 μg of anti-IKKα/β antibody, respectively, in lysis buffer as previously described (21Bayon Y. Ortiz M.A. Lopez-Hernandez F.J. Gao F. Karin M. Pfahl M. Piedrafita F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4 °C and then isolated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) after 3 h of incubation. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The washed beads were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1.5 μg of IκBα as substrate, 20 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-14% PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Quantification of the radioactive bands was performed with a PhosphorImager. Measurement of Mitochondrial H2O2 Production—Spleen mitochondria were isolated (Sigma MITO-ISO1) and resuspended in an assay medium based on the method of St-Pierre et al. (27St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), containing 3 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Mitochondrial protein was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). H2O2 levels were measured using Amplex® Red (Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit; Molecular Probes). For each of the three separate experiments conducted, equal amounts of mitochondria (350 μg/100 μl) from two mice of each genotype were incubated at room temperature in assay medium under state 4 conditions in the presence of the Amplex® Red reagent mixture. Mitochondrial production of H2O2 was measured at 10-min intervals over a 30-min period using a SPECTRAmax M2 spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Calibration curves for H2O2 concentrations were generated as previously described (27St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of spleen mitochondria. Independent confirmation of the amount of mitochondria in each reaction sample was verified by quantification of mitochondrial DNA after H2O2 measurement. H2O2 generation was linear through 30 min, and the data are expressed as mol·mg-1 min-1. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's or Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used to compare treated groups with controls. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant. iNOS-derived NO and Cytokine Enhancement in Ucp2-/- Mice upon LPS Treatment—Our original report on Ucp2-/- mice described their exaggerated immune response in vivo and free radical production by macrophages (9Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), but importantly, it did not distinguish between the relative contributions of ROS and RNS. The first experiments measured the changes in expression patterns of key ROS- and RNS-generating enzymes in spleen from Ucp2+/+ and Ucp2-/- mice, including NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenase 2, and iNOS. Following LPS treatment, the subcellular distribution of the NADPH oxidase subunits p47 and p67 shifted toward greater membrane association to indicate its activation (28Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I), and superoxide levels were increased as measured independently by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown), but there were no significant differences between the two genotypes. Also shown in Table I, the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 was identical in Ucp2+/+ and Ucp2-/- mice and was not affected by LPS. However, Fig. 1A illustrates that upon LPS treatment, total NO (nitrite and nitrate) in plasma from Ucp2-/- mice was increased 2.2 ± 0.8-fold above that produced by similarly treated Ucp2+/+ mice. This difference between the genotypes in the generation of reactive nitrogen species was further reflected by a much higher level of iNOS gene expression in spleen of Ucp2-/- mice as measured by Northern (Fig. 1B) and Western blotting (Fig. 1C). In both genotypes, iNOS expression was not detectable under basal conditions by these methods (data not shown). In addition, macrophages isolated from the two genotypes and stimulated by LPS in vitro gave identical responses to those observed in spleen. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, generation of NO and the induction of iNOS expression were more robust in the cells from Ucp2-/- mice compared with those from Ucp2+/+ mice. Pre-treatment of the cells with the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W completely prevented NO production (Fig. 2A), confirming that iNOS is the sole source of this NO.Table ISubcellular distribution of NADPH oxidase components p47phox and p67phox and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) mRNA levels in spleen Protein expression data are shown as the fold change relative to Ucp2+/+ without LPS treatment, which is set to 1.00 (italicized) (n = 3).

As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS-induced expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 was significantly higher in Ucp2-/- mice than in their wild-type littermates following LPS treatment. When we examined plasma levels of two of these key inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α, both were substantially greater in Ucp2-/- mice than in Ucp2+/+ mice (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar results of elevated cytokine gene expression were obtained from microarray analyses of spleen RNA from Ucp2+/+ and -/- mice (Fig. 4). There was also a greater representation of a subset of tissue-degrading matrix metalloproteinases and anti-apoptotic gene products in samples from LPS-treated Ucp2-/- mice than from wild-type animals. Gene network analysis (29Bonetta L. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 169-176Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) illustrates that these molecules regulate the transcription factor NF-κB or are regulated by it.Fig. 4Microarray analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2155062549,"Dopamine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are critically involved in locomotion, reward, and cognitive processes. The D2 class of dopamine receptors (DRD2, -3, and -4) is the target for antipsychotic medication. DRD4 has been implicated in cognition, and genetic studies have found an association between a highly polymorphic repeat sequence in the human DRD4 coding region and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Using DRD4 as a model, we show that antipsychotics can function as potent pharmacological chaperones up-regulating receptor expression and can also rescue a non-functional DRD4 folding mutant. This chaperone-mediated up-regulation involves reduced degradation by the 26 S proteasome; likely via the stabilization of newly synthesized receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum. Dopamine itself can function as a chaperone when shuttled into the cell by means of the dopamine transporter. Furthermore, different repeat variants of DRD4 display differential sensitivity to this chaperone effect. These data suggest that folding efficiency may be rate-limiting for dopamine receptor biogenesis and that this efficiency differs between receptor variants. Consequently, the clinical profile of dopaminergic ligands, including antipsychotics, may include their ability to serve as pharmacological chaperones.

Misfolded and incompletely assembled proteins are common side products of protein synthesis in the ER, and are transported back into the cytosol for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery (1Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). ER quality control is crucial for securing the fidelity of gene expression at the post-translational level (2Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 3Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that protein misfolding and aggregation is the most likely cause of various neurological disorders such as prion-related diseases, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease (4Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Minor changes in the primary structure of a protein can cause retention in the ER and rapid degradation; e.g. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ΔF508 mutant interferes with the biosynthetic folding of nascent CFTR polypeptides.Restoration of proper folding has become an important therapeutic goal and it has been demonstrated that small cell-permeable molecules such as glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and trimethylamine N-oxide stabilize protein conformation, increase the rate of in vitro protein refolding, and increase the kinetics of oligomeric assembly in a nonspecific way (5Sato S.

The receptor ligands may stabilize the newly synthesized receptor in the native or intermediate state of its folding pathway, possibly by inducing stabilizing conformational constrains within the hydrophobic core of the protein.The dopamine system is the main target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and contributes to the addictive properties of drugs of abuse like amphetamine. The expression levels of D2-like receptors have been implicated in an individuals predisposition to dopamine-related disorders and may also influence their susceptibility to the side effects associated with neuroleptic treatment (10Blin J.

Human genetic studies and molecular genetic and physiological studies suggest that this receptor plays a role in attention and cognition, and may pose a genetic vulnerability factor for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We show that ER-mediated quality control is an important rate-limiting step in the expression of mature DRD4 and that this expression can be enhanced by pharmacological chaperones and by its endogenous ligand dopamine. Moreover, the differences in chaperone-mediated up-regulation between polymorphic variants of the human DRD4 may point to this being a biological factor for the genetic association of this receptor with various traits and disorders (16Benjamin J.

Drug treatments using various receptor ligands were done by addition of the different drugs to the medium at a final concentration of 10 μm for various lengths of time (up to 16 h). To prevent a reduction in the activity of dopamine because of oxidation over prolonged periods of incubation, the medium was replaced every 3 h with new medium containing dopamine. The drugs brefeldin A, cycloheximide, lactacystin, and tunicamycin were directly added to the medium to the final concentrations and for the durations indicated under “Results.”Western Blotting—Western analysis was in essence done as previously described (52Lavine N.

Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed using RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). Cell lysate (50 μg of protein) in Laemmli buffer was heated for 5 min at 37 °C and separated on a 10% Tris-glycine gel followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce). Epitope-tagged receptors were detected using either the anti-FLAG M1 or anti-HA (16B12) antibodies in concert with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL Plus chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham). The detected signals were quantified on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant version 4.2 software (Amersham Biosciences).Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were grown to subconfluency and treated with 10 μm quinpirole or left untreated. After an incubation period of 16 h RNA was isolated using TRIzol as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA (30 μg) was denatured using glyoxal/Me2SO, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (47Van Tol H.H. Riva M. Civelli O. Creese I. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 111: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled randomprimed probe generated from the DRD4 cDNA using standard protocols (Roche Diagnostics). Results were visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HA-tagged DRD4 expressing cells were grown on glass coverslips until 20% confluency. Cells were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline), blocked (3% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min, and subsequently incubated in blocking solution containing mouse anti-HA (16B12), diluted 1/350, at room temperature for 45 min. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (Cy-3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1/500 diluted in blocking solution) for 20 min. All incubations were done at room temperature. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY).RESULTSIncreased DRD4 Expression by Chemical Chaperones—It has become clear that several chemicals such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) can act as chemical chaperones that assist the folding of wild-type and mutant proteins, including receptors, allowing them to achieve a functional state (5Sato S.

It has also been demonstrated that as much as 30% of newly synthesized proteins (e.g. major histocompatiblility class I molecules) never attain their correct native structure (22Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of these chemical chaperones on the expression level of the amino-terminal FLAG-tagged DRD4 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). The tagged receptor is pharmacologically and functionally indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor (23Asghari V. Sanyal S. Buchwaldt S. Paterson A. Jovanovic V. Van Tol H.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 24Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The DRD4 expressing cells were treated with various concentrations of glycerol and Me2SO for 24 h. Both glycerol and Me2SO increased the expression of the DRD4 up to 3- or 4-fold in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown).Increased DRD4 Expression by Pharmacological Chaperones—In light of the data obtained with the chemical chaperones, we investigated whether DRD4 ligands are effective as pharmacological chaperones. Treatment of DRD4 expressing cells with the agonist quinpirole (10 μm, 16 h) resulted in an increased expression of the receptor as measured by ligand binding (Bmax, 719 ± 60 versus 1587 ± 66 fmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein). Maximal receptor expression was reached after an induction period of 16 h (Fig. 1A); this increase was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). Quinpirole did not enhance expression of the CFTR ΔF508 mutant suggesting that the effects are specific for DRD4 (not shown).To further test the specificity of the ligand-induced DRD4 up-regulation, we also incubated the receptor-expressing cells with the antagonists haloperidol, butaclamol(+), clozapine, or domperidone. Saturation binding analysis (Fig. 2A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, B and C) showed that these antagonists could induce a similar increase in receptor expression as that seen for the agonist quinpirole. The endogenous ligand for the receptor, dopamine, is not membrane permeable and, as expected, incubation with this ligand did not result in DRD4 up-regulation. This, as well the effects of the antagonists, is consistent with the notion that the ligand-induced increase in receptor expression is not merely related to the activation of a signaling pathway by DRD4. In addition, quinpirole treatment did not increase DRD4 mRNA levels (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of translation with cycloheximide caused a 50% decrease in total protein levels but did not affect quinpirole-mediated DRD4 up-regulation (Fig. 2E). Together these data suggest that dopaminergic ligands exert their influence on expression post-translationally.Fig. 2Agonists and antagonists up-regulate DRD4 expression without changes in transcription or translation. Cells expressing DRD4.4 were treated for 16 h with 10 μm of the agonists dopamine (DA) or quinpirole (quin) or the antagonists domperidone (dom) or butaclamol(+) (but(+)). DRD4.4 expression was determined by [3H]spiperone binding (fmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein) (A) or by Western analysis (B). C, dose-response analysis of cells treated for 16 h with domperidone, butaclamol(+), haloperidol, or clozapine measured by Western analysis. D, Northern blot analysis of DRD4.4. Cells were treated with quinpirole (10 μm, 16 h) and total RNA was isolated and analyzed for DRD4.4 and cyclophilin mRNA expression by Northern blot. DRD4.4 expression levels, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, are indicated below the autoradiogram. E, ligand-induced DRD4 upregulation during translational block with cycloheximide. DRD4.4 expressing cells were treated with or without quinpirole (16 h, 10 μm) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX, 20 μg/ml). DRD4 expression was evaluated by Western analysis. Each lane contained 50 μg of protein. Note, however, that in the CHX-treated samples total protein content dropped by about 50%. All experiments were done in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing FLAG epitope-tagged DRD4.4. The FLAG epitope tag was used for immunodetection in the Western analyses.

CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with these receptor mutants displayed no functional expression of the receptors, as measured by radioligand ([3H]spiperone and [3H]nemonapride) saturation binding analysis and quinpirole-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange, despite the detection of receptor mRNAs. Pretreatment of the cells with 10 μm quinpirole for 16 h resulted in detectable expression of both receptor mutants (Fig. 3A) without changes in their mRNA levels (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the DRD4 antagonists butaclamol(+) and domperidone could induce DRD4-M345T mutant receptor expression (Fig. 3C). As seen with the wild-type DRD4, dopamine treatment did not increase the expression of this mutant. The Kd for [3H]spiperone was comparable for the wild-type and quinpirole-induced (16 h, 10 μm) DRD4-M345T receptors (0.15 ± 0.02 and 0.16 ± 0.02 nm, respectively). Furthermore, when expression of the mutant receptor was induced, functional activity was restored, as measured by its ability to mediate dopamine-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Rescue of expression of the putative folding mutant DRD4-M345(S/T).

Neuron. 2002; 35: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We investigated whether dopamine could activate mitogen-activated protein kinase in CHO-K1 cells expressing DRD4-M345T. Considering that DRD4-mediated activation of ERK phosphorylation is transient upon continuous receptor stimulation (24Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we treated the cells for 16 h with the antagonist butaclamol(+) (10 μm). The butaclamol-treated DRD4-M345T expressing cells, but not untreated cells, mediated dopamine-stimulated ERK (p42/44) phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results suggest that DRD4-M345T is a folding mutant that can be rescued following treatment with a suitable chaperone.Dopamine Transporter Expression Allows Dopamine to Act as Pharmacological Chaperone—Dopamine does not act as a pharmacological chaperone most likely because it cannot enter the cell in high enough concentrations. To determine whether dopamine can function as a pharmacological chaperone when present in substantial intracellular quantities, we co-expressed the dopamine transporter with DRD4 in CHO-K1 cells and HEK293T cells. The cells were pretreated for 16 h with dopamine (10 μm) and analyzed for DRD4 expression by saturation binding and Western analyses (Fig. 4, A and B). Dopamine-induced increases in receptor levels were only detected upon expression of the DAT. To further demonstrate that the transporter can serve as a conduit for dopamine to act as pharmacological chaperone we explored whether co-expression of DAT with the DRD4-M345T folding mutant would permit the dopamine-induced rescue of receptor expression. Indeed, dopamine increased DRD4-M345T expression in HEK293T cells coexpressing the dopamine transporter. No rescue was observed in the absence of DAT expression. The magnitude of dopamine-induced receptor expression was comparable with that seen with the cell-permeable agonist quinpirole (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Active transport of dopamine via the dopamine transporter up-regulates DRD4 expression. A, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing FLAG epitope-tagged DRD4.4 were transiently transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3, as negative control, or the same vector expressing the dopamine transporter (pDAT). B and C, HEK293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged DRD4.4 (B) or DRD4.4-M345T (C) and pcDNA3 or pDAT. After transfection (36 h) the cells were treated for 16 h with dopamine (DA, 10 μm; medium replaced every 3 h with new DA-containing medium) or quinpirole (10 μm). DRD4 expression was detected by [3H]spiperone ligand binding (bar graphs) and Western analyses (autoradiographs below the bar graph).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Human DRD4 Repeat Variants and Chaperone-mediated Upregulation—The human DRD4 gene contains within its third exon a variable number of 48-base pair tandem repeat sequences. The variable number tandem repeat is an imperfect repeat translated into 16 amino acids found to be present 2–11 times in different alleles of DRD4. The most common alleles are variants with 2, 4, and 7 repeats, DRD4.2, DRD4.4, and DRD4.7, respectively (26Van Tol H.H. Wu C.M. Guan H.C. Ohara K. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. Kennedy J. Seeman P.

For those three variants we compared the chaperone-mediated up-regulation of the mature receptor by quinpirole (1 and 10 μm, 16 h) using Western analysis. When the levels of up-regulation of the variants are compared, DRD4.2 showed an ∼2-fold lower pharmacological chaperone-induced up-regulation at 10 μm quinpirole treatment than DRD4.7 (Table I; Duncan, p < 0.0014). This increase was less for DRD4.4 when compared with the other receptor variants. As expected, at 1 μm quinpirole treatment the differences were less pronounced, indicating the specificity and dose dependence of the ligand-mediated increase.Table IQuinpirole-induced up-regulation of DRD4 variants Up-regulation of different DRD4 variant (DRD4.2, -4.4, and -4.7) expression was done by 16-h treatments with or without quinpirole at 1 and 10 μm. After 16 h, expression was measured by Western analysis using the NH2-terminal epitope tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). The baseline expression for the different DRD4 variants without quinpirole treatment is given in arbitrary units (A.U.) ± S.E. for eight experiments (n). The up-regulation is expressed as percentage of baseline (no quinpirole treatment) ± S.E. for seven or eight experiments (n). When levels of up-regulation of the variants are compared with their respective basal levels DRD4.2 showed an approximate 2-fold lower pharmacological chaperone-induced up-regulation at 10 μm quinpirole treatment compared with DRD4.7 (DRD4.2 versus DRD4.7; analysis of variance (5Sato S.

https://openalex.org/W2076166231,"Macroautophagy is an intracellular degradation system for the majority of proteins and some organelles that is conserved in all eukaryotic species. The precise role of autophagy in mammalian development and potential involvement in disease remain to be discerned. Yeast Atg9p is the first integral membrane protein shown to be essential for the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway and autophagy, whereas its mammalian functional orthologue has yet to be identified. We have identified two human genes homologous to yeast Atg9p and designated these as APG9L1 and APG9L2. We have previously identified APG9L2 as NOS3AS, which participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3) gene on chromosome 7 through its antisense overlap. In human adult tissues, APG9L1 was ubiquitously expressed, whereas APG9L2 was highly expressed in placenta (trophoblast cells) and pituitary gland. In transient transfection assays we found that both proteins were primarily localized to the perinuclear region and also scattered throughout the cytosol as dots, a subset of which colocalized with an autophagosome-specific marker LC3 under starvation conditions. Finally, by the small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of APG9L1 in HeLa cells, we demonstrated that APG9L1 is essential for starvation-induced autophagosome formation. In addition, APG9L2 can functionally complement APG9L1 in this process. These results, taken together with those of phylogenetic and sequence analyses, suggest that both APG9L1 and APG9L2 are functionally orthologous to the yATG9 in autophagosome formation. Moreover, APG9L2 is a vertebrate-specific gene that may have gained critical roles in mammalian-specific developmental events, such as placentation, through rapid evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2044909153,"Although both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and H2O2 induce activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase cascades, it is not known whether they utilize distinct intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, we first examined a variety of pharmacological inhibitors on TNF and H2O2-induced JNK activation. Gö6983 or staurosporine, which inhibits protein kinase C isoforms had no effects on TNF or H2O2-induced JNK activation. However, Gö6976 and calphostin, which can inhibit protein kinase C as well as protein kinase D (PKD), blocked H2O2- but not TNF-induced JNK activation, suggesting that PKD may be specifically involved in H2O2-induced JNK activation. Consistently, H2O2, but not TNF, induced phosphorylation of PKD and translocation of PKD from endothelial cell membrane to cytoplasm where it associates with the JNK upstream activator, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). The association is mediated through the pleckstrin homology domain of PKD and the C-terminal domain of ASK1. Inhibition of PKD by Gö6976 or by small interfering RNA of PKD blocked H2O2-induced ASK1-JNK activation and endothelial cell apoptosis. Interestingly, H2O2 induced 14-3-3 binding to PKD via the phospho-Ser-205/208 and phospho-Ser-219/223 and H2O2-induced 14-3-3 binding of PKD was specifically blocked by Gö6976 but not by Gö6983. More significantly, the 14-3-3-binding defective forms of PKD failed to associate with ASK1 and to activate JNK signaling, highlighting the importance of 14-3-3 binding of PKD in H2O2-induced activation of ASK1-JNK cascade.

The primary cells limiting inflammation is vascular endothelial cell(s) (EC). The signal transduction and resulting gene expression in response to TNF/ROS in EC have been extensively studied. TNF and ROS (H2O2 in cultured cells) activate overlapping of transcriptional factors and induce a common array of gene expression including EC adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, and matrix proteins leading to EC activation/dysfunction (1Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Irani K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). However, TNF and ROS do have distinct effects on EC and induce distinct intracellular signaling. For example, TNF induced EC death/apoptosis only in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which blocks TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression of survival factors. In contrast, H2O2 alone is sufficient to induce EC death. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that H2O2 induces the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not of NF-κB in EC (3Bradley J.R. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1598-1609PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that stress-activated kinase cascade (JNK/p38) can be activated by both TNF and ROS. However, the signal transduction pathways utilized by H2O2 have not been fully defined. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase family, is an upstream activator of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades (4Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Ten D.-P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). ASK1 can be activated in response to diverse stresses including proinflammatory cytokine TNF, ROS, and death receptor Fas, disruption of microtubule structures, protein aggregation in endoplasmic reticulum, and genotoxic stress from nucleus (4Ichijo H.

Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). In vitro data suggest that activation of ASK1 triggers various biological responses such as apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation, and survival in different cell types. Studies from ASK1-deficient mice indicate that ASK1 is critical for TNF- and ROS-induced apoptosis signaling (9Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF and ROS converge, at least, at the level of MAPK kinase kinase (ASK1). The mechanism by which TNF/ROS activates ASK1 is not fully understood. The identification of proteins associated with ASK1 has provided some insights. ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein that functionally is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. Several cellular factors including thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and 14-3-3 have been reported to interacts with different ASK1 domains and inhibit ASK1 activity (10Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M.

TNF and H2O2 activate ASK1, in part, by dissociating these cellular inhibitors from ASK1. Several ASK1 upstream activators have been also identified. In response to TNF, the C-terminal domain of ASK1 binds to TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and this association is required for ASK1 activation by TRAF2 (5Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 8Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ASK1 binding to TRAF2 may facilitate dissociation of ASK1 from thioredoxin. TRAF2 in turn induces ASK1 oligomerization, leading to autophosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr-845 within the activation loop in the kinase domain (15Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Activated ASK1 subsequently recruits and activates its downstream targets MAP2K (MKK3/7 and MKK4/7) and MAPK (JNK and p38). Thus, ASK1 activation appears to involve several sequential steps including association of upstream activators (such as TRAF2 in response to TNF), release of cellular inhibitors (such as thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, glutathione S-transferase Mu, heat shock proteins, and 14-3-3), ASK1 oligomerization/autophosphorylation at Thr-845, and scaffold protein-mediated association of ASK1 with downstream MKK and JNK (16Matsuura H.

However, the upstream activator mediating H2O2-induced ASK1 activation has not been identified. Protein kinase C (PKC) family has been implicated in the signal transduction pathways regulating a wide range of biological responses, including changes in cell morphology, differentiation, and proliferation (17Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PKC family is divided into three groups (classic (α, β, γ), novel (η, θ, δ, ϵ), and atypical (ζ, λ)), depending on their activation initiated by Ca2+, lipid second messengers, and/or protein activators. PKD, a novel member of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase, differs from PKC by its overall structure, the catalytic domain sequence, and substrate specificity (17Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of PKD contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and lacks the typical autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate motif present in PKCs. Recent studies suggest that PKD is important regulator of different intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, we employed pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA) approaches and identified PKD as a critical upstream mediator in H2O2- but not in TNF-induced ASK1 activation. Furthermore, we showed that 14-3-3 binding of PKD plays critical roles in mediating H2O2-induced ASK1-JNK activation and EC apoptosis.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus confocal microscope, and acquired images were transferred to Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 to generate the final figures. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (21Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ.

Cells after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. For immunoprecipitation to analyze protein interaction in vivo, supernatant of cell lysates was precleared by incubating with normal rabbit serum plus GammaBind plus Sepharose beads on rotator at 4 °C overnight. The lysates were then incubated with the first protein-specific antiserum (e.g. PKD from Cell Signaling) for 2 h with 50 μl of GammaBind plus Sepharose. Immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min followed by 3–5 washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with the second protein (e.g. ASK1)-specific antibody. The chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of FLAG-tagged proteins (ASK1 mutants) and hemagglutinin-tagged proteins (PKD), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-hemagglutinin antibody were used for Western blot, respectively. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-14-3-3 fusion protein preparation and GST pull-down assay were performed as described previously (21Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ.

GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. 400 μg of cell lysates expressing PKD were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μgof GST-14-3-3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose in the lysis buffer. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer before the addition of boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Bound PKD proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with anti-PKD. Adenoviral Expression and Preparation—Replication-deficient adenovirus expressing Myc-tagged ASK1 was described previously (23Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells, purified using CsCl, and titered using cytopathic effect. Infection of 50 m.o.i. of virus resulted in close to 100% of the cells expressing the gene of interest with no signs of toxicity. siRNA Transfection for Knockdown of PKD—We designed PKD siRNA duplex corresponding to bases 519–537 (siRNA1) and bases 534–552 (siRNA2) from the open reading frame of human PKD mRNA (5′-GGGUGUGGUCUGAAUUUACCdTdT-3′ and 5′-GGUCUUAAAUGUGAAGGGUdTdT-3′, respectively). The RNA sequence used as a negative control for siRNA activity was 5′-AAGGGUGAGGUGAAGGCCAdTdT-3′. siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). BAECs of 50–60% confluency were transfected with either control siRNA or PKD siRNA (siRNA1 + siRNA2) (30 nm) with Oligofectamine according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). BAEC media were added 5 h after transfection, and experiments were conducted 48–72 h post-transfection. Quantitation of Cell Survival and Apoptosis—Cell-killing assay was performed as follows. BAEC were cultured on coverslides and treated with H2O2 in the absence or presence of the PKD inhibitors as indicated. Plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove dead floating cells, and total survival cells attached on the slides were counted under microscope. For apoptosis assays, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (2.5 μg/ml) and apoptotic cell (nucleus fragmentation) were counted under a UV microscope (22Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means (±S.D.). For Western blots, kinase activity, and apoptosis and reporter gene assays, experiments were performed at least twice with duplicates. Analysis of densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.60. Results were then normalized for comparison among different experimental groups by arbitrarily setting the value of control cells to 1.0. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView 4.0 package (ABACUS Concepts). Differences were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. The values of p < 0.05 were taken as significant. Pharmacological Inhibitors of PKD Specifically Blunted H2O2- but Not TNF-induced JNK Activation—Although both TNF and H2O2 induce activation of JNK kinase cascades, it is not known whether they utilize distinct intracellular signaling pathways. To dissect the specific signaling pathway by H2O2 in EC, we first determined the effects of a variety of pharmacological inhibitors on H2O2-induced JNK activation. As listed in Table I, Gö6983 inhibits members of the classic and novel PKC (η, θ, δ, ϵ), whereas Gö6976 selectively inhibits the classic PKC (α) and PKD. BAEC were treated with 1 μm Gö6983 or Gö6976 for 60 min prior to treatment with H2O2 (0.5 mm for 30 min) or TNF (10 ng/ml for 15 min). JNK activation was determined by Western blot with a phosphospecific antibody. Gö6983 had no effects on either TNF- or H2O2-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, Gö6976 specifically blocked H2O2- but not TNF-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1a). We then compared staurosporine (which inhibits all PKC isoforms) with calphosptin (which inhibits PKC as well as PKD). Results showed that calphostin but not staurosporine specifically blunted H2O2- but not TNF-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1b). In contrast, JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) blocked both H2O2 and TNF-induced JNK activation (data not shown) (21Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PKD but not PKC might be critical for H2O2-induced JNK activation. H2O2 but Not TNF Specifically Induces Activation of PKD—To determine whether H2O2 induces PKD activation in EC, BAEC were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm) or TNF (10 ng/ml) for various times (0–60 min). PKD activation (phosphorylation at the activation loop Ser-744/748) was determined by Western blot with a phosphospecific antibody (pSer-744/748). As a control, JNK phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (a surrogate marker for NF-κB activation) were also determined. Results showed that TNF induced the activation of JNK and degradation of IκBα but failed to induce PKD activation at any of the times examined (Fig. 2a). In contrast, H2O2 strongly induced activation of PKD as well as JNK, which peaked at 30 min. Consistent with previous reports (25Johnson D.R. Douglas I. Jahnke A. Ghosh S. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), TNF induced degradation of IκBα at 5–15 min and recovered by 60 min. In contrast, H2O2 did not induce IκBα degradation (and subsequent NF-κB activation) in EC (3Bradley J.R. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1598-1609PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined the dose responses of H2O2 (0.1–4 mm for 30 min) and TNF (1–40 ng/ml for 30 min) on PKD activation. TNF failed to induce PKD activation at any of the doses examined. H2O2 maximally activates PKD at 0.5 mm, and higher doses did not further increase PKD phosphorylation (Fig. 2b). H2O2, but Not TNF, Induces Cytoplasmic Translocation of PKD, Leading to Association of PKD with JNK Upstream Activator ASK1—It has been shown that PKD activation involves a variety of translocation depending on stimuli. To determine the effects of H2O2 on PKD translocation, BAEC were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm) for the indicated times (0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min). PKD localization was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-PKD. The majority of PKD is detected on the surface of resting EC. H2O2 treatment induced PKD to undergo a sequential translocation including disappearance from the cytoplasm membrane (at 5–15 min), enrichment in the perinuclear region (at 15 min), and accumulation of PKD in the nucleus (at 30–60 min) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The pattern of PKD translocation in EC is similar to that was observed in Swiss 3T3 cells in response to H2O2 (26Waldron R.T. Rey O. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27482-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF did not induce these translocations of PKD (Fig. 3B). To further determine the specific translocation of PKD, we performed co-localization analyses by staining the cells with anti-PKD, anti-Golgin-97 (a Golgi marker), and DAPI (nuclear staining). As shown in Fig. 3C, co-localization of PKD with Golgin-97 was detected at 15 min, whereas co-localization of PKD with DAPI was detected at 60 min after H2O2 treatment. The cytoplasmic translocation of PKD prompted us to examine whether PKD is co-localized with ASK1, a MAPK kinase kinase implicated in H2O2-induced JNK activation. PKD and Myc-ASK1 were co-transfected into BAEC followed by non-treatment or treatment with H2O2 (0.5 mm for 15 min) when the majority of PKD was in the cytoplasm. Co-localization of PKD and ASK1 was determined by indirect fluorescence microscopy with anti-PKD and anti-Myc (for ASK1). PKD is localized on plasma membrane, whereas ASK1 is in the cytoplasm of resting EC (Fig. 3D, top panel). H2O2 treatment induced significant co-localization of PKD and ASK1 in the cytoplasm (particularly the perinuclear region) but not in the nucleus (Fig. 3D, bottom panel). To determine whether endogenous PKD and ASK1 form a complex in response to H2O2, BAEC were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm) or TNF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min. Association of PKD with ASK1 was determined by a reciprocal immunoprecipitation assay with anti-ASK1 followed by Western blot with anti-PKD and anti-PKD followed by Western blot with anti-ASK1. Results showed that H2O2, but not TNF, induced association of PKD with ASK1 (Fig. 3E). The Kinase Activity and the PH Domain of PKD Are Critical for ASK1 Interaction—To determine whether the kinase activity of PKD is critical for association with ASK1, PKD-WT or PKD-K619W (Fig. 4a) was transfected into BAEC and association of PKD with endogenous ASK1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-ASK1 followed by Western blot with anti-PKD. PKD-WT, but not PKD-K619W, associated with ASK1 (Fig. 4b, KW, a kinase-inactive form with a mutation at Lys-619), suggesting that the kinase activity of PKD is critical for PKD-ASK1 association. Interestingly, a constitutively active form of PKD (PKD-ΔPH with a deletion of the PH domain) also failed to associate with ASK1, indicating that the PH domain of PKD is critical for ASK1 binding (Fig. 4b). Thus, PKD binding to ASK1 requires both its PH domain and its kinase activity. To map the critical domain in ASK1 for PKD binding, FLAG-tagged ASK1 truncates containing the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4c, ASK1-N), the kinase domain (Fig. 4c, ASK1-K), or the N-terminal deletion (Fig. 4c, ASK1-ΔN) was transfected into BAEC. Association of ASK1 proteins with PKD was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-PKD followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG. ASK1-N or ASK1-K did not bind to PKD. However, the association of ASK1-ΔN with PKD was weakly detected in resting cells and was strongly enhanced in response to H2O2 (Fig. 4d). Taken together, H2O2 induced the association of PKD and ASK1 via the PH domain of PKD and the C-terminal domain of ASK1 PKD binding to ASK1. A Critical Role of PKD in Mediating H2O2-induced ASK1 Activation and EC Apoptosis—Association of PKD with ASK1 prompted us to determine the role of PKD in H2O2-induced ASK1 activation. We first examined the effects of PKD inhibitors on H2O2-induced ASK1 activation. BAEC were treated with Gö6976 or Gö6983 for 30 min prior to exposure to H2O2 (0.5 mm for 15 min), and ASK1 activation (phosphorylation at the activation loop Thr-845) was determined by Western blot with a phosphospecific antibody (pThr-845). Similar to JNK activation, H2O2-induced ASK1 activation was specifically blunted by Gö6976 but not by Gö6983 (Fig. 5a), suggesting that ASK1 is a potential downstream effector of PKD in H2O2 signaling. To determine whether Gö6976 also inhibits H2O2-induced EC death (a major effects of ASK1 activation in EC), BAEC were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm for 6 h) in the presence or absence of inhibitor Gö6976 or Gö6983. EC survival rate was determined by counting total survival cells. Results showed that Gö6976 significantly blocked H2O2-induced BAEC death and increased BAEC survival. Gö6983 failed to block (in fact enhanced) H2O2-induced BAEC death, leading to decreased EC survival (Fig. 5b). Gö6976 also significantly blocked ASK1-induced EC death (data not shown). To directly determine the physiological role of PKD in H2O2-induced ASK1-JNK activation and EC apoptosis, we employed siRNA approach to specifically knock down PKD. BAEC were transfected with a control siRNA or siRNA of PKD, and cells were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm for 30 min). Total PKD expression was first determined by Western blot with anti-PKD, and results showed that siRNA of PKD knocked down PKD in BAEC by 80% without any effect on TRAF2 or ASK1 expression (Fig. 5c). However, the activation of ASK1 (pThr-845) and JNK were significantly inhibited by siRNA of PKD (Fig. 5c). To determine the effect of PKD knockdown on H2O2/ASK1-induced EC apoptosis, PKD knock-down cells were induced to undergo apoptosis either by treating with H2O2 (0.5 mm for 4 h) or by overexpressing ASK1 with an adenoviral system. EC apoptosis was also determined characterized by nuclear fragmentation determined by DAPI staining followed by fluorescence microscopy. H2O2-induced EC apoptosis was significantly blunted in PKD knock-down EC compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5d). ASK1-induced EC apoptosis was also"
https://openalex.org/W1989966395,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a serum-derived phospholipid that induces a variety of biological responses in various cells via heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3. LPA-induced cytoskeletal changes are mediated by Rho family small GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. One of these small GTPases, RhoA, may be activated via Gα12/13-linked Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) under LPA stimulation although the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that the C terminus of LPA1 and LPA2 but not LPA3 interact with the PDZ domains of PDZ domain-containing RhoGEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, which are comprised of PDZ, RGS, Dbl homology (DH), and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. In LPA1- and LPA2-transfected HEK293 cells, LPA-induced RhoA activation was observed although the C terminus of LPA1 and LPA2 mutants, which failed to interact with the PDZ domains, did not cause LPA-induced RhoA activation. Furthermore, overexpression of the PDZ domains of PDZ domain-containing RhoGEFs served as dominant negative mutants for LPA-induced RhoA activation. Taken together, these results indicate that formation of the LPA receptor/PDZ domain-containing RhoGEF complex plays a pivotal role in LPA-induced RhoA activation."

Using isogenic cells with defined genetic deficiencies, here we show that in response to intrinsic, extrinsic, and endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli, HCT116 cells show clear-cut apoptotic sensitivities in the order of Bax+/Bak+ > Bax+/Bak– » Bax–/Bak+ » Bax–/Bak–. Small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of Bak in Bax-deficient cells renders HCT116 cells completely resistant to apoptosis induction. Surprisingly, however, Bak knockdown in Bax-expressing cells only slightly affects the apoptotic sensitivities. Bak, like Bax, undergoes the N terminus exposure upon apoptotic stimulation in both Bax-expressing and Bax-deficient cells. Gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that different from Bax, which normally exists as monomers in unstimulated cells and is oligomerized by apoptotic stimulation, most Bak in unstimulated HCT116 cells exists in two distinct protein complexes, one of which contains voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 2. During apoptosis, Bak and Bax form both homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes that still retain some VDAC-2. However, the oligomeric VDAC-2 complexes are diminished, and Bak does not interact with VDAC-2 in Bax-deficient HCT116 cells. These results highlight VDAC-2 as a critical inhibitor of Bak-mediated apoptotic responses.

Bax and Bak are important mediators of cell death as bax/bak double knockout cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic inducers (1Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V.

However, the role of Bak in regulating cancer cell apoptotic sensitivities in the presence or absence of Bax remains incompletely understood.

Establishment of HCT116 Cells Stably Expressing Bak siRNA Using Retroviral Vectors—Three double-stranded 21-nt siRNAs against human bak were initially made using the Silencer™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Their sequences were: bak1 (5′-CTCTGAGTCATAGCGTCGG-3′), bak2 (5′-GGTGAAGTACTCATAGGCA-3′), and bak3 (5′-AAACAGGCTGGTGGCAATC-3′). Preliminary experiments revealed the strongest effect with bak3, and this siRNA was then used in most subsequent experiments. A scrambled sequence (5′-ACAAGAGTCGTGGACGTCA-3′) for bak3 was used as control. To generate stable expression of siRNA, we first cloned the shRNA sequences corresponding to bak3 and the scrambled control into the pSuper.retro retroviral vector (42Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). These vectors were transfected into the Ampho Phoenix packaging cells. 48 h after transfection, the culture medium containing the infectious virions was harvested, filtered (0.2 μm), and directly used to infect HCT116 cells. 48 h later, the cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml), and stable clones were isolated 2–3 weeks later using a cloning ring. Stables clones were analyzed by Western blotting to confirm Bak down-regulation. siRNA Down-regulation of Bak—SiGENOME SMARTpool for Bak (Bak-siRNApool; sequence 1, 5′-CAGAGAAUGCCUAUGAGUAUU-3′; sequence 2, 5′-UAUGAGUACUUCACCAAGAUU-3′; sequence 3, 5′-CAACCGACGCUAUGACUCAUU-3′; and sequence 4, 5′-CGACAUCAACCGACGCUAUUU-3′) and siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA 1 (cont-siRNA; 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′) were obtained from Dharmacon. Cells plated 1 day earlier on 6-well or 10-cm culture dishes to achieve 50–60% confluence were transfected with bak-siRNApool or cont-siRNA (100 nm) by using Lipofectamine. Transfection efficiency was ∼70–80% as determined by using siTOX. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with STS, Fas/CHX, or TG. At the end of treatment, the cells were harvested for apoptosis analysis. Clonogenic Survival Assays—Cells (2 × 105/well) in 6-well tissue culture dishes were transfected with Bak-siRNApool or cont-siRNA and treated with apoptotic stimuli 24 h later. At the end of the treatment, the cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa at room temperature. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were treated and, 15 min prior to the end of the treatment, incubated live with MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos and DAPI to label mitochondria and nuclei, respectively. Then cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunolabeled (39Chandra D. Liu J.W. Tang D.G. J. Biol.

Chemical Cross-linking and Oligomerization Assay—Mitochondria (50 μg) were suspended in 45 μl of HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) followed by addition of freshly prepared bismaleimidohexane to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mitochondria were then mixed in protein sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Dithiothreitol in the sample buffer quenched the cross-linking reaction (3Cheng E.H.-Y. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analyses—HCT116 and HCT116-Bax-KO cells were treated with Fas/CHX, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in HNC buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% CHAPS). The lysates were then loaded onto Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% CHAPS and calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (all obtained from Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0.4 ml/min, and fractions (0.6 ml) were collected using a fast protein liquid chromatography machine. Immunoprecipitation—HCT116 and HCT116-Bax-KO cells (treated or untreated) were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 1mm EGTA, 2% CHAPS, pH 7.4). Cell lysates were first precleared by rabbit or goat (depending on the primary antibody used) IgG-conjugated beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies, i.e. rabbit anti-Bak NT, or goat anti-VDAC-2, respectively, for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of rabbit or goat IgG beads for 1 h. Finally, the beads were centrifuged, washed thoroughly, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed using paired Student's t tests in SPSS software. Bax Deficiency Confers Apoptosis Resistance in HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells That Express Bak—To determine the role of Bak in regulating apoptosis, we first utilized isogenic colon cancer cells HCT116 and HCT116-Bax-KO (22Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) to investigate how Bax deficiency would affect the apoptotic sensitivity. HCT116 cells expressed Bax, whereas HCT116-Bax-KO did not, but both expressed Bak (Fig. 1A). We treated both cells side by side with three intrinsic apoptosis inducers including STS and two DNA-damaging agents (i.e. VP16 or etoposide and x-ray irradiation), one extrinsic apoptosis inducer (i.e. Fas ligation with a cross-linking antibody), and an ER stress inducer (i.e. TG). The results demonstrated that Bax deficiency delayed and inhibited apoptosis (measured by counting apoptotic nuclei) induced by all five stimuli (Table I). For instance, STS treatment for 6 h resulted in >40% apoptosis in HCT116 wild-type cells, whereas it only killed ∼12% HCT116-Bax-KO cells (Table I). STS-induced HCT116 cell death was partially caspase-dependent as evidenced by 1) increased DEVDase activity (Fig. 1E) and 2) inhibition of apoptosis by Z-VAD (Table I). Similarly, when HCT116 cells were challenged with a Fas cross-linking antibody in the presence of CHX, ∼40% cells were killed within 4 h, and the loss of Bax delayed the onset and also decreased the peak level of apoptosis (Table I). The combined treatment of anti-Fas antibody and CHX resulted in the highest level of DEVDase activity, which was inhibited by loss of Bax (Fig. 1E), suggesting that HCT116 cells behave as so-called “type II” cells, in which the death receptor-induced apoptosis requires the mitochondrial activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Not surprisingly, Z-VAD demonstrated an inhibitory effect (Table I).Table IEffect of Bax on apoptotic sensitivities of Bak-expressing cancer cellsTreatmentHCT116Du145TimeBax-KOWild typeTimeMockBaxhh03.5 ± 0.73.6 ± 0.702.9 ± 0.73.6 ± 0.7STS (0.5 μm)611.7 ± 0.7ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.45.2 ± 6.1611.2 ± 4.0bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.19.0 ± 2.31244.0 ± 5.4ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.65.6 ± 4.11217.8 ± 4.3bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.36.0 ± 3.02470.5 ± 4.8ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.90.4 ± 1.52450.0 ± 3.6ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.65.0 ± 4.124 (+ Z-VAD)49.6 ± 4.1cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.58.6 ± 4.4dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.24 (+ Z-VAD)21.0 ± 5.0cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.,ep < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells in the presence of Z-VAD.38.0 ± 5.5cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.02.6 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.403.4 ± 1.49.9 ± 1.2FAS (0.6 μg/ml)/CHX (10 μg/ml)25.8 ± 2.47.7 ± 1.8216.7 ± 2.412.4 ± 3.4411.1 ± 4.3bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.43.6 ± 2.1428.7 ± 3.1ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.45.7 ± 4.1830.8 ± 3.7bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.44.4 ± 1.5884.4 ± 7.386.9 ± 2.38 (+ Z-VAD)7.4±.14cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.4.2 ± 1.2cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.8 (+ Z-VAD)12.1 ± 3.6cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.16.8 ± 3.4cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.03.6 ± 0.74.0 ± 0.502.9 ± 0.63.7 ± 0.7VP16 (50 μm)2418.6 ± 3.2bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.38.3 ± 3.11211.2 ± 4.3ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.30.3 ± 6.14845.3 ± 4.5ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.88.0 ± 2.82423.0 ± 6.5ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.66.5 ± 5.07281.0 ± 2.1ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.93.8 ± 1.93659.0 ± 3.6ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.79.8 ± 5.072 (+ Z-VAD)47.7 ± 4.3dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.46.8 ± 3.4dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.36 (+ Z-VAD)21.0 ± 4.2dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.,ep < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells in the presence of Z-VAD.48.8 ± 3.5dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.03.6 ± 0.74.0 ± 0.503.8 ± 0.55.1 ± 0.5X-rays (7 Gy)4845.2 ± 6.3ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.72.0 ± 2.14821.8 ± 5.5bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.43.0 ± 3.37263.0 ± 5.0ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.87.0 ± 5.07245.4 ± 4.2bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.75.0 ± 4.39675.0 ± 4.7ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.86.0 ± 1.39642.8 ± 6.1bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.72.5 ± 1.303.5 ± 0.73.6 ± 0.702.9 ± 0.63.7 ± 0.7TG (5 μm)128.0 ± 1.1ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.46.0 ± 5.5617.0 ± 3.320.3 ± 2.62420.5 ± 5.0ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.65.4 ± 4.31231.3 ± 4.833.0 ± 4.93649.7 ± 4.6ap < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.84.5 ± 3.32449.0 ± 4.5bp < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.65.0 ± 3.036 (+ Z-VAD)33.0 ± 3.6cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.27.8 ± 5.2cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.24 (+ Z-VAD)15.0 ± 4.2dp < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.,ep < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells in the presence of Z-VAD.35.5 ± 5.2cp < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.a p < 0.01 versus Bax-expressing cells.b p < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells.c p < 0.05 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.d p < 0.01 versus corresponding conditions in the absence of Z-VAD.e p < 0.05 versus Bax-expressing cells in the presence of Z-VAD. Open table in a new tab VP16, a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor used to treat many epithelial cancers, killed nearly all cells within 72 h (Table I). VP16-induced apoptosis was similarly delayed and inhibited in HCT116-Bax-KO cells (Table I). A lack of Bax inhibited DEVDase activity (Fig. 1E), suggesting that VP16-induced apoptosis in these cells involved Bax-mediated caspase activation. Indeed, Z-VAD inhibited apoptosis in both cells (Table I). Another DNA-damaging agent, x-ray irradiation, killed ∼90% HCT116 cells within 72 h (Table I). Bax deficiency also partially inhibited x-ray-induced cell death (Table I). Interestingly, x-ray-induced death in either HCT116 or HCT116-Bax-KO cells was not inhibited by Z-VAD (not shown), suggesting that it might be caspase-independent. In support, DEVDase activity was not detected in either cell type upon irradiation (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, x-ray-induced death in these cells morphologically resembled necrosis (not shown). Finally, when HCT116 cells were stimulated with TG, an irreversible inhibitor of the ER outer membrane pump SERCA whose function is to maintain the concentration of ER Ca2+ several orders of magnitude above that of the cytosol, >40% of the cells died within 12 h, and ∼85% underwent apoptosis by 36 h (Table I). Again, loss of Bax delayed the onset and also decreased the peak level of apoptosis (Table I). As expected, Z-VAD significantly inhibited TG-induced cell death (Table I), and Bax deficiency led to lower DEVDase activity (Fig. 1E). To determine whether the Bax deficiency-conferred resistance is at least partially mediated via decreased release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, we treated HCT116 or HCT116-Bax-KO cells with one extrinsic (i.e. Fas ligation) and one intrinsic (i.e. STS) inducer. As shown in Fig. 1B, the loss of Bax reduced the apoptotic stimuli-induced release of the mitochondrial holocytochrome c, which was detected by an antibody that specifically recognizes holo- but not apo-cytochrome c (39Chandra D. Liu J.W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Altogether, the above results have revealed the following points. First, the loss of Bax delays the apoptosis initiation in that the inhibitory effect of Bax deficiency appears more dramatic at earlier time points (Table I). These observations are consistent with Bax functioning as a critical gateway in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (1Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Second, at later time points, the Bax deficiency-rendered apoptosis resistance is somewhat diminished (Table I), likely because of compensation from Bak (see below). Third, Bax might also play a role in caspase-independent cell death (43Bidere N. Lorenzo H.K. Carmona S. Laforge M. Harper F. Dumont C. Senik A. J. Biol.

In yeast, worms, and flies, this enzyme is essential for viability of the organism. Humans and mice possess two distinct but structurally similar enzymes, NMT1 and NMT2. These two enzymes have similar peptide specificities, but no one has examined the functional importance of the enzymes in vivo. To address this issue, we performed both genetic and biochemical studies. Northern blots with RNA from adult mice and in situ hybridization studies of day 13.5 embryos revealed widespread expression of both Nmt1 and Nmt2. To determine whether the two enzymes are functionally redundant, we generated Nmt1-deficient mice carrying a β-galactosidase marker gene. β-Galactosidase staining of tissues from heterozygous Nmt1-deficient (Nmt1+/–) mice and embryos confirmed widespread expression of Nmt1. Intercrosses of Nmt1+/– mice yielded no viable homozygotes (Nmt1–/–), and heterozygotes were born at a less than predicted frequency. Nmt1–/– embryos died between embryonic days 3.5 and 7.5. Northern blots revealed lower levels of Nmt2 expression in early development than at later time points, a potential explanation for the demise of Nmt1–/– embryos. To explore this concept, we generated Nmt1–/– embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Nmt2 mRNA could be detected in Nmt1–/– ES cells, but the total NMT activity levels were reduced by ∼95%, suggesting that Nmt2 contributes little to total enzyme activity levels in these early embryo cells. The Nmt1–/– ES cells were functionally abnormal; they yielded small embryoid bodies in in vitro differentiation experiments and did not contribute normally to organogenesis in chimeric mice. We conclude that Nmt1 is not essential for the viability of mammalian cells but is required for development, likely because it is the principal N-myristoyltransferase in early embryogenesis.

N-Myristoylation is a lipid modification of proteins that facilitates the targeting of proteins to membrane surfaces. The process is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), 1The abbreviations used are: NMT, N-myristoltransferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ES, embryonic stem; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; E, embryonic day. an enzyme that transfers myristate from myristoyl-coenzyme A to the amino group of an amino-terminal glycine (1Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). There is little doubt that this posttranslational modification is important for eukaryotic cells. NMT is essential for cell viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Duronio R.J. Towler D.A.

Because its activity is essential, NMT has sparked interest as a target for antifungal, antiparasitic, and even anticancer therapy (9Selvakumar P. Pasha M. Ashakumary L. Dimmock J. Sharma R. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation is also required to produce infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1, suggesting that NMT could be a potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 target (10Takamune N. Hamada H. Misumi S. Shoji S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Shiraishi T. Misumi S. Takama M. Takahashi I. Shoji S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mammals (e.g. human, mouse, rat, and cow) and other vertebrates (e.g. chicken, frog, and zebrafish) possess two NMTs, NMT1 and NMT2, which are products of distinct genes (www.ensembl.org/). Human NMT1 and NMT2 are 77% identical at the amino acid level and have similar selectivities for peptide substrates (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The two mouse genes, Nmt1 and Nmt2, encode enzymes that are >95% identical to the human enzymes at the amino acid level (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Why mammals and other higher organisms have two NMTs is not clear. Northern blots comparing the patterns of Nmt1 and Nmt2 expression have not yet been published for either mouse or human, and it is not known whether the two enzymes are functionally redundant in vivo. In this study, we sought to address this issue by creating and characterizing Nmt1 knock-out mice and by analyzing the biochemical and functional properties of an Nmt1-deficient cell line. Nmt1-deficient Mice—A mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line (XE400, strain 129/Ola) with an insertional mutation in Nmt1 was created in a gene-trapping program, BayGenomics (baygenomics.ucsf.edu/). The gene-trapping vector, pGT1lxf, was designed to create an in-frame fusion between the 5′ exons of the trapped gene and a reporter, βgeo (a fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II). Nmt1 spans 13 exons on mouse chromosome 11. The insertional mutation in XE400 occurred in intron 3. Thus, the gene-trapped locus is predicted to yield a fusion transcript containing exons 1–3 of Nmt1 and βgeo. The ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to create chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous (+/–) Nmt1-deficient mice. All mice had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/Ola). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed chow containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Genotyping by Southern Blot and PCR—Genomic DNA (10–20 μg) from tail biopsies, yolk sacs, or embryos was digested with BglI and analyzed by Southern blot with an Nmt1 probe located 3′ of the insertion site. The probe was amplified from mouse genomic DNA with primers 5′-GACCTGTAGTGAGGCCATCC-3′ and 5′-ATTCCACAGGGCAGTGCTAG-3′. The wild-type allele yielded a 17.5-kb band, and the mutant allele yielded a 6.2-kb band. Blastocysts or cellular outgrowths from blastocysts were genotyped by PCR. The cells were lysed in 20 μl of PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/ml gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K) at 56 °C for 1 h and then at 95 °C for 15 min (13Li B. Ruiz J. Chun K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 22: 4997-5005Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PCR contained primer A (5′-CCGAAGGTCCAGAGTTCAAA-3′) and primer B (5′-ATGCCTTTGGGTTGACTCAC-3′), which correspond to sequences upstream and downstream, respectively, of the insertion point, and primer C (5′-CCACAACGGGTTCTTCTGTT-3′), which is specific to pGT1lxf sequences. Genomic DNA (100 ng) and primers A, B, and C (50 ng each) were placed in 10× Titanium PCR buffer (Clontech) containing 0.2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates and 1.25 unit of Taq polymerase (Clontech) for 30 s at 95 °C. After enzymatic amplification for 35 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 68 °C, and 8 min at 72 °C), the PCR products were size-fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Primers A and B amplify a 560-bp band from a wild-type allele; primers A and C amplify a 960-bp fragment from a mutant allele. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (25 μg) isolated from 50–150 mg of mouse tissue with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Two different mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) and mouse embryo poly(A)+ RNA blots (Clontech) were used to determine the distribution of Nmt1 and Nmt2 expression in adult mice and to examine Nmt1 and Nmt2 expression during embryogenesis. [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes were prepared with All-in-One random prime labeling mix (Sigma). Standard pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were used. Bands were visualized by autoradiography (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Imager FX; Bio-Rad). Probes were prepared by PCR. The Nmt1 protein-coding sequences were amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech) with primers 5′-TGTCCGGCTCTCGCAACCCAAGATGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGATACACAGCCAGTGCCCAAA-3′; Nmt2 coding sequences were amplified with primers 5′-AAATAGCCGCCGCGATGGCGGAGG-3′ and 5′-CTATGGACACCTTTAATCCCTCCC-3′. A cDNA probe for the 3′-untranslated region of Nmt1 was amplified with primers 5′-AGTTGCCAGTGAGATTCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCACGAGCTAGGTTTCAGCA-3′; an Nmt2 untranslated region probe was amplified with primers 5′-AGGTGTCCAGGGACAGACTC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCACTCAACTTGTGCTTTT-3′. A β-galactosidase cDNA probe was amplified from Nmt1+/– mouse liver RNA with primers 5′-TTTTCGATGAGCGTGGTGGTTATGC-3′ and 5′-GCGCGTACATCGGGCAAATAATATC-3′. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as a control. In Situ Hybridization—Sectioning of mouse embryos was performed according to techniques described on the BayGenomics web site (baygenomics.ucsf.edu/), and in situ hybridization studies with 33P-labeled Nmt1 and Nmt2 riboprobes were performed as described previously (14Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 255: 361-373Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Assay of Total NMT Activity—Total NMT activity levels were measured as described previously (15Raju R.V.S. Datla R.S.S. Sharma R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16King M. Sharma R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To produce [3H]myristoyl-CoA, a mixture of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm lithium CoA, 1 μm [3H]myristic acid (7.5 μCi), and 0.3 unit/ml Pseudomonas acyl-CoA synthetase (total volume, 200 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The efficiency of [3H]myristate conversion to [3H]myristoyl-CoA was generally >95%. Assays of total NMT activity contained a mixture of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.45 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, a phosphorylated, activated phosphoprotein 60-M (pp60src) peptide substrate (GSSKSKPKR, 500 μm), and a source of NMT in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding freshly generated [3H]myristoyl-CoA, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by spotting 15-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose paper discs and drying under a stream of warm air. The discs were washed in two changes of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, for 60 min. The radioactivity was quantified in 7.5 ml of Beckman Ready Safe Liquid Scintillation mixture in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. One unit of NMT activity was defined as 1 pmol of myristoylpeptide formed per minute. β-Galactosidase Staining—Mice were anesthetized with avertin and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 h at 4 °C, immersed in 30% glucose for 16 h at 4 °C, and frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) for sectioning. β-Galactosidase activity was assessed by incubating 10-μm-thick sections with 1.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 37 °C. After counterstaining with eosin Y (Sigma), the sections were examined and photographed with an Eclipse 600 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a Spot RT Slider digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Isolation of Homozygous Nmt1-deficient ES Cells—Nmt1+/– ES cells were seeded onto a 100-mm gelatin-coated Petri dish in ES cell medium (baygenomics.ucsf.edu/) and grown for 24 h. A high concentration of G418 (5.0 mg/ml) was added, and the concentration was gradually increased to 12.0 mg/ml. After 7–10 days, single colonies were picked and grown in individual wells of a 96-well plate for 5–7 days. Cell lines were genotyped by both Southern blot and PCR. In parallel control studies, homozygous mutant ES cell lines were created from an ES cell line with a mutation in Lmna (the gene encoding prelamin A and lamin C). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from wild-type blastocysts with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality and quantity of the RNA were assessed with spectrometry and by examining the RNA on an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel. To generate first-strand cDNA, total RNA (1.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 2 h. Ten ng of cDNA was used for each real-time PCR. Primer and probe sets from Applied Biosystems (Nmt1, Mm00500829_m1; Nmt2, Mm00476437_g1) were used to quantify Nmt1 and Nmt2 expression. A real-time PCR assay for GAPDH was used for normalization (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 15-s denaturation at 95 °C and 60-s annealing at 60 °C. All assays were performed in triplicate and normalized against GAPDH. The results are expressed as relative gene expression with the 2–ΔΔCT method (17Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Analysis of Nmt1–/– ES Cells—The number of chromosomes in Nmt1–/– and the parental Nmt1+/+ ES cells was counted (18Cronmille C. Mintz B. Dev. Biol. 1978; 67: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Mcburney M. Rogers B. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Nmt1–/– ES cells could differentiate into beating heart cells, Nmt1–/– ES cells were diluted in ES cell medium (25,000 cells/ml) and then pipetted in 20-μl droplets into a 96-well V-bottomed polypropylene plate (EK-21261; lids, EK26161; E&K Scientific Plates). The plates were flipped gently with one smooth motion and placed upside down in a 37 °C incubator with 7% CO2 for 2–3 days. The plates were then flipped right-side up, and differentiation medium (1× Glasgow minimal essential medium/BHK21 medium, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 20% fetal bovine serum, and a 1:1000 dilution of a β-mercaptoethanol stock solution (70 μl in 20 ml of water)) was added to each well (200 μl/well). The cells were grown right-side up at 37 °C for 3 days. On day 5, 100 μl of medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. On day 7, the embryoid bodies were transferred to gelatin-coated tissue culture plates and cultured for 21 days; the medium was changed every 2–3 days. Differentiated Nmt1–/– embryoid bodies were photographed and analyzed with an AXIO Vert2000 microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). In addition to these in vitro differentiation experiments, Nmt1–/– ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. Nmt1 and Nmt2 are expressed in a wide variety of adult mouse tissues, as judged by Northern blots (Fig. 1). In situ hybridization studies on mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 13.5 revealed widespread expression of Nmt1 in multiple tissues, for example in the liver, lung, and neural tube (Fig. 2). Nmt2 was also expressed in these same tissues, although the level of expression was consistently lower (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Patterns of Nmt1 and Nmt2 expression in E13.5 mouse embryos, as judged by in situ hybridization with 33P-labeled Nmt1 and Nmt2 riboprobes.

A PCR genotyping approach was developed (Fig. 3B), which was particularly useful for genotyping blastocysts. The mutation introduced a new BglI site, facilitating Southern blot genotyping (Fig. 3C). As predicted, the insertional mutation resulted in the production of an Nmt1-βgeo fusion transcript (Fig. 3D). Nmt1 mRNA levels in Nmt1+/– mice were approximately one-half of those in wild-type controls. Full-length Nmt1 transcripts were undetectable in Nmt1–/– ES cells (Fig. 3E). Because NMT is an essential enzymatic activity in yeast (2Duronio R.J. Towler D.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Science. 1989; 243: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we predicted that Nmt2 would be expressed in the Nmt1–/– ES cells. Indeed, Nmt2 expression was detectable by Northern blot after a long exposure (36 h) (Fig. 3E). Nmt1+/– mice were normal in terms of weight, growth rate, and appearance; we observed no postnatal deaths in these mice. X-gal staining of tissues from adult Nmt1+/– mice revealed widespread expression of Nmt1 (Fig. 4). In the brain, β-galactosidase expression was largely confined to neurons and was prominent in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The facial nucleus in the medulla and the gray matter of the spinal cord also stained intensely. β-Galactosidase expression was identified in hepatocytes, renal tubular cells, and cardiac myocytes. Because the specificities of NMT1 and NMT2 for peptide substrates are similar (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and because the expression patterns of Nmt1 and Nmt2 are similar in adult mice and E13.5 embryos (Figs. 1 and 2), we predicted that the two genes would play entirely redundant roles and that Nmt1–/– mice would be viable and phenotypically normal. This prediction was not upheld. In genotyping 247 offspring of Nmt1+/– intercrosses by Southern blot, we identified 121 Nmt1+/+ mice, 126 Nmt1+/– mice, and no Nmt1–/– mice. Interestingly, Nmt1+/– mice were born less frequently than predicted by Mendelian genetics (p < 0.01, χ2 test). Thus, heterozygous Nmt1 deficiency adversely affected survival. Additional genotyping revealed a complete absence of Nmt1–/– embryos at E7.5, E8.5, E11.5, E15.5, and E17.5 (data not shown), indicating that Nmt1 is essential for development. Not surprisingly, β-galactosidase was expressed at high levels in multiple tissues of Nmt1+/– embryos at E13.5, including the central nervous system, heart, lung, and liver (Fig. 5A). Strong β-galactosidase expression was also identified in embryos at E6.5 (data not shown). Although Nmt1–/– embryos were absent at E7.5, we identified 5 Nmt1–/– blastocysts (E3.5) among 31 that were genotyped. When placed in culture, both Nmt1–/– and Nmt1+/+ blastocysts yielded cellular outgrowths (Fig. 5B). One potential explanation for the demise of Nmt1–/– embryos is that Nmt1 is the “main NMT” early in mouse development. In line with this concept, Nmt1 expression was 6.76 ± 0.37-fold higher in wild-type 3.5-day mouse embryos (blastocysts) than Nmt2 expression, relative to GAPDH, as judged by TaqMan real-time PCR. In addition, Nmt1 expression was higher at E7 than at E11 and E15, as judged by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6). Nmt2 expression was relatively low at E7 and then increased gradually (Fig. 6). To further explore the issue of Nmt1 expression in early embryo cells, we isolated Nmt1–/– ES cells from Nmt1+/– ES cells by selection in high concentrations of G418 (20Mortensen R. Conner D. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The Nmt1–/– cells, like the parental Nmt1+/– ES cells, had a normal chromosome count (n = 40). Based on the Northern blot studies, we predicted that the majority of the NMT activity in these early embryonic cells might result from the expression of Nmt1 rather than Nmt2. If so, one would expect to observe much lower levels of enzymatic activity in Nmt1–/– cells than in Nmt1+/+ ES cells. Indeed, this was the case (Fig. 7). NMT activity levels were intermediate in Nmt1+/– cells (Fig. 7). To assess the functional capabilities of Nmt1–/– ES cells, we assessed their ability to differentiate into beating cardiac myocytes in embryoid bodies in vitro. Nmt1–/– ES cells yielded embryoid bodies (Fig. 8A) that stained brightly for β-galactosidase (Fig. 8B). However, the embryoid bodies and the area of beating heart cells within them were smaller with Nmt1–/– ES cells than with Nmt1+/+ ES cells (Fig. 8, C and D). Because Nmt1 is obviously required for mouse development, we suspected that the Nmt1–/– ES cells, when injected into blastocysts, might be defective in populating the tissues of the chimeric mice. The mice (n > 40) generated from blastocysts that had been injected with Nmt1–/– ES cells exhibited minimal evidence of chimerism, as judged by coat color. Moreover, β-galactosidase staining of 1-day-old pups from the injected blastocysts revealed a complete absence of β-galactosidase expression in the brain, lung, and liver (tissues that normally exhibit strong β-galactosidase staining in Nmt1+/– mice). However, the injected blastocysts did indeed yield chimeras because we identified β-galactosidase staining in enterocytes in every pup that was examined (n = 8) (Fig. 9). In parallel control experiments, high G418 selection was used to produce euploid ES cells that were homozygous for a mutant Lmna allele. Lmna is not essential for embryonic development (21Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Unlike the Nmt1–/– ES cells, the homozygous Lmna ES cells consistently yielded 80–90% chimeric mice. The fact that N-myristoylation of proteins is important in eukaryotes is beyond dispute. Yeast, fungi, flies, worms, trypanosomes, and Leishmania cannot survive without the enzyme that carries out this protein modification (2Duronio R.J. Towler D.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I.

However, in mammals as well as several other vertebrates, two distinct N-myristoyltransferases exist (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the two human enzymes have similar peptide specificities and kinetic properties (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it has remained mysterious whether the enzymes are entirely redundant or whether one enzyme might play a unique, vital role in vivo. In the current study, we provide new insights into that issue, demonstrating that Nmt1 is essential for mouse development. Homozygous Nmt1-deficient mice died between 3.5 and 7.5 days of embryonic development. This result was unexpected, not just because of the similar properties of the two enzymes (12Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but also because the tissue-specific expression patterns of the enzymes are similar, as judged by Northern blots and in situ hybridization studies of mouse embryos (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, only about one-half of the heterozygous Nmt1-deficient mice survived. The demise of significant numbers of heterozygous knock-out mice has been observed previously with mutations in other essential genes, for example Apob (22Huang L. Voyiaziakis E. Markenson D. Sokol K. Hayek T. Breslow J. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 5152-5161Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Cul-4A (13Li B. Ruiz J. Chun K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 22: 4997-5005Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Nmt1 knock-out mice were generated with an ES cell line containing an insertional mutation in intron 3 of Nmt1. A theoretical concern with gene trap mutations is that the splicing machinery might “splice around” the entire insertion, leading to the production of low levels of a wild-type transcript. In the case of the mutant Nmt1 ES cell line, this did not occur, because we were unable to find any full-length Nmt1 transcripts in Nmt1–/– ES cells by Northern blot, even on long exposures. The insertion of the gene trap vector led to the production of a fusion transcript (consisting of a small segment of Nmt1 and βgeo), which could be detected by Northern blot. The production of the Nmt1-βgeo fusion protein was fortunate because it made it possible for us to assess Nmt1 expression in tissue sections with X-gal stains. The fusion protein would not be predicted to retain any NMT enzymatic activity, inasmuch as it would lack important functional domains of NMT, for example regions that bind the protein substrate and myristoyl-CoA (23Raju R. Anderson J. Datla R. Sharma R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Raju R. Datla R. Warrington R. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14928-14936Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Why would Nmt1 be essential for development, given that a similar gene (Nmt2) exists within the genome? It seems unlikely that Nmt1 is simply required for cell viability, as it is in yeast, given that we had no difficulty in isolating Nmt1–/– ES cells. Those ES cells that expressed Nmt2 retained the capacity to differentiate into enterocytes in chimeric mice. A more attractive explanation is that Nmt1 is simply “the main Nmt enzyme” early in embryonic development. By Northern blot, Nmt2 expression was lower at E7 than at later time points, whereas Nmt1 expression was strong at E7. In addition, Nmt2 was expressed at far lower levels than Nmt1 in wild-type blastocysts (E3.5), as judged by real-time PCR. Also, total enzymatic activity levels were quite low in the Nmt1–/– ES cells, suggesting that Nmt2 contributes minimally to enzyme activity levels in those cells. The Nmt1–/– ES cells created within this study were functionally defective, lacking the capacity to contribute to the formation of organs in which Nmt1 is normally expressed at high levels (e.g. brain, liver, and lung). The ES cell clone used to create the Nmt1 knock-out mice was produced by BayGenomics, one of the gene-trapping programs that form the International Gene Trap Consortium (www.igtc.org.uk/). Thus far, the International Gene Trap Consortium lists ∼27,000 mutant ES cell lines covering ∼32% of the ∼30,000 mouse genes (25Skarnes W. von Melchner H. Wurst W. Hicks G. Nord A. Cox T. Young S. Ruiz P. Soriano P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Within BayGenomics, we have documented that the likelihood of trapping a particular mouse gene is directly correlated to the size of the gene and its level of expression in ES cells. 2B. Conklin, A. Nord, W. Skarnes, and S. G. Young, unpublished observations. Thus, large genes and genes expressed at high levels in ES cells are more likely to be trapped than small genes and genes that are expressed at low levels in ES cells. The preference for larger genes makes perfect sense, inasmuch as they provide a greater opportunity for the random gene-trapping insertional event. Trapping of highly expressed genes also makes sense because the generation of a drug-resistant ES cell colony depends on the expression of βgeo, which is driven by the promoter of the trapped gene. Of note, Nmt2 is ∼5 kb longer than Nmt1, so by that criterion, one would expect Nmt2 to be trapped by the International Gene Trap Consortium more often than Nmt1. However, as we showed, NMT activity levels are quite low in Nmt1–/– cells, suggesting that Nmt1 might normally be expressed more highly in ES cells than Nmt2. If so, one would predict that Nmt1 would have been trapped by the IGTC much more frequently than Nmt2. Indeed, this has been the case: Nmt1 has been trapped 12 times, whereas Nmt2 has never been trapped. We thank S. Ordway and G. Howard for comments on the manuscript."

In the current study, the regulation of NAG-1 expression in LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was examined. TPA treatment increased NAG-1 protein and mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner as well as NF-κB binding/transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. Pretreatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor blocked the TPA-induced increase in NAG-1 protein levels and NF-κB binding/transcriptional activity, whereas an inhibition of p38, JNK, MEK activity had no effect on TPA-induced NAG-1 levels and NF-κB transcriptional activity. Expression of constitutively active PKCs induced an increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity and NAG-1 protein levels in LNCaP cells. The expression of NF-κB p65 induced NAG-1 promoter activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay for p65 showed that NF-κB binds the NAG-1 promoter in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of TPA-induced NAG-1 expression by NAG-1 short interfering RNA blocked TPA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, suggesting induction of NAG-1 negatively affects LNCaP cell survival. These results demonstrate that NAG-1 expression is up-regulated by TPA in LNCaP cells through a PKC-dependent pathway involving the activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2119560251,"The γ subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, a 7-kDa single-span membrane protein, is a member of the FXYD gene family. Several FXYD proteins have been shown to bind to Na,K-ATPase and modulate its properties, and each FXYD protein appears to alter enzyme kinetics differently. Different results have sometimes been obtained with different experimental systems, however. To test for effects of γ in a native tissue environment, mice lacking a functional γ subunit gene (Fxyd2) were generated. These mice were viable and without observable pathology. Prior work in the mouse embryo showed that γ is expressed at the blastocyst stage. However, there was no delay in blastocele formation, and the expected Mendelian ratios of offspring were obtained even with Fxyd2–/– dams. In adult Fxyd2–/– mouse kidney, splice variants of γ that have different nephron segment-specific expression patterns were absent. Purified γ-deficient renal Na,K-ATPase displayed higher apparent affinity for Na+ without significant change in apparent affinity for K+. Affinity for ATP, which was expected to be decreased, was instead slightly increased. The results suggest that regulation of Na+ sensitivity is a major functional role for this protein, whereas regulation of ATP affinity may be context-specific. Most importantly, this implies that γ and other FXYD proteins have their effects by local and not global conformation change. Na,K-ATPase lacking the γ subunit had increased thermal lability. Combined with other evidence that γ participates in an early step of thermal denaturation, this indicates that FXYD proteins may play an important structural role in the enzyme complex.

The γ subunit of Na,K-ATPase (γ, FXYD2) is a single-span membrane protein that is thought to regulate the Na,K-ATPase by modifying its kinetic properties. It is a member of a family of related proteins that have a 35-amino acid stretch of homology, including the transmembrane span and residues on both sides of the membrane. The homologous stretch has 7 invariant and 16 highly conserved amino acids, and it begins with the shared sequence motif Pro-Phe-X-Tyr-Asp that gives the family its name (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Five members of this family have been shown to interact with Na,K-ATPase so far.

Hypertonicity stress-induced expression of the γa splice variant decreases Vmax of Na,K-ATPase, and the effect is blocked by silencing γ expression with small interfering RNA (23Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus γ appears to be an accessory protein that modulates the enzyme's properties, but a surprising variety of specific effects has been reported. Other FXYD proteins have different effects on Na,K-ATPase properties. Phospholemman (FXYD1) has been reported to decrease apparent Na+ affinity like γ, but so far this has been observed only in oocytes (24Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It also causes a small decrease in intrinsic affinity for K+, without major effect of membrane potential or competition by extracellular Na+. In phospholemman knock-out mice, its absence resulted in reduced Vmax without a major effect on Na+ affinity (3Jia L.-J. Donnet C. Bogaev R.C. Blatt R.J. McKinney C.E. Day K.H. Berr S.S. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Sweadner K.J. Tucker A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1982-H1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Antibodies also reduced Na,K-ATPase activity, consistent with a role as an activator (25Feschenko M.S. Donnet C. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Jones L.R. Sweadner K.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2161-2169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholemman regulation of pump activity also entails phosphorylation (26Fuller W. Eaton P. Bell J.R. Shattock M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Silverman B.D. Fuller W. Eaton P. Deng J. Moorman J.R. Cheung J.Y. James A.F. Shattock M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CHIF (FXYD4) increases the Na,K-ATPase affinity for Na+, the opposite of the effects of γ and phospholemman, apparently without effects on Vmax, affinity for ATP, or shifts in conformation (15Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O.

Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CHIF has no effect on the intrinsic affinity for K+; however, it greatly increases its sensitivity to competition by extracellular Na+, with the consequence that apparent K+ affinity is reduced in physiological conditions (15Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). FXYD7 has a different effect; it decreases intrinsic K+ affinity. Like phospholemman but different from CHIF, this was without extracellular Na+ competition or an effect of membrane potential. FXYD7 was also without effect on intracellular Na+ affinity (20Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Beguin P. Crambert G.

Phospholemman-like shark protein, a FXYD protein found in dogfish shark salt gland, is proposed to have yet a different effect, an inhibition that is relieved by kinase-mediated phosphorylation (30Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A.B. Cutler C.P. Meischke L.

Apparently the Na,K-ATPase αβ complex is a highly plastic target of FXYD proteins, in that so many different kinds of kinetic effects have been seen. It is also curious that in the case of phospholemman and γ, different results have been observed with different experimental approaches. For example, although the effects of γ on affinity for ATP have been extensively documented in HeLa cells (14Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Examination of the basic properties of Na,K-ATPase from a γ knock-out mouse kidney is a potential way to determine which of the reported functional effects can be detected in the native membrane environment. The exceptional plasticity of Na,K-ATPase kinetics in association with different FXYD proteins also raises the question whether FXYD proteins are accessory proteins or subunits. Prior work suggested that they are not indispensable, but our present results concerning the thermal sensitivity of mouse renal Na,K-ATPase without γ suggest that the FXYD protein does play a structural role. All procedures involving mice were consistent with the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals promulgated by the American Physiological Society and were carried out using protocols approved by the Animal Use Subcommittee of the Department of Animal Care and Veterinary Services of the University of Western Ontario. Targeted Disruption of the Fxyd2 Gene—A genomic Fxyd2 clone (AY035583), previously isolated from a strain 129/Sv mouse genomic library (12Jones D.H. Golding M.C. Barr K.J. Fong G.-H. Kidder G.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 6: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was used to build the targeting construct. A 5.2-kb PstI-Asp7001 fragment was subcloned into a pBKS vector containing a lacZ reporter gene before cloning these two segments together into a pPNT vector with a neoR cassette, 1.5 kb of 3′ homologous Fxyd2 sequence, and an hsvtk cassette. Most of exon 4 containing the sequence coding for the transmembrane domain and a portion of intron 4 were thereby deleted in the targeting vector (see Fig. 1). The lacZ sequence included a nuclear localization signal to concentrate the enzyme in cell nuclei and was preceded by an internal ribosome entry site. The targeting construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into the R1 line of strain 129 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Targeted clones were doubly selected with G418 (250 μg/ml geneticin, Invitrogen) and ganciclovir (2 μm Cytovene, Hoffmann-La Roche). Resistant clones were collected and screened by PCR (neo1–5′ primer, GCTTGCCGAATATCATGGTGGA; gamgen1–3′ primer, ACATGGTGGCAGACAGAAGTG) to identify homologous recombinants. Two such clones were confirmed by HindIII digestion and Southern blotting using the 5′ probe (Fig. 1). Targeted ES cells from both clones were aggregated with strain CD1 mouse morulae to obtain chimeras. Male chimeras were mated with CD1 females to obtain Fxyd2+/– mice that were intercrossed to generate homozygous offspring. To verify that the recombinant allele had the expected structure, overlapping segments of the γ gene from an Fxyd2–/– pup were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Subsequently, offspring were genotyped by PCR amplification of earpunch DNA taken at weaning. Primers used for identifying the wild type allele were Fxyd2G-3′ (CTGTGCTGGACTGGGGACAT) and Fxyd2G-5′ (GCAACTGTGGGGGCAGAG). To identify the mutant allele, the neo1–5′ primer (above) was used in conjunction with the Fxyd2G-3′ primer. Analysis of Preimplantation Development—Fxyd2+/– females (mixed 129/CD1 background) were superovulated with 5 IU of serum gonadotropin from pregnant mares (from the National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA) and 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma), as described previously (32MacPhee D.J. Barr K.J. De Sousa P.A. Todd S.D.L. Kidder G.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The females were mated with heterozygous males of the same genetic background. The females were killed on day 4 of pregnancy (91 h post-human chorionic gonadotropin) by cervical dislocation following CO2 anesthesia. Their reproductive tracts were removed and flushed to recover preimplantation embryos as described (32MacPhee D.J. Barr K.J. De Sousa P.A. Todd S.D.L. Kidder G.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using flushing medium containing 0.2 mm glucose. The embryos were immediately sorted into separate pools according to developmental progress (cavitating versus noncavitating). Cavitating embryos were processed for single embryo PCR genotyping as described previously (33De Sousa P.A. Juneja S.C. Caveney S. Houghton F.D. Davies T.C. Reaume A.G. Rossant J. Kidder G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the Fxyd2G5′, Fxyd2G3′, and neo1–5′ primers described above. Noncavitating embryos were cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C in potassium-augmented simplex optimization medium (34Erbach G.T. Lawitts J.A. Papaioannou V.E. Biggers J.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) for another 10–20 h to assess their ability to form blastocysts before they were processed for genotyping. Western Blot—Peptide-directed antibodies against the shared C-terminal end of γ (RCT-G1 (13Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) and against the splice variant N-terminal end of γb (RNGB (9Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) were used. To detect Na,K-ATPase α subunit, we used anti-KETYY (gift of Dr. Jack Kyte, University of California, San Diego). Electrophoresis was on SDS-Tricine gels of 12.5% polyacrylamide (35Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar), and detection was with chemiluminescence. Cytology—For staining of β-galactosidase activity expressed in the knock-out mice, tissues were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 0.2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PIPES buffer, pH 6.9, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm EGTA. They were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then embedded in frozen section medium (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ). Five μm sections were cut on the cryostat, and slides were stored at –70 °C until use. The slides were post-fixed on ice for 10 min in 0.2% paraformaldehyde and rinsed twice with PBS and then with detergent solution (0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.3). Staining was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and X-gal (1 mg/ml). The slides were washed in PBS, counterstained with 1% eosin for 1 min, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount. Immunofluorescence detection of γ and α subunits was performed as described elsewhere in more detail (10Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F531-F545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cryostat sections of paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate-fixed kidneys were treated with SDS for antigen retrieval (36Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Tilly A.S. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and then stained with rabbit antibodies RCT-G1 against the C terminus or RNGB against the γb splice variant or with monoclonal antibody 6F against Na,K-ATPase α1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Detection was with Cy-3 (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were collected on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 scanning laser confocal system. Analysis of Na,K-ATPase from Mutant Kidneys—Isolation of membranes and purification of Na,K-ATPase from mouse kidney (cortex plus outer medulla) was performed by the Jorgensen procedure (37Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasma membrane-enriched fraction was collected by differential centrifugation, followed by treatment with 0.56 mg of SDS/mg of protein to extract contaminating proteins, and then equilibrium density centrifugation on sucrose gradients. Purified rat renal medulla Na,K-ATPase was prepared by the same method but starting with dissected outer medulla only, and was used as a positive control on immunoblots. ATP hydrolysis reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in medium buffered with 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4, with 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm Tris-ATP, and either 3 or 4 mm MgCl2 as indicated, with and without 3 mm ouabain. Ouabain-sensitive Pi release was measured colorimetrically (17Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10162-10172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as a function of Na+ concentration (0–30 mm) at 20 mm K+, or as a function of K+ concentration (0–20 mm) at 120 mm Na+, in 3 mm MgCl2. ATP activation curves (0–1.6 mm) were obtained in the complete assay buffer above with 4 mm MgCl2. When measuring apparent affinity for ATP, care was taken that no more than 5% of the ATP was hydrolyzed during the assay. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Sigma Plot Graph System 4.01 (Jandel Scientific). Na+ and K+ activation curves were fitted according to the Hill model for ligand binding. Km values for ATP were derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation, also by nonlinear regression. Student's t test was used to assess the significance of differences. Five different preparations each from wild type and knock-out were analyzed. Specific activities of ATP hydrolysis ranged from 600 to 1,100 μmol/h/mg protein. Measurement of Na+, K+, and Mg2+ in Urine—Twenty four-hour urine samples were collected from mice 6 to 12 weeks of age housed singly in metabolic cages (Nalgene, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Urine electrolytes were analyzed by the Trace Elements Laboratory, London Laboratory Services Group, London, Ontario, Canada, using a Finnigan MAT element high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Urine creatinine was assayed using a reagent set and standard from Point Scientific Inc., Lincoln Park, MI. Briefly, the picric acid and surfactant reagents were mixed with the buffer reagent as per the kit instructions, prewarmed to 37 °C, and added to cuvettes. Sample (urine diluted in water) or standard was added to the cuvette, mixed, and the time zero absorbance at 510 nm read. After exactly 60 s, the absorbance was read again, and the difference in the absorbance readings was used to create values for the standard curve in the case of standards or to determine concentrations for samples. Urine electrolyte levels were expressed with respect to urine creatinine to correct for variation because of evaporation during the collection interval. Samples were stored at –20 °C until a sufficient number had been collected, and then all were analyzed at once. The data were tested for statistical significance by single factor analysis of variance. No significant differences were noted between male and female mice; hence the data from the two sexes were combined. Thermostability Assay—Purified enzyme from kidney of either Fxyd2–/– or wild type mice was diluted to a concentration of 5 μg/ml in a buffer (ATPase assay reaction mixture without ATP) containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4, and incubated for 60 min at three different sets of temperatures as follows: 4, 37, and 41 °C. Subsequently, the samples were kept on ice prior to the ATPase activity assay, which was performed at 37 °C as described above, but was started with the addition of 3 mm ATP. Na,K-ATPase activity was defined as the ouabain-sensitive difference in Pi release/mg of protein/h. Production of Mice Lacking γ Subunits—The γ subunit is encoded by a single gene (designated Fxyd2) belonging to the FXYD family (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). There are two γ subunit splice variants in rat and human with different N-terminal amino acid sequences (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E.

https://openalex.org/W1981634943,"RAS oncogenes play a major role in cancer development by activating an array of signaling pathways, most notably mitogen-activated protein kinases, resulting in aberrant proliferation and inhibition of apoptotic signaling cascades, rendering transformed cells resistant to extrinsic death stimuli. However, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is able to kill specific tumor cells through the engagement of its receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5), and the activation of apoptotic pathways, providing promising targets for anticancer therapies. In this study, we show that TRAIL induces cell death in human colon adenocarcinoma cells in a MEK-dependent manner. We also report a prolonged MEK-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and increased c-FOS expression induced by TRAIL in this system. Our study reveals that transformation of the colon cell line Caco-2 by Ki- and mainly by Ha-ras oncogenes sensitizes these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by causing specific MEK-dependent up-regulation of DR4 and DR5. These observations taken together reveal that RAS-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway can sensitize cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by up-regulating DR4 and DR5 and overall imply that TRAIL-based therapeutic strategies using TRAIL agonists could be used in cases of human colon cancers bearing RAS mutations.

The initiating mutagenic changes in the genome producing an early adenoma from normal colonic mucosa may provide a favorable environment (i.e. increased replication rate, increased survival signals, and alterations of the DNA repair mechanisms) for other mutations to occur. In this way, they traverse from early to intermediate to late adenoma and finally adopt a malignant phenotype, as characterized by the multi-stage carcinogenesis model (1Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 138-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Avoidance of apoptosis is a basic event that occurs during carcinogenesis. Changes in the apoptotic program and/or activation of the antiapoptotic pathways are key events allowing progression through various stages of carcinogenesis (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

TRAIL can also bind to the decoy receptors, the role of which remains to be identified (3Ichikawa K. Liu W. Zhao L. Wang Z. Liu D. Ohtsuka T. Zhang H. Mountz J.D. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R.P. Zhou T.

The latter two are incapable of transducing the signal because they either do not contain a death domain or contain a truncated death domain. TRAIL ligation to its functional receptors leads to recruitment of the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to the cytoplasmic region of the receptor (8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

At this level, procaspases undergo autocatalytic processing to be activated, leading to the activation of the effector caspases (11Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B.

It has been shown that incubation with TRAIL can activate a positive feedback loop causing the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 (17Shetty S. Gladden J.B. Henson E.S. Hu X. Villanueva J. Haney N. Gibson S.B. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that can potentially render the cells more sensitive to TRAIL in a time-dependent manner. Activation of AP-1 (18Guan B. Yue P. Lotan R. Sun S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3121-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) can lead to TRAIL-R1 up-regulation. Similarly TRAIL-R2 has been shown to be up-regulated through NFκB (17Shetty S. Gladden J.B. Henson E.S. Hu X. Villanueva J. Haney N. Gibson S.B. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results taken together allow us to assume that molecules not directly implicated in the TRAIL pathway play an important role in the regulation of TRAIL receptor expression. Considering the limitations of the current therapies in targeting cancer cells only, TRAIL provides an attractive target for cancer therapy (19Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Currently preclinical studies using soluble recombinant TRAIL derivatives, as well as monoclonal antibodies mimicking TRAIL effects, induce apoptosis in a broad range of human cancer cells and tumor regression in mice without significant systemic toxicity (4Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAIL can complement current strategies because it can render death sensitivity to tumors by its synergistic action with chemotherapeutic drugs or UV treatment (20Belka C. Schmid B.

RAS genes play a very important role in the development of human cancer. Activating mutations in the three best studied RAS genes, Ha-RAS, Ki-RAS, and N-RAS, have been detected in a large variety of human tumors (22Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in mice that are genetically modified to express ras oncogenes have very clearly shown that activated Ras promotes the initiation, progression, and maintenance of several types of tumors (23Chin L. Tam A. Pomerantz J. Wong M. Holash J. Bardeesy N. Shen Q. O'Hagan R. Pantginis J. Zhou H. Horner J.W. Cordon-Cardo C. Yancopoulos G.D. DePinho R.A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Activating Ki-RAS mutations are found in about 50% of colon carcinomas. Activated RAS mediates its biological activity through interaction with various downstream effector targets, thus activating pathways like MEK, PI3K, and Rho GTPases. RAS regulates a RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 kinase cascade. The MEK pathway has been shown to be active in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (25Plattner R. Gupta S. Khosravi-Far R. Sato K.Y. Perucho M. Der C.J. Stanbridge E.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as in human colorectal tumors (26Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The activated ERK1/2 translocate to the nucleus and regulate the expression of target genes like c-FOS and/or FRA-1 (27Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 28Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis very often is mediated by up-regulation of TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 (29Nimmanapalli R. Perkins C.L. Orlando M. O'Bryan E. Nguyen D. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 759-763PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of DR4 and DR5 has been found elevated in human colonic carcinomas as compared with normal colonic mucosa (30Koornstra J.J. Kleibeuker J.H. van Geelen C.M. Rijcken F.E. Hollema H. de Vries E.G. de Jong S. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); we aimed to pinpoint oncogenic pathways that make TRAIL more efficient against cells representing the later stages of carcinogenesis. We specifically examined the sensitivity of an intermediate colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis subsequent to its transformation with two active RAS isoforms (KRASV12 and HRASV12) that are very potent activators of ERK1/2 kinases. Caco-2 cells have been reported previously to be insensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We found that in Caco-2 human colon cells, the two RAS oncogenes present tumor-promoting potential, the Ha-RAS clones giving more and larger tumors in nude mice and a different gene expression profile. 2M. Roberts, G. Vasileiou, M. Stricker, K. Drosopoulos, E. Taoufik, C. Maercker, A. Guialis, M. Alexis, and A. Pintzas, submitted for publication. In this study we have provided strong evidence for the importance of ERK in the regulation of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. Moreover, we denote the significance of RAS oncogenes in the regulation of TRAIL receptors and the subsequent sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, both via cellular transformation and through direct signaling. Specifically, we have demonstrated the functional importance of the ERK-1/2 signal in modulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in RAS-transformed cells, in which aberrant Ras activation up-regulates the expression of TRAIL receptors, thus modulating the subsequent sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by an ERK-dependent mechanism. We also have demonstrated the relevance of this mechanism to its potential exploitation in colorectal cancer therapy. Cell Cultures—The Caco-2, DLD-1, and HT29 cells were obtained from ATCC. The human colon cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29 and the RAS-overexpressing clones derived from Caco-2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 and the derived clone that has the oncogenic Ki-RAS allele disrupted (DKO-4) (31Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. The human colon cell lines AAC1 and RGC2, obtained from Professor C. Paraskeva (United Kingdom), were cultured in the same manner as the HT-29 cells with the addition of insulin, hydrocortisone, and 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). RGC2 and AAC1 are clonogenic, nontumorigenic human colonic adenoma-derived cell lines (32Williams A.C. Harper S.J. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4724-4730PubMed Google Scholar). The MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was purchased from Sigma. The Caco-2 clones constitutively expressing active RAS proteins will be described in a forthcoming article. 2M. Roberts, G. Vasileiou, M. Stricker, K. Drosopoulos, E. Taoufik, C. Maercker, A. Guialis, M. Alexis, and A. Pintzas, submitted for publication. In short, cDNA expressing either V12 Ki-RAS4B or Ha-RASV12 was ligated into pcDNA3 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was transfected into Caco-2 cells using the CaPO4 precipitation technique and selected with Geneticin (Invitrogen). The colonies expressing between 2- and 3-fold exogenous protein were selected for further analysis. As a control, Caco-2 cells were also transfected with empty pcDNA3 expression cassette, and a number of colonies were isolated and expanded. FACS Analysis—For immunostaining, 5 × 105 cells were preincubated with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.1% sodium azide, and 20% fetal bovine serum) and then incubated in the staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% gelatin and 0.1% sodium azide) with monoclonal antibiotic (50 μg/ml) on ice for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated in the staining buffer containing phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse (no. 1070-09, Southern Biotechnology Associates). Cells were then washed, resuspended in the staining buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The following antibodies were used for FACS analysis: DR4-Alexis HS101, DR5-Alexis HS201, DcR1-Alexis HS301, DcR2-Alexis HS402, Fas-Exbio LT95, CD29-Exbio MEM101A, IgG1-GAM-PE (catalog no. 1070-09, Southern Biotechnology Associates). At least 4000 viable (negative propidium iodide staining) cells were analyzed for each condition. RT-PCR—RNA isolation was performed using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared using an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) following standard protocols. Primers used in these experiments were as follows: TRAIL-R1, 5′-CAGAACGTCCTGGAGCCTGTAAC-3′ and 5′-ATGTCCATTGCCTGATTCTTTGTG-3′; TRAIL-R2, 5′-GGGAAGAAGATTCTCCTGAGATGT G-3′ and 5′-ACATTGTCCTCAGCCCCAGGTCG-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3; and c-FOS, 5′-GAATAAGATGGCTGCAGCCAAATGC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAGACGTGTAAGCAGTGCAGC-3′. After reverse transcription the cDNA product was amplified by PCR with 3 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) and 2.5 mm Mg2+ using standard protocols; the annealing temperature was 56 °C for all of the primers except for the c-FOS primers (58 °C). The amplified products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed using UV illumination. Intensity values were measured using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). All PCR products were normalized to GAPDH expression. Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Assays—For cell viability cells were plated on 6-well plates, fixed with absolute methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 min, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline; the remaining crystal violet was extracted using 30% acetic acid and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. The percentages of viable, necrotic, and apoptotic cells were assessed by exposure to the DNA binding dyes Hoechst no. 33342 (Sigma) and propidium iodide (Sigma); apoptotic measurements were carried out using a fluorometric method and counting cell numbers under a fluorescent inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse). Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed with the following antibodies at 1:1000 (v/v): caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-6134); caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-1225); PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; sc-8007), p-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-7383); ERK-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-1647); p-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling, no. 9121S); Flip (Alexis, ALX-804-428); TRAIL-R1 (ProSci, no. 1139); TRAIL-R2 (ProSci, no. 2019); FADD (BD Transduction Laboratories, no. 610399); and p-Akt-Ser473 (Cell Signaling, no. 9271S). The membranes were scanned with Storm 860 scanner (Amersham Biosciences), and the values were measured using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). ERK2 protein expression and/or Ponceau staining was used for protein loading control; ERK2 was also used for normalization. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times, and S.D. function was used for error bar generation. All controls in every experiment were treated with the same amount of buffer/dilutant as the treated cells. TRAIL Induces Apoptosis Specifically in Colon Carcinoma Cell Lines, and This Effect Correlates with High DR4 and DR5 Expression Levels—TRAIL has been shown to exert enhanced apoptotic activity on tumor cells, whereas non-tumor cells have been reported to be resistant to TRAIL-induced death in many systems (4Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). To examine the apoptotic effects of TRAIL in an in vitro system of human colorectal carcinogenesis, we subjected human adenoma and carcinoma colon cells to different concentrations and time periods of TRAIL treatment. The three colon adenoma cell lines examined in the study, AAC1 (32Williams A.C. Harper S.J. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4724-4730PubMed Google Scholar), RGC2, and Caco-2, showed no difference in viability after a 24-h treatment with 500 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 1A). Even after 72 h of TRAIL treatment no evidence of cell death in adenoma cells was detected (data not shown). On the other hand, the carcinoma cell lines HT-29 and DLD-1 had reduced viability after TRAIL treatment (Fig. 1A) by undergoing apoptosis as detected by Hoechst staining and PARP cleavage; a representative image of the HT29 cell line is shown in Fig. 1B. Similar results were obtained with the DLD-1 cell line (data not shown). The expression levels of the functional TRAIL receptors and downstream signaling components were examined both at the mRNA level by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C) and at the protein level by WB analysis (Fig. 1D), respectively. We detected increased levels of DR4 and DR5 mRNA and protein levels in HT29 and DLD-1 cells as compared with Caco-2 cells that were correlated with the sensitivity of the cell lines to TRAIL-induced cell death. Expression levels of other factors like FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-3 did not correlate with the sensitivity of the examined cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). TRAIL Induces a Rapid and Sustained MEK-dependent Activation of ERK1/2 Followed by High mRNA Levels of c-fos— TRAIL receptor activation has been reported to regulate MAP kinase signaling pathways like c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (12Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and ERK (15Tran S.E. Holmstrom T.H. Ahonen M. Kahari V.M. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and these pathways play an important role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in many systems. To examine the cascade of MAP kinase signaling events in the different colon cell lines after TRAIL treatment, we have followed the activation of MEK pathway from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Steady state basal phosphorylation levels of the ERK1/2 kinases were detected in colon cell lines (Fig. 2A). Treatment with TRAIL increased the phosphorylated levels of MEK and p42/44 (ERK1/2) in HT29 cells (Fig. 2A). There was a strong and rapid ERK1/2 activation peaking 15 min after treatment with 500 ng/ml TRAIL. ERK phosphorylation followed MEK activation that peaked after ∼5 min of treatment with TRAIL. We then examined the ELK-1-responsive immediate early gene c-FOS in the HT29 cells and found an increase at the mRNA level of 1.9-fold at 30 min and 2.5-fold at 90 min after treatment with TRAIL, although this increase was abolished by co-treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, c-FOS induction by TRAIL was sustained for 90 min and did not show the characteristic transient induction observed in many systems after growth factor stimulation (Fig. 2B). The DLD-1 cell line was also found to have increased mRNA levels of the c-FOS gene after 25 min of incubation with TRAIL, an effect that was abolished by co-treatment with the MEK inhibitor (data not shown). Treatment with TRAIL Increases the Levels of Its Receptors, DR4 and DR5, whereas MEK Inhibition Reduces the Ability of TRAIL to Induce Apoptosis by Down-regulating Their Expression—Incubation with TRAIL has been reported to activate a positive feedback loop causing the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 (DR5) (17Shetty S. Gladden J.B. Henson E.S. Hu X. Villanueva J. Haney N. Gibson S.B. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this effect contributes to sensitizing cells to TRAIL-induced cell death in these cases, thus showing the importance of the regulation of TRAIL signaling at the receptor level. To explore the mechanism of TRAIL-induced MEK signaling and its effect on TRAIL receptor expression, we examined the potential feedback mechanism in the colon cell lines. Pretreatment of the HT29 cell line for 16 h with 100 μm MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevented TRAIL from significantly reducing cell viability (Fig. 3A) and from inducing apoptosis. Specifically, HT29 cells treated for 24 h with TRAIL showed significant reduction in viability relative to the control. Pretreatment for 16 h with the MEK inhibitor of cells to be treated with TRAIL resulted in an increase of cell viability (Fig. 3A), inhibition of PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B), a reduced number of apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 3C), and reduced caspase-8 activation (data not shown). Specifically, 32 ± 3.8% (mean ± S.D.) of the nuclei counted in the cells treated with TRAIL had apoptotic characteristics, whereas in the case of cells pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 only 16 ± 2.1% of the nuclei showed apoptotic characteristics after treatment with TRAIL (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, in the DLD-1 cell line MEK inhibition failed to produce any significant differences in TRAIL-induced cell death (data not shown). Additional evidence for the regulatory role of the MEK pathway on the expression levels of TRAIL receptors was provided by the reduced steady state levels of the functional TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 after treatment with MEK inhibitor, as determined by RT-PCR in the DLD-1 and HT29 cells (Fig. 4A) and by Western blot analysis in the HT29 cells (Fig. 4B). This clearly showed that in both the HT29 and the DLD-1 cell lines the expression levels of these receptors were at least partially dependent on MEK activation. This effect was lower on the DLD-1 cells, indicating that in this cell line the role of MEK signaling in the expression of the death receptors is not very important. In the same experiment we have shown that the mRNA expression levels of both of the TRAIL receptors increase after treatment with TRAIL (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the actual expression levels of the DR4 and DR5 receptors were altered on the cell surface, we performed FACS analysis on the HT29 cells and confirmed the observations made by Western blot and RT-PCR. There was a slight decrease in the cell surface levels of DR4 and DR5 after a 1-h incubation with MEK inhibitor PD98059, whereas a 16-h incubation showed a ∼42 ± 4.2% and a 51.5 ± 4.6% decrease in the levels of DR4 and DR5, respectively. The decoy and FAS receptors showed no significant changes after treatment with PD98059, indicating that the effect of the MEK inhibitor was not universal for death receptor levels in the cells under investigation (Fig. 5).Fig. 5DR4 and DR5 levels on the cell surface effect of MEK inhibition. FACS analysis was performed on the HT29 cell line treated with 100 μm PD98059 (PD) for 3 and 16 h. The numbers in the first column (control, CTRL) show the levels of the expression of DR4, DR5, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, and FAS on the surface of the HT29 cells, using specific antibodies for each receptor, and the numbers in the second and third columns show the percentage difference after 3 and 16 h of PD98059 treatment, respectively. The numbers of the first row represent the background signal when only the secondary antibody is used (GAM-PE, goat anti-mouse-phycoerythrin).

The Caco-2 cell line was stably transfected with the Ki-RASV12, the Ha-RASV12, and the empty vector ((Fig. 6A, Neo) as a control,2 and clones with low-to-moderate expression of RAS were chosen for analysis. The response of the various RAS-transformed cells to TRAIL was determined by cell viability assay and the presence of PARP cleavage. The Ha-RAS-transformed cells (Fig. 6A, H2 and H13) showed responsiveness to TRAIL in reducing cell viability by ∼35% after 24 h and by 73% after 62 h of treatment, whereas the Ki-RAS (Fig. 6A, K15) clones were more resistant; beginning to show significantly reduced viability after 62 h of treatment (Fig. 6A); these clones gave representative results of the various neo-transformed and Ki- and Ha-RAS-transformed cells tested.

In this paper, we report on the use of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to assay the cytoprotective activity of PrPC. The mammalian pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, confers a lethal phenotype when expressed in yeast. Since overexpression of PrPC has been found to prevent Bax-mediated cell death in cultured human neurons, we explored whether PrP could also suppress Bax-induced cell death in yeast. We utilized a form of mouse PrP containing a modified signal peptide that we had previously shown is efficiently targeted to the secretory pathway in yeast. We found that this PrP potently suppressed the death of yeast cells expressing mammalian Bax under control of a galactose-inducible promoter. In contrast, cytosolic PrP-(23–231) failed to rescue growth of Bax-expressing yeast, indicating that protective activity requires targeting of PrP to the secretory pathway. Deletion of the octapeptide repeat region did not affect the rescuing activity of PrP, but deletion of a charged region encompassing residues 23–31 partially eliminated activity. We also tested several PrP mutants associated with human familial prion diseases and found that only a mutant containing nine extra octapeptide repeats failed to suppress Bax-induced cell death. These findings establish a simple and genetically tractable system for assaying a putative biological activity of PrPC.

These diseases are caused by the conversion of PrPC, 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular isoform of PrP; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of PrP; BI-1, Bax inhibitor 1; DPAPB, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B; GPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; HA, hemagglutinin; SD, synthetic dextrose (glucose) medium; SG, synthetic galactose medium; WT, wild-type. a normal cell surface glycoprotein, into PrPSc, a β-sheet-rich conformer that is infectious in the absence of nucleic acid (2Prusiner S.B.

Cell. 2004; 116: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about the role of PrPSc in the disease process, the normal function of PrPC has remained elusive. A variety of functions have been proposed for PrPC, including roles in metal ion trafficking (4Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (5Mange A. Milhavet O. Umlauf D. Harris D. Lehmann S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and transmembrane signaling (6Chiarini L.B. Freitas A.R. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. Linden R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Identifying the function of PrPC may provide important clues to the pathogenesis of prion diseases, since there is evidence that PrPC plays an essential role in mediating the neurotoxic effects of PrPSc (7Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Several intriguing lines of evidence have emerged recently indicating that PrPC may function to protect cells from various kinds of internal or environmental stress (8Roucou X. Gains M. LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For example, PrP overexpression rescues cultured neurons and some mammalian cell lines from pro-apoptotic stimuli, including Bax expression, serum withdrawal, and cytokine treatment (9Bounhar Y.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40877-40881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, PrP-null mice are more susceptible to neuronal loss after experimental brain injury (13Hoshino S. Inoue K. Yokoyama T. Kobayashi S. Asakura T. Teramoto A. Itohara S. Acta Neurochir. Suppl. 2003; 86: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and neurons cultured from these animals display abnormalities related to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (14Brown D.R. Nicholas R.S. Canevari L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of wild-type PrP completely abrogates the neurodegenerative phenotype of mice expressing the PrP paralogue, Doppel, or N-terminally truncated forms of PrP (Δ32–121 and Δ32–134) (15Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

In this paper, we have utilized the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a experimentally accessible model system in which to analyze the cytoprotective function of PrPC. In particular, we tested whether PrP could rescue yeast from cell death induced by the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, similar to the way PrP has been shown to protect cultured human neurons from Bax-induced death (9Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Roucou X. Guo Q. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40877-40881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the fact that heterologous expression of mammalian Bax in yeast is lethal (17Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that has been used as an assay to isolate Bax inhibitor proteins from mammalian sources (18Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc.

We also capitalized on our recent demonstration that PrP with a modified signal peptide is efficiently targeted to the yeast secretory pathway, where it becomes glycosylated, glycolipid-anchored, and localized to the plasma membrane as it does in mammalian cells (21Li A. Dong J. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29469-29477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We show here that PrP targeted to the secretory pathway efficiently suppresses Bax-induced cell death in yeast, and we perform a structure-function analysis to determine which features of the PrP molecule are essential for this effect. Our results establish a simple and genetically tractable system for assaying a putative biological activity of PrPC. Yeast—Strain YPH499 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Yeast were grown at 30 °C on SD (synthetic medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source) or SG (synthetic medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source), with drop-out of either Ura, Leu, or both. Plasmids—Murine Bax was expressed using the vector pESC-LEU (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains a 2-micron origin of replication, two galactose-inducible promoters (GAL10 and GAL1), and a leucine (Leu) selection marker. The murine Bax coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone (IMAGE 3968903; Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) using the following primers: 5′-TATAATTAAGCTTGCGGCCGCATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCGGTCTAGATCTTCAGCCCATCTTCTTCCAGATGGT-3′ (reverse). The forward primer includes a NotI restriction site, and the reverse primer includes a BglII restriction site. The NotI/BglII-digested PCR product was cloned into pESC-LEU that had been cut with the same two enzymes, which places the Bax coding region under control of the GAL10 promoter. All PrP constructs were derived from the murine PrP sequence and contained the 3F4 epitope tag (22Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were expressed using the vector p426GPD, which contains a 2-micron origin of replication, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter, and a uracil (Ura) selection marker (23Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The coding region of DPAPB-PrP254 was subcloned from pVT102U into p426GPD using BamHI and HindIII sites. The construction DPAPB-PrP254/pVT102U has been described previously (21Li A. Dong J. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29469-29477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Deletion and truncation mutants of PrP (Δ51–90, Δ32–80, Δ32–93, Δ23–31, 23–231, Δ231–254 (GPI–)) were generated by bridge PCR using DPAPB-PrP254 as a template. PCR products were then cloned into p426GPD via BamHI and HindIII sites. Point and insertional mutants of PrP (PG14, E199K, P101L, D177N, F197S) were created by removing a KpnI/XbaI fragment from DPAPB-PrP254/pVT102U and substituting the equivalent fragment excised from previously constructed pcDNA3 plasmids carrying these mutations (24Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The DPAPB-PrP254 coding regions were then subcloned from pVT102U into p426GPD via BamHI and HindIII sites. The coding region of murine BI-1 (18Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) with a single C-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was amplified by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone (IMAGE 3708463; Open Biosystems) and was cloned into p426GPD via BamHI and HindIII sites. Yeast cells were transformed by electroporation (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2004Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Proteins were extracted from yeast by lysis in NaOH/β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (26Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. After heating for 10 min at 95 °C (PrP, Bax) or 56 °C (BI-1), proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. PrP was detected with monoclonal antibody 3F4 (22Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bax with rabbit anti-Bax antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse BI-1 with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics). Proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Proteinase K resistance and detergent insolubility were assayed as described previously (21Li A. Dong J. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29469-29477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PrP Rescues Yeast from Bax-induced Cell Death—We expressed murine Bax in S. cerevisiae using a galactose-inducible promoter (GAL10), so that growth in the presence or absence of Bax could be assessed by plating on galactose medium (SG) or glucose medium (SD), respectively. Overnight cultures were serially diluted and spotted on both kinds of plates. Yeast carrying the inducible Bax plasmid grew well on SD-Leu but failed to grow on SG-Leu (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, yeast transformed with empty vector grew similarly on both plates. Western blotting confirmed that growth in galactose medium induced expression of Bax (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, inducible expression of Bax is lethal in yeast. To test whether mammalian PrP could rescue yeast from Bax-induced cell death, we utilized DPAPB-PrP254, a form of PrP containing a chimeric signal peptide consisting of the signal-anchor sequence of the yeast protein DPAPB fused to the C-terminal 7 amino acids of the PrP signal peptide. We have shown previously that DPAPB-PrP254 is efficiently targeted to the secretory pathway in yeast, where it is glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and trafficked to the plasma membrane (21Li A. Dong J. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29469-29477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bax-expressing yeast were transformed with a plasmid that expresses DPAPB-PrP254 under control of the strong, constitutive GPD promoter. As controls, yeast were transformed with empty vector or with the same vector encoding murine Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1), which has previously been shown to rescue yeast from Bax-induced cell death (18Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of three independent transformants of each strain were serially diluted and spotted on glucose (SD-Leu-Ura) and galactose (SG-Leu-Ura) plates. Each of the strains grew on glucose plates, although yeast expressing DPAPB-PrP254 were slightly inhibited in their growth compared with the other two strains (Fig. 1A). On galactose plates, as expected, vector-transformed yeast failed to grow, while yeast expressing BI-1 were partially rescued. Remarkably, yeast expressing DPAPB-PrP254 grew even better on galactose than yeast expressing BI-1. Quantitation of the number of colonies on galactose plates compared with glucose plates revealed that DPAPB-PrP254 rescued 80% of the growth in the presence of Bax, compared with 50% for BI-1 and 2% for empty vector (Fig. 1B). We also noticed that PrP-expressing yeast produced larger colonies than BI-1-expressing yeast on galactose plates (Fig. 1A), implying that PrP is more potent than BI-1 in enhancing growth rate as well as increasing the number of surviving cells in the presence of Bax. Western blotting confirmed expression of Bax, DPAPB-PrP254, and BI-1 in yeast strains grown in galactose medium, demonstrating that DPAPB-PrP254 and BI-1 do not interfere with expression of Bax (Fig. 1C). The data shown in Fig. 1 were obtained using the yeast strain YPH499, but similar results were obtained with strain BY4741 (data not shown). We performed two additional control experiments. To exclude the possibility that the expression of DPAPB-PrP254 enhanced growth on galactose medium independent of Bax, we analyzed yeast expressing only DPAPB-PrP254 without Bax. We found that expression of DPAPB-PrP254 did not enhance, and actually slightly inhibited, growth on SG-Ura, when comparison was made to yeast transformed with empty vector (supplemental Fig. S2A). To confirm that the growth rescuing effect was due to the presence of the DPAPB-PrP254 plasmid and not to another genetic alteration, we selected for yeast that had lost this Ura-marked plasmid by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid. We found that yeast that had lost the plasmid did not retain the ability to grow on galactose medium (supplemental Fig. S2B). Cytosolic PrP Does Not Suppress Bax-induced Cell Death, but Non-membrane-anchored PrP Does—To investigate the rescuing activity of cytosolic PrP, Bax-expressing yeast were transformed with a plasmid encoding PrP23–231. This protein lacks both the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal GPI addition signal and would therefore be expected to be localized to the yeast cytosol. We found that yeast expressing PrP23–231 failed to grow on SG-Leu-Ura medium, similar to vector-transformed yeast, indicating that cytosolic PrP is incapable of rescuing yeast from Bax-induced cell death (Fig. 2). We did not note any difference in growth of the two strains on SD-Leu-Ura, demonstrating that cytosolic PrP is not toxic in the absence of Bax. Western blots confirmed that PrP23–231 was being expressed and that, in contrast to DPAPB-PrP254, it was not glycosylated, consistent with failure to enter the secretory pathway (supplemental Fig. S3A). To test whether GPI anchoring to the cell membrane was essential for the rescuing activity of PrP, we tested yeast transformed with a plasmid encoding DPAPB-PrP230, which contains the chimeric signal sequence but is missing the C-terminal, GPI addition signal. This form of PrP displayed full rescue activity, as indicated by similar growth on both SD-Leu-Ura and SG-Leu-Ura plates (Fig. 2). Thus, the GPI anchor is not essential for PrP suppression of Bax-induced death. Western blots confirmed that DPAPB-PrP230 is glycosylated, indicating entry into the secretory pathway, and that it does not affect expression of Bax (supplemental Fig. S3A). Deletion of Residues 23–31, but Not the Octapeptide Repeats, Reduces Rescue Activity—To further map structural determinants in PrP that are essential for suppressing Bax-induced cell death, we generated a set of deletions covering the unstructured, N-terminal region of the protein. DPAPB-PrP molecules carrying several different deletions that lie between residues 32 and 93 (Δ51–90, Δ32–80, Δ32–93) were as active as wildtype DPAPB-PrP254 in rescuing growth on galactose plates (Fig. 3). Thus, the octapeptide repeats (residues 51–90) are not essential for activity. Interestingly, however, deletion of only 9 residues within a positively charged region following the signal peptide (DPAPB-PrPΔ23–31) significantly reduced rescue activity (Fig. 3). Colony counts on glucose and galactose plates (performed as in Fig. 1B) indicated that DPAPB-PrPΔ23–31 has about 15% of the activity of wild-type PrP. All of the deleted proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type DPAPB-PrP254, and all were glycosylated, as assessed by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S3B). In addition, all strains expressed similar levels of Bax when grown on galactose (supplemental Fig. S3B). PrP Molecules Carrying an Octapeptide Insertion, but Not One of Several Point Mutations, Fail to Suppress Bax-mediated Cell Death—We tested DPAPB-PrP molecules carrying either a point mutation (E199K, P101L, D177N, F197S) or a nine-octapeptide insertional mutation (PG14) whose human homologues are associated with inherited prion diseases (27Kong Q. Surewicz W.K. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 673-775Google Scholar). None of the mutants impaired the ability of yeast to grow on glucose plates, implying that these proteins were not toxic in the absence of Bax (Fig. 4A). However, the PG14 insertion abolished growth on galactose plates, implying that this mutation abrogated the rescue activity of PrP. In contrast, the point mutants displayed full rescue activity, as evidenced by unimpaired growth on galactose plates. Western blots confirmed that PrP and Bax were expressed in each of these strains after galactose induction (supplemental Fig. S3C). The cytoprotective activity of the mutant proteins correlated with their biochemical properties. We measured detergent insolubility and protease resistance, two biochemical attributes of PrPSc. Only PG14 PrP exhibited protease resistance, yielding a 27–30-kDa protected fragment, while the point mutants were completely digested under the same conditions (Fig. 4B). In addition, a substantial amount of the glycosylated form of PG14 PrP was insoluble, while the glycosylated forms of the point mutants were mostly soluble (Fig. 4C). The unglycosylated forms of all PrP molecules, including wild-type, were insoluble, as is the case when these proteins are expressed in mammalian cells (28Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of Bax rescue activity of PG14 PrP correlates with its PrPSc-like biochemical properties. In this study, we have demonstrated that PrP targeted to the secretory pathway of S. cerevisiae is capable of rescuing the lethal phenotype caused by heterologous expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family. In mammalian cells, Bax is a cytoplasmic protein that is translocated to mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, where it promotes cell death by mediating release of cytochrome c, which in turn activates caspase-dependent pathways (29Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae does not contain endogenous Bcl-2 family members or caspases, the initial events underlying Bax activity in yeast and mammalian cells are similar, including translocation of the protein to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and alterations in mitochondrial function (17Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Jin C. Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The downstream effectors of Bax-induced cell death in yeast are less certain, but may include reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria. Of note, several mammalian proteins that were isolated by virtue of their ability to suppress Bax-induced cell death in yeast also have Bax inhibitory activity in mammalian cells (18Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Greenhalf W. Lee J. Chaudhuri B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the ability of PrP to rescue the lethal phenotype of Bax-expressing yeast reflects interaction with Bax-related pathways that are operative in higher organisms. How does PrP protect yeast from Bax-induced cell death? One possibility is that PrP directly associates with and inactivates Bax. Although PrP was reported to interact with Bcl-2 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (31Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), binding of DPAPB-PrP to Bax in our expression system seems unlikely, since DPAPB-PrP is present in the secretory pathway while Bax is in the cytoplasm. Indeed, when we deliberately targeted PrP to the cytoplasm by deletion of the N- and C-terminal signal sequences (PrP23–231), the protein lost its Bax rescuing activity. Whether the inactivity of cytosolic PrP is due to protein aggregation or to other factors remains to be determined. A second, more likely possibility to explain the protective effect of PrP is that PrP interacts with endogenous yeast proteins that lie downstream of Bax in a cellular stress or toxicity pathway. In addition to members of the Bcl-2 family, several other mammalian proteins are known to inhibit the action of Bax (18Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Greenhalf W. Lee J. Chaudhuri B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and it is possible that yeast homologues of these or related molecules play a role in the PrP rescue pathway we have demonstrated here. The results reported here are relevant to theories about the pathogenicity of mutant PrP molecules associated with inherited prion diseases. One hypothesis is that these molecules acquire toxic properties by virtue of misfolding or being converted to a PrPSc-like state. Alternatively, the presence of the mutation may abrogate or alter a normal physiological function of PrPC. We found that PrP molecules carrying a nine-octapeptide insertion (PG14), but not one of several point mutations, failed to suppress Bax-mediated cell death. In addition, PG14 PrP was the only one of the mutants that showed significant protease resistance and detergent insolubility when expressed in yeast. These results suggest that loss of Bax-protective function, perhaps as a result of protein aggregation or misfolding, could play some role in PG14-associated prion disease. This conclusion is consistent with our observation that neuronal death in Tg(PG14) mice is Bax-dependent (33Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Dossena S. Nowoslawski L. Roth K.A. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that this mechanism is also applicable to other pathogenic mutants, which display PrPSc-like biochemical properties in cultured mammalian cells (34Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and brain (27Kong Q. Surewicz W.K. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 673-775Google Scholar), even though they do not in yeast. PrP has also been reported to protect against cell death in several mammalian systems. The studies that are most directly comparable to ours are those in which human PrP was shown to prevent Bax-induced apoptosis of cultured human neurons, following microinjection of plasmids encoding these proteins (9Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Roucou X. Guo Q. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40877-40881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In those studies, in contrast to ours, PrP containing the D178N mutation (equivalent to D177N in mouse) was reported to lack rescuing activity, while cytoplasmic PrP-(23–231) retained activity. On the other hand, PrP lacking the GPI anchor was active in both systems. PrPΔ56–88, which retains part of the first octapeptide repeat, was inactive in neurons, but we did not test this construct in yeast. It is possible that the discrepancies between yeast and human neurons reflect fundamental mechanistic differences in how PrP suppresses Bax-induced cell death in the two systems. Alternatively, the pathways involved in PrP cytoprotection may be partially, but not completely, conserved between yeast and mammals. Interestingly, PrPΔ32–93, which rescues Bax-induced cell death in yeast, is also capable of rescuing neurodegeneration in transgenic mice expressing PrPΔ32–134 (15Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

Moreover, deletion of a charged region encompassing residues 23–31 partially abolishes PrP rescue activity in yeast, and a slightly smaller deletion within the same region (Δ23–28) has been found to abrogate protection against Doppel-induced apoptosis in mouse neurons (35Drisaldi B.

Taken together, these comparisons suggest that the ability of PrP to suppress Bax lethality in yeast reflects a physiological activity of PrP that is operative in mammals and that may protect cells against several kinds of toxic insults. The observations reported in this paper establish yeast as a valuable tool to assay a potentially important biological activity of PrP. This system offers many advantages, most importantly, the capability of genetic analysis of PrP function. With the use of appropriately designed genetic screens and selections, it should now be possible to identify proteins from yeast and mammals that alter the cytoprotective activity of PrP and that may also interact physically with PrP.

https://openalex.org/W2029052421,"The conformational distribution of the N-terminal domain of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCIIb) has been characterized by electron-electron double resonance yielding distances between spin labels placed in various domains of the protein. Distance distributions involving residue 3 near the N terminus turned out to be bimodal, revealing that this domain, which is involved in regulatory functions such as balancing the energy flow through photosystems (PS) I and II, exists in at least two conformational states. Models of the conformational sub-ensembles were generated on the basis of experimental distance restraints from measurements on LHCIIb monomers and then checked for consistency with the experimental distance distribution between residues 3 in trimers. Only models where residue 3 is located above the core of the protein and extends into the aqueous phase on the stromal side fit the trimer data. In the other state, which consequently is populated only in monomers, the N-terminal domain extends sideways from the protein core. The two conformational states may correspond to two functional states of LHCIIb, namely trimeric LHCIIb associated with PSII in stacked thylakoid membranes and presumably monomeric LHCIIb associated with PSI in nonstacked thylakoids. The switch between these two is known to be triggered by phosphorylation of Thr-6. A similar phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the N-terminal domain has been observed by others in bovine annexin IV which, due to the conformational switch, also loses its membrane-aggregating property.

A similar phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the N-terminal domain has been observed by others in bovine annexin IV which, due to the conformational switch, also loses its membrane-aggregating property. The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCIIb) 1The abbreviations used are: LHCIIb, light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex; Chl, chlorophyll; PS, photosystem; TEMPO, tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; DEER, double electron electron resonance; PDB, protein data bank; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: LHCIIb, light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex; Chl, chlorophyll; PS, photosystem; TEMPO, tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; DEER, double electron electron resonance; PDB, protein data bank; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine. in higher plants contributes to photosynthesis most significantly by increasing the amount of light energy absorbed and thus of the energy flow through the photosynthetic reaction centers. This is accomplished by the pigments present in the complex, eight chlorophyll (Chl) a and six Chl b molecules as well as four carotenoids per apoprotein, which are noncovalently bound to the protein and positioned such that the excitation energy can rapidly be conducted toward the reaction centers. With regard to this function, it seems reasonable to view the LHCIIb apoprotein as a rigid scaffold keeping the pigments in their proper position.In addition to its light-harvesting functions, LHCIIb is involved in a number of regulatory processes that may require a more flexible behavior of the apoprotein. One of these processes ensures a balanced energy flow through the two photosystems (PS). When PSII reduces more plastoquinone than can be reoxidized by PSI, then LHCIIb becomes phosphorylated at a threonine residue close to the N terminus by a thylakoid kinase. This modification prompts LHCIIb to dissociate from PSII and bind to PSI, increasing the absorption cross-section of the latter (1Allen J.F. Science. 2003; 299: 1530-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Zer H. Ohad I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this switch in binding partners is unclear, but an altered arrangement of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain in LHCIIb, triggered by its phosphorylation, has been discussed (3Nilsson A. Stys D. Drakenberg T. Spangfort M.D. Forsen S. Allen J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18350-18357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of LHCIIb has been reported to be favored not only by a reduced plastoquinone pool but also, more directly, when LHCIIb itself is excited by light. Irradiation with visible light causes an increased accessibility of the N-terminal protein domain to both the kinase and proteases (4Zer H. Vink M. Shochat S. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This apparent structural change, which is reversible in the dark, has been observed with thylakoid preparations and also with isolated LHCIIb, and therefore appears to be an intrinsic property of the pigment-protein complex (5Zer H. Vink M. Keren N. Dilly Hartwig H.G. Paulsen H. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8277-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, LHCIIb is involved in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photoinhibition due to overexcitation. Under high light conditions, one of the carotenoid components of the Chl a/b antenna of PSII, violaxanthin, is converted to zeaxanthin by a de-epoxidase residing in the lumen, and this conversion, together with the acidification of the lumen compartment, enables the light-harvesting apparatus to dissipate excitation energy into heat rather than funneling it to the reaction centers. This quenching process requires the PSII protein PsbS (6Li X.-P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) and is most likely brought about by a Chl-zeaxanthin heterodimer undergoing charge separation (7Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this regulatory process is still unclear, but one of the explanations that have been suggested is an allosteric mechanism leading to a dissipating conformation of Chl a/b complexes (8Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and possibly inducing a partial LHCIIb trimer-monomer transition (10Garab G. Cseh Z. Kovacs L. Rajagopal S. Varkonyi Z. Holzenburg A. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15121-15129Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In order to verify and understand the proposed structural changes in LHCIIb, the conformational behavior of the complex under various physiologically significant conditions needs to be analyzed. One possibility of doing so is to measure intramolecular distances. For instance, if structural transitions of the N-terminal domain are to be characterized, distances between the N terminus and other points in the molecule should be measured. Förster resonance energy transfer has been extensively used to measure molecular distances and specifically to characterize conformational changes in proteins (11Tucker M.J. Oyola R. Gai F. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Johnson A.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The drawback of Förster resonance energy transfer for analyzing LHCIIb conformations is that, in order to avoid spectral interference with the intrinsic pigments, one would have to use fluorescent labels in the infrared spectral domain, which tend to be bulky and are likely to distort the protein structure to be studied.An alternative technique for measuring molecular distances that avoids this complication is EPR. Spin labels used for EPR, such as tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), compare in size to amino acid side chains and therefore are less likely to interfere with the structural behavior of the protein. Distances between such labels up to 20 Å can be measured with good precision by conventional continuous-wave EPR techniques (13Rabenstein M.D. Shin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The combination of such measurements with site-directed spin labeling has recently emerged as a viable approach for studying structure and conformational dynamics of membrane proteins and protein complexes (14Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 566-573Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 15Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 16Steinhoff H.J. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 97-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distance range of this approach can be extended up to at least 50 Å by applying pulse EPR techniques such as pulse electron-electron double resonance experiments (17Milov A.D. Salikhov K.M. Shirov M.D. Fiz. Tverd. Tela. 1981; 23: 975-982Google Scholar, 18Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) or double-quantum EPR (19Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1999; 313: 145-154Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In particular, the four-pulse DEER experiment has been shown to be applicable to membrane proteins even if distances are rather broadly distributed as is the case for spin labels that are situated in loops (20Jeschke G. Wegener C. Nietschke M. Jung H. Steinhoff H.-J. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2551-2557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In recent methodological studies on extraction of distance distributions from four-pulse DEER data (21Jeschke G. Panek G. Godt A. Bender A. Paulsen H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2004; 26: 223-244Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and sensitivity enhancement (22Jeschke G. Bender A. Paulsen H. Zimmermann H. Godt A. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 169: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we have used doubly spin-labeled samples of LHCIIb as model systems. By applying double-quantum EPR to the soluble protein lysozyme T4 as a model system, Borbat et al. (23Borbat P.P. Mchaourab H.S. Freed J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5304-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) demonstrated that EPR distance measurements combined with triangulation techniques can potentially be used to determine structural features of a protein.In the present work, we attempt for the first time to obtain information on unknown structural details of a membrane protein by the combination of EPR distance measurements and triangulation. In particular, we try to determine possible locations of residue 3 close to the N terminus, which is not resolved in the crystal structures. On the basis of bimodal experimental distance distributions, we assume a two-state model of the N-terminal domain. Conformations of the domain that are consistent with the different possible assignments of the peaks in the distance distributions for LHCIIb monomers are modeled by using the program MODELLER, and it is tested as to which assignments are also consistent with the experimental data for the trimer. The results are discussed in the context of regulation of the energy flow balance of the plant photosystems.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Preparation and Spin Labeling—For the present study, two types of Lhcb1 clones derived from the Lhcb1*2 (AB80) gene (24Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2960-2964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from pea (Pisum sativum) were used. Mutant versions of the protein were constructed containing a single Cys replacing Ser in position 3 (S3C) and Ser-160 in the stromal loop (S160C). Double mutants contained two cysteines in positions 3 and 160 (S3C,S160C), 3/52 (S3C,S52Ch), 52/160 (S52C,S160C), 106/160 (S106C,S160Ch), 3/106 (S3C,S106Ch), and 106/229 (S106C,V229C). In all these mutants, the native single Cys in position 79 was replaced by Ser and, except for mutants 3/106 and 106/229, a hexahistidyl (His6) tag (designated by “h”) was added to the C terminus.All mutants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (25Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The resulting proteins were dissolved (1 mg/ml) in an aqueous solution of 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), and 2 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Spin labeling was performed by adding 4-(2-iodoacetamido)-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Sigma, 10-fold molar excess over protein) and incubating overnight at ambient temperature on a shaker. The proteins were then precipitated by adding 1 m acetic acid to a final concentration of 100 mm and 2.3 volumes of acetone. The protein was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C), washed several times with 70% ethanol and once with ethanol, and dried for 15 min at ambient temperature.Preparation of Pigments and Recombinant LHCIIb—Chls and carotenoids were isolated from pea thylakoids according to Ref. 26Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. From all doubly labeled apoproteins, monomeric pigment-protein complexes were reconstituted as described previously (27Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kühlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, two monolabeled apoproteins containing cysteine instead of serine at positions 3 (S3C) and 160 (S160C) were reconstituted. Trimerization of monomeric LHCIIb was initiated by immobilization of the His6-tagged monomers on a nickel-chelating fast-flow Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in columns of 0.8 cm width and 4 cm length. The column was washed with 1 volume of OG buffer containing n-octyl glycoside (1% (w/v), 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 12.5% sucrose (w/v)). Monomeric LHCIIb was applied, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed with 3 column volumes of OG buffer, followed by 2 volumes of TX buffer, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mg/ml dipalmitoyldiacylphosphoglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids). Pigment-protein complexes were eluted from the column by addition of 1 volume of eluate buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m imidazole, and 0.1 mg/ml dipalmitoyldiacylphosphoglycerol).Monomeric and trimeric LHCIIb in the nickel-chelating column eluate were purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The eluate was loaded on 0.1 to 1 m sucrose density gradients containing 0.1% (w/v) lauryl maltoside, 5 mm Tricine (pH 7.8). After centrifugation for 17 h at 230,000 × g and at 4 °C, the bands containing monomeric and trimeric LHCIIb were collected and concentrated by Centricon centrifugal filter units (30 kDa, Bio-Rad) up to 400 μm protein. Before loading to EPR tubes, the samples were mixed at a 1:1 volume ratio with 80% glycerol as a cryoprotectant.EPR Measurements—Dipolar time evolution data were obtained at X-band frequencies (9.3–9.4 GHz) with a Bruker Elexsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Flexline split-ring resonator ER 4118X_MS3. Microwave from a YIG oscillator (Avantek AV 78012) customized by Magnettech GmbH (Berlin, Germany) was fed into one microwave pulse-forming unit of the spectrometer to provide the pump pulses. All measurements were performed using the four-pulse DEER experiment: π /2(νobs) – τ1 – π (νobs) – t′ – π (νpump) – (τ1 + τ2 – t′) – π (νobs) – τ2 – echo (18Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Time t′ is varied, whereas τ1 and τ2 are kept constant, and the dipolar evolution time is given by t = t′ – τ1. Data were analyzed only for t > 0. The resonator was overcoupled to Q ∼ 100; the pump frequency νpump was set to the center of the resonator dip and coincided with the maximum of the nitroxide EPR spectrum, whereas the observer frequency νobs was 65 MHz higher and coincided with the low field local maximum of the spectrum. All measurements were performed at a temperature of 50 K with observer pulse lengths of 32 ns for both π /2 and π pulses and a pump pulse length of 12 ns. Proton modulation was averaged by adding traces at eight different τ1 values, starting at τ1,0 = 200 ns and incrementing by Δt1 = 8 ns. The total measurement time for each sample was between 6 and 14 h.Data Analysis—The theoretical model for data analysis is described in Refs. 21Jeschke G. Panek G. Godt A. Bender A. Paulsen H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2004; 26: 223-244Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar and 28Jeschke G. Koch A. Jonas U. Godt A. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 155: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar. Distance distributions were obtained by least squares fitting of amplitudes at a small number (9, 17, or 33) of equidistant sampling points in the range between 1.75 and 8 nm and interpolating between sampling points by cubic Hermite polynomials (21Jeschke G. Panek G. Godt A. Bender A. Paulsen H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2004; 26: 223-244Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A home-written Matlab program for this task is freely available on request. Similar distance distributions were obtained by Tikhonov regularization in the same distance range using a regularization parameter of 500.Modeling of the N-terminal Region of the LHCIIb—The program Modeller 6, version 2 (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10391) Google Scholar), was used to generate structural models of LHCIIb on the basis of the recently solved crystal structure of the trimeric complex from spinach (30Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gul L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). MODELLER performs comparative protein structure modeling by satisfying spatial restraints. The program optimizes the structure of homology models by minimizing a global probability density function that integrates stereochemical parameters and homology-derived restraints (31Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). The LHCIIb x-ray crystal structure employed as a template defines the positions of amino acids 14–231; therefore, the arrangement of the first 13 amino acids was highly variable in the structural models. As additional restraints, the intramolecular distances measured in this work between the spin labels in position 3 and in another position were used. For each set of distances, 500 independent modeling procedures were performed to cover all roughly equally possible arrangements of the N-terminal protein domain that are consistent with the intramolecular distances measured. The variability in the models was ensured by starting out from slightly different structures. Modeller generated 500 identical preliminary models, and before structural optimization, the program modifies each model by a randomization procedure that slightly varies the position of each atom resulting in different starting models. This prevents the optimization routine from being trapped at a local minimum that would produce 500 identical models. The existence of local minima also causes the creation of structural models that are not completely consistent with all specified distances deduced from the EPR measurements. We therefore checked whether the generated models were consistent with the experimental data and ruled out the nonconforming models. This reduced the number of models from 2000 to 1514 (Table I). Distance analysis of the homology models and the crystal structure was performed by using DeepView 3.7 (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar) and the home-written Matlab programs. Distances were measured between Oγ atoms (Ser residues) or the average of the two Cγ atoms (residue Val-229).Table IStructural models of LHCIIb monomers fulfilling various distance restraints derived from EPR measurementsCondition no.Distance 3/52Distance 3/160No. selected modelsÅÅ124-3022-32392224-3038-45346339-4322-32397439-4338-45379 Open table in a new tab RESULTSEPR Measurements of Doubly Spin-labeled LHCIIb Monomers—Six different intramolecular distances within an LHCIIb monomer were assessed by pulse EPR measurements. For each distance, a doubly spin-labeled Lhcb1 was prepared, carrying two TEMPO labels in amino acid positions where a serine (positions 3, 52, 106, and 160) or a valine (position 229) had been replaced with a cysteine (Fig. 1). The labeling positions (given in parentheses) were close to the N terminus (position 3), and in the N-terminal domain were close to the first transmembrane helix (position 52), in the stromal (position 106) and luminal loops (position 160), and close to the C terminus (position 229). The only cysteine in the native Lhcb1 amino acid sequence had been exchanged with a serine, so that labeling with an excess amount of the sulfhydryl-reactive iodoacetamido derivative of TEMPO occurred exclusively at the intended positions. As a control, an Lhcb1 mutant containing no cysteines gave no EPR signal after it had been subjected to the same labeling procedure as the cysteine-containing mutants (data not shown). The efficiency of TEMPO labeling in Lhcb1 mutants containing a singular cysteine was quantified by subsequent fluorescence labeling with a 10-fold molar excess of BODIPY 507/545 IA (Molecular Probes D-6004). The fluorescence labeling dropped to less than 10% when the protein had been reacted previously with the TEMPO label, indicating that TEMPO labeling was at least 90% efficient (not shown). This means that at least 80% of the protein molecules used in the intra-molecular distance measurements carried two labels.The spin-labeled proteins were reconstituted with pigments in detergent solution, and the resulting LHCIIb derivatives were isolated by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose density gradient and concentrated by ultrafiltration to >400 μm. That this preparation contained monomeric LHCIIb was verified by virtually complete energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a (25Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and by circular dichroism spectra in the visible range (33Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (data not shown).Pulse EPR measurements with doubly spin-labeled LHCIIb are exemplified in Fig. 2 for the mutant S3C/S160C, covering the distance between the N terminus and the stromal loop. The four-pulse DEER data (solid line in Fig. 2A) were corrected for the background from interactions with labels on other protein molecules (dashed line) and used to calculate distance distributions by cubic Hermite interpolation between sampling points (21Jeschke G. Panek G. Godt A. Bender A. Paulsen H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2004; 26: 223-244Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As a control, we performed a measurement on a 1:1 mixture of LHCIIb monomers carrying only a single spin label in position 3 or 160, respectively, at approximately the same total protein concentration. The DEER decay in this case corresponds to the background from interactions with labels on other protein molecules (dots in Fig. 2A). The signals of bilabeled samples were corrected for this background contribution and, thus, correspond to distances between labels within the same LHCIIb molecule.Fig. 2EPR data obtained for the monomeric LHCIIb doubly labeled mutant S3C/S160Ch (single measurement).

In general, primary DEER data from different preparations of the same double mutant (monomers) or single mutant (trimers) were tested for significant differences after normalization of the modulation depth as described previously (21Jeschke G. Panek G. Godt A. Bender A. Paulsen H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2004; 26: 223-244Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The primary data sets for different preparations of the same mutant (17 data sets for S3C/S160C, 12 data sets for S106C/S160C, and 2 data sets for each of the other mutants) were found to agree within experimental noise. They were at first processed independently, and for each of them the root mean square error for the best fit distance distribution was determined. To obtain an average primary data set, the data sets for a given mutant were weighted with their inverse root mean square error, added, and normalized. The distance distribution was then determined from the average primary data set. This procedure corresponds to a maximum likelihood estimate of the distance distribution from the series of independent primary data sets.Fig. 3Distance distributions for six intramolecular distances in LHCIIb monomers. The location of the spin label pairs in the sequence is given in the upper left corners of the plots. Arrows indicate the distances taken from the crystal structure (30Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gul L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) between the midpoints of the amino acid side chains in the labeling positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When we assume a fixed distance between the Cα atoms of the two residues, the maximum possible peak width in the distance distribution is determined by the conformational distribution of the spin labels and can be estimated as ±0.5 nm (13Rabenstein M.D. Shin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Widths of the distribution larger than that imply a distribution of the distance of the Cα atoms. Shallow valleys in the distribution, as the one observed for mutant 106/160 at 3.7 nm, may be noise-induced and should be ignored. For mutant 3/160, where data could be measured only for maximum dipolar evolution times of 1.5 μs, we may not exclude the presence of distances larger than 4.5 nm, which would be suppressed by background correction for this evolution time. In the other cases, such contributions could be excluded by measuring data up to longer maximum dipolar evolution times and checking that the distance distribution did not change.Three of the distances measured can be compared with the corresponding distances in the LHCIIb crystal structure (arrows in Fig. 3). The values taken from the crystal structure for distances 106/160 (3.89 nm) and 106/229 (3.50 nm) coincide quite well with the maxima of the distance distributions measured by EPR (3.86 and 3.84 nm, respectively). The distance 52/160 from the crystal structure (3.1 nm) is on the lower side of but still being comprised in the distance distribution obtained here (see also arrows in Fig. 3). Taken together, the data obtained by pulse EPR are fully consistent with the crystal structure. We can therefore conclude that the labeling of the protein with TEMPO does not disrupt the native protein structure. The EPR distance distributions including position 3 near the N terminus cannot be compared with the crystal structure in which the 13 N-terminal amino acids are not resolved.Three of the distance distributions are bimodal, each showing two separated peaks centered at 2.8 and 4.1 nm (3/52), 2.9 and 4.0 nm (3/160), and 3.8 and 4.7 nm (52/160). In particular, the data for 3/52, where base-line separation of the peaks is at least as broad as the peaks themselves, strongly suggests that the N-terminal domain can exist in two different states.

Amino acid sequence analyses of TRPCs revealed the presence of ankyrin-like repeat domains, one of the most common protein-protein interaction motifs. Using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we found that the second ankyrin-like repeat domain of TRPC6 interacted with MxA, a member of the dynamin superfamily. Using a GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that MxA interacted with TRPC1, -3, -4, -5, -6, and -7. Overexpression of MxA in HEK293T cells slightly increased endogenous calcium entry subsequent to stimulation of Gq protein-coupled receptors or store depletion by thapsigargin. Co-expression of MxA with TRPC6 enhanced agonist-induced or OAG-induced calcium entry activity. GTP binding-defective MxA mutants had only a minor potentiating effect on OAG-induced TRPC6 activity. However, a MxA mutant that could bind GTP but that lacked GTPase activity produced the same effect as MxA on OAG-induced TRPC6 activity. These results indicated that MxA interacted specifically with the second ankyrin-like repeat domain of TRPCs and suggested that monomeric MxA regulated the activity of TRPC6 by a mechanism requiring GTP binding. Additional results showed that an increase in the endogenous expression of MxA, induced by a treatment with interferon α, regulated the activity of TRPC6. The study clearly identified MxA as a new regulatory protein involved in Ca2+ signaling.

The study clearly identified MxA as a new regulatory protein involved in Ca2+ signaling. [Ca2+]i regulates many cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, contraction, and secretion. In most nonexcitable cells, [Ca2+]i elevations are initiated in response to hormones and other stimuli that activate phospholipase C β or γ. This activation causes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; AngII, angiotensin II; ARD, ankyrin-like repeats domain; CCh, carbachol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; IFN, interferon; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; HBSS, Hepes buffered salt solution; aa, amino acids; TG, thapsigargin; X-α-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; AngII, angiotensin II; ARD, ankyrin-like repeats domain; CCh, carbachol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; IFN, interferon; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; HBSS, Hepes buffered salt solution; aa, amino acids; TG, thapsigargin; X-α-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside. and diacylglycerol. IP3 activates its receptor/channel on the endoplasmic reticulum and causes the first phase of [Ca2+]i elevation by releasing Ca2+ from the intracellular pool. The second phase of [Ca2+]i elevation involves Ca2+ entry from the extracellular compartment. This second phase allows the maintenance of [Ca2+]i at a higher than basal level, which is essential for maintaining cell functions (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P.

A typical TRPC subunit is composed of six membrane-spanning domains and a hydrophobic segment between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains that forms the putative pore region loop. Cytosolic N terminus and C terminus tails flank the six transmembrane domains. Each TRPC subunit possesses two coiled-coil regions (one in the N terminus and the other in the C terminus) and a hyperconserved region composed of three to four ankyrin-like repeat domains (ARDs) in the N terminus (18Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O. Trebak M. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).ARDs are found in more than 4,000 different proteins, making one of the most common motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. The 33 amino acids of ARDs form two α-helices linked by a β-hairpin/loop (19Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 20Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When ARDs are involved in protein-protein interactions, most of the binding occurs at the β-hairpin/loop region (21Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), but certain complexes can also form at the surface of the inner α-helices (22Main E.R. Jackson S.E. Regan L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ARDs of proteins like GA binding protein, p53, CDK6, and Notch (23Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) play a role in the regulation of the activity of these proteins.To determine which proteins can interact specifically with the ARD of TRPC6, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library from human fetal brain. MxA, an interferon-induced 76-kDa GTPase that inhibits the multiplication of several RNA viruses, was one of the proteins that interacted with the ARD. In the study presented here, we showed that the C terminus of MxA bound to the second ankyrin-like repeat of TRPC6. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that MxA also interacted with TRPC1, -3, -4, -5, and -7 and that the overexpression of the wild-type form of MxA enhanced the channel activity of TRPC6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media, serum, Hepes, trypsin, G418, Opti-MEM I, TRIzol, Lipofectamine 2000, and TA Topo cloning kit were purchased from Invitrogen.

Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma.Molecular Biology and cDNA Constructs—Standard molecular biology techniques were used for DNA isolation, analysis, and cloning (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York2002Google Scholar). Depending on their intended use, cDNAs were cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pEBFP-C1 (Clontech), the yeast expression vectors pGBKT7 or pACT2 (Clontech), the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), or the in vitro translation vector pAGA (26Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing from double-stranded DNA templates using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar).To obtain the full-length coding region of MxA (GenBank™ accession number M30817), overlapping partial cDNA fragments were amplified from HEK293 total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR, subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and sequenced to confirm the identity of the inserts. MxA cDNA (nucleotides -84 to 2441) was assembled and subcloned into pcDNA-3.1 using a standard molecular biology approach. Mutations were introduced into the MxA cDNA by PCR-based sitedirected mutagenesis using Expand high fidelity polymerase and the following corresponding sense primers: K83A, 5′-GACCAGAGCTCGGGCGCTAGCTCC-3′; T103A, 5′-AGCGGGATCGTGGCCAGATGCCCGCTG-3′; L612K, 5′-ACGTACGGCCAGCAGAAACAGAAG-3′, and their complementary antisense primers. The resulting PCR products were sequenced to confirm the mutations and the integrity of the amplified fragments. The resulting PCR products and pcDNA3.1-MxA were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases and purified, and suitable fragments were ligated together. The same strategy was employed to introduce the FLAG epitope (DYKD-DDDK) at the N terminus of MxA.To determine the IFN-α-induced MxA expression in HEK293 stably expressing TRPC6, cell monolayers were treated with 1,000 units/ml IFN-α for 16 h. RNA was isolated by using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's directions. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 30 μl, with mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions by using 2.5 μg/μl hexamer as primer. This reverse cDNA was then used as template for the subsequent PCR. Primers used were as follows: for MxA, 5′-AACAGCTCTGTGATACCATTTAACTTGTTG-3′ and 5′-TTCCTCCAGCAGATCCCTGAAATATGGGTG-3′; for β-actin, 5′-TCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC-3′. PCRs were carried out for the indicated number of cycles by using an annealing temperature of 53 °C and a 120-s elongation at 72 °C. Products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells and HEK293 stably expressing TRPC6 cells were maintained at subconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Briefly, 6-well plates were treated with poly-l-lysine for 30 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and dried. Plasmid DNA (1 μg) diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM I was added to each well before adding 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM I. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. HEK293T cells (7.5 × 105) diluted in 1.5 ml of culture medium without antibiotic were then added to the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was then replaced by complete culture medium, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. For [Ca2+]i measurements, the content of a single well was trypsinized and plated on four poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips. To determine the transfection efficacy, HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of cDNA coding for the M5 muscarinic receptor, and the proportion of cells showing a CCh-induced Ca2+ mobilization was evaluated 48 h after transfection. Typically, the transfection efficacy varied between 55 and 65%.Measurement of [Ca2+]i—We used the method described by Zhu et al. (28Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) to measure [Ca2+]i. Briefly, cells attached to coverslips were washed twice with HBSS (120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4,10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.8 mm CaCl2) and loaded with fura-2/AM (0.05 μm in HBSS) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing and a 30-min de-esterification step in fresh HBSS at room temperature, the coverslips were inserted into a circular openbottom chamber and placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert microscope fitted with an Attofluor Digital Imaging and Photometry System (Attofluor Inc., Rockville, MD). Isolated fura-2-loaded cells were selected and the [Ca2+]i in these cells was measured by fluorescence video microscopy at room temperature using alternating excitation wavelengths of 334 and 380 nm and monitoring emitted fluorescence at 520 nm. Free [Ca2+]i was calculated from the 334/380 fluorescence ratio according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All reagents were diluted to their final concentration in HBSS and applied to the cells by surface perfusion. For Ba2+ entry measurements, the composition of HBSS was modified (120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm BaCl2). To select transfected cells in the OAG-induced Ca2+ entry experiments, the medium was replaced by Ca2+-free HBSS (plus 0.5 mm EGTA) 3 min after OAG stimulation, and 100 nm AngII was added to the medium. Only cells that showed AngII-induced Ca2+ release were considered as transfected. The results were represented as average data obtained from 8-12 coverslips, each containing 20-30 transfected cells. The S.E. bars were usually smaller than the size of the symbols.Immunoprecipitation Assay—Transfected cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+/Mg2+ (137 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and lysed with 600 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation followed by 10 passages through a 20-gauge needle and five passages through a 25-gauge needle. The solubilized material was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 2 μl of anti-HA antibody and 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Before use, the protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was precoated for 1 h at 4 °C, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in lysis buffer. Samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 2 min at 5,000 rpm and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C before separation on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting.Immunoblots—For immunoblots, cell lysates, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in 150 mm glycine, 20 mm Tris-base, and 20% methanol (350 mA, 3 h, 4 °C). The blots were stained with Ponceau S to visualize marker proteins, destained with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20), and blocked for either 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat skim milk. The blots were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-HA (dilution 1:1,000), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (dilution 1:1,000), or mouse anti-c-Myc antibodies (dilution 1:1,000). After three washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-IgG (1:20,000) or peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (1: 10,000) for 2 h at room temperature in TBST. The blots were washed three times with TBST, and the immune complexes were visualized with the ECL Plus detection system.GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays—Amino acids 572-662 of MxA were cloned in frame into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid to express GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h at 30 °C. The cells were subsequently collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 15 min, sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice, and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 2,500 × g at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature and then washed (five times) with ice-cold lysis buffer.The c-Myc-tagged ARD-TRPCs (TRPC3, aa 1-201; TRPC4, aa 3-183; TRPC5, aa 1-183; TRPC6, aa 3-259; TRPC7, aa 3-195) were translated using the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system. For GST pull-down experiments, c-Myc-tagged ARD-TRPCs were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Sepharose bead-bound GST fusion proteins. After washing with binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min before being separated by SDS-PAGE and being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—cDNA encoding the amino acids 3-259 of TRPC6 was used as bait and cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7-BD and transformed into the yeast strain AH109. AH109 expressing the bait was then mated with the Y187 yeast strain pretransformed with a cDNA library from human fetal brain cloned into the pACT2-AD vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Based on the mating efficiency and the titer of the library, 6.4 × 106 clones were screened. Mated yeast cells were first grown on low stringency selection plates (-Leu, -Trp, -His) and then on high stringency selection plates (-Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal). Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity and positive colonies were further segregated on (-Leu, -Trp, +X-α-gal) media. pACT2-AD plasmids containing the library inserts from positive colonies were isolated and transformed into the DH5α bacterial strain. The selected plasmids were then sequenced and analyzed with the Blast alignment tool from NCBI (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zheng Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar). To eliminate false positive clones, cDNAs in frame with the GAL4-activating domain were used to transform the AH109 yeast strain that was mated with the Y187 yeast strain containing either a cDNA encoding amino acids 3-96 of TRPC6 (which is missing the ARD of TRPC6) cloned into pGBKT7-BD, or a cDNA encoding amino acids 66-230 of human lamin C cloned into pGBKT7-BD, or the plasmid pGBKT7-BD alone. Mated yeast cells were plated on (-Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade +X-α-gal) and (-Leu, -Trp) media. Only those colonies that grew only on (-Leu, -Trp) medium were considered as expressing a protein that could specifically interact with the ARD of TRPC6.Yeast Protein Extraction—Five ml of selective medium (-Leu/-Trp) was inoculated with a single yeast colony, vigorously mixed, and incubated overnight at 30 °C on a rotating plate at 250 rpm. An aliquot (1.5 ml) of overnight culture was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.25 n NaOH containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, agitated well, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Trichloroacetic acid (160 μl of 50%) was added to the mixture, which was mixed well and reincubated for a further 10 min on ice. After a 10-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone before being centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was dried by evaporation and dissolved in 500 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting.RESULTSBased on homology with other proteins, several specific domains or motifs have been identified in the intracellular N and C termini of TRPC proteins. One of them, ARD, is known to play a major role in protein-protein interactions and is found in many types of proteins, including those involved in signal transduction. We performed an amino acid sequence alignment of the ARDs of 15,401 different proteins in the Pfam data base and calculated the frequency of each amino acid and group of amino acids at precise positions. Amino acids present at a high frequency (in at least 10% of all ARDs) at precise positions determined the “common consensus motif” shown in Fig. 1A. According to this consensus motif, amino acid insertions can be found between positions 15 and 16 and between positions 25 and 26 of some ARDs. Also, amino acids after position 26 or further are deleted in some ARDs. Amino acid sequence alignments of TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 with the consensus motif revealed that each TRPC contained four ARDs. For the ARDs of TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6, 44.2, 50.8, and 49.2%, respectively, of the amino acids were identical to those of the consensus motif (Fig. 1C).To identify proteins that interact with TRPCs, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library with the amino acids 3-259 of TRPC6 as bait. From this initial screening, we obtained 32 potential positive clones that grew on a Trp/Leu/His/Ade-deficient medium, that were positive for α- and β-galactosidase, and that were in frame with the GAL4-activating domain. To determine the specificity of their interactions with the ARD, each potential clone was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain and mated with the Y187 yeast strain expressing either lamin C, the N terminus of TRPC6 without the ARD (TRPC6 3-93), or the N terminus of TRPC6 with the ARD (TRPC6 3-259). Mated yeast were plated on a high stringency medium (-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade +X-α-gal) and a Trp/Leu-deficient medium. Despite the fact that all of the clones were highly expressed in the diploid yeast (Fig. 2B), only four were able to grow with TRPC6 3-259 but not with TRPC6 3-93 or lamin C (Fig. 2A). One of the four clones contained a 0.8-kb cDNA fragment that encoded the C terminus of MxA, a member of the dynamin superfamily, which has antiviral properties.Fig. 2Amino acids 547-662 of MxA interact specifically with the ARD of TRPC6. A, the S. cerevisiae Y187 strain pretransformed with the GAL4-binding domain (GAL4-BD) constructs pGBKT7 (Vector), pGBKT7-human lamin C, pGBKT7-TRPC6 3-93, or pGBKT7-TRPC6 3-259 were mated with S. cerevisiae AH109 expressing the GAL4-activating domain (GAL4-AD) containing amino acids 547-662 of MxA. A high stringency selective medium (-Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) was used to grow mated clones. B, the mated clones expressing the constructions described in A were grown overnight at 30 °C in selective liquid medium (-Trp). Proteins were extracted, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by specific immunoblotting directed against the N-terminal c-Myc epitope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the exact region of the ARD required for the interaction with MxA, we made progressive deletions from the N terminus and C terminus of the ARD of TRPC6 (Fig. 3A) and tested for interactions using the yeast two-hybrid assay. All of the deletion mutants of the ARD of TRPC6, as well as the empty bait plasmid pGBKT7 and lamin C, were transformed individually into the Y187 yeast strain and mated with the AH109 yeast strain carrying the prey plasmid pACT2-MxA 547-662. Fig. 3B shows that all of the mutants of the ARD of TRPC6 were expressed in diploid yeast cells plated on a Trp/Leu-deficient medium. However, only diploid yeast cells that expressed the TRPC6 3-159, TRPC6 3-196, and TRPC6 122-259 sequences were able to grow on a high stringency medium. In contrast, yeast cells containing the empty plasmid pGBKT7, lamin C, or the ARD of TRPC6 that is missing the sequence 131-157 failed to grow on a high stringency medium. These results pointed to the importance of the second ankyrin-like repeat of TRPC6 for the interaction with MxA.Fig. 3Amino acids 547-662 of MxA interact specifically with the second ankyrin-like repeat of TRPC6 in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

B, S. cerevisiae Y187 strains pretransformed with the GAL4-BD-TRPC6-fusion fragments shown in A were mated with S. cerevisiae AH109 pretransformed with the GAL4-AD fused to amino acids 547-662 of MxA. A high stringency selective medium (-Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) was used to grow the interacting clones. A selective medium (-Leu, -Trp) was also used to mon"

To protect the highly reactive reaction intermediate glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA), a tight complex between these two enzymes was proposed based on their solved crystal structures. The existence of this hypothetical complex was verified by two independent biochemical techniques. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies directed against E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM demonstrated the physical interaction of both enzymes in E. coli cell-free extracts and between the recombinant purified enzymes. Additionally, the formation of a GluTR·GSA-AM complex was identified by gel permeation chromatography. Complex formation was found independent of Glu-tRNAGlu and cofactors. The analysis of a GluTR mutant truncated in the 80-amino acid C-terminal dimerization domain (GluTR-A338Stop) revealed the importance of GluTR dimerization for complex formation. The in silico model of the E. coli GluTR·GSA-AM complex suggested direct metabolic channeling between both enzymes to protect the reactive aldehyde species GSA. In accordance with this proposal, side product formation catalyzed by GluTR was observed via high performance liquid chromatography analysis in the absence of the GluTR·GSA-AM complex.

In plants, green algae, archaea, and most bacteria the common precursor molecule of all tetrapyrroles, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), 1The abbreviations used are: ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid; DTT, 1,4-dithio-d,l-threitol; GluRS, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; GluTR, glutamyl-tRNA reductase; Glu-tRNAGlu, glutamyl-tRNAGlu; GSA-AM, glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase; GSA, glutamate-1-semialdehyde; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid]; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. is synthesized from tRNA-bound glutamate (Glu-tRNAGlu) in a two-step reaction (1Schön A.

Sci. 1992; 17: 215-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the first step, the NADPH-dependent glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) catalyzes the reduction of glutamyl-tRNA to glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA). In a subsequent transamination reaction this aldehyde is transformed into ALA by the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (GSA-AM) (3Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently the catalytic mechanism of GluTR and its structural basis have been elucidated in a combined biochemical and structural investigation using the recombinant enzyme from the extreme thermophilic archaean Methanopyrus kandleri (4Moser J.

Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of GluTR reveals an unusual extended V-shaped dimer with each monomer consisting of three distinct domains arranged along a curved “spinal” α-helix. The N-terminal catalytic domain specifically recognizes the glutamate moiety of the substrate. The active site was identified by co-crystallization of the competitive inhibitor glutamycin representing the 3′-terminal end of the natural substrate. During catalysis a nucleophilic cysteine residue attacks the aminoacyl linkage of the glutamate to its cognate tRNA and generates an enzyme-bound thioester intermediate. This intermediate has been biochemically trapped and visualized. For this purpose a new purification strategy for the Escherichia coli enzyme has been developed (6Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The thioester intermediate gets finally reduced by direct hydride transfer from NADPH to form GSA and to release tRNAGlu. The nucleotide cofactor is supplied by the second distinct domain, the NADPH binding domain. An additional C-terminal domain of GluTR is responsible for the dimerization of the unusual V-shaped molecule. Structure-based alignments of amino acid sequences from different sources have revealed a high degree of sequence identity (8Schubert W.D. Moser J. Schauer S. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings along with the biochemical data for the E. coli enzyme indicate that the M. kandleri enzyme can be regarded as a model system representing all GluTR enzymes. ALA synthesis requires the concerted action of the two enzymes GluTR and GSA-AM that are metabolically linked by the highly reactive aldehyde GSA. A half-life of less than 4 min was determined for GSA at physiological pH in aqueous solution (9Hoober J.K. Kahn A. Ash D.E. Gough S. Kannangara C.G. Carlsburg Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structures of GluTR from M. kandleri and GSA-AM from Synechococcus sp. (10Hennig M. Grimm B. Contestabile R. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) a hypothetical model ensuring efficient ALA synthesis was proposed (5Moser J. Schubert W.D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We realized that the open space delimited by the GluTR monomers is remarkably similar to the volume occupied by GSA-AM. In silico the dimeric GSA-AM was placed into the open space of the V-shaped GluTR-dimer. Both enzymes were docked along their 2-fold symmetry axes leading to a model complex with a high degree of surface complementarity (in Fig. 1 the analogous E. coli model complex is shown). Independently, tRNAGlu was docked in a single plausible position on the GluTR protein. The resulting combined model of the ternary complex (GluTR, tRNA, and GSA-AM) did not lead to steric clashes. Additional strong evidence for the model complex came from the observation that the putative active site entrance of each GSA-AM monomer is positioned opposite a partly opened depression of the catalytic domain of GluTR. This depression and the GluTR active site pocket are separated from each other only by the conserved arginine 50 (M. kandleri GluTR numbering). In our current hypothesis the GluTR product GSA leaves the enzyme via this “back door” of the GluTR active site pocket and subsequently enters the active site of GSA-AM. This way direct channeling of labile GSA to the active site of GSA-AM without exposure to the aqueous environment is possible. Here we provide the first experimental evidence for the GluTR·GSA-AM complex using two independent biochemical techniques. Additionally, we created the homologous E. coli model complex in an in silico experiment (Fig. 1) supporting our results. Overexpression and Purification of E. coli GluTR—Details for recombinant production, refolding, and purification of recombinant E. coli GluTR have been published elsewhere (7Schauer S. Lüer C. Moser J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Construction of the Gene for the GluTR Mutant A338Stop by Site-directed Mutagenesis—A deletion mutant lacking the dimerization domain (GluTR-A338Stop) was generated using the plasmid pBKCwt (6Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48657-48663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotide was employed to introduce a stop codon into the E. coli GluTR sequence: 5′-GCGTGGCTGCGATAACAAAGCGCCAGCGAAAC-3′ (stop-codon underlined). Purification and Characterization of the E. coli GluTR Deletion Mutant A338Stop—Purification and refolding of the truncated protein was performed in analogy to the wild type enzyme (7Schauer S. Lüer C. Moser J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The yield of refolded protein was 4 mg from 0.6 g of inclusion bodies. In the final concentrated fraction a single protein band on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel was visible after Coomassie Blue staining. The calculated molecular mass of the mutant enzyme deduced from the gene sequence (40,112 Da) was experimentally confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (4Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to be 40,110 ± 5 Da (data not shown). Edman degradation revealed an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence (first 15 amino acids) as derived from the cloned gene sequence. N-terminal protein sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 454 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To provide further evidence for proper refolding of GluTR-A338Stop circular dichroism spectroscopy was employed. CD spectroscopy was carried out on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). Protein solutions of GluTR and GluTR-A338Stop were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm NaCl. The concentration of the protein solution was 500 μg/ml. In quartz cuvettes of 1-mm path length, CD spectra over a range of 190–250 nm were recorded at room temperature as an average of 5 scans. Thermal unfolding was carried out in the range of 20–100 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The molar ellipticity was measured at 220 nm every 2 °C. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 20 min at 20 °C before starting each scan. Both GluTRwt and GluTR-A338Stop were used for the following measurements. Using CD spectroscopy in the far-UV spectral region, we detected no significant differences compared with the wild type enzyme. Thermal unfolding experiments followed by CD spectroscopy indicated a comparable temperature range (80–85 °C) for the unfolding of the mutant protein (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of GluTR comprising residues 338–418 is not essential for the proper folding of the catalytic and the NADPH-binding domain. For the GluTR-A338Stop mutant a residual activity of <5% compared with wild type enzyme was detected using the standard GluTR depletion assay (4Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Large Scale Overproduction, Purification, and Characterization of E. coli GSA-AM—E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying pLIpopC (11Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Eggertsson G. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3408-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultivated in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A578 nm of 0.6. After the addition of another 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 400 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosid, cells were grown for an additional 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial cell pellet (4 g) was resuspended in 20 ml of 100 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.8, containing 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (buffer A). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 50,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (XK 16 column, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 2 column volumes of buffer A, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 5 column volumes ranging from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing GSA-AM were pooled (∼200 mg of total protein) and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT (buffer B) at 4 °C. This solution (40 ml) was subsequently loaded on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B. Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient (150 ml) with a concentration of 10 mm to 1 m NaCl in buffer B. GSA-AM-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Vivaspin-15 centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 (Viva-science, Hannover, Germany). A final volume of 2 ml with a protein concentration of 45 mg/ml was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 prep grade, high load 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated previously with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions containing GSA-AM were pooled and concentrated to 30 mg/ml (Vivaspin-15 concentrator, molecular weight cut-off 30,000). The newly established purification procedure for the E. coli GSA-AM yielded ∼50 mg of protein/liter of bacterial culture purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. The integrity of the enzyme preparation was experimentally verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and by N-terminal protein sequencing as described above (data not shown). Analytical gel filtration chromatography, performed as described previously (12Frankenberg N. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) resulted in a single, well resolved peak. The cofactor absorption spectrum indicated a peak at 330 nm and another peak at 430 nm as described previously (3Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the E. coli GSA-AM was comparable with that of the Synechococcus enzyme (10Hennig M. Grimm B. Contestabile R. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments Using Cell-free E. coli Extracts—Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against recombinant E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM were generated by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). For co-immunoprecipitation using cell free extracts, a total of 0.5 g of aerobically grown E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were harvested in the early exponential phase. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 0.5% (v/v) of the detergent Nonidet P-40 (lysis-buffer). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. From the supernatant 300 μl were incubated with 2.5 μl of anti-GluTR (5 mg/ml) or anti GSA-AM serum (8 mg/ml), respectively, by gentle shaking for 90 min at 4 °C. After the addition of 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer, the mixture was further incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbent was recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g and washed three times by resuspension in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. The samples were eluted into 20 μl of SDS loading buffer (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples eluted from protein A-Sepharose were heated for 5 min at 99 °C and subjected to 9% SDS-PAGE using standard techniques (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.55Google Scholar). The electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Trans-Blot apparatus (semi-dry transfer cell, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was first incubated with anti-GSA-AM or anti-GluTR rabbit antibodies (1:30,000 in phosphate-buffered saline (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.55Google Scholar) with 3% bovine serum albumin), washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibodies (1:20,000 in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin) from Pierce (Bonn, Germany). The detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate color developing method from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments Using Purified Recombinant E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM—For co-immunoprecipitation using purified enzymes 1 μm wild type GluTR or GluTR deletion mutant A338Stop, respectively, and 1 μm of GSA-AM were analyzed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (assay buffer) containing 500 μm l-glutamate, 4 mm ATP, 2 mm NADPH, 500 μm PLP, 1 μmE. coli glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), and 20 μmE. coli tRNA preparation containing ∼37% tRNAGlu acceptor activity prepared as described elsewhere (14Borel F. Hartlein M. Leberman R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 100 μl of this assay mixture were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C or alternatively for 2 min at 37 °C. After dilution with 300 μl of assay buffer, 1 μl of anti-GluTR (5 mg/ml) or anti-GSA-AM serum (8 mg/ml), respectively, was added to the assay mixture and incubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C. Co-precipitation and immunodetection was then performed analogous to the experiments using cell-free extracts as described above. Analysis of GluTR·GSA-AM Interaction by Gel Filtration according to Hummel and Dreyer—The Hummel and Dreyer method (15Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) is based on the disturbance of the equilibration of a gel filtration column equilibrated with a given concentration of a compound of interest (GSA-AM) by the presence of a weak interaction partner (GluTR). For this purpose a defined amount of the tested interaction partner (GluTR) is injected onto a gel filtration system equilibrated with GSA-AM, and elution profiles are recorded spectroscopically. The binding of GluTR to GSA-AM results in a local deficit of GSA-AM in the eluent, allowing the determination of the binding constant (15Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 16Beeckmans S. Methods. 1999; 19: 278-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An analytical Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to investigate the binding of GluTR to GSA-AM. The chromatography buffer contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm GSA-AM. After equilibration with 2 column volumes of chromatography buffer a 20-μl injection of various concentrations of GluTR (2–20 μm) dissolved in the chromatography buffer, including 10 μm GSA-AM, was performed. Chromatography was at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Protein concentration was followed by on-line measuring of absorbance at 280 nm. Analogous experiments were performed using GSA-AM at a concentration of 5 μm. Enzyme Assays and HPLC Analysis of Reaction Products—The substrate [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu was prepared in a bulk reaction using 100 μg of purified E. coli tRNAGlu (Sigma) and 50 μg of purified E. coli GluRS incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, and 40 μm [14C]Glu with a specific activity of 284 mCi/mmol (10.5 GBq/mmol). The [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu was then separated from the other reaction components as described previously (4Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli GluRS was purified to apparent homogeneity following published procedures (17Lin S.X. Brisson A. Liu J. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The GluTR assay mix (50 μl) contained 8 μm GluTR, 6 μm [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.1, 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 100 μm DTT, 2.5 μm bovine serum albumin, 400 μm NADPH, and 200 μm PLP (standard assay buffer). Reactions were started by the addition of [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu and incubated at 37 °C for 8 min. For sequential enzyme analysis the reaction products were formed without the addition of GSA-AM and its cofactor. Formed substances were further incubated with 400 pmol of purified E. coli GSA-AM (8 μm) for 8 min. Reaction products were analyzed via HPLC on a Waters μBondapack™ C18 reversed phase column (3.9 × 150 mm, 125 Å pore size, 10 μm particle diameter) as described previously (4Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ratio of reaction products was estimated by peak integration. For coupled enzyme assays the GluTR standard assay described above additionally contained 8 μm E. coli GSA-AM. After incubation for 8 min HPLC analysis revealed the ratio of reaction products. Reactions without GluTR for the different types of enzyme assay served as background controls. Structure Modeling—The sequences of the E. coli enzymes under study were obtained from the PubMed data base. The coordinates for the M. kandleri GluTR (5Moser J. Schubert W.D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank data base ID code 1GPJ, and coordinates for the Synechococcus GSA-AM (10Hennig M. Grimm B. Contestabile R. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were obtained from the ID code 2GSA. Sequence alignments between GluTR from M. kandleri and E. coli, as well for GSA-AM from Synechoccus and E. coli, were carried out using the program ClustalW (18Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4078) Google Scholar). The modeled E. coli structures were generated using the program BRAGI (19Reichelt J. Dieterich G. Kvesic M. Schomburg D. Heinz D.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The model complex was created by placing GSA-AM in the open space delimited by GluTR and docking them along their 2-fold symmetry axes as described previously (5Moser J. Schubert W.D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The image was generated by using PyMOL (20DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM form a Complex in Cell-free Extracts—In silico experiments suggested a complex between GluTR and GSA-AM to protect the labile GSA from hazardous exposure to the aqueous environment. To analyze for the presence of the proposed complex, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted. For this purpose rabbit anti-GluTR and anti-GSA-AM antibodies were generated. The employed strategy involved the recognition of one protein with the specific antibody, immobilization of the antibody-antigen complex on Protein A-Sepharose, and its isolation via centrifugation and washing. In the case of a co-immunoprecipitated interaction partner, this protein was visualized in Western blot experiments using a second antibody directed against it. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-GluTR and anti-GSA-AM antibodies were performed first with cell-free extracts prepared from wild type E. coli BL21 (DE3) cultures harvested in the early exponential growth phase. These cells contained the natural amounts of both enzymes because none of the corresponding genes was overexpressed. Both of the complementary co-immunoprecipitation experiments resulted in the precipitation of the postulated GluTR·GSA-AM complex. Significant amounts of complexed protein were detected with the corresponding anti-GSA-AM antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and anti-GluTR antibody, respectively (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In the supernatant of the co-precipitates, only residual amounts of the interacting protein partner were detected using Western blot analyses (data not shown). In a control experiment E. coli strain EV61, which carries a disrupted gene for GluTR, was cultivated (21Verkamp E. Chelm B.K. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a cytosolic extract was prepared analogously to E. coli BL21 (DE3). No immunoprecipitation of GluTR or of GSA-AM by anti-GluTR antibodies was observed (data not shown). In agreement, neither of the pre-immune serums taken prior to the immunization of the rabbits reacted with E. coli GluTR or GSA-AM, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 1) Because of the known low cellular concentration of both enzymes, only highly concentrated extracts from 20 to 40 mg/ml protein resulted in clear co-immunoprecipitation results. Interestingly, cell-free extracts prepared from stationary phase-grown E. coli did not contain detectable amounts of the GluTR·GSA-AM complex (data not shown). Possibly because of lower heme requirements in the stationary phase, heme-induced GluTR proteolysis decreased cellular GluTR concentrations (22Wang L. Elliott M. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, a stable GluTR·GSA-AM complex detectable via co-immunoprecipitation is present in E. coli cell-free extracts. Complex Formation between Purified E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM Is Glutamyl-tRNA- and Cofactor-independent—To further study the prerequisites for the observed interaction between E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using recombinant purified enzymes at protein concentrations of 1 μm were performed. Incubation of the assay mixture prior to immunoprecipitation was carried out in the presence and absence of Glu-tRNAGlu and catalytically important cofactors such as NADPH and PLP at both 4 °C and 37 °C. At both preincubation temperatures the GluTR·GSA-AM complex was precipitated from the assay mixture independently of the addition of the substrate Glu-tRNAGlu and the NADPH and PLP cofactors. Identical results were obtained by using either anti-GluTR or anti-GSA-AM antibodies for the precipitation. The data are shown for anti-GSA-AM antibodies in Fig. 3A, lane 3. The pre-immune serum control is shown in Fig. 3A, lane 1. From these results we conclude that complex formation at the employed protein concentrations is not dependent on the flow of metabolites through the GluTR·GSA-AM complex. GluTR Dimerization Enhances GluTR·GSA-AM Complex Formation—To study the role of the C-terminal domain in complex formation in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the GluTR-A338Stop mutant lacking the dimerization domain. Gel filtration chromatography indicated a native relative molecular mass of 39,000 ± 3,000 Da for the truncated protein. Based on these results it was concluded that the GluTR-A338Stop-mutant (40,112 Da calculated molecular mass) is a globular monomeric two-domain GluTR variant. The function of the 80 C-terminal residues (representing 19% of the overall GluTR sequence) is the formation of the dimerization domain responsible for the V-shaped quaternary structure of the wild type GluTR. An intact dimerization domain is also important for the enzymatic activity of the E. coli GluTR as indicated by only 5% residual activity of the mutant enzyme compared with the wild type enzyme. The monomeric enzyme was tested for complex formation at a concentration of 1 μm in the presence or absence of Glu-tRNAGlu and associated cofactors. In comparison with the dimeric wild type enzyme the amount of precipitated enzyme was significantly reduced, but there was still a detectable interaction (Fig. 3B). The amount of wild type GluTR co-immunoprecipitated in the GluTR·GSA-AM complex was ∼50% of GluTR precipitated using anti-GluTR antibodies (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 3). However, only about 20% of complex bound GluTR-A338Stop was detected compared with freely precipitated GluTR-A338Stop (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 3). These experiments suggested an important role of the C-terminal dimerization domain in the facilitation of complex formation. From these data we conclude that the dimeric V-shaped GluTR structure is an important prerequisite for the interaction of both enzymes. Nevertheless, complex formation was not solely dependent on those C-terminal residues but also required the residual GluTR molecule as indicated by the small amount of observed co-precipitate using GluTR-A338Stop. Gel Filtration Analysis of the GluTR·GSA-AM Complex— With the newly established purification procedure for E. coli GSA-AM sufficient quantities of highly pure enzyme were obtained to apply a second independent biochemical method, the Hummel-Dreyer gel filtration chromatography, for complex formation analysis (15Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). On the basis of our results from the in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments we decided to investigate complex formation at room temperature in the absence of substrate and cofactors. A gel filtration column was calibrated for the elution position of GluTR (1.54 ml) and GSA-AM (1.72 ml), respectively. The same gel filtration column was then equilibrated with buffer containing 10 μm GSA-AM until a stable absorption at 280 nm was observed. Subsequently, a sample containing 10 μm GluTR in addition to the 10 μm GSA-AM was injected. The elution profile followed at 280 nm showed in addition to the expected peak for GluTR (1.54 ml) a trough (1.72 ml) in the basal absorbance (Fig. 4). This trough is the result of GSA-AM depletion from the running buffer caused by the binding of GSA-AM to the injected GluTR protein. Analogous chromatographies were conducted with increasing amounts of GluTR ranging from 2 to 20 μm. The size of the trough increased with the concentration of injected GluTR. No troughs were observed when the applied samples did not contain GluTR or when 10–50 μm bovine serum albumin was injected instead. These results clearly indicated the physical interaction of E. coli GluTR and GSA-AM in the absence of substrate and cofactors. From experiments with different protein concentrations an association constant of ∼10 μm for the complex was deduced. Toward a Function of the GluTR·GSA-AM Complex by Way of Sequential Versus Coupled ALA Formation—To identify a function for the GluTR·GSA-AM complex, the enzymatic conversion of [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu into ALA via the highly reactive GSA intermediate was compared for the two consecutive enzymatic reactions and the coupled reactions. Resulting reaction products were identified and quantified by scintillation counting after reversed phase HPLC chromatographic separation. In vitro reactions of GluTR alone with the substrate [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu led to the formation of [14C]GSA, with a retention time of 7.5 min and, because of spontaneous substrate hydrolysis, to a [14C]Glu peak at 5 min. Besides those two well characterized products a third 14C-labeled compound, with a retention time of 2.6 min, was reproducibly detected as the result of GluTR catalysis (Fig. 5A). When GSA-AM was added to this product mixture only [14C]GSA was converted into [14C]ALA. The additional compound at 2.6 min was no substrate for GSA-AM catalysis (Fig. 5B). In coupled in vitro assays, allowing complex formation prior to substrate addition, this additional compound was not detectable (Fig. 5C). On the basis of these observations one might speculate that one essential role of GluTR·GSA-AM complex formation is to prevent the side reaction of the reactive GSA aldehyde species, possibly with cellular compounds or the solvent. Another possible reaction has been described earlier during the chemical synthesis of GSA in which a cyclization of GSA to 2-hydroxy-3-aminotetrahydropyran-1-one was described (23Jordan P.M. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990Google Scholar). To date no physical characterization of that compound has been reported. Because of the minimal amounts of intermediate formed in the assay mixture (≈5 pmol) no further characterization of this side product was possible. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the semialdehyde species was protected from an inefficient side reaction by the presence of GSA-AM. However they do not rule out the possibility that a very rapid GSA-AM reaction in the coupled assay might also result in the protection of GSA. Nevertheless, these findings are in clear agreement with the postulated substrate channeling pathway as indicated by x-ray crystallography and by modeling experiments (5Moser J. Schubert W.D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in which the intermediate aldehyde is prevented from exposure to the aqueous environment. The current investigation was one of the rare cases in which the structural biology of related enzymes from different organisms directly give the answer to a metabolic question. The present investigation demonstrates the existence of a GluTR·GSA-AM complex in E. coli, which might indicate that the original structure-based complex model can be regarded of general significance for the GluTR·GSA-AM interaction in plants, archaea, and all bacteria synthesizing ALA from Glu-tRNAGlu. We thank Rita Getzlaff for N-terminal protein sequencing and Manfred Nimtz (both from the German Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig) for mass spectrometry analysis. We are indebted to Nicole Frankenberg-Dinkel for the gel filtration column and Ronja Tasler for advice during the Hummel-Dreyer experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2101632787,"Dietary fatty acids have a profound impact on atherosclerosis, but mechanisms are not fully understood. We studied the effects of a saturated fat diet supplemented with fish oil, trans10,cis12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), or elaidic acid on lipid and glucose metabolism and liver protein levels of APOE*3 Leiden transgenic mice, a model for lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Fish oil lowered plasma and liver cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, and glucose but increased plasma insulin. CLA lowered plasma cholesterol but increased plasma and liver triglycerides, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin. Elaidic acid lowered plasma and liver cholesterol. Proteomics identified significant regulation of 65 cytosolic and 8-membrane proteins. Many of these proteins were related to lipid and glucose metabolism, and to oxidative stress. Principal component analysis revealed that fish oil had a major impact on cytosolic proteins, and elaidic acid on membrane proteins. Correlation analysis between physiological and protein data revealed novel clusters of correlated variables, among which a metabolic syndrome cluster. The combination of proteomics and physiology gave new insights in mechanisms by which these dietary fatty acids regulate lipid metabolism and related pathways, for example, by altering protein levels of long-chain acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase and adipophilin in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1967192674,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) is an essential scaffolding protein required to recruit the 43 S complex to the 5′-end of mRNA during translation initiation. We have previously demonstrated that eIF4GI protein expression is translationally regulated. This regulation is mediated by cis-acting RNA elements, including an upstream open reading frame and an IRES that directs synthesis of five eIF4GI protein isoforms via alternative AUG initiation codon selection. Here, we further characterize eIF4GI IRES function and show that eIF4GI is expressed from several distinct mRNAs that vary via alternate promoter use and alternate splicing. Several mRNA variants contain the IRES element. We found that IRES activity mapped to multiple regions within the eIF4GI RNA sequence, but not within the 5′-UTR per se. However, the 5′-UTR enhanced IRES activity in vivo and played a role in initiation codon selection. The eIF4GI IRES was active when transfected into cells in an RNA form, and thus, does not require nuclear processing events for its function. However, IRES activity was found to be dependent upon the presence, in cis, of a 5′ m7guanosine-cap. Despite this requirement, the eIF4GI IRES was activated by 2A protease cleavage of eIF4GI, in vitro, and retained the ability to promote translation during poliovirus-mediated inhibition of cap-dependent translation. These data indicate that intact eIF4GI protein is not required for the de novo synthesis of eIF4GI, suggesting its expression can continue under stress or infection conditions where eIF4GI is cleaved. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) is an essential scaffolding protein required to recruit the 43 S complex to the 5′-end of mRNA during translation initiation.

These data indicate that intact eIF4GI protein is not required for the de novo synthesis of eIF4GI, suggesting its expression can continue under stress or infection conditions where eIF4GI is cleaved. The initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis is a highly regulated process utilized to control global protein synthesis and to differentially control expression from specific mRNAs. The majority of cellular mRNAs translate cap-dependently by virtue of a 5′ m7-guanosine (m7G) cap, which is specifically recognized and bound by eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; MOI, multiplicity of infection; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PABP, polyadenosine-binding protein; ITAF, IRES transactivating factors; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RL, Renilla luciferase; FL, firefly luciferase; uORF, upstream open reading frame. 4E (eIF4E). During translation initiation eIF4E is part of a protein complex, termed eIF4F, which also contains the RNA helicase eIF4A, and the large scaffolding protein eIF4G (for a review see Ref. 1Prevot D. Darlix J.-L. Ohlmann T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). eIF4G, in particular, is crucial for recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, 5′-3′ interactions on mRNA and AUG initiation codon selection (2Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Two genes encode eIF4G, and their protein products are termed eIF4GI and eIF4GII. eIF4GI comprises the majority of total eIF4G in cells as revealed by examination of protease cleavage products of purified eIF4F (3Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). eIF4GI can be functionally divided into three domains, separated by caspase-3 cleavage sites (3Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Morley S.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cleavage product binds to polyadenosine-binding protein (PABP), whereas the central portion encodes the eIF4E interaction sequences and a HEAT repeat domain responsible for eIF3, eIF4A, and RNA interactions (6Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 7Marcotrigiano J. Lomakin I.B. Sonenberg N. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The C-terminal cleavage fragment encodes a second eIF4A binding region and can recruit the mitogen-activated protein (MAP); MAP kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) (8Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that the central domain encompassing the eIF4E, eIF3, and eIF4A binding domains is sufficient to support cap-dependent translation initiation (9De Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4865-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). eIF4G plays a central role in translation initiation, thus eIF4G function is frequently targeted to regulate protein synthesis. Many regulatory processes modulate eIF4G function by displacement of proteins normally bound to eIF4G. For example, during serum starvation and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection, dephosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) results in the removal of eIF4E from eIF4G. This, in turn, leads to a down-regulation of global cap dependent translation (10Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y. Belsham G.J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5578-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Mader S. Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the function of eIF4G can be modified by proteolytic cleavage, which separates specific eIF4G binding domains from each other. For instance, rhinovirus, poliovirus (PV), Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) encode proteases that cleave eIF4G and separate the eIF4E and PABP binding domain from the central domain, resulting in a down-regulation of cellular, cap-dependent translation initiation (12Etchison D.

Liebig H.D. Skern T. Virology. 1994; 198: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, the protease expressed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cleaves eIF4G, separating the N-terminal (including the eIF4E interaction site) and C-terminal regions from the eIF3-binding central fragment, also resulting in a dramatic inhibition of host translation (17Ventoso I. Blanco R. Perales C. Carrasco L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12966-12971Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other cellular proteases activated during PV infection have also been shown to cleave eIF4GI, separating the eIF4E and PABP interaction domains from the remainder of the protein in a cleavage similar to that mediated by PV 2A protease (19Zamora M. Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Control of translation initiation can also be mediated via proteolytic cleavage of eIF4GI in uninfected cells. During apoptosis, caspase cleavage of several translation initiation factors, including eIF4G, results in a down-regulation of cap-dependent translation. In this case, eIF4GI cleavage by caspase-3 separates putative regulatory regions in the N and C termini from the core domain, which binds to eIF4E, eIF3, and RNA (3Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During virus-induced inhibition of cap-dependent translation most cellular mRNAs cannot be effectively translated; however, viral RNAs continue to translate via specialized RNA sequences that mediate translation initiation. During PV infection, cellular protein synthesis is down-regulated by the viral 2A and 3C proteases, which cleave eIF4G and PABP, respectively (13Rose J.K. Trachsel H. Leong K. Baltimore D. Proc.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Translation of the viral polyprotein is maintained by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) present in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of PV RNA (22Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). The PV IRES can mediate translation initiation independent of a m7G cap and eIF4E by recruitment of the translation apparatus directly to the IRES. RNA-binding proteins (e.g. polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2)), known as IRES transactivating factors (ITAFs), have been shown to stimulate PV IRES function (23Hellen C.U.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A variety of other viral RNAs have been shown to translate from IRES elements (e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV), EMCV, rhinovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HIV), and ITAFs are also implicated in these processes (for a review see Ref. 26Kean K.M. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the translation of certain cellular mRNAs is also maintained during cap-dependent translation inhibition, (e.g. during viral infection) (27Johannes G. Carter M. Eisen M. Brown P. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Two known mechanisms of translation initiation operate under conditions when cap-dependent scanning has been down-regulated. First, like their viral counterparts, some cellular RNAs can translate via IRES elements (e.g. c-IAP1, c-Myc, and BiP) (28Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Yang Q. Sarnow P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2800-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Nanbru C. Lafon I.

These elements are defined by the ability to mediate translation initiation from the second cistron of dicistronic RNAs (22Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). As has been demonstrated for viral IRESs, these cellular IRESs do not require cap-dependent scanning and recruit ITAFs to enhance their function (31Stoneley M. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3200-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, other mRNAs continue to translate via a discontinuous scanning mechanism, known as shunting (e.g. Hsp70), which requires the presence of a m7G-cap (32Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). As currently defined, translation shunting elements do not function in dicistronic RNAs, and consist of two sequences, the cap proximal shunt donor and AUG proximal shunt acceptor which enable scanning ribosomes to bypass or jump over large regions of RNA leader sequences (32Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). Both IRES and shunting mechanisms can mediate translation initiation when cap-dependent scanning is repressed, however, the fundamental mechanism by which this is accomplished differs (33Johannes G.

Several reports have described IRES activity in eIF4GI RNA; however, confusion has been generated because some investigations tested mutually exclusive and distinct regions of the eIF4GI gene. The original sequence reported for human eIF4GI mRNA contained a 5′ leader that was reported to encode an IRES (35Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence did not contain the complete eIF4GI ORF, encoded only the smallest of the eIF4GI isoforms (isoform e), and was subsequently suggested to contain intronic sequences appended to the ORF (37Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These intron sequences were later shown to have promoter activity that could have been misinterpreted as IRES activity in dicistronic assays (39Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 7372-7384Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However another group demonstrated that native eIF4GI mRNA co-sedimented with polysomes during poliovirus infection, suggesting that eIF4GI protein expression does not require cap-dependent scanning (33Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further experiments in our laboratory also supported the hypothesis that eIF4GI mRNA contained IRES activity in a separate region of the mRNA that mapped to the ORF (38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the eIF4GI expression scheme we characterized the eIF4GI mRNA species expressed in HeLa cells. Here we demonstrate that eIF4GI is expressed from multiple mRNA species that originate from three separate promoters and are further altered by alternate splicing that modifies the leader sequences on mRNAs. We further characterized the IRES element embedded within the ORF on most of the eIF4GI mRNAs. We show that these eIF4GI RNA sequences directed translation initiation internally when placed in dicistronic constructs and this translation was resistant to inhibition of cap-dependent translation in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that this eIF4GI translation control element is by convention an IRES. However, we found that the eIF4GI IRES-like element also shares characteristics with shunting sequences, in that it only functions within m7G-capped RNA. Taken together our finding support a complex model of eIF4GI translation regulation via both cap-dependent scanning and IRES-mediated mechanisms. Interplay between these mechanisms may dynamically control eIF4GI expression in response to changing cellular translation conditions. Further, an IRES allows the cell to regulate global translation via eIF4GI cleavage and still continue translation of eIF4GI to restore those levels. RT-PCR—HeLa cell S10 lysates were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and total cytoplasmic RNA precipitated according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) with either avian myeloblastosis virus or moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega); in each case the reactions were primed with random decamers (Ambion). RT reactions were then subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the Master Mix Taq polymerase (Promega) with a common 3′ primer (5′-gccccagacatgatctcctctgtgat-3′) and 5′ primers selected to amplify endogenous transcribed from each of the three eIF4GI promoters, α-promoter (5′-ccggaaatggttgtggactacgtctgt-3′), β-promoter (5′-cctgtgtgcccctgggccaggcccg-3′), or γ-promoter (5′-gttctagatgggggtcctgggccccag-3′). DNA products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis excised, and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified DNA was ligated into pGEM-TEasy vectors (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 5′ and 3′ DNA sequencing of the recovered, amplified DNA was performed using standard oligonucleotides which annealed to the T7 and SP6 sequences that flanked each insert (Lone Star Labs). DNA Constructs-pRL—HL was a kind gift from S. M. Lemon (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) and has been previously described (40Honda S. Kaneko S. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Abell G.A. Lemon S.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). pBS/U6ApaI is from Y. Shi (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and has also been described (41Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). pBS/U6-RLi was constructed via sequential insertion of two sets of annealed oligonucleotides. Briefly, oligonucleotides 5′-ggatgaatggcctgatattga-3′ and 5′-agcttcaatatcaggccattcatcc-3′ were annealed and ligated into pBS/U6ApaI, which was prepared by; digesting with ApaI, blunting with T4 polymerase, and then digesting with HindIII. This new construct was isolated, digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and then annealed oligonucleotides 5′-agcttcaatatcaggccattcatccctttttg-3′ and 5′-aattcaaaaagggatgaatggcctgatattga-3′ were ligated into the plasmid to generate pBS/U6-RLi. This plasmid mediates DNA polymerase III expression of a ∼50 nucleotide RNA hairpin, which is processed by Dicer and subsequently directs degradation of RL ORF containing transcripts via RNA interference (RNAi) (41Sui G.

RNA. 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). pSV-βGal, pGL3 Control, and pRL-CMV were obtained from Promega. The construction of pRL-HL and pRL-revHL, which each have a 35-nucleotide polyadenosine tract following the FL ORF were detailed previously (28Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pRL-FL was constructed by removing the NcoI fragment from pRL-GFP (38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (encoding the CMV promoter and RL) and insertion into the NcoI site of pGL3-Enhancer (Promega). pRL-4Gα-FL was constructed by obtaining the ∼780-bp NotI fragment from pGEM-TEasy-4Gα (obtained by RT-PCR) that was inserted into the Bsp120I site of pRL-GFP to generate pRL-4Gα-GFP. 5′ PCR primer was designed based on RACE analysis of HeLa mRNA. Subsequently the ∼2.0-kb PstI-AgeI fragment from pRL-4Gα-GFP was ligated into the PstI-AgeI sites of pRL-FL, to produce pRL-4Gα-FL. The exon 5 region was deleted from pRL-4Gα-FLpA by using long distance PCR as previously described (44Sherrill K.W. Byrd M.P. Van Eden M.E. Lloyd R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29066-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers 5′-ctggcggggctgagaaggcgtgttcatttgtg-3′ and 5′-gggcgttccacatacgttgtcccgacacagc-3′ were used for PCR to amplify all but the exon 5 region from pRL-4Gα-FLpA, and the resulting product DNA was DpnI-treated and -ligated, thus generating pRL-4Gα5Δ-FLpA. pRL-4G610Δ-FL, pRL-4G339Δ-FL, and pRL-4GΔ697-FL were constructed by PCR amplification of eIF4GI nucleotides (β clone) 3–610, 3–339, or 697–873 from pSP4GI using primers; 5′-taagcggccgcttgtgtgcccctgggccaggcccgaa-3′ and 5′-gcgaccggtgtggaacgcccctgtccaggg-3′ (3–610) or 5′-taagcggccgcttgtgtgcccctgggccaggcccgaa-3′ and 5′-gcgaccggtggaagcgctggctgtgggagtccg-3′ (3–339) or, 5′-taagcggccgctggcgcctactatccagcccga-3′ and 5′-gcgaccggtgccccagacatgatctcctctgtgat-3′, (697–873). Product DNAs were digested with NotI and AgeI, before ligation into the Bsp120I and AgeI sites of pRL-GFP, to generate plasmids pRL-4G610Δ-GFP, pRL-4G339Δ-FL, and pRL-4GΔ697-FL, respectively. Again the ∼2.0-kb PstI-AgeI fragments from these plasmids were inserted into the PstI-AgeI sites of pRL-FL, to produce plasmids pRL-4G610Δ-FL, pRL-4G339Δ-FL, and pRL-4GΔ697-FL, respectively. To produce plasmids pRL-4GΔ275-FL and phpRL-4GΔ275-FL, the ∼1.5-kb NcoI fragments from pRL-4G-(275–873)-GFP and phpRL-4G (275–873)-GFP (38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were cloned into the NcoI site of pRL-FL. pRL-4GΔ497-FL was constructed by PCR amplification of eIF4GI nucleotides 497–873 from pSP4GI using primers 5′-gcccagctgcccatgtctaccctgc-3′ and 5′-gccccagacatgatctcctctgtgat-3′. PCR DNA products were directly ligated into pGEM-TEasy then removed with NotI digestion and inserted into the Bsp120I site of pRL-GFP, to generate plasmids pRL-4GΔ497-GFP. The ∼1.5-kb NcoI fragment from pRL-4GΔ497-GFP was then inserted into the NcoI site of pRL-FL to yield plasmid pRL-4GΔ497-FL. To construct pRL-4Gβ-FL, the 2.1-kb BglII fragment from pRL-4G610δ-FL was ligated into pRL-4Gα-FL, which had been digested with BglII. A thirty nucleotide (nt) poly(A) stretch terminated by a HindIII site was added to plasmids, pRL-4Gα-FL, pRL-4Gβ-FL, pRL-4GΔ275-FL, and pRL-4Gα5Δ-FL, by cutting each with XbaI and FseI, and ligating the plasmids with two annealed oligonucleotides 5′-ctagaga(a30)-gcttggccgg-3′ and 5′-ccaagct(t30)ct-3′. These changes are indicated in the plasmid designations by the addition of pA after the name of the parent vector. The plasmids p4Gα-FLpA and p4GΔ275-FLpA were constructed by digesting plasmids pRL-4Gα-FLpA and pRL-4GΔ275-FLpA with SacII and HindIII. Digested DNA was then ligated into pBluescript KS+ (pBS) (Stratagene), which had been digested with SacII and HindIII, to produce plasmids pRL-4Gα-FLpA and pRL-4GΔ275-FLpA, respectively. Plasmid pHL was constructed by digesting pRL-HLpA with NotI and KpnI, and ligating this DNA fragment into (pBS), which was digested with NotI and KpnI. Plasmid pRL was generated by digesting pRL-4Gα-FLpA with PmeI and XbaI (to remove eIF4G and FL sequences), then filling-in DNA overhangs with T4 polymerase, and religating the vector. The plasmid p-EGFP has been previously described (38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to generate p4Gα-EGFP and p4GΔ275-EGFP, pRL-4Gα-GFP, and pRL-4GΔ275-EGFP respectively, were digested with NheI, and PmeI, overhangs were blunted with T4 polymerase and then relegated, thus deleting the RL ORF. In Vitro Transcription—Run-off RNA T7 transcription reactions were preformed generally as previously described (43Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with the inclusion of m7GpppG (Ambion, Austin, TX) or ApppG (New England Biolabs) to cap RNAs and [32P]ATP (ICN) for radiolabeling where indicated. Template plasmid DNA was linearized by endonuclease digestion; for plasmids lacking a poly(A) region digests were performed with BamHI (pRL-FL, pRL-HCV-FL, pRL-revH-FL) or with XbaI (all other plasmids), for transcription of poly(A)-tailed RNA digests were performed either with AgeI (pRL-FL, pRL-HL, pRL-revHL) or with HindIII (all other poly(A) plasmids) (all enzymes were from New England Biolabs). Following transcription, reactions were treated RQ-DNase (Promega), extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and RNA precipitated with 50% isopropyl alcohol and 2 m ammonium acetate. Precipitated RNA was reconstituted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl by as determined by UV-absorbance at 260 nm. Cell Culture—293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum) (Hyclone) and were re-plated every 3 days at one-fifth the cell concentration. HeLa S3 cells were maintained in suspension in S-MEM containing penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, 9% calf serum, and 1% fetal bovine serum. Nucleic Acid Transfection—DNA transfections into cells were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was transfected into cells as previously described (43Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using DMRIE-C reagent (Sigma). Poliovirus Infection and Time Course—Preparations of Poliovirus type 1 Mahoney were prepared as previously described (19Zamora M. Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and titers were determined by plaque assay on HeLa S3 cell monolayers. Infections at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) were performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 0.5 h followed by replacement of the infection media with serum containing media. Metabolic labeling of cells was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine (Invitrogen) supplemented with dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml Tran-label [35S]methionine/cysteine (Met/Cys) (ICN). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (PLB) (Promega) for 10 min at 22 °C, and nuclei removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysate supernatants were precleared by incubation in PLB plus protease inhibitors and 25 μl of 50% protein A-agarose (Sigma) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. After removal of the protein A-agarose beads by sedimentation, 5 μl of monoclonal anti-AFP antibody (Calbiochem) were added to each reaction in addition to 25 μl of fresh protein A-agarose beads (50% suspension), and samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. After being allowed to settle, beads were washed once with 1 ml of PLB, and twice with 1 ml of IP wash buffer (25 mm Hepes pH: 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% deoxycholic acid). Protein was eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assay were preformed as previously described (28Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). In Vitro Translation—Translation of transcript RNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (Promega) was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h as previously described (38Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Preparation of HeLa cell translation lysates was accomplished as described in (21Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Van Eden M.E. Younan P.

We examined the effects of HA at several molecular weights on osteoclast formation and function induced by RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) in a mouse monocyte cell line (RAW 264.7). HA at Mr < 8,000 (low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA)) enhanced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cell formation and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity induced by RANKL in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HA at Mr > 900,000 (high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA)) showed no effect on osteoclast differentiation. LMW-HA enhanced pit formation induced by RAW 264.7 cells, whereas HMW-HA did not, and LMW-HA stimulated the expression of RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB) protein in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, we found that LMW-HA enhanced the levels of c-Src protein and phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 MAPK in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with RANKL, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. This enhancement of c-Src and RANK proteins induced by LMW-HA was inhibited by CD44 function-blocking monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that LMW-HA plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation and function through the interaction of RANKL and RANK.

HA is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan in mammalian tissue and is present in high concentrations in connective tissues as well as in skin, the vitreous humor of the eye, cartilage, and umbilical cord tissue. The largest single reservoir is the synovial fluid of diarthroses joints, where concentrations of 0.5–4 mg/ml have bee found (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). In rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the molecular weight and concentration of HA in synovial fluid are reduced, probably due to abnormal biosynthesis by synovial type B cells and free radical depolymerization of the HA chain (3Dahl L.B. Dahl I.M. Engstrom-Laurent A. Granath K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1985; 44: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These changes in the rheological properties of synovial fluid in arthritic joints may contribute to disease progression because articular cartilage, subchondral bone, and synovial connective tissues are subjected to increased mechanical stress when the viscoelastic and lubricating properties of HA are diminished. Many studies have reported the biological effects of HA on chondrocytes (4Larsen N.E. Lpmbard K.M. Parent E.G. Balazs E.A. J. Orthop.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HA affects the catabolic activity of the cartilage matrix by inducing the production of TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) by bovine chondrocytes (6Yasui Y. Akatsuka M. Tobetto K. Umemoto J. Ando T. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Biomed. Res. 1992; 13: 343-348Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sakamoto et al. (12Sakamoto T. Mizuno S. Maki T. Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Iwata H. Orthop. Res. Sci. 1984; 11: 264-266Google Scholar) reported that high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) injected into the joint cavity becomes attached to the surface of articular cartilage, where it exerts chondroprotective effects. Extrinsic HA has also been shown to penetrate degenerated cartilage and to reach the surface of chondrocytes (13Fukuda K. Dan H. Takayama M. Kumano F. Saitoh M. Tanaka S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 277: 1672-1675Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies using synovial fibroblasts have indicated that synovial type B cells, the major source of synovial HMW-HA, lead to de novo synthesis of HMW-HA (14Smith M.M. Gosh P. Rheumatol. Int. 1987; 7: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In a previous study utilizing high performance liquid chromatography (15Takahashi T. Tominaga K. Takano H. Ariyoshi W. Habu M. Fukuda J. Maeda H. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 2004; 33: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the molecular weights of HA in synovial fluid from temporomandibular joint samples from patients with internal derangement and osteoarthritis are decreased probably due to free radical depolymerization of the HA chain and/or abnormal biosynthesis by the synovium. The results of that study shed light on the mechanisms of the changes in joint lubrication and the pathology of the temporomandibular joint. Several researchers have reported the involvement of the interaction between CD44 and HA in bone resorption (2Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 16Prince C.W. BMC Musculoskelet. Disord. 2004; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/5/12)PubMed Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K.

However, less attention has been paid to the effect of low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA) on osteoclast formation induced by RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand). In this study, we examined the effects of HA at several molecular weights on osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and found that LMW-HA enhanced both osteoclast formation and function in vitro. Reagents and Antibodies—HA at several molecular weights (4-mer, 12-mer, and Mr = 8,000, 900,000, and 2,000,000) was kindly supplied by Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Human recombinant soluble RANKL was purchased from Pepro Tech EC Ltd. (London, United Kingdom). Anti-c-Src monoclonal antibody and anti-RANK polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-ERK, and anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem. CD44 function-blocking monoclonal antibody (BRIC 235) was obtained from the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (Bristol, United Kingdom). Cell Culture—Mouse monocyte RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in collagen-coated dishes (Asahi Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan). Cell Viability—RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 102 cells/well 1 day before the experiment and then stimulated with RANKL and HA at several molecular weights. The stimulated cells were cultured for 1, 2, 5, or 6 days, after which a stock 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (2.5 mg/ml, 20 μl/well; Sigma) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. Next, acid/isopropyl alcohol (100 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol) was added and mixed thoroughly, and the plates were read using a Multiskan Bichromatic microplate reader (Lab-systems, Helsinki, Finland), with a test wavelength of 540 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm (18Okahashi N. Nakamura I. Jimi E. Koide M. Suda T. Nishihara T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Differentiation of Osteoclasts—Osteoclasts were detected by staining with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (Sigma) (19Kotake S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Matsuzaki K. Itoh K. Ishiyama S. Saito S. Inoue K. Kamatani N. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Suda T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). In brief, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (5.0 × 102 cells/well) in the presence of RANKL (40 ng/ml), HA at several molecular weights, or SB203580. After culturing for the indicated times, the adherent cells were fixed and stained for TRAP activity. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing three or more nuclei were considered to be osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) and were counted under a microscope. TRAP Activity—For the TRAP activity assay, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (5.0 × 102 cells/well) in the presence of RANKL (40 ng/ml), HA (100 ng/ml) at several molecular weights, or SB203580 for 6 days. The treated RAW 264.7 cells were suspended in 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and then frozen and thawed three times. TRAP activities in the supernatants were analyzed using a phenyl phosphate substrate kit (Sanseiphospha KII-Test-Wako, Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions (20Kind P.R. King E.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1954; 7: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Bone Resorption Assay—To estimate bone resorption activity, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 14 days with RANKL (40 ng/ml) and HA (100 ng/ml) at several molecular weights on BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ multitest slides, which consisted of submicron synthetic calcium phosphate thin films coated onto various culture vessels (BD Biosciences). The cells were removed using 6% NaOCl and 5.2% NaCl, and the number of the resorption pits formed in each well was counted under a microscope. Western Blot Analysis—RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 105) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of RANKL (40 ng/ml) and HA (100 μg/ml) at several molecular weights (Mr = 8,000 and 2,000,000), SB203580 (10–6m), or BRIC 235 (5 μg/ml) on 6-well plates. Adherent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl containing 2% SDS and 10% glycerol, pH 6.8). Protein contents were measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membranes in 10% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, and the membrane was washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation with diluted primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-c-Src, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, and anti-RANK primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used in this experiment. After washing the membranes, chemiluminescence was produced using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). After exposure to film, the membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to confirm equal loading. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences were determined using an unpaired Student's t test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Effects of RANKL and HA on Cell Growth—We examined the effects of RANKL and HA at several molecular weights on the proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide viability assay. HA had no effect on RAW 264.7 cell growth after 1, 2, 5, and 6 days of culture with RANKL (data not shown). LMW-HA Up-regulates Osteoclast Differentiation Induced by RANKL—Culturing LMW-HA activated the differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells into OCLs via RANKL in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas HMW-HA had almost no effect. The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was maximized at higher concentrations (100 ng/ml) in this experiment; however, LMW-HA alone did not induce OCL formation (data not shown). Incubation with LMW-HA and RANKL for 0–2 days was adequate to enhance OCL formation in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1C). LMW-HA Up-regulates TRAP Activity Induced by RANKL— We examined the effects of RANKL in the presence of HA at several molecular weights on the TRAP activity of RAW 264.7 cells using the phenyl phosphate substrate method. As shown in Fig. 2, RANKL alone enhanced TRAP activity in RAW 264.7 cells; however, when the cells were incubated with both RANKL and LMW-HA, the level of TRAP expression was 1.5-fold higher than in cells treated with RANKL alone. In contrast, HMW-HA had no effect on RANKL-induced TRAP activity in RAW 264.7 cells. LMW-HA Stimulates Bone Resorption Induced by RANKL— To determine whether LMW-HA affects osteoclast function, differentiated RAW 264.7 cells were cultured on Osteologic™ multitest slides with RANKL (40 ng/ml) in the presence of HA (100 μg/ml) at several molecular weights. LMW-HA enhanced the stimulatory effect of RANKL on bone resorption (Fig. 3), whereas it had no effect on basal bone resorption, with or without RANKL. LMW-HA Enhances the Expression of RANK Protein in RAW 264.7 Cells—We also examined RANK expression in RAW 264.7 cells by immunoblot analysis. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 6–72 h in the presence or absence of RANKL and HA at several molecular weights. Interestingly, treatment with LMW-HA alone induced RANK expression and enhanced the expression level in RAW 264.7 cells treated with RANKL, whereas HMW-HA had no effect on the level of RANK protein expression (Fig. 4). LMW-HA Enhances RANKL-induced Expression of c-Src Protein in RAW 264.7 Cells—Next, we investigated the effect of RANKL and HA at several molecular weights on the expression of c-Src protein in RAW 264.7 cells by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, the level of c-Src protein expression was increased in cells following stimulation with RANKL. Furthermore, c-Src protein expression was up-regulated upon the addition of LMW-HA in a time-dependent manner up to 72 h. LMW-HA Enhances RANKL-induced Activation of MAPKs in RAW 264.7 Cells—The effects of RANKL and HA at several molecular weights on the activation of ERKs at Mr = 42,000 and 44,000 in RAW 264.7 cells were investigated (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis revealed that phosphorylated ERKs were detected within 15 min and reached a plateau at 30 min after the addition of RANKL. When the cells were incubated with both RANKL and LMW-HA, the level of ERK phosphorylation was higher than in cells treated with RANKL alone. In contrast, the total amounts of ERK protein were not affected by treatment with RANKL and HA. We also examined the effects of RANKL and HA at several molecular weights on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in osteoclast precursors. Fig. 7 shows the time course of changes in the level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to RANKL in RAW 264.7 cells. p38 MAPK was phosphorylated within 30 min in response to RANKL, and phosphorylation reached a maximum level within 60 min. LMW-HA stimulated the RANKL-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK; however, there was no change in the level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation upon treatment with LMW-HA alone. Furthermore, the total amounts of p38 MAPK protein in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with RANKL were unchanged in the presence and absence of HA at all time periods tested. SB203580 Inhibits the Differentiation of RAW 264.7 Cells Induced by RANKL and LMW-HA—To further examine the role of p38 MAPK in RANKL- and HA-mediated osteoclast differentiation, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with RANKL, HA at several molecular weights, or SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK). A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide viability assay showed that SB203580 had no significant effect on the proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown), whereas it inhibited the induction of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells by RANKL and LMW-HA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8). To confirm that p38 MAPK was inhibited by SB203580, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with RANKL and HA at several molecular weights in the presence and absence of SB203580. Western blot analysis revealed that SB203580 inhibited p38 MAPK activity mediated by RANKL and LMW-HA (Fig. 9).Fig. 9Effect of SB203580 on phosphorylated p38 protein in RAW 264.7 cells treated with RANKL and HA. RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to RANKL (40 ng/ml) and SB203580 (10–6m) in the presence of HA (100 μg/ml) at several molecular weights. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis.

Western blot analysis revealed that the monoclonal antibody inhibited the enhancement of c-Src and RANK protein expression mediated by LMW-HA (Fig. 10). In this study, we used a homogeneous clonal population of murine monocyte RAW 264.7 cells to elucidate the direct effects of RANKL and HA on osteoclast differentiation and function. This cell line is known to express RANK and to differentiate into TRAP-positive cells when cultured with bone slices and RANKL (21Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstn C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Lelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia L.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The main advantage of this system is that it does not contain any osteoblast/bone marrow stromal cells, which may also be targets of RANKL and LMW-HA actions. We focused on pre-osteoclast cells to examine the effects of RANKL and LMW-HA on differentiation and function. We also found that LMW-HA activated OCL formation induced by RANKL in mouse bone marrow culture (data not shown). These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of LMW-HA on OCL formation is involved in the RANKL-mediated signaling pathway in mouse bone marrow cells as well as RAW 264.7 cells. RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, triggers osteoclastogenesis by forming a complex with RANK, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. The binding of RANKL to RANK results in a cascade of intracellular events, including the activation of the intracellular adaptor protein family in pre-osteoclast cells (21Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstn C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Lelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia L.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B.

Our results show that LMW-HA markedly increases the level of RANK protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells. It is possible that LMW-HA changes RANK action, with an ultimate increase in osteoclast development in addition to increases in RANK production. Bone resorption is a multistep process initiated by the proliferation of immature osteoclast precursors, which is followed by the commitment of those cells to the osteoclast phenotype and degradation of the organic and inorganic phases of bone by mature resorptive cells. Like their in vivo counterparts, in vitro generated osteoclasts are capable of bone resorption. When cultured with bone or dentin, osteoclasts excavate resorptive lacunae, or pits, which are similar to the structures formed when the cells degrade bone in vivo, and the number and size of the resorption lacunae formed in vitro are used as a quantitative measure of osteoclast activity (24Fuller K. Thong J.T. Breton B.C. Chambers T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we used Osteologic™ slides coated with calcium phosphate substrate and observed the up-regulation of the pit-forming activity of OCLs stimulated with RANKL. RANKL increases the level of c-Src protein, another marker molecule of osteoclast differentiation (25Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 29: 1504-1508Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar) that is a widely expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase particularly abundant in platelets and neural tissues (26Clark E.A.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). c-Src plays an essential role in osteoclast function, as mice in which the src gene has been disrupted show normal osteoclast development, but fail to resorb bone, resulting in osteopetrosis (30Soriano P. Montgomery P. Gese R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). In the present TRAP activity results, the expression of c-Src induced by RANKL was enhanced by LMW-HA, suggesting that the enhanced osteoclast formation by LMW-HA is not caused by stimulating the proliferation of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, but rather by increasing the number of cells committed to osteoclast lineage, which are responsive to RANKL-mediated terminal differentiation to mature osteoclasts. MAPK family members are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that are important for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (31Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem.

MAPK family members are classified into the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK groups, and it is widely accepted that peptide growth factors and phorbol esters preferentially activate ERKs, whereas cellular stress, such as that caused by hyperosmolarity or reactive oxygen species, potently activates JNKs and p38 MAPKs (35Iwasaki S.

A previous study has shown that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway plays an important role in the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of precursor bone marrow cells (38Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In this study, RANKL-induced activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK was clearly detected, and LMW-HA enhanced the activities of both kinases in RAW 264.7 cells. The pyridinyl imidazole SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (39Lee J.C. Kumar S. Griswold D.E. Underwood D.C. Votta B.J. Adams J.L. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), has been widely used to investigate the roles of p38 MAPK in the regulation of cell differentiation and function (37Cobb M.H.

Votta B.J. Rieman D.J. Badger A.M. Gowen M. Lee J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p38 MAPK-mediated signals regulate osteoclast differentiation or function. In this study, SB203580, but not PD98059, inhibited differentiation and TRAP activity induced by RANKL and LMW-HA, whereas it inhibited only p38 MAPK activity in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 9). Our findings suggest that p38 MAPK may play a critical role in RANKL/LMW-HA-induced osteoclast formation in RAW 264.7 cells. However, we cannot rule out the possible involvement of ERK in osteoclastogenesis. In our experiments, LMW-HA enhanced both the differentiation and function of RAW 264.7 cells when cultured with RANKL. Interestingly, HMW-HA had almost no effect on osteoclast formation and function.

Furthermore, there are no known reports concerning the pathological effects of different molecular weights of HA on osteoclastogenesis or its signal transduction in osteoclasts. Our results suggest that HA at low molecular weights is effective in enhancing osteoclast formation and function under inflammatory conditions (15Takahashi T. Tominaga K. Takano H. Ariyoshi W. Habu M. Fukuda J. Maeda H. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 2004; 33: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but suggest that it is caused by the interaction of HA and HA-binding protein in joint tissues under pathological conditions. HA is a major component of synovial fluid and plays important roles in the joint cavity. CD44, one of the major HA-binding proteins, is expressed in several human cells, including lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and fibroblasts, as well as in several kinds of tumor cells (42Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culty et al. (43Culty M. O'Mara T.E. Underhill C.B. Yeager Jr., H. Swartz R.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mature alveolar macrophages may be involved in regulating HA levels in the lung and suggested that the binding of HA and CD44 leads to the efficient degradation of HA. Furthermore, it has been reported that CD44-mediated degradation of HA may play an essential role during embryonic morphogenesis and the development of some organs, such as the liver, spleen, and thymus; bone marrow; and hair follicles. More recently, Cao et al. (44Cao J.J. Singleton P.A. Majumdar S. Boudignon B. Burghardt A. Kurimoto P. Wronski T.J. Bourguinon L.Y. Harlloran B.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 30-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that HA activates CD44 to stimulate RANKL expression in bone marrow stromal cells. In this study, we found that CD44 function-blocking monoclonal antibody remarkably inhibited the effect of HA on the signal introduction of c-Src and RANK in RAW 264.7 cells. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that the expression of CD44 in osteoclasts, which have the same lineage as alveolar macrophages, leads to the localized degradation of HA in the joint cavity, which in turn leads to induction of osteoclast formation and activation mediated by LMW-HA in the surrounding tissues. Further study is needed to examine the correlations between LMW-HA and CD44 regarding the enhancement of osteoclast formation and activation induced by RANKL in bone marrow stromal cells as well as signal transduction during osteoclastogenesis in joint tissue destruction. We are grateful to Kyoko Imai and Akihiro Tominaga for invaluable help with the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1992647667,"The PMCA (protein misfolding cyclic amplification) technique has been shown to drive the amplification of misfolded prion protein by PrP(Sc) seeds during several cycles of incubation-sonication. Here, we report that cyclic amplification of normal hamster brain homogenates treated with a number of transition metals (manganese [Mn], copper [Cu], and iron [Fe]) leads to conversion of PrP(C) into protease-resistant PrP(res). The efficiency of PrP(res) formation and the glycoforms induced by Mn were different from those obtained by Cu and Fe. Previous results have shown higher Mn and lower Cu levels in the affinity-purified PrP(Sc) from the brain of prion diseases compared with normal hamster brain homogenates. We focused on Mn because we observed higher levels of Mn in whole brain, mitochondria, and scrapie-associated fibril-enriched fractions from the brains of animals with prion disease. In the presence of minute quantities of Mn-induced PrP(res) template with a large amount of PrP(C), PrP(res) amplification is observed. A metal chelater, EDTA reverses the effect of Mn on PrP(res) amplification, suggesting that Mn may play a role in the formation of PrP(res). It has been proposed that metal-catalyzed oxidation of PrP leads to the oxidation of amino acids and extensive aggregation of oxidized PrP. Carboxyl acids such as deoxycholic acid (DA) are oxidized molecules produced by 3' oxidation pathway. In in vitro studies, the potent effect of Mn on PrP(res) amplification is augmented by DA in a dose-dependent manner. On the basis of the evidence of the elevated Mn levels in scrapie-associated fibril (SAF)-enriched preparations from the brains of animals with prion disease, Mn-loaded PrP and oxidized molecules such as carboxyl acids may contribute to the formation of the scrapie isoform of PrP in prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2037610035,"The human norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) attenuates neuronal signaling by rapid NE clearance from the synaptic cleft, and NET is a target for cocaine and amphetamines as well as therapeutics for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In spite of its central importance in the nervous system, little is known about how NET substrates, such as NE, 1-methyl-4-tetrahydropyridinium (MPP+), or amphetamine, interact with NET at the molecular level. Nor do we understand the mechanisms behind the transport rate. Previously we introduced a fluorescent substrate similar to MPP+, which allowed separate and simultaneous binding and transport measurement (Schwartz, J. W., Blakely, R. D., and DeFelice, L. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 9768–9777). Here we use this substrate, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styrl)-N-methyl-pyridinium (ASP+), in combination with green fluorescent protein-tagged hNETs to measure substrate-transporter stoichiometry and substrate binding kinetics. Calibrated confocal microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy reveal that hNETs, which are homomultimers, bind one substrate molecule per transporter subunit. Substrate residence at the transporter, obtained from rapid on-off kinetics revealed in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, is 526 μs. Substrate residence obtained by infinite dilution is 1000 times slower. This novel examination of substrate-transporter kinetics indicates that a single ASP+ molecule binds and unbinds thousands of times before being transported or ultimately dissociated from hNET. Calibrated fluorescent images combined with mass spectroscopy give a transport rate of 0.06 ASP+/hNET-protein/s, thus 36,000 on-off binding events (and 36 actual departures) occur for one transport event. Therefore binding has a low probability of resulting in transport. We interpret these data to mean that inefficient binding could contribute to slow transport rates. The human norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) attenuates neuronal signaling by rapid NE clearance from the synaptic cleft, and NET is a target for cocaine and amphetamines as well as therapeutics for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In spite of its central importance in the nervous system, little is known about how NET substrates, such as NE, 1-methyl-4-tetrahydropyridinium (MPP+), or amphetamine, interact with NET at the molecular level. Nor do we understand the mechanisms behind the transport rate. Previously we introduced a fluorescent substrate similar to MPP+, which allowed separate and simultaneous binding and transport measurement (Schwartz, J. W., Blakely, R. D., and DeFelice, L. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 9768–9777). Here we use this substrate, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styrl)-N-methyl-pyridinium (ASP+), in combination with green fluorescent protein-tagged hNETs to measure substrate-transporter stoichiometry and substrate binding kinetics. Calibrated confocal microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy reveal that hNETs, which are homomultimers, bind one substrate molecule per transporter subunit. Substrate residence at the transporter, obtained from rapid on-off kinetics revealed in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, is 526 μs. Substrate residence obtained by infinite dilution is 1000 times slower. This novel examination of substrate-transporter kinetics indicates that a single ASP+ molecule binds and unbinds thousands of times before being transported or ultimately dissociated from hNET. Calibrated fluorescent images combined with mass spectroscopy give a transport rate of 0.06 ASP+/hNET-protein/s, thus 36,000 on-off binding events (and 36 actual departures) occur for one transport event. Therefore binding has a low probability of resulting in transport. We interpret these data to mean that inefficient binding could contribute to slow transport rates. Adrenergic signaling in the central nervous system modulates learning and memory, the fight-or-flight response, and the reception of pain (2Valentino R.J. Foote S.L. Aston-Jones G.

After stimulated or spontaneous NE release, NETs rapidly clear NE from the synaptic cleft via efficient transport system attenuating signaling (9Axelrod J. Kopin I.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1969; 31: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and recycling 90% of synaptic NE (10Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A polymorphism in hNET causing decreased uptake correlates with orthostatic intolerance (11Garland E.M. Hahn M.K. Ketch T.P. Keller N.R. Kim C.H. Kim K.S. Biaggioni I. Shannon J.R. Blakely R.D.

Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Drugs that block NETs or replace NE anomalously increase NE levels and prolong signaling. In particular, the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-tetrahydropyridinium (MPP+), an monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine, inhibits mitochondrial respiration and induces Parkinson disease symptoms (16Javitch J.A.

Understanding hNET and how substrates and drugs interact with this transporter are fundamental questions in neuroscience. The mechanism of NE transport and drug interfere are only partially understood, one obstacle being few data on substrate-transporter interactions. NET belongs to a gene family that uses the Na+ gradient to transport transmitters (14Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots and antibody accessibility data imply that NETs have 12 transmembrane domains with intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains II and III (14Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 17Savchenko V. Sung U. Blakely R.D. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1131-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A single gene encodes hNET (18Hahn M.K. Robertson D. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4470-4478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, biochemical evidence predicts that NETs are multimers (19Kocabas A.M. Rudnick G. Kilic F. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, related transporters for serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) function as multimers (20Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc.

Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) measured oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitation of tagged NETs. Thus, monoamine transporters function as homomultimers (27Sitte H.H. Farhan H. Javitch J.A. Mol. Intervent. 2004; 4: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but the number of bound substrates per functional unit is unknown. In vitro studies in tissue culture, resealed membrane vesicles, cultured cells, and synaptosomes demonstrate that NE accumulation saturates at micromolar concentrations, but Na+ and Cl- dependence saturate in the millimolar range (28Bonisch H. Fuchs G. Graefe K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 332: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The accepted mechanism for co-transporters is the fixed stoichiometry, alternating access model (29DeFelice L.J. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 352-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which predicts NET transports 1NE:1Na:1Cl roughly once per second (30Friedrich U. Bonisch H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Gu H.H. Wall S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6911-6916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, NET-mediated currents are 100 times larger than predicted by this model (32Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Duke B.J. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2197-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar currents exist in native cells (33Larsson H.P. Picaud S.A. Werblin F.S.

A. 2004; 101: 16046-16051Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the charge-to-substrate ratio is an important key to mechanism (39Rudnick G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we use fluorescence methodology and patch clamp to compare ASP+ binding, ASP+ transport, and ASP+-induced current. After adding ASP+, hNET-expressing cells intensify fluorescence initially to binding and secondarily to transport (1Schwartz J.W. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9768-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we use morphological markers to distinguish plasma membrane-localized ASP+ (bound to the cell surface) from mitochondrial ASP+ (transported into the cell). Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCS) with ASP+ and GFP-tagged hNETs, we directly measure substrate-transporter kinetics, substrate-transporter stoichiometry, transporter, and substrate surface density, transport rates, and charge/substrate ratios. These data provide a novel model of neurotransmitter co-transport, in which the rate-limiting step is not exclusively large conformation changes but also inefficient binding, expressed as the low probability of transport following binding. Reagents—Experiments were at room temperature unless noted. ASP+ and DiO were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), soluble recombinant EGFP from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and other chemicals from Sigma. Images were processed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). P. Bissel at Virginia Polytechnic synthesized deuterated ASP+. Methyliodide-d3 (84 ml, 1.4 mmol) was added to trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)-styryl]pyridine (100 mg, 0.45 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (2 ml), and added at 4 h to 20 ml of ether and filtered. The crude product crystallized from methanol gave pyridinium salt as purple needles (111 mg, 67%, m.p. 256 °C), validated by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stable lines expressing hNET (hNET-293) are previously described (32Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Duke B.J. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2197-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). N-terminal GFP-tagged hNET cDNA was a gift from S. Amara. Stable GFP-tagged hNET (GFP-hNET) cells (GFP-hNET-293) were generated by G418 antibiotic selection. HEK293 were FuGENE 6 transfected with GFP-hNET-293 cDNA. At 24 h, transfected cells were selected (G418 250 μg/ml) and colonies were examined for ASP+ or NE uptake. Stable lines were maintained under G418 selection. Radiometric and Mass Spectrometric Transport Assay—hNET-293 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates, 105 cells per well, 3 days before transport assays (90% confluence on 3rd day, media removed by aspiration). Cells were preincubated 10 min in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH, mm: 130 NaCl, 1.3 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4) with/without 10 μm desipramine (DS) before [3H]MPP+ or ASP+ exposure to define nonspecific uptake, well above the DS IC50. Between 0.5 and 10 μm there is no significance difference in DS displacement of substrate (data not shown, see Ref. 1Schwartz J.W. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9768-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After 5 min, cells were washed 3 times at 4 °C with KRH, and accumulated [3H]MPP+ was determined by liquid scintillation of 1% (w/v) SDS-solubilized cells; [ASP+] was determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). An electrospray (+ESI) LC-MS assay with selected reaction monitoring determined [ASP+] in hNET-293 cells (incubated in 2 μm ASP+ for 5 min with/without DS). Cells with ASP+ were solubilized in 1% SDS and treated with control [D]3-ASP+ and acetonitrile. Precipitated proteins were pelleted and discarded. Acetonitrile from the supernatant was evaporated and SDS was removed by polymeric anion exchange trap. High performance liquid chromatography was done on a Zorbax SB-C18, 5 μm, 2.1 × 50-mm column in water:acetonitrile gradient buffered with 10 mm ammonium acetate. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Finnigan TSQ-7000 triple quadrapole mass spectrometer with a standard API-1 electrospray ionization source with a 100-μl inner diameter deactivated fused silica capillary. Nitrogen was used for both sheath and auxiliary gas in the mass spectrometer in the selected reaction monitoring mode, to quantify ASP+ (mass to charge ratio, m/z 239 > 223) with [D]3-ASP+ (m/z 242 > 226) as an internal standard. No other significant chromatographic peaks were present in cell extracts at the retention time of ASP+ or internal standard. The lower limit measurement was 150 fm on a column (30 nm in cell extract). Absolute recovery of ASP+ from cell extracts was greater than 70%. The polymeric strong anion exchange trap reduced SDS content from 1 to ∼0.03%. Peak area ratios were evaluated using linear regression weighted with the inverse square of [ASP+]. Calibration range was 150–5000 fmol on the column (30–1000 nm ASP+ in original samples). Evaluation of multipoint calibrations in triplicate yielded concentrations of standards within 10% of the theoretical value. Microscopy—Cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated with poly-l-lysine 3 days before experimentation. Confocal and Spectra Imaging—Confocal images were taken as described previously (1Schwartz J.W. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9768-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar): culture medium was aspirated and cells immediately mounted on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope centrally focused on a monolayer using differential interference contrast. Autofluorescence was established from images taken 10 s before adding ASP+. The argon laser was tuned to 488 nm; emitted light was filtered with a 580-nm lp filter (λmax = 610 nm). ASP+ accumulation was measured from average pixel intensity of time-resolved fluorescent images in a differential interference contrast-identified region. Average pixel intensity was used to normalize the data. Membrane-localized ASP+ is defined by a line-scan (3 pixel width) corresponding to a differential interference contrast image. HEK293 cells endogenously accumulate ASP+ (41Stachon A. Schlatter E. Hohage H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 72-91Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar); NET-mediated ASP+ accumulation is defined as hNET-293 minus HEK293 fluorescence. Spectral images were collected using the Meta detector on the Zeiss 510. Emitted light was divided into 10-nm segments ranging from 550 to 700 nm. The average pixel intensity in a region of interest was used to generate an ASP+ spectrum. FLIM and Lifetime Spectroscopy—FLIM experiments were performed at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, in collaboration with N. Barry and E. Gratton (42Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar): hNET-293 cells were exposed to 2 μm ASP+ for 5 min before imaging, and in 2 μm ASP+ several intensity and lifetime images were collected. Lifetimes were established by measuring phase and modulation shifts for ASP+ fluorescence excited by a Ti-sapphire laser at 80 MHz tuned to 920 nm. Calculations for heterdyne frequency measurements are described in Refs. 43Jameson D.M. Gratton E. Hall R.D. Appl. Spectrosc. Rev. 1984; 20: 55-106Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 44Gratton E.

Instr. 1985; 14: 225-250Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar. The electronic delay was calibrated using 50 nm rhodamine. Lifetime spectroscopy was performed using a Life Spec spectrometer (Edinburgh, Scotland) coupled to a Ti-sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) producing femtosecond pulses at 1 MHz. TIRF Microscopy—TIRF images were collected on an Olympus IX-70 with TIRF illumination (Olympus, Melville, NY) and dual-view multi-image acquisition (Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM) with an Orca ER camera (Hamamstu, Bridgewater, NJ). Channel cross-talk (GFP signal in the ASP+ window, or vice versa) was measured by 10-s images taken before ASP+ exposure, and no cross-talk occurred. FCS—Simultaneous GFP-hNET and ASP+ measurements were taken on a Zeiss 510 with confocal II FCS module. GFP-hNET and ASP+ were excited with a 488-nm laser, with emitted light separated with 635 nm long pass dichrohic. GFP-hNET and ASP+ emission were filtered using a 505–530 and 585 band pass. No GFP signal was measured in the ASP+ channel, or vice versa. For all FCS data, the z-position was fixed at the cell membrane coverslip face to minimize mitochondrial contributions. If the ASP+ signal increased over the initial 10-s interval, data were discarded. ASP+ binding was equilibrated in <1 s (1Schwartz J.W. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9768-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We collected fluorescence for 10 s in 15 replicates, with auto- and cross-correlation functions determined for each replicate. The back aperture was overfilled to minimize one-photon FCS artifacts (46Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2300-2317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and the focal volume was calibrated using 30 nm rhodamine 6G. FCS measures fluctuations in fluorescence that arise from particle diffusion in the optical volume, chemical reactions, or environmental changes, and the autocorrelation G(τ) reveals time constants of these processes. Following the formulation in Ref. 46Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2300-2317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, we used the following equation.G(τ)=1N(1−FB+FBe−τ/τB1−FB)(∑i=1nfi(1+τ/τDi)1+τ/ω2τDi)eq.1 The fluctuations depend on the number of particles, N, the characteristic diffusion time, τDi, of those particles in the observation volume, a structure parameter, ω, the weighting factor, fi, the dark fraction, FB, and time constant, τB, for dark to bright conversion. A detailed discussion of the FCS theory is described in Ref. 47Bacia K. Schwille P. Methods. 2003; 29: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleach—FRAP measurements were made using a procedure described in Ref. 48Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar: GFP-hNET images were acquired with a ×40 (NA = 1.3) objective (×4 digital zoom) on a Zeiss 510. Three pre-bleach images were acquired before bleaching a 4 × 17.5-μm strip of membrane, and data were fit to an inhomogeneous diffusion model (49Siggia E.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bekiranov S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1761-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whole Cell Voltage Clamp—hNET-293 cells on glass coverslips were washed 2 times with bath solution and mounted in a perfusion chamber (SD instruments, San Diego, CA) on an Olympus IX-70 microscope. Whole cell voltage clamp was achieved with an Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Axon instruments, San Diego CA), as described in Ref. 32Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Duke B.J. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2197-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Bath solution was (in mm): 130 NaCl, 1.3 KH2PO4, 0.5 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 34 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH and 300 mosmol liter-1 with glucose. Pipette solution was (in mm): 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 Hepes, 30 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35 with KOH and 270 mosmol liter-1 with glucose. ASP+ or NE were added freshly to the bath solution at 2 and 30 μm, respectively, and perfused with a gravity driven system. All data related to ASP+ solution exchange (except infinite dilution experiments) were taken at 3 s or later, with ASP+ at its full concentration. ASP+ is quenched until bound, further insuring that we monitor only the kinetics of bound and subsequently transported ASP+. Optical Isolation of Plasma Membrane and Mitochondrial Localized ASP+—To investigate ASP+ bound to plasma membrane-localized NET, we used subcellular organelle stains. hNET-293 cells were stained with 500 nm 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) for 20 min prior to ASP+ exposure. ASP+ is optically isolated from DiO, a membrane-specific marker (Fig. 1, A and B). Imaging DiO-stained cells for 10 s before adding ASP+ showed negligible cross-talk between ASP+ and DiO channels. Initially, ASP+ staining co-localizes with DiO fluorescence (first 3 s, data not shown). After 3 s, we observe intracellular punctuated ASP+ distributions (Fig. 1A) not co-localized with DiO (Fig. 1C). Instead, punctuated intracellular ASP+ co-localizes with a mitochondria stain (Mito-Tracker Green Molecular Probes, Eugene OR, data not shown), whereas plasma membrane ASP+ is still co-localized with DiO (Fig. 1C, yellow). Panel D shows the average pixel intensity along a 3-pixel width line from the bath, through the plasma membrane, to the mitochondria. In the first seconds (black line), fluorescence localizes to the plasma membrane. After 120 s (blue), mitochondrial ASP+ is significant. Subsequent exposure to NE (30 μm) displaces plasma membrane ASP+ without altering mitochondrial fluorescence (Fig. 1D, red). HEK293 cells measured in parallel demonstrate <0.5% membrane binding and <10% mitochondrial staining. Although line scans separate plasma membrane from deep mitochondria, circumference fluorescence may not report pure plasma membrane. Imperfect separation of near-membrane mitochondria from membrane movement results in ∼25% residual fluorescence in the membrane component, because of relatively low spatial resolution of confocal microscopy and cellular movement during the 2-min incubation. With these restrictions, data in Fig. 1A are quantified in panel E. Plasma membrane-localized fluorescence saturates after ∼6 s (blue), whereas mitochondrial ASP+ continues to increase (Fig. 1, red). At 120 s, 30 μm NE displaces plasma membrane ASP+ and arrests accumulation of mitochondrial ASP+. To improve resolution we use TIRF microscopy (below). Transporter Plasma Membrane Distribution—TIRF microscopy examines a narrow evanescent field (<1000 Å) where cells contact the coverslip (50Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Panel A shows ASP-bound to transporters clustered on the surface and localized to thin filaments at pseudopodia. ASP+ exhibits an identical pattern to GFP-hNET (Fig. 2B) and is displaced by 1 μm DS. To evaluate membrane folding as a source of this pattern, we compared DiO HEK293 cells and GFP-hNET-293: only DiO images were uniform, whereas GFP images show patterns. These data demonstrate co-localization of ASP+ and GFP-hNET in the evanescent field (Fig. 2C), although the distribution of the paired molecules varies widely. Time-resolved patterns indicate substrate-transporter complexes constantly migrating on the surface, but total surface expression remains constant. ASP+and GFP-calibrated Images—To determine the stoichiometry of ASP+ to transporters we used FLIM (see “Materials and Methods”). The fluorescence generated from a population of molecules is dependent on: 1) absorbability (molar extinction); 2) path length; 3) excitation light intensity; 4) quantum yield; and 5) concentration. Knowing this enables conversion of ASP+ fluorescence (AFU) to molecular number (51Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluoresence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Cellular ASP+ fluorescence lifetime was determined by fluorescent phase shift and modulation using heterodyne frequency domain measurements (43Jameson D.M. Gratton E. Hall R.D. Appl. Spectrosc. Rev. 1984; 20: 55-106Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 45Alcala J.R. Gratton E. Jameson D.M. Anal. Instr. 1985; 14: 225-250Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular ASP+ fluorescence lifetime, hNET-293 cells were exposed to 2 μm ASP+ for 5 min. The intensity image (Fig. 2A) shows that ASP+ binding is strongest along the plasma membrane, but the signal also arises from mitochondrial regions inside the cell. Using the intensity image as a template, the lifetime of ASP+ can be determined from FLIM (Fig. 2B) on the plasma membrane and in the mitochondria. The heterdyne frequency method provides two measurements of the average lifetime in a diverse population, τphase and τmod. The former measures lifetime via changes in phase of the excitation fluorescence, the latter measures changes in frequency modulation of the excitation fluorescence. Average ASP+ lifetimes were equal for plasma membrane and mitochondrial fluorescence (τphase and τmod were 2.5 ± 0.5 and 1.8 ± 0.36 ns, respectively), indicating that an increase in ASP+ qu"

CAC mutants, in which one or more Cys residues had been replaced with Ser, were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into liposomes. The effect of SH oxidizing, cross-linking, and coordinating reagents was evaluated on the carnitine/carnitine exchange catalyzed by the recombinant reconstituted CAC proteins. All the tested reagents efficiently inhibited the wild-type CAC. The inhibitory effect of diamide, Cu2+-phenanthroline, or phenylarsine oxide was largely reduced or abolished by the double substitutions C136S/C155S, C58S/C136S, and C58S/C155S. The decrease in sensitivity to these reagents was much lower in double mutants in which Cys23 was substituted with Cys136 or Cys155. No decrease in inhibition was found when Cys89 and/or Cys283 were replaced with Ser. Sb3+, which coordinates three cysteines, inhibited only the Cys replacement mutants containing cysteines 58, 136, and 155 of the six native cysteines. In addition, the mutant C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S, in which double tandem fXa recognition sites were inserted in positions 65-72, i.e. between Cys58 and Cys136, was not cleaved into two fragments by fXa protease after treatment with diamide. These results are interpreted in light of the homology model of CAC based on the available x-ray structure of the ADP/ATP carrier. They indicate that Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155 become close in the tertiary structure of the CAC during its catalytic cycle.

The mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC) 1The abbreviations used are: CAC, carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier; fXa, factor 10 of blood coagulation; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. plays a central role in the translocation of fatty acids as acylcarnitines into the mitochondrial matrix, where the acyl groups are used for fatty acid oxidation (1Krämer R. Palmieri F. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 359-384Google Scholar, 2Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). After some pioneer studies in intact mitochondria, the CAC was purified (3Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and characterized in reconstituted liposomes (see Ref. 4Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein). In particular, the CAC was found to be very sensitive to cysteine-specific reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide, mercurials, and diamide (4Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Later, the amino acid sequence of the carrier was determined by cDNA sequencing (5Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), showing that it belongs to the mitochondrial carrier protein family (reviewed in Ref. 2Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). On the basis of the hydrophobic profile of the CAC and its sequence similarity with the other mitochondrial carriers, a model for its arrangement in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been proposed (5Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). According to this model, the CAC polypeptide chain has six transmembrane α-helices (I-VI) traversing the membrane, connected by hydrophilic loops, and both the N and C termini protruding toward the cytosol. This asymmetric orientation of the membrane-embedded CAC is also supported by functional studies indicating different substrate-binding sites on the inner and outer faces in both intact mitochondria (6Idell-Wenger J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5579-5603Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and reconstituted liposomes (7Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CAC is encoded in man by the gene SLC25A20 (2Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) that maps to chromosome 3p21.31 (8Iacobazzi V. Naglieri M.A. Stanley C.A. Wanders J.R. Palmieri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Microbiol. 1999; 171: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The rat CAC gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in an active form (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which opened the way to using site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate structure-function relationships of this metabolically important transporter. Recently, it was found that Cys136, located in loop III-IV, is accessible to membrane-impermeable reagents from the external (cytosolic) side of the proteoliposomes (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the rat CAC contains six cysteines (Cys23, Cys58, Cys89, Cys136, Cys155, and Cys283). In this work, we aimed to determine the relationships among the six Cys residues of CAC. By functional analysis of Cys-mutants treated with SH oxidizing, cross-linking, and coordinating reagents, we have identified three cysteine residues that become close in the tertiary structure of the CAC during its catalytic cycle. They are Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155. Materials—Sephadex G-50, G-75, and G-200 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, l-[methyl-3H]carnitine from Amersham Biosciences, and egg yolk phospholipids (l-α-phosphatidylcholine from fresh turkey egg yolk), Pipes, Triton X-100, cardiolipin, l-carnitine, and N-dodecanoyl sarcosine (sarcosyl) and diamide from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Overexpression, and Isolation of the CAC Proteins—The coding region for the rat CAC was amplified from total rat liver cDNA as described previously (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Cys/Ser replacements were constructed with complementary mutagenic primers using the overlap extension method (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Hortnon R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) and the High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The PCR products were purified by the Gene Clean Kit (La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company), digested with NdeI and HindIII (restriction sites added at the 5′ end of forward and reverse primers, respectively), and ligated into the pMW7 expression vector. Single or double tandem fXa recognition sites were inserted in positions 65-72 of the four-Cys replacement mutant C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S by replacing the sequence REGITGLY with IEGRIEGR using the overlap extension method (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Hortnon R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and, except for the desired base changes, all of the sequences were identical to that of rat CAC cDNA. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli C0214 (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bacterial overexpression, isolation of the inclusion body fraction, and solubilization and purification of the wild-type CAC and mutant CAC proteins were performed as described previously (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of CAC and CAC Mutants into Liposomes—The recombinant proteins were reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of 13 mm carnitine, as described previously (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The external substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns. Transport Measurements and Effect of SH Oxidizing, Cross-linking, and Coordinating Reagents—Transport at 25 °C was started by adding 0.1 mm [3H]carnitine to proteoliposomes and terminated by the addition of 1.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (11Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In controls, the inhibitor was added together with the labeled substrate, according to the inhibitor stop method (14Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Finally, the external substrate was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 columns, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (14Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. All of the transport activities were determined by taking into account the efficiency of reconstitution (i.e. the share of successfully incorporated protein). To study the effect of diamide, Cu2+-phenanthroline, or phenylarsine oxide on the transport activity of wild-type CAC and CAC mutants, the proteoliposomes were preincubated with each reagent (under the conditions indicated in the legends to figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) before transport was started. In the case of Sb3+, this reagent was added to the reconstitution mixture as potassium antimony tartrate.Fig. 2Dependence on diamide of carnitine transport catalyzed by reconstituted CAC double Cys-mutants.

Finally, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of dithioerythritol. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) as described previously (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant protein was estimated on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels by a Bio-Rad GS-700 Imaging Densitometer equipped with the software Bio-Rad Multi-Analist, using bovine serum albumin as standard. The extent of incorporation of the recombinant protein into liposomes was determined as described by Phelps et al. (16Phelps A. Briggs C. Mincone L. Wohlrab H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with the modifications reported in Ref. 12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F.

Transport Activity of CAC Mutants—As reported previously, all of the single Cys mutants exhibited transport activities similar to the wild-type protein (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Table I shows the transport activities of the mutants containing more than one substitution. Most of these mutants had transport activities ranging from ∼20 to 110% of the wild-type CAC. The mutants C23S/C58S/C136S, C58S/C136S/C155S, C23S/C58S/C136S/C155S, and C23S/C58S/C89S/C155S were more or less inactive (transport activity <5% of the wild type). A comparable loss of activity was observed previously for the C-less CAC and for the five-replacement mutants C23S/C58S/C89S/C136S/C283S and C23S/C58S/C89S/C155S/C283S (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of these virtually inactive mutants are characterized by substitution of at least three Cys residues among the four residues Cys23, Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155, independently of the presence or absence of Cys89 and Cys283 (Table I).Table ITransport activity of CAC mutants CAC mutants, in which two or more Cys residues were substituted with Ser, were overexpressed in E. coli, reconstituted into liposomes, and tested for their transport activity.

Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), at concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mm, on single CAC Cys mutants. Diamide strongly inactivated the wild-type protein, reaching nearly complete inhibition of transport activity at 0.5 mm. The mutants C23S, C58S, C89S, C155S, and C283S were inactivated similarly to the wild-type CAC. Only C136S was much less sensitive to the reagent. Because protein inactivation caused by diamide is used to monitor the formation of S-S bridge(s) (4Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these results indicate that Cys136 is involved in the formation of S-S bridge(s). To gain information about the second Cys residue involved in the disulfide bridge(s), double mutants were tested for their sensitivity to diamide concentrations up to 2 mm. In a first set of double mutants, Cys136 was substituted together with a second Cys residue (Fig. 2A). The double mutants C89S/C136S and C136S/C283S showed a sensitivity to diamide that was virtually indistinguishable from that exhibited by the single mutant C136S, indicating that Cys89 and Cys283 are not involved in S-S formation. The sensitivity to diamide of the double mutant C23S/C136S and in particular of C58S/C136S was lower than that of the single mutant C136S; a complete loss of sensitivity to diamide was observed with the mutant C136S/C155S, indicating that the presence of Cys136 and/or Cys155 is essential for the formation of S-S bridges either with each other or in combination with other Cys residues. The dependence on diamide of the transport activity exhibited by the mutants C23S/C58S, C23S/C155S, and C58S/C155S is shown in Fig. 2B. C23S/C58S and C23S/C155S showed a sensitivity to diamide similar to or only slightly lower than that of the wild type, whereas C58S/C155S had a much lower sensitivity to diamide than the wild type, indicating that an S-S bridge is formed between Cys58 (but not Cys23) and Cys155. We then analyzed the effect of diamide on CAC mutants in which only two of the four Cys residues 23, 58, 136, and 155 were present (Fig. 3). C23S/C58S/C89S/C283S showed a sensitivity to diamide similar to the wild type, indicating that Cys136 and Cys155 are at or can come to an optimal distance for forming an S-S bridge. In contrast, C89S/C136S/C155S/C283S was completely insensitive to diamide, indicating that Cys23 and Cys58 cannot form an internal S-S bridge. C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S and C23S/C89S/C136S/C283S were strongly sensitive to diamide, indicating that Cys58 is involved in S-S formation with Cys136 or Cys155. A much lower sensitivity was observed with C58S/C89S/C155S/C283S and especially with C58S/C89S/C136S/C283S, suggesting a minor contribution of Cys23 to S-S formation with Cys136 or Cys155. It should be noted that the same high sensitivity to diamide observed with C23S/C58S (Fig. 2B) was found for the triple mutants C23S/C58S/C89S and C23S/C58S/C283S and that the addition of 15 mm dithioerythritol after treatment with 2 mm diamide led to a complete recovery of the activity of all the mutants described (not shown). In addition, the effect of diamide on mutants C23S/C58S/C136S, C58S/C136S/C155S, C23S/C58S/C136S/C155S, and C23S/C58S/C89S/C155S was not tested because of their very low transport activity. Effect of Cu2+-phenanthroline and Phenylarsine Oxide on CAC Four-Cys Replacement Mutants—We also tested the effect of Cu2+-phenanthroline, another reagent that, like diamide, oxidizes vicinal SH residues to S-S bridges (23Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), on the activity of the wild-type CAC and of the four-replacement mutants C23S/C58S/C89S/C283S, C23S/C89S/C136S/C283S, C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S, C58S/C89S/C136S/C283S, C58S/C89S/C155S/C283S, and C89S/C136S/C155S/C283S (Fig. 4A). The wild-type protein and the C23S/C58S/C89S/C283S mutant were totally inhibited by 2 μm Cu2+ phenanthroline, confirming that Cys136 and Cys155 are at or can come to an optimal distance for S-S formation. C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S was also efficiently inhibited, showing maximal effect at about 5 μm Cu2+-phenanthroline. C23S/C89S/C136S/C283S and C58S/C89S/C155S/C283S were about 70% inactivated at 10 μm Cu2+-phenanthroline. C58S/C89S/C136S/C283S was about 30% inactivated at 10 μm Cu2+-phenanthroline, and C89S/C136S/C155S/C283S was nearly unaffected at the same concentration. In another set of experiments, the effect of phenylarsine oxide was investigated. This reagent does not induce the formation of S-S bridges but reacts with two Cys residues close enough to be cross-linked with the reagent (24Kalef E. Gitler C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that the wild-type CAC, C23S/C58S/C89S/C283S, and C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S were strongly inhibited by phenylarsine oxide. C23S/C89S/C136S/C283S and C58S/C89S/C155S/C283S were inhibited to a lesser extent, and C58S/C89S/C136S/C283S and especially C89S/C136S/C155S/C283S were affected poorly by phenylarsine oxide up to 1 mm. Taken together, these results indicate that Cys136 and Cys155 can form an S-S bridge not only with each other but also with Cys58 and perhaps with Cys23. Effect of Sb3+ on CAC Cys Mutants—To obtain further support for the existence of vicinal SH groups in the CAC molecule, the effect of Sb3+ was investigated. Sb3+ is known to form a tricoordinate complex with a cluster of three Cys residues in the tertiary structure of proteins (25Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We first found that 0.8 mm Sb3+ completely inhibited the activity of the wild-type CAC, indicating that Sb3+ can form a complex with three of the Cys residues present in the carrier protein. Then we compared the effects of the reagent, at a concentration giving half-maximal inhibition of the wild-type protein (0.2 mm), on CAC mutants in which one or more of the four Cys residues 23, 58, 136, and 155 were substituted (Fig. 5). All of the four-replacement mutants tested (containing only two Cys residues) were insensitive to Sb3+. The double mutant C23S/C283S (containing Cys58, Cys89, Cys136, and Cys155) was strongly inhibited by Sb3+, similarly to the wild-type protein. In contrast, little inhibition by Sb3+ was observed with the double mutants in which at least one of the three cysteines 58, 136, and 155 was substituted. Among the single mutants, C23S, C89S, and C283S were markedly inhibited similarly to the wild-type CAC, whereas C58S, C136S, and C155S were only slightly inhibited by Sb3+. These results point to the importance of each of the three cysteines 58, 136, and 155 in the formation of the tricoordinate complex with Sb3+. The Chemical Modifications Involve Only Cysteines Belonging to a Single Polypeptide Chain—It is important to know whether the cysteine pairs of the CAC oxidized by diamide and Cu2+-phenanthroline and cross-linked by phenylarsine oxide, as well as the three cysteines coordinated by Sb3+, are located on the same polypeptide or on different polypeptide subunits. This question was investigated by subjecting the wild-type CAC and its mutants to SDS-PAGE, in the absence of dithioerythritol, after treatment with the above mentioned reagents. The results obtained showed no significant variation in the apparent molecular mass of any protein tested with or without preincubation with the chemical modifiers (not shown). This result clearly indicates that diamide, Cu2+-phenanthroline, phenylarsine oxide, and Sb3+ do not cause dimerization of CAC and its mutants, and therefore all the cysteines involved in the modifications described above are located on a single polypeptide subunit. Disulfuric Linkage in the C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S CAC Mutant with Inserted fXa Recognition Sites—In other experiments, double tandem fXa recognition sites were inserted in positions 65-72 of the C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S mutant. After incubation with fXa protease, this mutant was proteolyzed to an appreciable extent, giving rise to two fragments (Fig. 6, lane 1). As deduced from their N-terminal sequencing, the smaller fragment, with a molecular mass of ∼7.5 kDa, extended from the N terminus to the cleavage site, and the larger fragment, with a molecular mass of ∼25 kDa, extended from the cleavage site to the C terminus. Interestingly, if the mutant was treated with diamide before the incubation with fXa protease, no cleavage was observed (Fig. 6, lane 2), indicating that under these conditions, the two peptides are linked by a diamide-induced S-S bridge. To support this conclusion, aliquots of the proteins that had been treated with fXa protease without (Fig. 6, lane 1) and with (lane 2) diamide were supplemented with dithioerythritol before being subjected to SDS-PAGE (lanes 3 and 4). After the dithioerythritol addition, the two peptides also appeared in the diamide-treated sample (Fig. 6, lane 4), i.e. the S-S bridge formed by diamide was reduced. It is noteworthy that the smear of the protein bands shown in Fig. 6 was caused by the presence of phospholipids derived from the proteoliposomes from which the CAC proteins were extracted. Furthermore, it is possible that internal disulfide bridges contributed slightly to the apparent molecular mass in the absence of dithioerythritol (Fig. 6, lane 2). This also explains why the mutant C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S often appears as two close bands after gel electrophoresis, due to either spontaneous oxidation of a fraction of the protein or incomplete reaction with diamide. It should be mentioned that after reconstitution into liposomes, the mutant containing double tandem fXa recognition sites showed much lower activity than the wild-type CAC (Table I) and that the same mutant containing only one fXa recognition site showed higher transport activity but was poorly cleaved by fXa protease (not shown, see also Ref. 27Sahin-Toth M. Dunten R.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Homology Model of CAC Based on the X-ray Structure of the ADP/ATP Carrier—The rat mitochondrial CAC is homologous with the bovine mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier for which a crystal structure is available (21Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In fact, the sequences of the two carriers can be aligned unambiguously (Fig. 7); they share 19.6% identical amino acids and 39.6% highly conserved residues. Interestingly, Cys58 and Cys155 of the rat CAC are conserved in the bovine ADP/ATP carrier corresponding to Cys56 and Cys159, respectively. We therefore built a homology model of CAC (Fig. 8) based on the three-dimensional structure of the carboxyatractyloside-ADP/ATP carrier complex. Fig. 8 highlights the positions of the six cysteine residues of CAC, which are grouped at the matrix side (Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155) and at the cytoplasmic side (Cys23, Cys89, and Cys283) of the membrane-embedded CAC protein.Fig. 8Structural model of the CAC. Ribbon diagrams viewing the carrier from the side (A) or from the outside (B). The transmembrane α-helices are colored as follows: TM I, blue; TM II, light blue; TM III, light green; TM IV, yellow-green; TM V, yellow; TM VI, pink. Red dot surfaces highlight the SH groups of the Cys residues indicated by their number in the CAC sequence. The distances for Cys58-Cys136 and Cys136-Cys155, calculated by the Swiss Protein Database Viewer software, are 14.8 and 9.4 Å, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The resolution of the tertiary structure of mitochondrial carriers by x-ray crystallography is still in its infancy. So far, only the structure of the ADP/ATP carrier-carboxyatractyloside inhibited complex has been determined after crystallization of the purified carrier from bovine mitochondria (21Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Therefore, especially for a protein like CAC, which is present in a very minute amount in mitochondria, the site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification approach still represents a useful tool to obtain structural and dynamic information and to define structure-function relationships. We found previously that formation of disulfide(s) in the CAC protein, purified from mitochondria, leads to transport inhibition, and we therefore concluded that at least two of the six Cys residues present in the CAC amino acid sequence are in close proximity (4Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Identifying the specific residues that can form disulfides or can be cross-linked has important implications on the structure and dynamic properties of the CAC, because the protein segments that contain these Cys residues have to be sufficiently close or become close to each other during the conformational changes accompanying the translocation of the substrate through the protein. The functional analysis described above of one-, two-, and four-Cys replacements mutants of CAC, as well as of the wild-type recombinant protein, clearly shows that Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155 can be oxidized by diamide and Cu2+-phenanthroline or cross-linked by phenylarsine oxide. Therefore the residues 58, 136, and 155 of CAC are close or become close in the tertiary structure of the protein during its catalytic cycle. This conclusion is supported by the observation that Sb3+, a reagent forming a tricoordinate complex with three cysteines (25Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), inhibits only the CAC mutants containing the above mentioned cysteines. It is also supported by the observation that the CAC mutant C23S/C89S/C155S/C283S, containing the cysteines 58 and 136 and two tandem fXa recognition sites in positions 65-72, is not cleaved by fXa protease into two fragments if pretreated with diamide. The CAC and the ADP/ATP carrier are homologous and must have the same overall structure. Therefore, we discuss our results in light of the homology model of CAC (Fig. 8) based on the available x-ray structure of the ADP/ATP carrier (21Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). It is particularly interesting to compare the three-dimensional structure with our Cys mutagenesis and chemical modification data because the former can only provide static information, whereas the latter can give a more dynamic view of the structure. As shown in the homology-modeled structure of the CAC, the three important cysteines, Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155, are clustered at approximately identical distances from the membrane/aqueous interface near the mitochondrial matrix side. In the three-dimensional structure, the distances between the side chains of these cysteines (for instance, 9.4 Å between Cys136 and Cys155) are greater than those required for the chemical modifications described in this study. However, it is possible that Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155 become closer during some stage of the catalytic cycle. The presence of the substrate carnitine, inside and outside of the proteoliposomes, probably facilitates the cross-linking of the CAC cysteine pairs observed here. It has indeed been shown that on binding the substrate, the carrier-substrate complex undergoes a conformational change, causing the binding center to switch between the external and internal states (reviewed in Ref. 28Palmieri F. Klingenberg M. Lennarz W.J. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. 2. Elsevier, Oxford2004: 725-732Google Scholar). Therefore, substrates may confer on the above mentioned cysteines the mobility necessary for gaining sufficient proximity to be cross-linked. We demonstrated previously that Cys136 is accessible from the extraliposomal (cytosolic) side to the membrane-impermeant reagents sodium(2-sulfonatoethyl)-methane-thiosulfonate and p-(chloromercuri)benzene-sulfonate and that this interaction is prevented by the presence of the CAC substrate (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the homology model of CAC shows that Cys136 (corresponding to Thr-138 of the ADP/ATP carrier) protrudes into the large water-accessible cavity that, in the crystallographic structure of the ADP/ATP carrier-carboxyatractyloside complex, is exposed toward the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial membrane and is occupied by the inhibitor or possibly by the cytosolic ADP (21Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The effects of the various modification reagents on Cys23-containing mutants are relatively minor, and the kinetics of the cross-linking reactions are also clearly different for Cys23-containing mutants than for the mutants containing at least two of the three cysteines 58, 136, and 155 (Figs. 2 and 4). These results alone make it unlikely that Cys23 can be oxidized or cross-linked with Cys58, Cys136, or Cys155. This possibility is definitively ruled out by the homology model of CAC. Cys23 is pointing into the lipid phase at the cytoplasmic side of the carrier protein, and its distance from Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155 (24.2, 21.3, and 24.2 Å, respectively) is too great to be cross-linked with one of these cysteines, unless drastic structural changes take place. In this study, some reconstituted mutants containing Cys23, but with various mutations in the other native cysteines, have considerably lower activity than the wild-type protein (for example 19.8% of the wild-type activity for C58S/C155S). Because none of the native cysteines (including Cys23) are important for the transport activity per se (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the decreased activity of these mutants may be caused by structural/folding instability. A plausible interpretation of the results, which seemed to suggest involvement of Cys23 in disulfide bridge(s) with Cys136 or Cys155, is that in certain recombinant mutants containing Cys23 and mutations in other native cysteines, there may be a portion of misfolded molecules that give anomalous cross-linking. This would in fact agree with previous results showing that C23S mutants have low yields of reconstitution into liposomes, which is likely because of structural/folding instability (12Indiveri C. Giangregorio N. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The CAC contains two other Cys residues, Cys89 and Cys283. Our mutagenesis and chemical modification data, which show that neither Cys89 nor Cys283 can be oxidized or cross-linked with Cys58, Cys136, or Cys155, can be explained easily by the CAC homology model, because they are located at the cytoplasmic side of the carrier and are >20 Å from the three important cysteines Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Cys89 and Cys283 may form a disulfide bridge with each other or with Cys23 without loss of transport activity. Another result of this work is that at least two of the three important Cys residues of the rat CAC (Cys58, Cys136, and Cys155) have to be present in reduced form for efficient activity of transport. It can be excluded, however, that these cysteines have a catalytic function because they are not conserved in evolutionarily distant organisms such as S. cerevisiae and A. nidulans. It is likely that their oxidation, cross-linking, and coordination by Sb3+ rigidifies the protein structure, causing reduction in transport activity. SH groups interact both with hydrophilic residues (SH, OH, NH2) via hydrogen bond (29Raso S.W. Clark P.L. Haase-Pettingell C. King J. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and with hydrophobic residues (30Nagano N. Ota M. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the rat CAC, two thiol groups of the three cysteines 58, 136, and 155 dynamically switch from hydrophilic to hydrophobic interactions, being structurally and dynamically important, probably because they are involved in one or more conformational changes during the translocation process."

XendoU has no homology to any known cellular RNase, although it has sequence similarity with proteins tentatively annotated as serine proteases. It has been recently shown that XendoU represents the cellular counterpart of a nidovirus replicative endoribonuclease (NendoU), which plays a critical role in viral replication and transcription. In this paper, we combined prediction and experimental data to define the amino acid residues directly involved in XendoU catalysis. Specifically, we find that XendoU residues Glu-161, Glu-167, His-162, His-178, and Lys-224 are essential for RNA cleavage, which occurs in the presence of manganese ions. Furthermore, we identified the RNA sequence required for XendoU binding and showed that the formation of XendoU-RNA complex is Mn2+-independent.

XendoU is an RNA processing enzyme that participates in the production of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA(s)), 1The abbreviation used is: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; ONE, oocyte nuclear extracts. a large family of non-coding RNAs with essential roles in ribosome biogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Filipowicz W. Pogacic V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). There are two major families of such molecules, namely box H/ACA and box C/D snoRNAs. The components of the first class participate in pseudouridylation, whereas the members of the second class are involved in site-specific 2′-O-methylation of rRNA and spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (2Kiss T. Cell. 2002; 109: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that the box C/D U16 snoRNA, encoded by an intron of the L4 ribosomal protein gene of Xenopus laevis, originated from site-specific processing of the intron within the pre-mRNA (3Fragapane P. Prislei S. Michienzi A. Caffarelli E. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we studied the in vitro processing of U16 and demonstrated that an extract prepared from X. laevis germinal vesicles was able to reproduce the cleavage pathway observed in vivo (4Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In particular, we showed that double cleavage upstream and downstream of intronic U16-coding region produced pre-U16 molecules that are converted, by exonuclease trimming, to the mature snoRNA (see schematic representation in Fig. 1A). More recently, we purified, from X. laevis nuclear extracts, the endoribonucleolytic activity responsible for the release of U16 and U86 snoRNAs from their host primary transcripts. Characterization of this enzyme, named XendoU, showed that it is a Mn2+-dependent nuclease that cleaves U stretches on the RNA substrate and releases 2′-3′-cyclic phosphodiester products (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Depending on the production of 5′- or 3′-phosphate extremities, the RNases can be subdivided into two groups (6Saida F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The main characteristic of the enzymes belonging to the first group, which includes many intracellular endo- and exoribonucleases, is that they all possess a metal ion in their active site. The second class includes the families of barnase, RNase A, RNase T1, and RNase T2. The components of this class release reaction products carrying cyclic 2′-3′-phosphodiester termini, and their catalytic activity is ensured by two side chains, one acting as a general base, the other as a general acid. In addition, in all known cases the general acid catalyst is always a histidine, whereas the general base catalyst can be a histidine or a glutamate (7Nishikawa S. Morioka H. Kim H.J. Fuchimura K.

So far, no RNase has been described that requires manganese ions and releases products with 2′-3′-cyclic phosphodiester termini, suggesting the existence of another class of enzymes that employs different reaction mechanism. A data base search for XendoU homologs with the whole protein sequence did not show any homology with cellular RNases, yet identified significant homology (38% identity and 55% similarity) with pp11, a putative serine protease (11Grundmann U. Romisch J. Siebold B. Bohn H. Amann E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) from organisms as distant as Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. However, data base searches with nidovirus proteins led to the recent identification of XendoU as the cellular homolog of the nidovirus NendoU (12Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T. Rozanov M. Bayer S. Thiel V. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). NendoU is one of the replicative components conserved in coronaviruses and in all their distant nidovirus relatives, and its activity is required for virus replication and transcription (13Snijder E.J. Bredenbeek P.J. Dobbe J.C. Thiel V. Ziebuhr J. Poon L.L. Guan Y. Rozanov M. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the contribution of active site residues to the function of XendoU and the requirements for enzyme-RNA interaction. We started with phylogenetic comparisons of XendoU and its eukaryotic orthologs and used the information about sequence conservation as a guide for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Several mutants were designed, and the roles of mutated residues were investigated by characterizing their catalytic activity in parallel with their binding capability. The results of such analysis indicate the critical role of five amino acid residues; their chemical nature suggests an interesting hypothesis about the role of manganese in RNA cleavage. Sequence Analysis—The non-redundant protein data base was searched with PSI-BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The data base was searched separately for three iterations, and the checkpoints were saved for secondary structure predictions (15Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). Multiple alignment figures were generated using CHROMA (16Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P.

Oligonucleotides—The following DNA oligonucleotides, purchased from MWG Biotech, were used for cloning the different constructs: ATG, 5′-GGGGATCCATGGCGAGTAACAGGG-3′, STOP, 5′-GGAAGCTTTCAGTACAGATCCGGGTTATT-3′, A, 5′-CACAAACACGTGCTGAAAGCCGC-3′, B, 5′-GGACAATCGAAGCGAGGGCAGGAG-3′, C, 5′-GGAGAATCGAAGCGAGGGCAGGAG-3′, D, 5′-CACAAACACGTGCTCAAAGCCGC-3′, E, 5′-GGAGAATCGAAGCGAGGGCAGGAG-3′, F, 5′-CACAAACACGGCCTCAAAGCCGCAC-3′, G, 5′-ACAACCTGGGCCACCCCCGTG-3′, H, 5′-GACTCCGGAGGAAATCGCTGAAAAC-3′, I, 5′-GATGCGTGCGGCTTTGAGCACGTGTTTGTGGG-3′, J, 5′-GGGTCTGCTCCCTGGGGCCCG-3′, K, 5′-GCCGTCAGCCCGGAATTCGAATTCGCCC-3′, L, 5′-AATGAAGCTGCTGCCGACGGG-3′, M, 5′-GGCGTCGCCCCGGAATTCGAATTCGCCC-3′, N, 5′-GGCGTCAGCGCGGAATTCGAATTCGCCC-3′, O, 5′-GAGATGATGGGGCTTGCCAACTGGG-3′, P, 5′-CTGCCCTCGCTTCGATTCTCCCAC-3′, Q, 5′-AAGGAGATGGTGGCACCCGTCGGC-3′, R, 5′-CCAATTGAACTGCAGGTTCAACACC-3′, S, 5′-GGCGTCAGCCCGCAATTCGAATTCGCCC-3′, mini 003fw, 5′-CTGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTATCCTTTTGGGATTTA-3′, mini 003rev, 5′-AAGCTTCCCGAAGAGAAATTTTTG-3′, B3, 5′-TACGTCCACCACGACACAT-3′, and γ, 5′-TTTTCCTCAGAACGCAAT-3′. For competition experiments, we purchased the following oligoribonucleotides P1 (5′-GGAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG-3′) and P3 (5′-GGAACGUAUCCUCUGGGAG-3′) from RNA-TEC. Plasmids and Templates for in Vitro RNA Transcription—The 003 construct, encoding U16-containing precursor (003 RNA), was described previously (18Caffarelli E. Fatica A. Prislei S. De Gregorio E. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mini-003 construct, encoding for a shorter variant of 003 RNA, was obtained by PCR-based methods. The 003 template was amplified using oligonucleotides mini 003fw and mini 003rev and cloned in Bluescript KS plasmid (Stratagene). The mini-003 RNA is 207 nucleotides long and includes the upstream (a, b, c, and d) and downstream (e and f) XendoU cleavage sites, flanking the U16-coding region (see schematic representation in Fig. 3A). Cloning of Hexahistidine-tagged XendoU and of Its Mutant Derivatives—All fusion proteins were expressed as N-terminally His6-tagged proteins by using the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The open reading frame for the wild type XendoU was PCR-amplified using X. laevis oocyte cDNA, with the primers ATG and STOP (pQE30-XendoU). The constructs expressing XendoU mutant derivatives were obtained by inverse PCR on pQE30-XendoU plasmid with the oligonucleotides indicated in parentheses: E161Q/E167Q (A, B), E161Q (A, C), E167Q (B, D), H162A (E, F), E92Q (G, H), S157A (I, J), G232A (K, L), S234A (L, M), P235A (L, N), H178A (O, P), K224A (Q, R), and E236Q (L, S). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant XendoU (His-XendoU) and its mutant derivatives were expressed in M15 [pREP4] strain and purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by affinity chromatography with nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, according to Qiaexpress protocol (Qiagen). Protein preparations were dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol) and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Transcription and Processing Reaction—U16-containing precursors (003 and mini-003 RNAs) were synthesized in vitro (19Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and 15 μm UTP. After transcription, the RNAs were gel-purified, phenol-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. In a typical processing reaction, 3 × 104 cpm (corresponding to ∼2 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA precursors) were incubated with recombinant proteins or oocyte nuclear extracts as described (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reaction products were then analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Analysis of 3′ Terminus—Gel-purified 5′-terminal cleavage product (molecule I-1 derived by cleavage at the b site) was treated as described (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) After extraction and labeling in the presence of 5′-[32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate, the RNA was analyzed by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. Primer Extension Analysis—Unlabeled I-2 and I-4 molecules produced by XendoU cleavage on U16-containing precursor (003 RNA) were gel-extracted and annealed with γ-32P-labeled γ and B3 oligonucleotides, respectively. Resulting molecules were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II System (Invitrogen), and reaction products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed by incubating 2 fmol of [α-32P]UTP in vitro transcribed mini-003 RNA with increasing amounts of recombinant proteins in a final volume of 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). After 30 min of incubation at 24 °C, the RNA-protein complexes were fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bis) native gels containing 4% glycerol. In competition experiments, binding assays were carried out by incubating [α-32P]UTP in vitro transcribed mini-003 RNA with His-XendoU, in the presence of increasing amounts of different unlabeled RNAs as competitors. Characterization of Recombinant XendoU Activity—The first step toward the characterization of the XendoU residues involved in the catalysis was the production of the recombinant enzyme. N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged XendoU (His-XendoU) was expressed from bacteria, and the affinity-purified protein was tested for its ability to correctly process the U16 snoRNA from its host precursor (003 RNA). 003 RNA mimics the natural substrate of XendoU and includes the U16-containing intron and portions of the flanking exons (18Caffarelli E. Fatica A. Prislei S. De Gregorio E. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A typical processing assay was carried out by incubating His-XendoU with 32P-labeled 003 RNA in the presence of Mn2+ (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the comparison of processing activity of 1 μg of Oocyte Nuclear Extract (lanes ONE) with that of 10 ng of recombinant XendoU (lanes His-XendoU). The results confirm that the enzyme releases the same products previously identified in vivo and in extracts (4Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (see schematic representation in Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the lack of cleavage when Mn2+ was not added to the reaction (lane 5) confirms its requirement for His-XendoU activity. His-XendoU cleavage activity was further analyzed by characterizing the 3′ termini of the reaction products (Fig. 2A) and by primer extension experiments on gel-purified I-2 and I-4 products (Fig. 2B). The results indicated that His-XendoU produces molecules carrying 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate ends and that it cleaves intronic sequences at the same U-rich sites recognized by the native enzyme (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We concluded that the recombinant enzyme could be used for mutagenic analysis. Analysis of XendoU-RNA Interaction—To analyze the binding of His-XendoU to its RNA substrate, we investigated the ability of the protein to bind RNA without cleaving it. For this purpose, the RNA-protein interaction was tested in the absence of Mn2+, and the assembled complex was visualized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For this assay, a suitable RNA substrate was constructed (mini 003). Mini 003 RNA is 207 nucleotides long. It includes the upstream and downstream cleavage sites flanking the U16 snoRNA coding region and lacks the exon sequences (see schematic representation in Fig. 3A). Fig. 3A shows that when incubated with His-XendoU this substrate produces the same cleavage profile (lanes His-XendoU) as that obtained with the oocyte nuclear extracts (lanes ONE). A typical gel-shift assay is shown in Fig. 3B. 32P-Labeled mini 003 RNA was incubated with XendoU, at concentrations of 0.1 (lane 2) or 0.6 μm (lane 3) (see “Experimental Procedures”); the assembled complexes were then fractionated on native gels and visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis showed that His-XendoU, at a concentration of 0.1 μm, is able to shift ∼10–15% of the input RNA. Based on these data, we concluded that manganese ions are not required for RNA-protein interaction. Association of XendoU to Its Substrate Is Specific and Requires Oligo(U)—To verify the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction, competition experiments were performed. A gel mobility shift assay was carried out by incubating 32P-labeled mini 003 RNA with His-XendoU alone, at a protein concentration (0.6 μm) that shifts 90% of the RNA input or in the presence of different concentrations of cold competitors. The RNAs used as competitors were mini 003 RNA, Escherichia coli tRNA (Fig. 3C) and the two oligoribonucleotides, P1 and P3 (Fig. 3D). P1 oligo contains the distal cleavage site upstream to U16 (site d), whereas P3 is its mutant derivative in which the cleaved sequence UUU is replaced by the sequence UCU. This analysis revealed that the RNA containing the XendoU cleavage sites (mini 003 competitor) was able to compete out the binding of the protein already at a concentration of 4 nm, whereas tRNA molecules did not compete even at higher concentrations. The use of smaller 20-nucleotide long oligoribonucleotides P1 and P3 provided additional information about the sequence requirements for RNA-protein interaction. Three U residues present in P1 oligo are sufficient to make this RNA an active competitor, whereas the substitution of three U residues with the sequence UCU makes the competitor P3 completely inactive. These data are consistent with functional data, which showed that P1 is a substrate for XendoU cleavage, whereas P3 is not (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results support the conclusion that the binding of His-XendoU to its substrate is highly specific and revealed a strict requirement for oligo(U) sequences. Prediction of XendoU catalytic residues—A data base search with the whole XendoU sequence revealed homology to a number of proteins from animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates) and plants, including a few surprising hits to cyanobacteria. The only group of identified proteins with established annotations were putative serine proteases, with homologs found in human, mouse, fruit fly, and nematodes. Given that XendoU and its homologs did not contain any known protein domain, and in particular those with a known RNase activity, we generated a multiple alignment to identify the most conserved residues (Fig. 4). Knowing that XendoU needs Mn2+ for its activity (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we looked in particular for the conserved residues that may bind metal ions or those that are typically involved in metal-based cleavage by nucleases. Divalent metal ions are commonly bound by carboxylate groups of acidic residues (Asp and Glu) and are thought to stabilize the transition state in cleavage reactions. Often found in these enzymes are Asp-His conserved pairs that are used to deprotonate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the phosphate (20Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Lo T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Dlakic M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 272-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It also has been shown that catalytic His residues can be directly involved by forming hydrogen bonds to one of the oxygens in of the target phosphate (22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The most conserved part of the alignment is between XendoU residues 157–167, with a consensus sequence SSsFEHVFxsE (where capital letters represent individual amino acids, while “s” and “x” are for small and any amino acid residues, respectively). We considered this region a prime candidate for the active site of XendoU and decided to mutate potential catalytic residues identified by red triangles in Fig. 4. In addition, we singled out for mutagenesis other conserved residues that were outside of this putative active site (Glu-92, His-178, and Lys-224 of XendoU, marked by green triangles in Fig. 4). Because many conserved residues were identified (Fig. 4, yellow shade), we reasoned that not all of them are involved in catalysis, in particular, because XendoU can bind RNA. To test whether RNA binding and catalytic functions are separated within the protein, we decided to individually mutate residues 232–236 in yet another conserved patch of XendoU (Fig. 4, blue triangles). While this work was in preparation, it was reported that nidoviruses contain a homolog of XendoU named NendoU (12Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T. Rozanov M. Bayer S. Thiel V. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Snijder E.J. Bredenbeek P.J. Dobbe J.C. Thiel V. Ziebuhr J. Poon L.L. Guan Y. Rozanov M. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). This group of viral proteins never appeared as significant hits in our PSI-BLAST searches, even when we raised the significance threshold. However, in reciprocal searches starting with viral proteins, the homologs of XendoU appeared just below the significance threshold. Because XendoU and NendoU proteins do not align over their whole lengths, we used profile-profile alignments (17Edgar R.C. Sjolander K. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to define the region they share. This common region encompasses our predicted active site, and the multiple alignment of XendoU and NendoU homologs is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Red triangles in that figure mark XendoU residues mutated in this study, whereas blue triangles denote residues mutated by Ivanov et al. (12Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T. Rozanov M. Bayer S. Thiel V. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Construction of XendoU Mutant Derivatives—A collection of XendoU mutant derivatives was produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Two Glu residues of XendoU, Glu-161 and Glu-167, were substituted both simultaneously and individually by Gln, giving rise to the double mutant E161Q/E167Q and to the single mutants E161Q and E167Q. Mutants E92Q and E236Q were generated by substitution of Glu-92 and Glu-236 by Gln. Acidic residues were replaced with their amides, because these mutations remove the carboxyl group needed for metal coordination while negligibly affecting the whole structure of the protein (23Fatica A. Tollervey D. Dlakic M. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Substitution of His-162 and His-178 by Ala produced the mutant H162A and H178A. Finally, Ser-157, Lys-224, Gly-232, Ser-234, and Pro-235 were individually replaced by Ala producing mutants S157A, K224A, G232A, S234A, and P235A. XendoU mutant derivatives, expressed as recombinant proteins in bacterial cells, were first tested for their ability to interact with the RNA substrate in a mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). 32P-Labeled mini 003 RNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of wild type XendoU and its mutant derivatives. Using Packard Instant Imager, we calculated, for each mutant, the protein concentrations giving 10–15% shift of the RNA substrate. For proper comparison of binding activities for different mutants, we determined the amount of active protein in each preparation by reverse titration experiments with constant amounts of protein and increasing amounts of the hot probe (data not shown). The results of such analyses indicated that all mutated proteins were able to bind mini 003 RNA. Some of them (H178A, K224A, G232A, P235A, S234A, and S237A) bind the RNA substrate as efficiently as the wild type protein, whereas other mutants (E161Q/E167Q, H162A, and E92Q) interact less efficiently. E236Q is the only protein that shows higher affinity for the RNA substrate (see Fig. 6A).Fig. 6Analysis of activity of XendoU mutants. A, binding activity calculated as the protein concentrations getting 10–15% of RNA shift. These values were calculated by Instant Imager quantification on band shift gels shown in Fig. 5. B, catalytic activity of different XendoU mutant derivatives analyzed by processing assays. The different proteins at the specific concentrations indicated below, were incubated with 2 fmol of 32P-labeled mini 003 RNA for 20 min under the standard conditions. The specific cleavage products are indicated on the side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of Processing Activity of XendoU Mutant Derivatives—We first established the amounts of wild type and of mutated proteins needed to bind 10–15% of the RNA substrate, to standardize subsequent studies of the processing activity. The predetermined amounts of proteins were incubated with a constant amount of 32P-labeled RNA substrate, and the efficiency and specificity of processing activity were evaluated. For those mutants that did not display any detectable cleavage activity (H162A, E161Q/E167Q, H178A, and K224A), we tested higher concentration of proteins (up to 4 μm) in the activity assay (Fig. 6B). Such analysis allowed us to identify five residues (Glu-161, Glu-167, His-162, His-178 and Lys-224) that are indispensable for cleavage. Interestingly, the single mutants E161Q and E167Q were still able to specifically process the transcript (data not shown), indicating that individually these two residues have functions that are not strictly required for the catalytic activity. Somewhat surprisingly, G232A, P235A, and E236Q proteins at the concentration giving 15% of RNA shift did not produce an efficient cleavage pattern. However, at higher concentrations (2 μm for G232A and P235A and 0.4 μm for E236Q), they were able to process the RNA substrate specifically. In this paper, we report functional characterization of XendoU, the X. laevis endoribonuclease responsible for processing several intron-encoded snoRNAs. Our results shed new light on the association between XendoU and its substrate, including the identification of XendoU residues that participate in catalysis. The chemical requirements and specificity of RNA-protein interaction were investigated by in vitro binding assays. Such analysis revealed that the interaction of XendoU to its RNA substrate does not require metal ions. Because manganese ions are essential for cleavage (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we concluded that RNA binding and processing activities can be functionally separated. The specificity of the interaction was verified by competition experiments. We showed that oligo(U) sequences are directly involved in binding and recognition of the enzyme; in fact, the UUU → UCU mutation is sufficient to prevent binding. This indicates that U stretches represent not only the target for cleavage activity (5Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) but also the critical element for protein recognition. The low XendoU sequence specificity observed in vitro contrasts with the enzyme selectivity in vivo (4Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggesting that the enzymatic activity in the cellular context is finely controlled. Therefore, it seems likely that specific factors and/or secondary structures assist the function of the enzyme in vivo by providing substrate selectivity. A similar conclusion has already been reached for other enzymes such as the endoribonuclease Rnt1p, which participates in the biosynthesis of monocistronic and polycistronic snoRNA transcripts in yeast (24Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the interaction of specific snoRNP proteins with U18 snoRNA recruits Rnt1p to the specific target, thus activating cleavage (26Giorgi C. Fatica A. Nagel R. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6856-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another example is RNase E, where the stem-loop structures of its target RNA modulate the enzyme activity by limiting access to potentially susceptible sites (27McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The identification of the residues involved in XendoU catalysis was primarily based on prediction data. A comparison analysis showed sequence homologies between XendoU and several proteins from animals, plants, and even cyanobacteria, suggesting a very ancient origin for this protein. XendoU does not contain any known protein domain; among its homologs, the only annotated function was that of putative serine proteases. After establishing the most conserved residues by multiple alignments, we generated several XendoU mutants containing specific amino acid substitutions. They were first tested for the ability to interact with the RNA substrate and then for processing activity. Our experiments identified several residues that are important for the catalytic function of XendoU. The first group includes five amino acids (Glu-161, Glu-167, His-162, His-178, and Lys-224) that are essential for the catalytic activity (Fig. 6). Based on their chemical nature and the known residue requirements for other nucleases (20Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Lo T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Suck D. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 405-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), His-162, His-178, and Lys-224 are probably directly involved in the catalysis. Because Glu-161 and Glu-167 are individually dispensable for catalysis, their role may be indirect, e.g. their carboxylate groups could form hydrogen bonds with imidazole rings of the catalytic histidines (20Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Lo T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Alternatively, glutamates and histidines could be involved in the coordination of the manganese ions, thus promoting the nucleophilic attack. Mutants in a second group of residues (Gly-232, Pro-235, and Glu-236) display only reduced catalysis (Fig. 6). These three residues could have indirect, yet important, roles in catalysis. It has been proposed for 5-phosphatases, which share the same fold with Mg2+-dependent nucleases (21Dlakic M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 272-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), that a conserved Gly may be important, because its unusual conformation, which is not allowed for non-Gly residues, is needed to correctly position the nearby Asp (29Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Gly-232 and Pro-235 are in the short loop that is sandwiched between a predicted β-strand and α-helix, raising the possibility that these conformationally flexible residues are needed for the tight turn between the two structural elements. Other conserved residues, such as Glu-92, Ser-157, and Ser-234, do not affect XendoU catalysis significantly (Fig. 6). Interestingly, among all the mutants analyzed, only the replacements of few residues (Glu-161, Glu-167, Glu-92, and His-162) significantly reduce the binding affinity of XendoU, indicating that binding and catalytic activities of XendoU are partially overlapped. XendoU is the cellular homolog of NendoU, an endoribonuclease that is highly conserved in coronaviruses and in all their distant nidovirus relatives. Both nucleases are involved in basic RNA processing events: NendoU is required for nidovirus RNA synthesis, whereas XendoU is implicated in the biosynthesis of cellular snoRNAs. Notably, three of five catalytically essential residues (His-162, His-178, and Lys-224) coincide with those already described as essential for NendoU catalytic activity (12Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T. Rozanov M. Bayer S. Thiel V. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The other two residues participating in the catalysis are in both cases acidic residues, glutamates for XendoU (Glu-161 and Glu-167) and aspartates for NendoU. The fact that the homologous region shared by the two enzymes includes the putative active sites supports the conclusion that this domain carries out a conserved function. The two distantly related enzymes indeed display analogous activities. They exhibit a similar substrate specificity, the same chemistry of reaction, and the same ion requirement. However, several differences can be pointed out. NendoU, whose natural substrate is still unknown, shows a preference for cleavage of double stranded RNA substrate and displays a U specificity confined to single U residues (12Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T. Rozanov M. Bayer S. Thiel V. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Based on its biochemical features, XendoU cannot be included in either of the two RNase groups already described (6Saida F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We propose XendoU as the founder of a third class of RNA processing enzymes whose members require manganese ions for the catalysis and release products with 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate termini. It would be very interesting to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the members of this new RNase family. We can envision different modes of action. One possibility is that the identified histidine residues could be directly involved in the catalysis by acting as nucleophiles, with manganese ions stabilizing the transition state intermediate. Alternatively, Mn2+can have a direct role in a phosphoryl-transfer reaction. In this context, the catalytically relevant glutamates and histidines could coordinate manganese ions that promote RNA cleavage by deprotonizing water molecules. This possibility is especially attractive, because we previously demonstrated that the natural substrate of XendoU, the third intron of the X. laevis L4 r-protein gene, is able to release the U16 snoRNA precursor by a self-cleavage reaction (30Prislei S. Fatica A. De Gregorio E. Arese M. Fragapane P. Caffarelli E. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Such autocatalytic processing requires Mn2+ ions and releases products containing 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate termini. Nonetheless, cleavage sites utilized in this autocatalytic process encompass but do not coincide with those recognized during enzymatic reaction (30Prislei S. Fatica A. De Gregorio E. Arese M. Fragapane P. Caffarelli E. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that during molecular evolution a predominantly RNA-based mechanism was replaced by a protein-mediated reaction in which Mn2+ still induces endonucleolytic cleavage, whereas the protein moiety determines the specificity of the reaction. Future structural studies will eventually provide deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism employed by these endoribonucleases. We thank Fabio Altieri for constructive discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2096650668,"The homeobox gene HOXA5 encodes a transcription factor that has been shown to play important roles in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tumorigenesis. In order to decipher downstream signaling pathways of HOXA5, we utilized oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed in HOXA5-induced cells compared with uninduced cells. Comparative analysis of gene expression changes after 9 h of HOXA5 induction in Hs578T breast cancer cells identified 306 genes whose expression was modulated at least 2-fold. Ten of these 306 genes were also up-regulated by at least 2-fold at 6 h post-induction. The expression of all of these 10 genes was confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Among these 10 genes, which are most likely to be direct targets of HOXA5, we initiated an investigation into the pleiotrophin gene by first cloning its promoter. Transient transfection assays indicated that HOXA5 can specifically activate the pleiotrophin promoter. Promoter deletion, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and gel-shift assays were performed to show that HOXA5 can directly bind to one binding site on the pleiotrophin promoter. These data strongly suggest that microarray analysis can successfully identify many potential direct downstream genes of HOXA5. Further functional analysis of these targets will allow us to better understand the diverse functions of HOXA5 in embryonic development and tumorigenesis.

HOX genes, a subset of the homeobox genes that were originally identified in Drosophila, encode a family of transcriptional factors essential for axial and appendicular patterning and organogenesis (1Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Recently, many HOX genes were found to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers, including those of the breast, kidney, and skin, suggesting that they may also contribute to the progression of tumors (2Abate-Shen C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 3Chen H. Sukumar S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Lewis M.T. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Chen H. Sukumar S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 524-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All 39 HOX transcriptional factors identified in vertebrates have in common a 60-amino acid DNA-binding homeodomain that binds DNA and that has been conserved with respect to sequence, structure, and mechanism of DNA binding (6Sharkey M. Graba Y. Scott M.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro assays show that all HOX proteins can bind to similar DNA motifs with a core sequence of TAAT (7Hayashi S. Scott M.P. Cell. 1990; 63: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4532-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to relatively simple binding motifs revealed in in vitro binding assays, each HOX gene has a variety of functions that cannot be completely compensated by other HOX genes. In order to understand the complexity of HOX gene functions extending from embryo development to hematopoietic maturation and tumorigenesis, it is important to identify the specific targets for each HOX gene. The evidence for an important role of Hoxa5 in development comes mainly from the study of the Hoxa5 knock-out mice (9Jeannotte L. Lemieux M. Charron J. Poirier F. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2085-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Aubin J. Lemieux M. Tremblay M. Berard J. Jeannotte L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The resultant heterozygous mutant mice were viable and indistinguishable from their wild type littermates. However, more than 60% of the homozygous pups died within 4 days of birth. In homozygous newborn mutants, improper tracheal and lung morphogenesis lead to tracheal occlusion and to respiratory distress associated with a marked decrease in the production of surfactant protein (10Aubin J. Lemieux M. Tremblay M. Berard J. Jeannotte L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Loss of Hoxa5 also perturbed intestinal maturation and transiently affects thyroid development (11Aubin J. Chailler P. Menard D. Jeannotte L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C965-C973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aubin J. Dery U. Lemieux M. Chailler P. Jeannotte L. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4075-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the skeletal structures in the homozygote revealed consistent abnormalities affecting the region between sixth cervical vertebra (C6) and the first lumbar vertebra. In human, HOXA5 has been shown to play a role in blood cell differentiation (13Crooks G.M. Fuller J. Petersen D. Izadi P. Malik P. Pattengale P.K. Kohn D.B. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fuller J.F. McAdara J. Yaron Y. Sakaguchi M. Fraser J.K. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 3391-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of HOXA5 expression in human hematopoietic progenitor cells causes a significant shift toward myeloid differentiation and away from erythroid differentiation (13Crooks G.M. Fuller J. Petersen D. Izadi P. Malik P. Pattengale P.K. Kohn D.B. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HOXA5 expression was lost in more than 60% breast cancer cell lines and primary breast carcinoma cells (15Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HOXA5 in breast cancer cell line, MCF7, induced apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of p53 (15Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, in the p53-mutant breast cancer line Hs578T, we have presented evidence that HOXA5-mediated apoptosis by activating caspase-2 and caspase-8 (16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HOXA5 and TNFα acted synergistically to induce apoptosis (16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that HOXA5 may behave as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cells. Despite knowledge of a variety of functions of the HOXA5 gene that have been found to date in development and tumorigenesis, very few specific targets genes have been identified. The identity of the target genes could better define the multiple pathways through which HOXA5 may positively or negatively modulate growth. In this study, we utilized microarray analysis of an inducible HOXA5 breast cancer cell line, HS578T, to identify 306 genes whose expressions are significantly modified after HOXA5 induction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HOXA5 can directly bind to and activate the promoter of one these genes, pleiotrophin (PTN). 1The abbreviations used are: PTN, pleiotrophin; RT, reverse transcription; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; nt, nucleotide; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HBS, HOXA5-binding site. Further sorting and functionally analyzing the candidate targets of HOXA5 will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of HOXA5 function. Cell Culture and Plasmids Construction—The Hs578T breast cancer cell line was purchased from the ATCC and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SKBR3 breast cancer cells were cultured in McCoy 5A medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The HOXA5-inducible Hs578T cell line was established using the two-step Tet-Off plasmid transfection system, where gene expression is induced by removing doxycycline from the medium, as described previously (16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HOXB1-, HOXB3-, HOXB5-, and HOXD9-expressing plasmids were described previously (15Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 17Raman V. Tamori A. Vali M. Zeller K. Korz D. Sukumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26551-26555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pCB6-HOXA5M was constructed by restricting pCB6-HOXA5 with ApaI followed by treatment with Klenow enzyme to remove 4 bp followed by self-ligation. The 4-bp deletion in pCB6-HOXA5M resulted in a frameshift of the HOXA5-coding sequence. pCB6-HOXA5M encodes a truncated HOXA5 protein without its homeodomain and C terminus. We found unacceptably high levels of activation of the pGL2 promoterless constructs by HOXA5. To circumvent this problem, we modified the pLC-Gal plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Linzhao Cheng, The Johns Hopkins University) that carries a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The pLC-Luc plasmid was constructed by us by replacing the β-galactosidase gene sequence of pLC-Gal with the luciferase gene sequence from pGL-3 plasmid (Promega). The full-length and deleted PTN promoter sequences were PCR-amplified with primers (forward primers: P-1084, 5′-CTA CTT GCC ACA AGA CAA TG-3′; P-624, 5′-AAA TTC TTG GGT GTC AAA GG-3′; P-314, 5′-AAA TGC CCA TCA ATT GTC CA-3′; and reverse primer P+222, 5′-TTG CTA CCG CTG AGT CCA GG-3′) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The PTN promoter inserts, released from pGEM-T cloning vector by restriction enzymes SacII and NdeI, were cloned into pLC-Luc by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter sequence between enzyme sites HindIII and NdeI. The resulting clones, which contained full-length and deletions of PTN promoter, were sequenced and referred to as PTN-Luc, PTN-D-604, and PTN-D-314. respectively. To construct the PTN promoter deletion plasmid PTN-D-880, PTN-Luc was digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and NheI to release a small fragment of 5′-end PTN promoter sequence and was followed by filling with Klenow enzyme and self-ligation with T4 ligase. Similarly, PTN-Luc was cut with NdeI and HindIII to construct PTN-D-101. PTN-D-604-106M was constructed by using a two-step PCR mutagenesis method (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Unit 3.17. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989Google Scholar). Transcriptional Profiling Microarray—Total RNA was purified from HOXA5-inducible Hs578T cells with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) after isolation with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two batches of RNA from HOXA5-inducible cells (0, 6, and 9 h) were purified for performing replicate microarray hybridization experiments. The U133A GeneChip® (Af-fymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) contains probes for detecting ∼14,500 well characterized genes and expressed sequence tags. Hybridization was performed as described (19Thimmulappa R.K. Mai K.H. Srisuma S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Biswal S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5196-5203PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of total RNA with SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen) by using oligo(dT)24 primers, with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added to its 3′-end (Genset Corp, La Jolla, CA). The isolated cDNA was then labeled to generate biotinylated cRNA in vitro and amplified using the BioArray T7 RNA polymerase labeling kit (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). After purification of the cRNA by RNeasy mini kit, 20 μg of cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min. Approximately 12.5 μg of fragmented cRNA was used in a 250-μl hybridization mixture containing herring sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI), plus bacterial and phage cRNA controls (1.5 pm BioB, 5 pm BioC, 25 pm BioD, and 100 pm Cre) to serve as internal controls for hybridization efficiency as directed by the manufacturer (Affymetrix). Aliquots (200 ul) of the mixture were hybridized onto the array for 18 h at 45 °C in a GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix). Each array was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and amplified with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on the GeneChip® Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix). Each array was scanned with the GeneArray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain image and signal intensities. Data Analysis Using Affymetrix Software—Scanned output files were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, and global normalization was performed prior to comparison. To identify differentially expressed transcripts, pairwise comparison analysis was carried out with Data Mining Tool 3.0 (Affymetrix). The analysis compares the differences in values of perfect match to mismatch of each probe pair in the base-line array to its matching probe on the experimental array. p values were determined by the Wilcoxon's signed rank test and denoted as increase, decrease, or no change. Analysis using Data Mining Tool also provides the signal log ratio, which estimates the magnitude and direction of change of a transcript when two arrays are compared (induced versus uninduced). We have converted the signal ration output into fold change for convenience using Equation 1 as recommended by Affymetrix,fold change={ 2signal log ratio,signal log ratio>0(−)2−(signal log ratio),signal log ratio<0eq.1 In the present study, we performed 4 pairwise comparisons for each time point (induced, n = 2, and uninduced, n = 2). Only those altered genes that appeared in 4 of 4 comparisons were selected. This conservative analytical approach was used to limit the number of false-positives. The expressed sequence tags obtained in the data were searched for their recent annotation using the “Analysis Center” at the Affymetrix site (www.netaffx.com). The microarray data has been deposited to the GEO data base (series entry GSE2241; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Ten up-regulated genes as identified by microarray were selected for real time RT-PCR analysis to verify the array results. Reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA, 0.5 μg of anchored oligo(dT)15 primer, and 500 m dNTPs (New England Biolabs) were heated for 5 min at 65 °C; 1× first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 0.01 m dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) were added, and reverse transcription was carried out, in a 20-μl reaction, for 50 min at 42 °C and terminated by heating for 15 min at 70 °C. To assess for potential contamination of solutions, a control containing all reagents, but devoid of RNA, was included. In addition, a control containing all reagents, except the Superscript II, was included for each sample in order to monitor for possible residual genomic DNA in the RNA preparations. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green Master Mix following standard protocols on an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, CA). The primers used for the PCR are shown in Table I. Native gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the final products. The data were first analyzed using the Sequence Detector Software SDS 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Results were calculated and normalized relative to the GAPDH control by using the Microsoft Excel program. All of the PCRs were performed in triplicate, and mean values are shown in figures.Table IPrimers used in the quantitative real time RT-PCR analysisGene namePrimer sequenceEGR-15′-CGAGCAGCCCTACGAGCACCTGAC-3′5′-TGCGCAGCTCAGGGGTGGGCTCTG-3′IL-85′-TCTTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT-3′5′-AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTG-3′GADD45β5′-CGGTGGAGGAGCTTTTGGTG-3′5′-CACCCGCACGATGTTGATGT-3′SAT5′-ATGGCTAAATTCGTGATCCG-3′5′-TTAGCAAGTACTCCTTGTCG-3′TIEG5′-CTCAACTTCGGTGCCTCTCT-3′5′-GGTTTGGCAGTATCTGAGAG-3′ETR1015′-TCGGTGTGGAAGATGTATCA-3′5′-TGTCCATTGGCTCCGGAAAC-3′PTN5′-ATGCAGGCTCAACAGTACCA-3′5′-TATGTTCCACAGGTGACATC-3′EST15′-TTTGCACTTATTCCCATCTT-3′5′-GGTGCCCATTGTTGAACTAA-3′EST25′-AGGAGTCACTGGTTTACAAG-3′5′-ACTTGGAAATTGTGCCAGTG-3′EST35′-GAGTATTTCCAGCCATAACA-3′5′-TAAAGGACTCACACTGGAGA-3′GAPDH5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Twenty μg of protein was fractionated in a 4-12% NuPAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with 100 ml of TBS buffer (10 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl) containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h on the shaker at room temperature or overnight in cold room. The membrane was rinsed once with TBS buffer before incubating with an appropriate dilution of the 1° antibody in TBS buffer containing 5% milk and 0.02% Tween 20 on shaker for 1 h. The primary antibodybound membrane was washed with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 four times and then incubated with the 2° antibody (ECL kit antirabbit or anti-mouse from Amersham Biosciences) at about 1:1000 dilution for 1-1.5 h on a shaker. The filter was developed by using the ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit anti-peptide antibodies to HOXA5 were provided by Zymed Laboratories Inc. Transient Transfection Assay—2 × 105 SKBR3 cells were seeded onto each well of 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. 1-2 μg of plasmids was transfected into cells using Gene Jammer (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assay using the luciferase activity measuring kit (Promega, Madison WI) and the β-galactosidase assay kit (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities for each sample. The fold activation was calculated as the ratio of normalized luciferase activities in the cells transfected with the reporter plasmid in the presence of HOXA5-expressing plasmid to that in the absence of HOXA5-expressing plasmid. Each transfection was repeated at least three times, and the averaged data are shown in the figures. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 × 106 vector and HOXA5-induced cells were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture medium. Cells were harvested and sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. After centrifuging samples for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was pre-cleared with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, 50% slurry for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. 2 μg of HOXA5 antibody was then added to the supernatant fraction for incubation overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Then 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added to collect the antibody-histone complex. The protein A-agarose-antibody-histone complex was extensively washed for 5 min as suggested and heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse histone-DNA crosslinks. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The PCR were performed using two pairs of primers (control: nt 1084, 5′-CTA CTT GCC ACA AGA CAA TG, and nt 725, 5′-ACG CTA AGG CAA TGC ATA GG-3′; HBS: nt 271, 5′-GAG ATC TGG CTT TGC ACT CAT CTG AA-3′, and nt 8, 5′-GCA TAT GGA GAA TGG GAG GGA ATG A-3′). Gel-shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from HOXA5-inducible cells were prepared, and gel-shift assays were performed as described previously (15Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 17Raman V. Tamori A. Vali M. Zeller K. Korz D. Sukumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26551-26555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl. One microliter of nuclear extract (∼2 μg of total protein) was added to binding buffer containing 2 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Amersham Biosciences), 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 6% glycerol, and 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide. After 15 min on ice, loading buffer was added, and the protein-DNA complexes were resolved in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis at 100 V for 3-4 h in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE: 0.089 m Tris base, 0.089 m boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak-RP film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The 20-mer oligonucleotides, containing the canonical HOXA5-binding site within the PTN promoter and the mutated binding sites, were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. To ascertain specificity of binding, unlabeled competitor wild type or mutated oligonucleotides were incubated with the protein extract prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. A supershift assay was also performed by incubating the DNA-protein complex with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal HOXA5 antiserum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 10 min on ice. Identification of Genes That Are Differentially Expressed after Induction of HOXA5 Expression—TheTet-Off HOXA5-in-ducible Hs578T cell line was established as described previously (16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this system, HOXA5 expression is tightly controlled by the tetracycline-responsive promoter and can be rapidly induced by removal of doxycycline (a tetracycline analog) from the culture medium (Fig. 1). Similar to the parental cells, under uninduced conditions (0-h time point), the expression of HOXA5 was undetectable by Western blot analysis. At 3 h post-induction, the expression of HOXA5 became detectable and continued to increase over the time course of induction until 6-9 h post-induction. At 12 h post-induction, cells began to undergo apoptosis (16Chen H. Chung S. Sukumar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data suggested that HOXA5-mediated gene expression had occurred during the first few hours of induction. The earliest responding genes are more likely to be the direct targets of HOXA5. To this end, we harvested cells at 0, 6, and 9 h after induction. Total RNA was purified from these cells and subjected to oligonucleotide microarray analysis using Affymetrix chips. The microarray experiments were repeated once with separately purified RNA samples for each of the time points. The gene expression profiles of cells induced for 6 and 9 h were compared with that under uninduced conditions (0 h) in two sets of experiments (_1 and _2). The differentially expressed genes in 4 of 4 comparisons (6 h_ 1 versus 0 h_ 1 and _ 2; 6 h_ 2 versus 0h_1and_2;9h_1 versus 0h_1and_2;9h_2 versus 0 h_ 1 and _ 2) are listed in the supplemental tables. At 9 h post-induction, when we observed the maximal number of genes that were differentially expressed, we identified 262 genes whose expression was up-regulated by at least 2-fold and 44 genes whose expression was down-regulated by at least 2-fold. Because HOXA5 is well established as a positive regulator of genes, we have focused only on the up-regulated genes in this study. Among the 262 up-regulated genes, 10 genes or expressed sequence tags were also up-regulated at 6 h post-induction (Table II).

Therefore, we examined the expression pattern of these genes over the time course of HOXA5 induction. Similar to the continued increase in the expression of HOXA5 during the time course of induction, we observed that compared with parent cells and uninduced cells, expression of most of these 10 genes increased in parallel to the expression of HOXA5 (Fig. 2). Hence, the data generated by the microarray was confirmed for each of these genes by real time PCR, thereby validating the robustness of the analysis. HOXA5 Specifically Activates the Promoter of the Pleiotrophin Gene—Next, a search was performed of the promoter region of these 10 HOXA5-induced candidate genes. Among these, we observed the presence of multiple HOXA5 core-binding motifs (TAAT) in the promoter sequences of the PTN gene. Although the core binding sequences of HOX genes are TAAT, the specificity of binding for each HOX genes has been shown, in one study, to be attributable to the flanking sequences (8Pellerin I. Schnabel C. Catron K.M. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4532-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). But no consensus HOXA5-specific binding sites beside the TAAT core sequence were identified. PTN encodes a 136-amino acid cytokine that is an important contributor to growth, differentiation, and maintenance of viability within the mammalian nervous system during development (21Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 22Deuel T.F. Zhang N. Yeh H.J. Silos-Santiago I. Wang Z.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Hoxa5 is also highly expressed in the nervous system during mouse embryogenesis. Moreover, in primary breast cancers, we analyzed multiple array data bases and determined that PTN expression is lost in breast cancer (www.oncomine.com). PTN expression level was significantly lower in breast tumor samples in three of three studies involving a total of 32 normal breast samples and 149 breast carcinoma samples. The adjusted p values for these three studies were 0.002, 0.1, and 5.6 × 10-6 respectively. Based upon the data that there is loss of HOXA5 (15Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and PTN in a large proportion of breast cancers, we wanted to test whether HOXA5 directly activates the expression of PTN. To this end, we performed transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, HOXA5 up-regulated the PTN promoter driven-luciferase gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Luciferase activity increased by about 4-fold in the presence of 1 μg of HOXA5-expressing plasmid, when compared with activity in the absence of HOXA5-expressing plasmids (Fig. 3B). With the same amount of transfected mutant HOXA5-expressing plasmid, no increase in luciferase gene expression was observed (Fig. 3B). Because many HOX genes are functionally redundant, we next tested the specificity of HOXA5 on activation of PTN promoter. PTN promoter was cotransfected with expression constructs of either HOXB1, HOXB3, HOXB5, or HOXD9. W"

Little is known about the regulation of HER-2 signaling in colon cancer cells. Integrin α5/β1 expression is frequently lost in colorectal cancer cells compared with normal intestinal epithelium, and colon cancer cells lacking integrin α5/β1 expression utilize HER-2 signaling for proliferation and tumorigenicity. Re-expression of integrin α5/β1 in colon cancer cells abrogated their tumorigenicity, but how this occurs is not well known. Stable expression of integrin α5/β1 in colon cancer cells with little or no detectable integrin α5/β1 protein expression resulted in the post-transcriptional down-regulation of HER-2 protein. Integrin α5/β1 was found to interact with HER-2, and the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α5/β1 was sufficient to mediate HER-2 down-regulation. Integrin α5/β1-mediated down-regulation of HER-2 was the result of increased lysosomal targeting. The inhibition of HER-2 signaling represents a potential mechanism by which integrin α5/β1 exerts its tumor suppressor-like activity in colon cancer cells.

HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2), a member of the c-erbB receptor tyrosine kinase protooncogene family, is commonly overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including 35–85% of human colorectal cancers, in which its overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis (2Kapitanovic S.

However, its potential role as a therapeutic target in colon cancers is in the preclinical phase. HER-2 is the only HER family member that lacks a ligand, but its tyrosine kinase activity can be stimulated through heterodimerization with other activated HER members. It appears to be the preferred heterodimerization partner when co-expressed with other HER family members and promotes cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis (5Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). HER-2 can also stimulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclooxygenase-2 by cancer cells, thus promoting tumor angiogenesis and survival (6Kumar R. Yarmand-Bagheri R. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). HER-2 is an important therapeutic target in breast cancers, especially in those that greatly overexpress HER-2 protein. Colon cancer cells express much less HER-2 relative to breast cancer cells, but preclinical studies suggest that HER-2 may still be a relevant therapeutic target in human colon cancers (8Mann M.

Cancer. 2003; 105: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the post-translational regulation of HER-2 in colorectal cancers is poorly understood. Integrins are the largest family of epithelial cell adhesion receptors and are expressed in cells as α/β heterodimers. Integrins and the HER family share common signaling pathways and cellular responses, such as differentiation, survival, motility, and proliferation. In fact, integrins can activate the EGFR in epithelial and nonepithelial cell lines (11Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P.

Regulation of integrin and HER family members is critical to normal cell behavior, because the dysregulation of the expression and function of members of each of these receptor families promotes tumorigenicity (14Ruoslahti E.

Integrin α5/β1 expression is commonly lost during colonic tumorigenesis, and its re-expression in malignant Chinese hamster ovary and colon cancer cells abrogated their anchorage independent growth and tumorigenicity (13Kuwada S.K.

Little is known as to the mechanisms of the tumor suppressor-like activity of integrin α5/β1. We show that the stable expression of integrin α5/β1 in colon cancer cells lacking integrin α5/β1 expression caused a significant down-regulation of HER-2 protein levels. The down-regulation of HER-2 was not due to changes in c-erbB-2 transcriptional regulation. In addition, stable expression of integrin α5/β1 in a colon cancer cell line resulted in a significant decrease in amphiregulin mRNA levels and the loss of constitutive EGFR autophosphorylation, which was seen in the control cells. These results suggest that the loss of integrin α5/β1 expression in colon cells may lead to constitutive activation of EGFR and HER-2-mediated signaling, which in turn promotes growth factor and extracellular matrix independence. Humanized mAb 4D5 (Herceptin™) was purchased from the Huntsman Cancer Institute pharmacy. The following antibodies were used for the immunoblotting experiments: integrin α5 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories), HER-2 mAb (Ab-3, Oncogene Research), phospho-MAPK mAb (Cell Signaling), ERK1 mAb (Transduction Laboratories), actin mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), V5 mAb (Invitrogen), Myc polyclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), and ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Lysosomes were detected using the acidophilic and fluorescent Lysotracker® dye (Molecular Probes). The lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml in the cell culture medium. pcDNA3-integrin α5 was previously constructed as published (13Kuwada S.K. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of pTP2000-HER-2 (a kind gift from Dr. Kathleen Woods Ignatoski, University of Michigan) was performed to generate a SalI site before the stop codon after the HER-2 sequence. A DNA fragment encoding eGFP with SalI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends was generated by PCR of the vector pEGFP (Amaxa) using the following primers: 5′-TACCGGTCGACACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGA-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GTACCGTCGACTGCAGAATTCG-3′ (antisense primer). pTP2000-HER-2 and the cDNA fragment were cut with SalI and gel-purified. The digested PCR products were ligated yielding the following plasmid: pTP2000-HER-2-eGFP. The HER-2-eGFP construct was verified by DNA sequencing. pcDNA3α5 was cut with the restriction endonuclease HindIII. The truncated integrin α5 DNA sequence was gel-purified and subcloned into the HindIII site of pcDNA4B (Invitrogen). The resulting construct encoded a peptide in which the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin α5 subunit was deleted at the amino acid just after the transmembrane sequence: extracellular domain-transmembrane sequence-KL/GFFKRSLPYGTAMEKAQLKPPATSDA (the cytoplasmic domain is underlined, and the forward slash shows the location of the truncation). First, a plasmid containing the integrin α5 signal sequence was made. The integrin α5 signal sequence (MGSRTPESPLHAVQLRWGPRRRPPLLPLLLLLLPPPPRVGGFN) was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3-α5 as a template and with the following primers: 5′-CGCTAAGCTTAGAGCGGGCGCTATGGGGAGCC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-CTGCGGATCCCTCCGCGTCTAAGTTGAAGCCC-3′ (antisense primer). The PCR fragment was designed to contain 5′ HindIII and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. The fragment was cut with HindIII and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated in frame into pcDNA4A-Myc6-V5-His6. The resulting pcDNA4-α5 SS (signal sequence)-Myc6-V5-His6 construct was sequence-verified. The integrin α5 sequence with deletion of the extracellular domain was constructed next. A DNA fragment containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was generated by PCR using pcDNA3-α5asa template with the following primers: CCAAGAATTCAGGCAGCTATGGCGTCCCACTGT (sense primer) and AAATCTCGAGGACTCCGGCATCAGAGGT (antisense primer). The cDNA was designed to contain EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into pcDNA4-α5 SS-Myc6-V5-His6, which had been digested with EcoRI and XhoI (between the Myc6 and V5 epitope tag sequences). This resulted in a truncation mutant encoding an integrin α5 protein missing the extracellular domain-/GSYGVPLWIIILAILFGLLLLGLLIYILY-cytoplasmic domain (the transmembrane domain is underlined, and the forward slash shows the location of the 5′ end of the truncation). The integrin α5 transmembrane sequence (GSYGVPLWIIILAILFGLLLLGLLIYILY) was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3-α5 as a template and with the following primers: 5′-CCAAGAATTCAGGCAGCTATGGCGTCCCACTGT-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-TTTGAACTCGAGAAGCTTGTAGAGGATGTAGATGAG-3′ (antisense primer). The cDNA was designed to contain EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated in frame into pcDNA4-α5 SS-Myc6-V5-His6, which had been digested with EcoRI and XhoI (between the Myc6 and V5 epitope tag sequences). The final construct was sequence-verified. Caco-2 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were cultured on tissue culture plastic or permeable polycarbonate membrane inserts (24 mm, 0.8-μm pore Transwells™; Costar). Caco-2 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3-integrin α5 as previously described and were maintained on fibronectin-coated plastic in medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of G418 (13Kuwada S.K. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells stably transfected with integrin α5 (a kind gift from Dr. Rudolph Juliano, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) were maintained on fibronectin-coated plastic in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml of G418 (17Varner J.A. Emerson D.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM complete medium to about 70% confluency on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes, and Caco-2 cells were cultured to about 70% confluency on plain dishes. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 4 ml of Optimem medium (Invitrogen) and then overlaid with 2.4 ml of Optimem medium/dish. A mixture of 250 μl of Optimem containing 4 μg of DNA that was premixed with 8 μl of Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA mixture was then added to 250 μl of Optimem plus 24 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), which was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA mixture was added to the cells, which were then incubated in the tissue culture incubator for 3 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were overlaid with complete DMEM for transient transfections or complete DMEM with 1.5 mg/ml G418 (pcDNA3-based constructs) or 200 μg/ml zeocin (for pcDNA4-based constructs). For transient expression of pcDNA4-HER2-eGFP in HT-29 cells, the Nucleofector™ (Amaxa) was used because these cells were difficult to transfect. Confluent monolayers of HT-29 cells in 60-mm dishes were dispersed in trypsin-PBS, and then 5 ml of medium was added to each dish of cells. The cells were placed in conical sterile tubes and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice in PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution V (Amaxa) and then mixed with 5 μl of DNA (concentration, 1 μg/μl). The cell/DNA mixture was transferred to a cuvette (Amaxa) and placed in the Nucleofector™ device. The samples were electroporated using program T-20. The cuvettes were immediately removed, and 500 μl of RPMI (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine) was added to the cells. The cells were then transferred to 35-mm dishes containing sterile coverslips immersed in DMEM with 75 nm (final concentration) Lysotracker® dye. At various time points, the cells on the coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS and then mounted in Prolong Gold™ (Molecular Probes) on glass slides. The cells were imaged at 100× on a fluorescent microscope. The cells were dispersed and plated at 40,000 cells/well in 96-well dishes. At various days in the culture, the cells were gently washed twice with 100 μl/well of ice-cold blocking buffer A (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and twice with 100 μl/well of ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed for 10 min in 100% ice-cold methanol (100 μl/well) and then allowed to air-dry. The cells were stained with 100 μl/well of 0.1% crystal violet in H2O for 10 min and then washed gently four times with double distilled H2O and four times with PBS. The plates were then air-dried completely. The stained cells were then solubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate, and the plates were read at 590 nm in a spectrophotometer. The absorption at 590 nm is proportional to the number of attached cells. A 1.6% low melting point agar solution (in water) was microwaved until boiling and then cooled in a 37 °C water bath. The agar solution was mixed 1:1 with 2× medium, and 1 ml of this solution was plated in 35-mm tissue culture plastic dishes. 20,000 cells were added to a solution containing 2× medium and 1× medium in a 1:2 ratio (3 ml total volume/dish). Then 1 ml of liquid 1.6% agar solution (at 37 °C) was added to the cell mixture, which was vortexed gently to disperse the cells. One ml of the cell mixture was layered onto the bottom layer and left at room temperature until the agar solidified. The cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and photographed each day. The following probes were constructed. GAPDH—A 1272-base pair DNA fragment was cut out of pBS(KS II)-GAPDH with PstI restriction endonuclease and gel-purified. HER2—A 210-base pair PCR product was generated from Caco-2 cDNA that encompassed the exon II–III splice site and incorporated BamHI and SmaI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, using the following set of primers: forward primer with BamHI site, 5′-GAGTGGATCCTGGAACCTGGAACTCACCTACCT-3′, and reverse primer with SmaI site, 5′-AATACCCGGGTGGTATTGTTCAGC-3′. The PCR product was cut with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and SmaI, gel-purified, and ligated into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA4C (Invitrogen). The probe for Northern blotting was cut out with BamHI and NotI and gel-purified. The probes were randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP using the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) and purified with G-50 Sephadex quick spin columns (Roche Applied Science). RNA was extracted from 80–90% confluent cell monolayers with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was resolved in formaldehyde, 0.9% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N Nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and immobilized with UV light. The membranes were washed in prehybridization buffer (5× Denhardt's Solution, 5× SSC (750 mm NaCl; 75 mm sodium citrate), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm single-stranded DNA at 42 °C for 3 h. The denatured probe was then added into the buffer and incubated at 42 °C overnight. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and then twice for 20 min each in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. X-ray film was exposed to the membranes with intensifying screens at –70 °C overnight and then developed. Confluent monolayers of Caco-2 and HT-29 control and integrin α5-transfected cells cultured on Transwell polycarbonate membranes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. 4 °C PBS (pH 8) containing EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was added to the apical and basal chambers of the cells and left for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then once with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) to quench the reaction. The cells were warmed to 37 °C to allow HER-2 endocytosis to resume. At various time points thereafter, the cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer. The lysates were normalized for total protein concentration and then incubated with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin beads in PBS (Pierce) at 4 °C on a rocker overnight. The lysates were aspirated off, and the beads were washed once with lysis buffer and boiled in reducing sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue) for 3 min. Western blots for HER-2 were performed as described elsewhere in this section. Confluent monolayers of cells were lysed in 4 °C lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2PO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) and clarified at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysates were then normalized for protein concentration to a total volume of 1 ml in lysis buffer. 1–2 μgof primary antibody were added to each tube of lysate, which was then incubated on a rocker at 4 °C for 2 h. The antibodies were immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of a slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Calbiochem) for 1 h on a rocker at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then boiled in sample buffer for 3 min. The samples were then used to perform immunoblotting as described below. The cells cultured on 100-mm plastic dishes were extracted at various times after plating in lysis buffer, sonicated for 10 s, and clarified at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Pierce). 50–100 μg of total protein for each lysate or immunoprecipitate were boiled in reducing sample buffer for 3 min and then resolved on 7.5 or 4–20% Tris-HCl SDS-polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked overnight in blocking buffer B (1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet). The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer B at 4 °C overnight. The blots were washed twice in blocking buffer B for 20 min each and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The blots were washed twice in blocking buffer B for 20 min each, incubated with SuperSignal™ horse-radish peroxidase substrate (Pierce) for 1 min and then exposed to film. Densitometry was performed on the bands on the blots using National Institutes of Health Image 1.63. Integrin α5/β1 Modulates HER-2 Expression and Function in Colon Cancer Cells—Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, which had little or no detectable integrin α5/β1 protein expression, were stably transfected with a vector containing the full-length human integrin α5 gene and selected in culture medium containing 1.5 mg/ml of G418. The stable expression of integrin α5 resulted in the overexpression of integrin α5/β1 in Caco-2 and HT-29 clonal populations (13Kuwada S.K. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Varner J.A. Emerson D.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Caco-2 and HT-29 cells are known to express HER-2 protein (9Kuwada S.K. Scaife C.L. Kuang J. Li X. Wong R.F. Florell S.R. Coffey Jr., R.J. Gray P.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because HER-2 mediates cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, the effect of HER-2 inhibition on cell proliferation was tested by incubating the cells with the HER-2 antagonistic mAb 4D5 (trastuzumab). Although mAb 4D5 inhibited Caco-2 cells stably transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1A), it had little effect on Caco-2 cells stably transfected with integrin α5 (Fig. 1B). HER-2 is known to activate ERKs, which are known mediators of growth factor-induced cell proliferation. Control Caco-2, but not Caco-2 cells stably transfected with integrin α5 (Caco-2-α5), showed constitutive activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1C). The constitutive ERK phosphorylation in HT-29 cells was reduced by incubation with mAb 4D5 for 24 h (Fig. 1C). HT-29-α5 formed significantly fewer colonies in the soft agar anchorage-independent proliferation assay than the control cells as expected from previous reports (13Kuwada S.K. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 17Varner J.A. Emerson D.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Incubation with mAb 4D5 inhibited the anchorage-independent proliferation of control HT-29 cells but not HT-29-α5 cells (Fig. 1D), which showed that HER-2 promoted anchorage-independent proliferation in HT-29 cells lacking integrin α5/β1 expression. To understand why the control Caco-2 and HT-29 cells demonstrated decreased proliferation in the presence of mAb 4D5 and the integrin α5-transfected cells did not, the expression levels of HER-2 were examined. The integrin α5-transfected Caco-2 and HT-29 cells demonstrated much lower HER-2 protein levels than the control cells (Fig. 1E). Multiple Caco-2 integrin α5 transfectants were isolated and studied to determine the potential effect of clonal selection on HER-2 expression. Three additional stable integrin α5-transfected Caco-2 clones showed HER-2 down-regulation (Fig. 1F, left panel, lanes 4–6), whereas three additional control transfectants failed to show HER-2 down-regulation (Fig. 1F, left panel, lanes 1–3). This showed that the stable expression of integrin α5/β1 consistently resulted in decreased HER-2 expression. Because HER-2 cleavage was observed in cells overexpressing HER-2 (20Shimizu H. Seiki T. Asada M. Yoshimatsu K. Koyama N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the entire HER-2 Western blot, which was performed with a monoclonal antibody that detects the carboxyl-terminal portion of HER-2, is shown (Fig. 1F). No HER-2 cleavage products were detected in the lysates generated from integrin α5-transfected Caco-2 cells. Mechanism of Integrin α5/β1-mediated Decrease in HER-2 Expression—The possibility that integrin α5/β1 caused a decrease in c-erbB2 transcription was examined. Neither HT-29 nor Caco-2 cells that were stably transfected with integrin α5 showed decreased HER-2 mRNA levels compared with the control transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Loading controls of the cell lines showed similar levels of GAPDH mRNA in the samples. The data in Fig. 2A suggested that integrin α5/β1-induced down-regulation of HER-2 may occur at the post-transcriptional level. To test this hypothesis, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with integrin α5. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed and used to generate integrin α5 and HER-2 immunoblots. Down-regulation of HER-2 protein did not occur in Caco-2 cells transiently transfected with integrin α5 (Fig. 2B), but instead it took at least two passages in the presence of the selection agent G418 to see at least a 50% decrease in HER-2 expression compared with the control cells (Fig. 2C). The diminished expression of HER-2 persisted with subsequent passages. The HER-2 protein levels remained constant in the Caco-2 cells stably transfected with vector alone (Fig. 2C). Co-transfection of HER-2 and integrin α5 did not induce apoptosis (data not shown), arguing against a selection mechanism for the emergence of a population of cells expressing integrin α5/β1 and not HER-2. Integrin α5/β1 Stimulates HER-2 Protein Degradation—One possible explanation for the decreased HER-2 protein levels in the integrin α5/β1-expressing cells was a decrease in the half-life of HER-2 protein. To study this, Caco-2 cells that were transfected with integrin α5 and only passaged once in G418, so they expressed readily detectable levels of both integrin α5 and HER-2 proteins, and control cells were surface biotinylated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then brought to 37 °C to allow receptor endocytosis to resume, and at various time points thereafter, the cells were lysed. The lysates were normalized for total protein concentration and incubated with streptavidin beads. The resulting precipitates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-HER-2 antibodies. The immunoblots show that surface HER-2 protein levels did not change much over the 24-h time course in the control cells, whereas they fell greatly after 12 h in the integrin α5-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). These data showed that the half-life of surface HER-2 receptors was significantly reduced in cells stably expressing integrin α5/β1. The EGFR is well known to undergo lyso"
https://openalex.org/W2080303413,"We have determined the crystal structure of nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase from Themoplasma acidophilum (TaNAPRTase). The TaNAPRTase has three domains, an N-terminal domain, a central functional domain, and a unique C-terminal domain. The crystal structure revealed that the functional domain has a type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold that may be a common architecture for both nicotinic acid and quinolinic acid (QA) phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTase) despite low sequence similarity between them. Unlike QAPRTase, TaNAPRTase has a unique extra C-terminal domain containing a zinc knuckle-like motif containing 4 cysteines. The TaNAPRTase forms a trimer of dimers in the crystal. The active site pocket is formed at dimer interfaces. The complex structures with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) showed, surprisingly, that functional residues lining on the active site of TaNAPRTase are quite different from those of QAPRTase, although their substrates are quite similar to each other. The phosphate moiety of PRPP and NAMN is anchored to the phosphate-binding loops formed by backbone amides, as found in many α/β barrel enzymes. The pyrophosphate moiety of PRPP is located at the entrance of the active site pocket, whereas the nicotinate moiety of NAMN is located deep inside. Interestingly, the nicotinate moiety of NAMN is intercalated between highly conserved aromatic residues Tyr21 and Phe138. Careful structural analyses combined with other NAPRTase sequence subfamilies reveal that TaNAPRTase represents a unique sequence subfamily of NAPRTase. The structures of TaNAPRTase also provide valuable insight for other sequence subfamilies such as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor, known to have nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity.

NAD is an essential cofactor for both energy metabolism and signal transduction similar to dual functional nucleotides, ATP and GTP. The role of NAD acting on redox equilibrium in metabolism has been well known in processes such as DNA repair and calcium-dependent signaling pathways (1Lin S.J. Guarente L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). NAD is synthesized via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In one pathway, NAD is synthesized from tryptophan, a de novo pathway (2Kucharczyk R. Zagulski M. Rytka J. Herbert C.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in the other, NAD is generated by recycling degraded NAD products such as nicotinamide, referred to as the salvage pathway (3Tritz G.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 557-563Google Scholar). The three precursors, quinolinate (QA), 1The abbreviations used are: QA, quinolinic acid; PRTase, phosphoribosyltransferase; MtQAPRTase, QAPRTase from M. tuberculosis; StQAPRTase, S. typhimurium; PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate; NA, nicotinate; NAMN, nicotinate mononucleotide; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAm, nicotinamide; NAPRTase, NA phosphoribosyltransferase; TaNAPRTase, NAPRTase from T. acidophilum; St- NAPRTase, NAPRTase from S. typhimurium; EcNAPRTase, NAPRTase from E. coli; NAmPRTase, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; PBEF, pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor; PDB, Protein Data Bank. nicotinate (NA), and nicotinamide (NAm), can be transferred onto phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) by the respective phosphoribosyl transferase (Fig. 1). The resulting mononucleotides, nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN), are converted into the corresponding dinucleotides, NAD or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (4Berger F. Ramirez-Hernandez M.H. Ziegler M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Finally, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide is amidated to NAD by NAD synthase. Surprisingly, increasing the activity of NAD biosynthetic enzymes has recently been demonstrated to extend life span (5Denu J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 41-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 6Hekimi S. Guarente L. Science. 2003; 299: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Overexpression of enzymes of the NAD biosynthetic pathway such as nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase), nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, or nicotinamidase in yeast results in higher activity of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2p and concomitant life span extension (7Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 8Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L.

NAPRTase is a facultative ATPase that couples ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide formation in the salvage pathway (3Tritz G.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 557-563Google Scholar). The NAPRTase from Salmonella typhimurium (StNAPRTase) catalyzes NAMN formation without ATP but accelerates the reaction 10-30-fold in its presence (10Gross J.W. Rajavel M. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A low affinity form of StNAPRTase is phosphorylated by ATP followed by conversion to a high affinity form binding substrates and producing NAMN. The covalently phosphorylated site, His219, is converted to a labile 1-phosphohistidine by ATP (11Rajavel M. Lalo D. Gross J.W. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4181-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular function of NAPRTase, we have determined the crystal structures of native and substrate-bound forms of an NAPRTase homologue from Thermoplasma acidophilum (TaNAPRTase, gi: 16082162). In the Pfam data base (12Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 30: 276-280Crossref Scopus (2021) Google Scholar), TaNAPRTase belongs to pfam04095 together with StNAPRTase and EcNAPRTase (NAPRTase from Escherichia coli). The TaNAPRTase also shows strong sequence homology to pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), one of the members of Pfam04095 (Fig. 2A). The murine homologue of the previously identified human PBEF gene coding for a putative cytokine has been identified as a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAmPRTase), indicating that NAD biosynthesis may play an important role in lymphocyte activation (13Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The structural and functional relationship of NAPRTase sequence subfamilies is also discussed based on the crystal structures together with sequence comparisons.Fig. 2Sequence comparisons. A, comparison of sequences and secondary structures between NAPRTase and QAPRTases. Abbreviations are as follows: human (Hs), Rattus norvegicus (Rn), Thermotoga maritima (Tm). For others, refer to the abbreviations used. The secondary structure prediction results of StNAPRTase, EcNAPRTase, HsPBEF, and RnPBEF were obtained from PSIPRED (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred). The crystal structures of MtQAPRTase (PDB accession code: 1qpn) and TmQAPRTase (1o4u) were used to derive their secondary structure elements. Blue characters represent α-helix, red for β-strand, and green characters represent 310-helix. Only the type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold is represented with symbols of α-helix and β-strand based on the MtQAPRTase structure. B, Sequence comparison between TaNAPRTase and its homologues. Abbreviations are as follows: T. acidophilum (Ta), Thermoplasma volcanium (Tv), Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af), Halobacterium sp.

Domains are represented as follows: red for the N-terminal domain, green for the central domain, and yellow for the C-terminal zinc knuckle-like domain. Secondary structure elements are represented above the sequence alignment. Blue represents the α-helix, red diamonds represent the β-strand, and green represents the 310-helix. The - - - represents a gap, the * represents identical residues, the: represents highly conserved residues, and the · represents less highly conserved residues. The percentage of sequence identities are also shown.

The resulting PCR product was purified and prepared for ligation-independent cloning (14Aslanidis C. de Jong P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 20: 6069-6074Crossref Scopus (948) Google Scholar) by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mm dTTP for 30 min at 37 °C. The prepared DNA was then mixed with the vector pB4 for 5 min at room temperature and transformed into DH5α. This pB4 vector was designed in our laboratory to express the target protein together with an N-terminal His6 tag-maltose-binding protein fusion containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Clones were screened by plasmid DNA analysis and transformed into BL21(DE3)/pSJS1244 for protein expression (15Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S-H. Biotechnol.

Cells were disrupted by microfluidization (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml DNase, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was then spun in a Beckman ultracentrifuge Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein was affinity-purified using two 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP columns (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was bound to the column in 5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl and was eluted with a gradient of 4-300 mm imidazole in 10 column volumes. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at room temperature against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole in the presence of tobacco etch virus protease. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 5-ml HiTrap metal chelating (Ni2+) column. The cleaved recombinant protein was found in the flow-through. Further purification was performed with size-exclusion chromatography in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE showed one band ∼ 43 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of TaNAPRTase. The protein was concentrated to 8.1 mg/ml for crystallization. Dynamic light scattering (DynaPro 99, Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) showed a polydisperse peak, indicating the presence of an oligomeric form of TaNAPRTase. Screening for crystallization conditions was performed using the sparse matrix method (17Jancarik J. Kim S-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) with several screens from Hampton Research (Hampton Research, Laguna Niquel, CA) and the Wizard Screen (deCODE genetics, Bainbridge Island, WA). The crystallization robot “Hydra Plus-One” (Matrix Technologies, Hudson, NH) was used to set the screens using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. In the optimized crystallization conditions, 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of the well solution containing 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 45% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. A thin rod crystal grew in a week to approximate dimensions of 0.08 × 0.02 × 0.02 mm3. The PRPP-bound complex was obtained by soaking a crystal with 10 mm PRPP for 12 h. When crystals are grown in 2.4 m sodium malonate at pH 7.0, the electron density map showed the presence of partially occupied NAMN. Interestingly, the addition of 10 mm nicotinate for 12 h clearly showed a fully occupied NAMN bound in the structure. Data Collection and Reduction—The crystal grown in the first crystallization solution was soaked in a drop of mother liquor containing 5 mm K2IrCl6 for 12 h and then transferred to mother liquor with 10% glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for x-ray data collection. X-ray diffraction data to 2.8 Å were collected at a single wavelength (1.10490 Å, Table I) of iridium absorption peak at the Macromolecular Crystallography Facility beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using an Area Detector System Co. (Poway, CA) Quantum 4 CCD detector placed 250 mm from the sample. The oscillation range per image was 1.0° with no overlap between two contiguous images. X-ray diffraction data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL program suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The data sets for the complex crystals with PRPP and NAMN were collected to 2.75 and 2.65 Å, respectively.

Ten percent of the data were randomly chosen for free R-factor cross validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Isotropic B-factors for individual atoms were initially fixed to 20 Å2 and were refined in the last stages. The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps were used for manual rebuilding between refinement cycles and for the location of solvent molecules. Two complex structures containing PRPP and NAMN were solved at 2.75 and 2.65, respectively. Atomic coordinates of the three structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession code of 1YTD, 1YTE, and 1YTK, respectively.Table IICrystal parameters and refinement statisticsData setIridium complexPRPP complexNAMN complexSpace groupP6322P6322P6322Cell dimensions (Å3)136.0 × 136.0 × 119.7136.1 × 136.1 × 120.2135.2 × 135.2 × 119.7β = 120β = 120β = 120Volume fraction of solvent65.4%65.6%65.0%Vn (Å3/dalton)3.693.713.65Total number of residues389389389Total non-H atoms305031093105Number of water molecules397664Average temperature factorsProtein45.9 Å240.2 Å247.4 Å2Solvent35.9 Å239.7 Å242.9 Å2OthersN/A93.8 Å261.7 Å2Resolution range of reflections used20.0−2.8 Å20.0−2.75 Å20.0−2.65 ÅAmplitude cutoff0.0 σ0.0 σ0.0 σR-factor19.8%19.6%20.1%Free R-factor24.6%25.4%25.3%Stereochemical idealityBond0.009 Å0.007 Å0.009 ÅAngle1.4°1.3°1.5°Improper0.86°0.89°1.03°Dihedral23.2°22.9°23.1° Open table in a new tab Quality of the Model and Overall Structure—The final model of the native crystal structure includes 389 out of 393 residues. The final models have been refined at 2.8 Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 19.8% and free R-factor of 24.6% (Fig. 3). The averaged B-factors for main chain atoms and side chain atoms are 43.6 and 47.4 Å2, respectively. In the TaNAPRTase models, 3 C-terminal residues are undefined in the electron density map. Table II summarizes the refinement statistics as well as model quality parameters. All residues lie in the allowed region of the [phis] - φ plot produced with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Cα trace of the atomic model of TaNAPRTase is shown in Fig. 4A. The monomer has approximate dimensions of 80 Å × 55 Å × 25 Å. TaNAPRTase consists of three domains, an N-terminal α + β domain, a central α/β domain, and a C-terminal domain containing a zinc knuckle-like domain. The three dimers form a hexamer with a circular ring structure in the unit cell (Fig. 4, B-D). The thickness of the ring is about 50 Å, and the approximate diameters inside and outside of the ring are 35 and 90 Å, respectively. The presence of quaternary structures is supported by results from a dynamic light scattering experiment indicating the presence of several oligomeric states of TaNAPRTase in solution (data not shown). The surface area of TaNAPRTase buried by dimer formation is very large (per monomer ∼2,730 Å2). Interestingly, the major interaction at the dimeric interface is ionic rather than hydrophobic, as usually found in dimeric proteins. The interaction between dimers (∼1,950 Å2/dimer) that results in a hexameric state in the crystal structure is also ionic. Therefore, the oligomeric states can be achieved or destroyed depending on surrounding conditions influencing these ionic interactions such as pH, salt, or protein concentration. The result from a size-exclusion column in high salt conditions proved that TaNAPRTase could be present as a monomer (see “Materials and Methods”). A similar hexamer formation by three dimers dependent on high protein concentration or ionic strength has been reported based on the crystal structure of QAPRTase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtQAPRTase) (24Sharma V. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1587-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The major interaction at the dimeric interface of the MtQAPRTase is also ionic rather than hydrophobic. The final models of a NAMN-bound and PRPP-bound structures have been determined at 2.65 and 2.75 Å, respectively. The difference Fourier maps were used to build substrate models. In the PRPP-bound structure, the electron density of a pyrophosphate moiety was weak (Fig. 3A). This might be the result of the lack of magnesium ion known to bind with PRPP. In the NAMN-bound structure, in addition to NAMN-bound in the active site, one Tris buffer molecule was also found in the vicinity of Lys122 and Lys125 in the refined model. Table II summarizes the refinement statistics as well as model quality parameters. All residues lie in the allowed region of the [phis] - φ plot produced with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). These substrate-bound crystal structures suggested that the functional unit of TaNAPRTase is at least a dimeric form as discussed below. Overall Structural Comparison of TaNAPRTase with QAPRTases—A DALI search (25Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) shows that the highest similarity is found with MtQAPRTase (24Sharma V. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1587-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with Z-value of 18.9 (root mean square deviations of 2.9 Å for 254 pairs of aligned Cα atoms; 1qpo-A). Most of the N- and the central domains of TaNAPRTase are matched with the whole domain of MtQAPRTase (Fig. 5A), despite the low sequence similarity between NAPRTase and QAPRTase (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal domain of TaNAPRTase is composed of a β-sheet stacked with four α-helices having an α-β plait topology similar to that of MtQAPRTase. However, the following differences are observed. 1) The N-terminal antiparallel β-sheet of TaNAPRTase is composed of six β-strands instead of the four found in MtQAPRTase by adding extra two β-strands from the C-terminal domain; 2) The starting region of the N terminus is composed of a loop and a short α-helix involved in dimeric interaction, unlike the long N-terminal helix of MtQAPRTase not involved in dimeric interaction. The seven β-stranded α/β barrel structure of the central domain of TaNAPRTase has been first observed in QAPRTase from S. typhimurium (StQAPRTase) known as the type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold (26Eads J.C. Ozturk D. Wexler T.B. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This is a unique fold with an approximate topology of αβ αβ (βα)4β, unlike the conventional topology of (α/β)8. However, some deviations are observed in the TaNAPRTase structure. 1) An extra α-helix H6 is present between β7 and H7; 2) The loop between H6 and H7 does not form a part of the β-barrel due to the large gap with β8. As a result, the actual topology is αβ αβ α2(βα)3β instead of αβ αβ (βα)4β. Active Site Comparison between TaNAPRTase and QAPRTases—NAPRTase and QAPRTase use the same substrate, PRPP, to transfer the phosphoribosyl group and use NA and QA, respectively, to produce NAMN. The comparison of the three active sites of TaNAPRTase and two QAPRTases, StQAPRTase and EcQAPRTase, revealed that the shape and the size of the active site pocket (∼8 × 12 Å) are strongly correlated with the shape and size of the final product, NAMN. The active site pockets are confined by the other dimer subunit. The dimerization is thought to be important in increasing substrate specificity and the proper functioning of TaNAPRTase as shown in the two QAPRTase structures. Except for the dimension of the active sites, other characteristics of the active sites are quite different between TaNAPRTase and the two QAPRTases. The QA-bound structures of the two QAPRTases showed the presence of a strongly positively charged cleft inside the active site pocket to accommodate two carboxylate moieties of QA (24Sharma V. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1587-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in TaNAPRTase, the active site pocket itself is not so basic due to the presence of a relatively high content of hydrophobic and aromatic residues. The basic residues lining the active site pockets are as follows. 1) StQAPRTase has 8 basic residues, Arg118′ (from the other subunit), Arg152, Lys153, Arg159, Lys163, His174, Arg175, and Lys183; 2) MtQAPRTase has 8 basic residues, Arg105′, Arg136, Arg139, Lys140, His161, Arg162, Lys172, and His274; 3) TaNAPRTase has four basic redues, Arg141, Arg142, His182, and Arg235. Interestingly, there is no conserved residue detected in the active site pockets between TaNAPRTase and the two QAPRTases. Structural Comparison of PRPP-bound Forms—For the transfer of the phosphoribosyl group, PRPP must bind to the enzyme. In type I phosphoribosyltransferases, there are three conserved motifs forming a PRPP-binding site (27Sinha S.C. Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, TaNAPRTase has a type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold not having these motifs, as first shown in the StQAPRTase structure. The structural comparison was done between PRPP-bound TaNAPRTase and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-(β-methylene) pyrophosphate (a PRPP analog)-bound MtQAPRTase. In both structures, the phosphate group of PRPP binds to a common phosphate-binding motif of many α/β barrel enzymes and QAPRTase (28Wilmanns M Hyde C.C. Davies D.R. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9161-9169Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is known that the phosphate group is bound between the C-terminal ends of the final two β-strands of the α/β barrel, created by residues of the loop between β-strand 7 (β11 in the case of TaNAPRTase) and α-helix 7 (H10) and the N terminus of the additional helix 8′ (H11) of conventional α/β barrel structures (Fig. 6A). Although the sequence similarity among the phosphate-binding motifs is poor, the structures overlay in quite a striking manner. There is almost no conservation of the basic residues that coordinate the phosphate group. The important driving force of phosphate binding is due to main chain amides similar to the oxyanion hole formed by a glycine rich motif as shown in the carboxylesterase structure (29Kim K.K. Song H.K. Shin D.H. Hwang K.Y. Choe S. Yoo O.J. Suh S.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 1571-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two conserved motifs, 269hSGGh273 (h stands for hydrophobic residue) and 290GVGXX294 (Figs. 2B and 6B), serve to accommodate the phosphate group of PRPP. The comparison of the two complex structures revealed that pyrophosphate moieties are located at the entrance of the active site pocket. However, their specific position and interacting residues are quite different between TaNAPRTase and MtQAPRTase, as shown in Fig. 6B. In the case of MtQAPRTase, although there are few directly interacting residues, several charged residues (Arg48′, Arg105′, Glu104′, Asp173, Glu201, and Asp222) are located to help charged interaction. However, TaNAPRTase has few charged residues, Asp237 and Asp302′, located around PRPP, but Ser240 from the 235RLDTPSSRRG244 motif (Fig. 2B) strongly interacts with PRPP (Fig. 3A). The comparison of native and PRPP complex structures of TaNAPRTase shows no significant conformational changes. As shown in Fig. 3A, only a few side chains lining the active site pocket relocate their positions to avoid steric hindrance with PRPP. Structural Comparison of NAMN-bound Forms—The comparison of NAMN structures of TaNAPRTase and the two QAPRTases shows that NAMNs occupy a different site from PRPP; NAMN is located inside the cavity instead of the entrance (Fig. 6). However, the phosphate group of NAMN is located in approximately the same position as that of PRPP. Therefore, the architecture for accommodating the phosphate moiety of PRPP and NAMN may be critical for enzyme function. The ribosylnicotinate moiety of NAMN swings from outside to inside as compared with the ribosylpyrophosphate moiety of PRPP. To accommodate the two carboxylate groups of QA, StQAPRTase has 5 basic residues (Arg118′, Arg152, Lys153, His174, and Arg175) lining the deep active site pocket (26Eads J.C. Ozturk D. Wexler T.B. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). MtQAPRTase has 4 (Arg136, Arg139, His161, and Arg162) in the deep active site pocket to accommodate the QA and NA moiety of NAMN (24Sharma V. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1587-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TaNAPRTase has only one basic residue, Arg235, in the deep active site. However, to compensate the weak basic potential in the deep active site, TaNAPRTase employs a different strategy to deal with the same product. In addition to specific binding of NAMN to Arg235 from the 235RLDTSSRRG244 motif and hydrogen bond with Thr179 of the 178GTMPH182 motif, the aromatic ring of NA intercalates between the highly conserved aromatic resides Tyr21′ and Phe138 (Figs. 2B and 3B). The distances between these aromatic rings are around 4 Å, the general distance of stacked base pairs in DNA. Therefore, TaNAPRTase uses a stacking effect as a driving force to accommodate NA. C-terminal Unique Zinc Finger Domain—The C-terminal domain (299-393) of TaNAPRTase is composed of seven β-strands followed by the terminal α-helix (H12). The first two β-strands and the last β-strand formed a six-stranded β-sheet with three N-terminal β-strands. The next four β-strands form a zinc knuckle-like structure formed by the 4 cysteines, Cys330, Cys333, Cys348, and Cys350. However, there is no zinc atom in the center of the 4 cysteines. A DALI search (25Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) with the C-terminal domain shows the highest similarity with a DNA replication initiator from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Z = 2.1; root mean square deviations of 2.7 Å for 39 pairs of aligned Cα atoms; 1ltl-A). Interestingly, the aligned 39 Cα atoms of the DNA replication initiator is composed of a zinc knuckle structure (Fig. 7). This zinc finger domain of the DNA replication initiator is involved in a unique dodecamerization interaction rather than a functional activity (30Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The PSI-BLAST search with the C-terminal sequence showed that the CXXC(X)14CXC motif is unique and is not conserved in NAPRTase subfamily. Therefore, the role of this motif may be unique to TaNAPRTase. In the tertiary and quaternary structure of TaNAPRTase, this motif does not interact with any other domains, unlike that of the DNA replication initiator. Comparison of TaNAPRTase with Other Homologues Using Sequence Alignment and Secondary Structure Prediction—NAPRTase has been identified in many species from bacteria to human. In the Pfam data base (12Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 30: 276-280Crossref Scopus (2021) Google Scholar), TaNAPRTase, St- NAPRTase, EcNAPRTase, and PBEF belong to pfam04095. In the NCBI CDD data base (31Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D. Geer L.Y. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Lanczycki C.J. Liebert C.A. Liu C. Madej T. Marchler G.H. Mazumder R. Nikolskaya A.N. Panchenko A.R. Rao B.S. Shoemaker B.A. Simonyan V. Song J.S. Thiessen P.A. Vasudevan S. Wang Y. Yamashita R.A. Yin J.J. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), they are categorized in different subfamilies. TaNAPRTase belongs to cd01571 (called NAPRTase subgroup B), StNAPRTase belongs to cd01401 (called PncB_like), and PBEF to cd01569 (called PBEF_like). To infer the structural properties of these subfamilies, sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions have been performed and compared with those of TaNAPRTase. As expected, overall structure is predicted to be quite similar (Fig. 2A). In particular, the functionally important type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold is predicted to be present in all the members. The α/β barrel domain is apparent in the secondary structure predictions. NAPRTase has ATPase activity even if it is not essential for a function. StNAPRTase clearly showed the presence of a phosphorylated intermediate after ATP hydrolysis (11Rajavel M. Lalo D. Gross J.W. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4181-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His219 is phosphorylated and converted to phosphohistidine (11Rajavel M. Lalo D. Gross J.W. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4181-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignment shows that His219 is not conserved in TaNAPRTase and PBEF subfamilies (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it is not clear whether the formation of a phosphohistidine is the common property of all NAPRTases or not. If this is the case, His182 from the 178GTMPH182 motif of TaNAPRTase is one of the candidates for a phosphorylation site because it is located at the active site pocket. Recently, PBEF from murine has been identified as an NAmPRTase (13Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The NAmPRTase function is predicted to originate from a type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold, as discussed above. The sequence alignment shows that the nicotinate-binding residues and phosphate moiety of PRPP-binding motifs are more similar to those of TaNAPRTase. In the NCBI CDD data base, TaNAPRTase (the NAPRTase subgroup B) sequence family is closer to the PBEF sequence family than to the PncB_like sequence family. However, PBEF has a longer N-terminal domain similar to PncB_like and has several insertions not found in other subfamilies. Therefore, the crystal structure of TaNAPRTase together with sequence information show that TaNAPRTase, PBEF, and PncB_like subfamilies have their unique sequence motifs and structural properties for their specific function, although they share a common fold and function. In summary, the first crystal structure of an NAPRTase family member is presented in this study. The presence of the type II phosphoribosyltransferase fold in the TaNAPRTase structure together with bound PRPP and NAMN complex structures helps to explain the NAPRTase function of this family at a molecular level. The application of structural information to analyze subfamilies gives an insight for finding common as well as unique properties of each subfamily. Thus, the crystal structure of TaNAPRTase provides a structural framework for understanding the molecular functions of all members of NAPRTase family.

A conserved aspartic acid N-capping motif for helix 9 was identified by sequence alignments of the C-terminal regions of class Alpha glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and an analysis by the helix-coil algorithm AGADIR. The contribution of the N-capping motif to the stability and dynamics of the region was investigated by replacing the N-cap residue Asp-209 with a glycine in human glutathione S-transferase A1-1 (hGST A1-1) and in a peptide corresponding to its C-terminal region. Far-UV circular dichroism and AGADIR analyses indicate that, in the absence of tertiary interactions, the wild-type peptide displays a low intrinsic tendency to form a helix and that this tendency is reduced significantly by the Asp-to-Gly mutation. Disruption of the N-capping motif of helix 9 in hGST A1-1 alters the conformational dynamics of the C-terminal region and, consequently, the features of the H-site to which hydrophobic substrates (e.g. 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB)) and nonsubstrates (e.g. 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS)) bind. Isothermal calorimetric and fluorescence data for complex formation between ANS and protein suggest that the D209G-induced perturbation in the C-terminal region prevents normal ligand-induced localization of the region at the active site, resulting in a less hydrophobic and more solvent-exposed H-site. Therefore, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with CDNB is diminished due to a lowered affinity for the electrophilic substrate and a lower stabilization of the transition state.

As a consequence of their multifunctional capabilities, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate; CD, circular dichroism; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GSH, glutathione; G- and H-sites, glutathione and hydrophobic substrate binding sites; hGST A1-1, human glutathione transferase class Alpha with two type-1 subunits; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; BSP, bromosulfophthalein; ALBP, adipose lipid-binding protein. contribute toward diverse cellular processes ranging from detoxification reactions to the control of gene expression (1Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). These proteins, ubiquitous in aerobes, form a superfamily of species-independent classes that, except for the Kappa GST (2Ladner J.E. Parsons J.F. Rife C.L. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), share a common fold. Typically, the canonical GSTs are soluble, dimeric proteins with each subunit possessing a thioredoxin-like domain 1 fused to an all-α-helical domain 2 (3Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The Kappa GST, however, is more closely related to the protein disulfide bond isomerase, dsbA, in that domain 2 is inserted in domain 1 (2Ladner J.E. Parsons J.F. Rife C.L. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the active site of GSTs consists of two adjacent regions, a G-site on the thioredoxin-like domain that supports GSH as the thiol substrate or cofactor, and a nonpolar H-site on both domains that contributes to the binding of hydrophobic substrates. Although the molecular recognition of GSH is conserved among GSTs, these enzymes employ different strategies such as the nature of the residue (Tyr, Ser, or Cys) in contact with the thiol group of GSH and the structural contribution by domain 2 to the active site to realize their diverse functionalities (1Sheehan D.

The class Alpha GSTs possess, like many other GST classes, an active site tyrosine residue for the activation of GSH but, unlike other GST classes, they possess an extended C-terminal region that forms an integral part of the active site (5Cameron A.D.

Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition to its contributions to catalysis, the C-terminal region is an important determinant of ligandin function, i.e. the binding of nonsubstrate ligands (16Dirr H.W. Wallace L.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15631-15640Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Mosebi S. Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W.

Given these contributions of the C-terminal region to the functions of class Alpha GSTs, the conformational dynamics of the region and their impact on enzyme function have received much attention. Although the C-terminal region in hGST A1-1 is highly dynamic and not observed in the crystal structure of the apo enzyme (5Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Le T.I. Stenkamp R.E. Ibarra C. Atkins W.M. Adman E.T. Proteins. 2002; 48: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is observed in the apo structure of the homologous hGST A4-4 enzyme (8Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Rather than being completely disordered, the C-terminal region in apo-hGST A1-1 assumes helix-like conformations close to the surface of the protein (19Zhan Y. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7244-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), where it experiences tertiary contacts that facilitate its folding (16Dirr H.W. Wallace L.A.

It is only when the enzyme binds G-site and/or H-site ligands that the C-terminal region becomes fully immobilized on the protein (5Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G.

However, the structural determinants that maintain the conformational stability of the region in the apo and complex forms of hGST A1-1 (and other class Alpha GSTs) are not clear. Recently, we demonstrated that a bulky, hydrophobic residue at position 219 contributes significantly toward the stability of the region in apo and complexed hGST A1-1 (17Mosebi S. Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15326-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The type of amino acid residue found at the N-terminal end of a helix has a major effect on the stability of the entire helix and is referred to as the N-capping residue (21Serrano L. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). All GSTs have a conserved N-capping motif for helix 6 in domain 2 (22Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) shown to play an important role in the folding and stability of GSTs (23Cocco R. Stenberg G.

In this study, we identified a conserved aspartate N-capping motif for helix 9 in all class Alpha GSTs and, given the importance of N-capping motifs in the folding and stability of α-helices (25Scholtz J.M. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 26Wan W.Y. Milner-White E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), investigated its contribution to the dynamics of the C-terminal region of hGST A1-1. Chemicals—GSH was from ICE Biomedical Inc. (Aurora, OH). TFE (>99% grade), 8-aniline-1-naphthalene sulfonate, ethacrynic acid, glutathione sulfonate, p-bromobenzyl GSH, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrin. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Peptides corresponding to the wild-type and D209G forms of the C-terminal region of hGST A1-1 were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic Inc. (San Antonio, TX), and their molecular masses and purity were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The peptides have the following sequences: Ac-Tyr-Gly-Met-Asp/Gly-Glu-Lys-Ser-Leu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Arg-Lys-Ile-Phe-Arg-Phe. Residues Met3 to Phe17 correspond to the C-terminal sequence in hGST A1 (i.e. Met208 to Phe222). The underlined residues correspond to those residues located in helix 9 in the crystal structures of hGST A1-1 complexed with active site ligands (5Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B.

Atkins W.M. Adman E.T. Proteins. 2002; 48: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The presence of a tyrosine at the N terminus of the peptide, used to quantitate the peptide, should not induce a significant aromatic band in their CD spectra because of the flexible helix-breaking glycine spacer separating the tyrosine from the rest of the peptide (27Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Peptide stock solutions were made in water and their concentrations determined at 275 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1450 m-1·cm-1 (28Brandts J.F. Kaplan L.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2011-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—The plasmid (pKHA1) used for the expression of hGST A1-1 (29Stenberg G. Bjornestedt R. Mannervik B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Bengt Mannervik (Department of Biochemistry, University of Uppsala, Sweden). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, based on the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolly, CA), was performed to generate the D209G mutant of hGST A1-1 using the following primers: 5′-GCCTCCATGGGTGAGAAATCTCTAGAAGAAGC and 5′-GCTTCTTCTAGAGATTTCTCACCCATGGGAGGC. The mutations introduced for generating D209G hGST A1-1 are underlined. The presence of the mutation in the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and D209G hGST A1-1 were expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells and purified by CM-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (20Wallace L.A. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16686-16694Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of the dimeric proteins was determined at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 38,200 m-1·cm-1. Spectroscopic Methods—Far-UV CD measurements were done at 20 °C in a Jasco model 810 CD spectropolarimeter. Averaged CD signals, corrected for solvent, were converted to mean residue ellipticity [Θ], [Θ]=(100×Θ)/Cnl(Eq. 1) where C is the peptide concentration in millimolar, Θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegree, n is the number of residues (17 in this case), and l is the path length (cm). The percentage helical content was calculated from the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, using the equation, %Helix=[Θ]−[Θ]coil[Θ]helix−[Θ]coil(Eq. 2) where [Θ]helix and [Θ]coil represent the mean residue ellipticity of a helix [–42,500(1 – (3/n)] and random coil (+640), respectively (30Rohl C.A. Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2623-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The units of mean residue ellipticity are deg·cm2·dmol-1. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in a Hitachi model 850 fluorescence spectrofluorometer. The intrinsic fluorescence of hGST A1-1 was monitored by selectively exciting a single tryptophan residue (Trp-21) per subunit at 295 nm. The binding of the anionic dye, ANS, to hGST A1-1 was monitored by fluorescence enhancement using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm (31Sluis-Cremer N. Naidoo N.N. Kaplan W.H. Manoharan T.H. Fahl W.E. Dirr H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—Kinetic parameters were determined at pH 6.5 for the S-conjugation reaction between GSH and CDNB (32Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Reaction rates were measured in triplicate at 20 °C and corrected for non-enzymatic rates. Conditions for determining KmGSH were 0.05–6.5 mm GSH and 1.5 mm CDNB, and for KmCDNB they were 0.15–1.5 mm CDNB and 5 mm GSH. For kcat/KmGSH determinations, CDNB was kept at 1.5 mm, whereas GSH was varied from 0.05 to 0.15 mm. For kcat/KmCDNB determinations, GSH was kept at 5 mm, whereas CDNB was varied from 0.05 to 0.15 mm. The data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis using Origin5 MicroCal Inc. software. Active Site Tyrosinate Formation—The ionization of the catalytic Tyr9 in the active site of hGST A1-1 was determined over the pH range 5.5–9.0 by UV absorbance difference spectroscopy as described (17Mosebi S. Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15326-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The concentration of tyrosinate ion formation was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 2350 m-1·cm-1 and the pKa of Tyr9 determined as described (15Bjornestedt R. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Board P.G. Sinning I. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Atkins W.M. Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry with a VP-ITC calorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, MA) was employed to determine the thermodynamic parameters of ANS·hGST A1-1 complex formation in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, as described (17Mosebi S. Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15326-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Sayed Y. Hornby J.A. Lopez M. Dirr H. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 341-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total heats were obtained by titrating 0.04 mm D209G hGST A1-1 (subunit concentration) with 5-μl aliquots of 4.1 mm ANS. Heats of dilution, determined by titrating ANS into buffer alone, were subtracted from the total observed heats, and the corrected data analyzed by nonlinear regression with Origin5 (MicroCal). Molecular Docking—Two molecular docking programs, Cerius2 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and LIGIN (34Sobolev V. Wade R.C. Vriend G. Edelman M. Proteins. 1996; 25: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), were used to predict the ANS binding site in hGST A1-1. The 1K3Y high resolution structure of wild-type hGST A1-1 without the bound ligand was used as the host apo molecule. Cerius2 treated ANS as a flexible, guest ligand and the protein host as a rigid body. Various ligand conformations and binding locations were ranked according to conformational energy minima, with the lowest being the most probable binding complex. Energy minimization was carried out with GROMOS (35van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J. Angew. Chem. Int. 1990; 29: 992-1023Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) in the WHATIF version 2.0 package (36Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). LIGIN, which uses surface complementarity between guest and host as the guiding principle for predicting binding sites, was implemented as described (34Sobolev V. Wade R.C. Vriend G. Edelman M. Proteins. 1996; 25: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Docking between ANS and hGST A1-1 was also done with the binary GSH-protein (PDB file 1GSE without the ethacrynic acid moiety) and GSO3-protein (coordinates for GSO3− obtained from PDB file 1EV4) complexes. Asp-209, the N-cap Residue of Helix 9 —The AGADIR algorithm, based on helix-coil transition theory that explicitly considers specific interactions occurring in helices devoid of tertiary interactions (37Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), was used to identify N-capping motifs for helices in the class Alpha hGST A1-1. Two such motifs were identified; one for helix 6 and the other for helix 9, both of which are conserved in class Alpha GSTs. The N-capping motif of helix 6 (22Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is a class 5 Ser motif (26Wan W.Y. Milner-White E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which has been shown to play an important role in the folding and stability of GSTs (23Cocco R. Stenberg G. Dragani B.

Milner-White E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and is conserved in all class Alpha GSTs (Table I). The motif together with its hydrogen-bonding pattern with the main chain of helix 9 is shown in Fig. 1.Table ISequence alignment of the C-terminal region of class Alpha GSTs The sequence alignment of the C-terminal region begins two residues preceding the first α-helical residue (N1) of α-helix 9.Gi numberTypeaType refers to the subunit type of class Alpha GSTSourcePDBSequencebThe conserved N-cap Asp residue is in boldface, and the underlined residues correspond to those located in α-helix 9 of the crystal structuresN′NN1121730A1Human1K3YMDEKSLEEARKIFRF66611A1Rat1EV9MDAKQIEEARKIFKF11514503A1Mouse1F3BMDAKQIQEARKAFKIQ1170081A1RabbitMDEKNLEKAKKIFKIP2495106A1Bos taurusTDEKKIEEARKVFKF30749486A2Mouse1ML6MDAKQIEEARKVFKF121733A2HumanMDEKSLEESRKIFRF6166190A3HumanADAKALEEARKIFRF7767212A4Human1GUMPDEIYVRTVYNIFRP3114387A4Mouse1GUKPDGPYVEVVRIVLKFa Type refers to the subunit type of class Alpha GSTb The conserved N-cap Asp residue is in boldface, and the underlined residues correspond to those located in α-helix 9 of the crystal structures Open table in a new tab Helical Content of C-terminal Region Peptides—Far-UV CD spectra, used to determine the helical content of two peptides corresponding to the sequences of the wild-type and D209G mutant C-terminal regions (WT-pep and DG-pep, respectively) in water, are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra, displaying ellipticity minima at 222 and 201 nm and ellipticity maxima at 218 and 194 nm, are characteristic of a mixture of helical and random coil conformations. The low helical content of WT-pep and DG-pep in water (10 and 4%, respectively) was substantiated by AGADIR (i.e. 20 and 8% for the wild-type and mutant sequences, respectively). AGADIR also predicted that the length of the helix in the wild-type sequence is longer (residues Asp-210 to Ile-219 with individual propensities of 21.2–37.4%) than that in the D209G mutant sequence (residues Leu-213 to Ile-219 with individual propensities of 11.4–18.6%). The residues predicted to form a helix in the wild-type sequence are in agreement with those that form helix 9 in the protein structure (6Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Capping motifs are known to increase helical propensity by initiating and/or stabilizing helix propagating tendencies at their ends (38Doig A.J. MacArthur M.W. Stapley B.J. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 40Dasgupta S. Bell J.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduced CD signal of the DG-pep can also be interpreted as an increase in fraying of the helix at its N-terminal end. TFE, a co-solvent known to enhance the helical content of peptides with intrinsic helical properties (30Rohl C.A. Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2623-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 41Kumaran S. Roy R.P. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), increases the helix content of both peptides, as shown in Fig. 2. The TFE-induced changes of the CD spectra exhibit an isodichroic point at 202–204 nm indicative of a two-state, helix-coil transition (43Brown J.E. Klee W.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The helix content of both peptides reaches a maximum level of about 35% in the presence of TFE (inset in the bottom panel of Fig. 2). Although the sequence of the C-terminal region displays a preference to be disordered in aqueous solution, the flexible region in apo-GST A1-1 assumes an ensemble of native helix-like structures close to the surface of the protein where it samples multiple environments (19Zhan Y. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7244-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is only when the active site becomes occupied by ligand that the C-terminal region becomes stabilized and localized on the surface of the protein (5Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R.

Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tertiary interactions at the interfaces between the C-terminal region, protein, and bound ligand, therefore, play a major role in stabilizing the region (16Dirr H.W. Wallace L.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15631-15640Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Mosebi S. Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15326-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), consistent with the helix-stabilizing effect of TFE. Disrupting the conserved N-capping motif of helix 9 by the D209G mutation substantially reduces the intrinsic ability of its sequence to form a helix. Consequently, this alters the dynamics of the C-terminal region and, because it forms part of the active site, the function of the enzyme (see below). Characteristics of D209G hGST A1-1—Helix 9 (residues 210–220) is the major structural feature in the C-terminal region (residues 210–222) of GST A1-1 (6Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). As expected, replacing the N-cap residue, Asp-209, with a glycine residue had little impact on the global structural features of hGST A1-1 in that its secondary and dimeric structures were unchanged (data not shown). The tertiary environment of the lone tryptophan, Trp-21, is, however, different in the mutant, as indicated by a lower fluorescence intensity, although the maximum emission wavelength was unaltered (data not shown). Trp-21 is located at the domain-domain interface of each subunit where its indole ring is surrounded by helix 1 in domain 1 and helices 6 and 8 in domain 2. Although the Asp-210 N-capping motif of helix 9 is about 18 Å away from Trp-21, it is connected to helix 8 via a 10-amino acid linker. Not only is the fluorescence of Trp-21 sensitive to changes occurring at the domain-domain interface (45Wallace L.A. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is also sensitive to changes in"
https://openalex.org/W2034366277,"Crystalline forms of detergent-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, obtained in the presence of either a substrate analog, AMPPCP, or a transition state complex, ADP·fluoroaluminate, were recently described to share the same general architecture despite the fact that, when studied in a test tube, these forms show different functional properties. Here, we show that the differences in the properties of the E1·AMPPCP and the E1·ADP·AlFx membraneous (or solubilized) forms are much less pronounced when these properties are examined in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ (the concentration prevailing in the crystallization media) than when they are examined in the presence of the few micromolar of Ca2+ known to be sufficient to saturate the transport sites. This concerns various properties, including ATPase susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by proteinase K, ATPase reactivity toward SH-directed Ellman's reagent, ATPase intrinsic fluorescence properties (here described for the E1·ADP·AlFx complex for the first time), and also the rates of 45Ca2+-40Ca2+ exchange at site “II.” These results solve the above paradox at least partially and suggest that the presence of a previously unrecognized Ca2+ ion in the E1·AMPPCP crystals should be re-investigated. A contrario, they emphasize the fact that the average conformation of the E1·AMPPCP complex under usual conditions in the test tube differs from that found in the crystalline form. The extended conformation of nucleotide revealed by the E1·AMPPCP crystalline form might be only indicative of the requirements for further processing of the complex, toward the transition state leading to phosphorylation and Ca2+ occlusion. Crystalline forms of detergent-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, obtained in the presence of either a substrate analog, AMPPCP, or a transition state complex, ADP·fluoroaluminate, were recently described to share the same general architecture despite the fact that, when studied in a test tube, these forms show different functional properties.

This concerns various properties, including ATPase susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by proteinase K, ATPase reactivity toward SH-directed Ellman's reagent, ATPase intrinsic fluorescence properties (here described for the E1·ADP·AlFx complex for the first time), and also the rates of 45Ca2+-40Ca2+ exchange at site “II.” These results solve the above paradox at least partially and suggest that the presence of a previously unrecognized Ca2+ ion in the E1·AMPPCP crystals should be re-investigated. A contrario, they emphasize the fact that the average conformation of the E1·AMPPCP complex under usual conditions in the test tube differs from that found in the crystalline form. The extended conformation of nucleotide revealed by the E1·AMPPCP crystalline form might be only indicative of the requirements for further processing of the complex, toward the transition state leading to phosphorylation and Ca2+ occlusion. After the initial description of the high resolution structures of two crystalline forms of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (the membranous Ca2+-dependent P-type ATPase SERCA1a) (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 633-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), additional forms of this Ca2+-ATPase were recently crystallized, with the hope of characterizing as many as possible of the different intermediates formed in sequence during the catalytic cycle of this enzyme and therefore to provide a structural basis for the mechanistic description of ion pumping (3Toyoshima C.

Among these forms, one has its two transport sites occupied by Ca2+, and its nucleotide binding site occupied by a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMPPCP 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; ATPase, adenosine triphosphatase; quin2, 2-[(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)methyl]-6-methoxy-8-aminoquinoline-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DTNB, Ellman's reagent, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PK, proteinase K; C12E8, octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether; DDM, dodecylmaltoside; ATPγS, (adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate); Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.; it is referred to as “E1·AMPPCP.” Another one, referred to as “E1·AlFx·ADP,” also has its two transport sites occupied by Ca2+, and it has been obtained by crystallization of the quasi-irreversible complex formed by ATPase with ADP and aluminum fluoride, a complex thought to be a fair analog of the transient species formed in the catalytic cycle immediately before the ADP-sensitive “E1P” phosphoenzyme. The overall polypeptide chain architecture was found to be very similar in these two crystalline forms (except for specific features at the catalytic site): in particular, in both forms (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Sugita Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 442: 361-368Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the M1–M2 transmembrane helices appear to be pulled up toward the cytosol and the top portion (M1′) of the M1 helix gets kinked, thereby locking the conformation of Glu309, a residue thought to cap Ca2+ at one of its binding sites, “site II,” and therefore to be critical for dissociation of the two bound Ca2+ ions out of their binding pocket (e.g. Refs. 8Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 9Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This locking by M1–M1′ of the conformation of Glu309 was considered to be responsible for the long known “occlusion” of Ca2+ (10Verjovski-Almeida S. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5006-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that occurs during normal turnover, after ATPase phosphorylation from ATP. In the (stable) E1·AlFx·ADP form, it is indeed accepted that the Ca2+ transport sites are occluded (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 9Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 267: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as in the (transient) E1P phosphoenzyme form. However, it has been suggested previously that a similar occlusion occurs neither after the mere formation of a noncovalent E1·AMPPCP complex, nor after the mere formation of the E1·Mg·ATP complex that immediately precedes phosphorylation during the normal cycle (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 9Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol.

This apparent discrepancy between the different properties of the two ATPase forms and their similar crystalline structure has already been noted (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 9Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and various interpretations have been given, together with somewhat contradictory comments that these two forms, E1·AMPPCP and E1·AlFx·ADP, have (5Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) or do not have (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) a similar pattern of resistance to cleavage by proteinase K of their cytosolic domains. Structural fluctuation of the non-crystallized ATPase·AMPPCP complex (we will discuss it) and/or selection of a particular conformation by crystal packing were suggested to explain the different occlusion properties of the two ATPase forms in a test tube (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In view of the significance of this issue with respect to the mechanism of occlusion, we decided to further document the resemblance or differences between E1·AMPPCP and E1·AlFx· ADP forms. In particular, we asked whether any clues could be provided by the fact that the published crystalline forms of E1·AMPPCP had been obtained at very high Ca2+ concentrations. Under high millimolar Ca2+ conditions, we found that the ATPase complex with AMPPCP indeed has properties closer to those of the ATPase complex with ADP·fluoroaluminate than under micromolar Ca2+ conditions, from the point of view of various indexes, including exchange of calcium at site II (hence its dissociation from this site), resistance to proteolysis, susceptibility to SH modification, or Trp fluorescence. This was especially true when Ca2+-ATPase was solubilized by detergent. For comparison, we also briefly documented the (different) influence of Mg2+ on the effect of AMPPCP and other nucleotides. We discuss various possibilities possibly explaining why a high Ca2+ could favor resemblance between the E1·AMPPCP and E1·AlFx·ADP forms. We also discuss various possibilities to explain, a contrario, the differences between the fluoroaluminate complex and the AMPPCP complex under more usual conditions: among these, the average conformation of the E1·AMPPCP complex under such conditions might well be different from the one found in the crystal, a fact that should not be overlooked in future descriptions of ATP binding to Ca2+-ATPase during the normal cycle. 45Ca2+ dissociation from sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase or its exchange with 40Ca2+ was measured with a rapid filtration Bio-Logic device (12Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For these measurements, ATPase-containing SR membranes were adsorbed onto Millipore nitrocellulose (HA) filters (0.45-μm pore diameter). The SR membranes had previously been equilibrated for 5–15 min with either 25 or 50 μm45Ca2+ (plus 50 μm [3H]glucose as a volume marker), in the absence or presence of various additives. The adsorbed membranes were perfused for various periods of time, at flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 ml/s depending on the perfusion period. In addition to the above buffer, the perfusion fluid also contained either EGTA or various concentrations of unlabeled Ca2+ (40Ca2+), again in the absence or presence of various additives. Radioactivity in the perfused filter (or in a non-perfused filter, for time zero control) was finally counted, without rinsing. The total 45Ca2+ found was corrected for the 45Ca2+ content in the wet volume by taking into account the 3H radioactivity present in the same filter (this 45Ca2+ or 3H content in the wet volume was of course very small after the filter had been perfused). Ca2+ dissociation from sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was also measured in stopped-flow experiments using quin2, a fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye whose strong complex with Ca2+ has a fluorescence level different from that of the Ca2+-free dye (higher or lower depending on the excitation wavelength; see Refs. 14Bayley P. Ahlström P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Champeil P. Combettes L. Berthon B. Doucet E. Orlowski S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17665-17673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Champeil P. Henao F. de Foresta B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12383-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We were initially concerned by the possibility that the presence of nucleotide could interfere with this measurement of quin2 fluorescence, if dissociation of a preformed Ca2+·nucleotide complex were to superimpose with dissociation of Ca2+ from Ca2+-ATPase. However, this does not occur, based on several facts: (i) the amplitude of the quin2 fluorescence change is essentially similar with or without AMPPCP; (ii) observed rate constants in the presence of AMPPCP are essentially similar when AMPPCP is initially present in both syringes and when AMPPCP is initially only present together with quin2 (in the latter case, the Ca·AMPPCP complex is not formed); (iii) we directly checked, in the absence of membranes, that any Ca·AMPPCP or Ca·ATP complex formed under our conditions dissociates faster than the dead time (3 ms) of our stopped-flow measurements. All these experiments were performed at 20 °C. Most of them (unless otherwise noted) were performed in a 50 mm Mes-Tris buffer at pH 6, generally without potassium, or in a 50 mm Mops-Tris buffer at pH 7, supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 5 mm Mg2+. AMPPCP and ATPγS were from Sigma, ADP was from Fluka, and quin2 was from Calbiochem. Equilibrium fluorescence experiments were performed with a SPEX Fluorolog fluorometer, with constant stirring of the temperature-controlled cell. Stopped-flow experiments were performed with Bio-Logic SFM3 equipment; quin2-emitted fluorescence was detected with a broad band filter, DA 531 from MTO (Massy, France). The extent of Ca2+-ATPase proteolysis by proteinase K under different conditions was examined by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gels prepared in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, as described in Ref. 18Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. SH reaction with DTNB (Ellman's reagent, from Sigma) was monitored at 25 °C, using a diode array spectrophotometer (HP 8453) operated in the kinetic mode. DTNB conversion to a colored anion upon reaction with SH groups was monitored at 430 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 12 mm–1·cm–1, slightly lower than that at the wavelength for maximal absorption (13.6 mm–1·cm–1 at 412 nm); 430 nm, instead of the more widely used wavelength of 412 nm, was chosen to minimize the slight interference with DTNB absorption which occurs at 412 nm. Absorption by DTNB is not visible in Fig. 4 because DTNB was already present in the buffer used to record the blank spectrum. Note that, judging from the apparent affinities reported in Ref. 19Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar for AMPPCP-cation complexes, the dissociation constants of AMPPCP complexes with Mg2+ and Ca2+ in 50 mm Mes-Tris at pH 6 probably are in the 0.4–0.5 mm and the 0.8–1 mm ranges, respectively (i.e. intermediate between those for ATP and those for ADP, as also shown by our own measurements with antipyrylazo III, data not shown). ADP·AlF4 Blocks 45Ca2+ Dissociation from SR Ca2+-ATPase, but under Ordinary Conditions, AMPPCP Does Not—Sørensen et al. (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and Toyoshima and Mizutani (5Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) found that the presence of AMPPCP or ADP·fluoroaluminate in the crystalline forms of Ca2+-ATPase resulted in structural changes indicative of occlusion of the bound Ca2+ ions in both cases, but they already noted that this was somewhat dissonant with a previous experimental finding deduced from rapid filtration experiments with 45Ca2+: the half-time for the dissociation of 45Ca2+ from the transport sites of non-phosphorylated ATPase only increases by 50% in the presence of 250 μm AMPPCP, at pH 6 in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ (12Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and thus dissociation remains relatively fast in the presence of AMPPCP. We first repeated that old experiment under different conditions, and at pH 7 in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, found a similar although not identical result: AMPPCP again failed to block 45Ca2+ dissociation, but in these experiments did not even slow down the rate of this dissociation at all, even if its concentration was increased up to 2.5 mm. Yet, under the same conditions, preliminary incubation of Ca2+-ATPase with ADP and fluoroaluminate did block 45Ca2+ dissociation completely (see Fig. I in the Supplemental Material, and accompanying comments). Depending on Mg2+, AMPPCP May Either Stimulate or Slightly Reduce the Rate of Overall Ca2+ Dissociation from Ca2+-ATPase, and the Modulatory Effect of Mg2+ Differs for Various Nucleotides—We therefore re-investigated the effect of AMPPCP under the previous conditions at pH 6, using a stopped-flow assay in which Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2+-ATPase was triggered by mixing Ca2+-equilibrated SR vesicles with the fluorescent chelator quin2, whose fluorescence changes allowed us to monitor the rate of this Ca2+ dissociation (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. II in Supplemental Material). With this new assay, we found that at pH 6 too, AMPPCP in the presence of a few millimeters of Mg2+ only minimally affected Ca2+ dissociation from ATPase (Fig. 1A), but we nevertheless confirmed that in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ AMPPCP did slow down Ca2+ dissociation moderately, as previously observed in 45Ca2+ filtration experiments (12Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); at lower Mg2+ concentrations, however, this slowing down was in fact converted into a definite acceleration of the rate of Ca2+ dissociation, by a factor of up to 4 in the total absence of Mg2+ (representative traces are shown in Fig. III of Supplemental Material). This is summarized in panel B of Fig. 1, which includes experiments performed at high AMPPCP concentrations in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+. These data reveal no real occlusion of Ca2+ after the mere binding of AMPPCP. In the absence of Mg2+, the EC50 for AMPPCP-induced acceleration of Ca2+ dissociation was in the micromolar range (open circles in panel B; the true EC50 is somewhat lower than the one apparent in this panel, because of sub-stoichiometric conditions for the lowest concentration of AMPPCP tested). Incidentally, note that, although the quin2 fluorescence rise that we measured monitors the overall dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions previously bound to Ca2+-ATPase (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. II in Supplemental Material), all traces were quasi-monophasic, as previously noted and interpreted within the context of a “flickering gate” for the Ca2+ binding pocket (12Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Champeil P. Henao F. de Foresta B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12383-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMPPCP is not a perfect analog of ATP, because the Mg2+ dependence of its binding to Ca2+-ATPase is opposite to the Mg2+ dependence of the binding of ATP itself (19Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3262-3266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ross D.C. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12977-12983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; this will be confirmed below), presumably because binding in the presence of Mg2+ is perturbed by the CH2 link between β and γ phosphates in AMPPCP. Therefore, for comparison, we also measured the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from ATPase in the presence of another poorly-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, ATPγS, whose Mg2+ dependence has been shown to retain an ATP-like behavior, i.e. a higher affinity in the presence of Mg2+ than in its absence (23Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10961-10968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPγS was found to stimulate the rate of Ca2+ dissociation both in the absence and presence of Mg2+, and in this case Mg2+ enhanced the ATPγS-dependent acceleration instead of converting it into a slowing down (original traces in Fig. IV of Supplemental Material). Note that, for these experiments, ATPγS (at twice the final concentration) was purposely added together with quin2, and thus, SR vesicles were not preincubated with ATPγS: this is because ATPγS, although poorly hydrolyzed (24Yates D.W. Duance V.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 159: 719-728Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), has been shown to react with Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+, leading to accumulation of a thio-phosphorylated intermediate (25Yasuoka K. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This alteration in our experimental protocol (compared with the above-described case of AMPPCP) was tested in the case of AMPPCP, and it had no significant influence on the rate constant for Ca2+ dissociation; note that nucleotide-dependent rates of Ca2+ binding have previously also been found similar when the nucleotide is added simultaneously with Ca2+ and when nucleotide is preincubated with Ca2+-free ATPase (26Mintz E. Mata A.M. Forge V. Passafiume M. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27160-27164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), presumably because of the fairly fast rate of nucleotide binding at a concentration of 250 μm. Because of the puzzling difference between AMPPCP and ATPγS in their Mg2+ dependences, we performed a third series of experiments with ADP (again added together with quin2) in the presence of various concentrations of Mg2+:1mm ADP accelerated Ca2+ dissociation at all concentrations of Mg2+. Fig. 1C summarizes all these results. Note that experiments were also performed at pH 6 in the presence of 100 mm KCl and 5 mm Mg2+. In this series of experiments, 250 μm AMPPCP again hardly affected the rate of Ca2+ dissociation (from 14 to 15 s–1), whereas the same concentration of ADP accelerated it moderately (to 23 s–1) (data not shown). In previous experiments performed at pH 6.5 in the presence of 100 mm KCl and 2 mm Mg2+ at 11 °C, ADP had also been found to only have a weak effect on Ca2+ dissociation (15Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This confirms that, although the presence of potassium slightly accelerates Ca2+ dissociation (e.g. Refs. 12Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 17Champeil P. Henao F. de Foresta B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12383-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it does not affect the above-described pattern of nucleotide-induced alteration: the presence of nucleotide generally does not lead to Ca2+ occlusion. If Free Ca2+ Is Increased to High Millimolar Concentrations, Well Beyond Those Allowing Saturation of the ATPase High Affinity Sites, AMMPCP Binds to Ca2+-ATPase with Even Higher Affinity—As a preliminary step in our attempt to understand the effect of AMPPCP on Ca2+-ATPase under crystallization conditions, we estimated the affinity with which AMPPCP binds to Ca2+-ATPase under such conditions, namely in the presence of a high millimolar Ca2+ concentration. For this purpose, we used a Trp fluorescence assay (27Lacapère J.J. Bennett N. Dupont Y. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and first checked that it gave results consistent with the above-mentioned effect of Mg2+ on AMPPCP binding (19Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3262-3266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ross D.C. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12977-12983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That this was the case, both in the absence and in the presence of an ordinary submillimolar concentration of Ca2+, is shown in panels A–D of Fig. 2 (for control, the well known opposite dependence on Mg2+ of ATP binding in the absence of Ca2+ is shown in Fig. V of Supplemental Material); note that the equilibrium dissociation constant for AMPPCP binding deduced from the assay in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2C) is slightly lower than the apparent EC50 with which AMPPCP accelerates the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from its binding sites in the absence of Mg2+ (previously illustrated in Fig. 1B): this is probably in part due to the fact that nucleotide binding at a concentration of only a few micromolar may be rate-limiting. We then monitored the binding of various concentrations of AMPPCP in the presence of a high, millimolar Ca2+ concentration, and found that the affinity for AMPPCP binding was increased further, compared with its affinity in the presence of submillimolar Ca2+ concentrations sufficient to saturate the Ca2+ transport sites: this was found both in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2, E and F) and in its absence (Fig. VI of Supplemental Material). Related results are scattered in the literature (19Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. J.

A high millimolar Ca2+ therefore affects AMPPCP binding in some way. AMPPCP Binding at Millimolar Ca2+ (but Not Submillimolar Ca2+) Almost Fully Protects ATPase from Proteolysis by Proteinase K—We first estimated the effect of a high millimolar Ca2+ on AMPPCP-dependent changes through measurements of the susceptibility of Ca2+-ATPase to proteolysis. The simultaneous presence of AMPPCP and Ca2+ (18Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was previously described as affording partial protection of Ca2+-ATPase from digestion by proteinase K, and the combination of fluoroaluminate with ADP in the presence of Ca2+ was also described previously to afford protection (9Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C.

In one of the analyses of the x-ray data, the increased resistance of both the E1·AMPPCP and E1·AlFx·ADP forms against proteolysis was considered to be consistent with the similar structures of the two crystalline forms (5Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast, in another analysis (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), the protection afforded by AMPPCP was reported to be only minimal compared with the strong protection afforded by fluoroaluminate in the presence of ADP and Ca2+, and this was considered instead to be consistent with the lack of Ca2+ occlusion by E1·AMPPCP, despite the similar structures (4Sørensen T. L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have tried to solve these apparent discrepancies by giving particular attention to the Ca2+ concentration prevailing during proteolysis. We have found that extensive protection by AMPPCP is obtained in the presence of millimolar Ca2+ concentrations similar to those used for crystallization. This is shown in"

The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state.

Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). They are assembled as tetramers of subunits that share a modular design consisting of an N-terminal oligomerization domain, a ligand-binding domain (LBD), three transmembrane domains, a pore loop, and an intracellular C terminus (2Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 3Madden D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The LBD of these receptors is structurally homologous to the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBP) (4Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G-Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), for which spectroscopic, crystallographic, and solution-scattering analyses all established a Venus flytrap binding mechanism (5Newcomer M.E.

The hallmark of this mechanism is a bilobate structure, in which the two lobes are separated by a binding cleft that is predominantly open in the empty state and closed in the ligand-bound state. Data supporting a similar ligand-binding mechanism for the iGluR LBD have been obtained by spectroscopic (9Abele R. Keinänen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10472-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and crystallographic (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) studies. The antagonist-bound LBD structure is open compared with agonist-bound states, and the extent of closure induced by a given agonist correlates broadly with its efficacy in activating the channel (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 12Hogner A. Kastrup J.S. Jin R. Liljefors T. Mayer M.L. Egebjerg J. Larsen I.K. Gouaux E. J.

Thus, the observed cleft closure appears to represent the driving force that is harnessed to open the channel gate. However, although the structures of the antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes appear to be generally well defined, it has been observed that the conformation of ligand-bound GluR2 LBD can differ as a function of lattice packing (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 13Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, under physiological conditions, channel activation corresponds to the binding of agonist to a ligand-free binding site. As a result, understanding the molecular mechanism of iGluR activation will ultimately require a detailed understanding of the conformation of the apo state. However, within the glutamate receptor family, different apo structures have been observed, suggesting that its conformational status may not be well defined. The crystal structure of the empty GluR2 LBD revealed an open cleft (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), whereas that of the bacterial GluR0 was closed (16Mayer M.L. Olson R. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ligand-free LBD of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 has been crystallized in both open and closed conformations (17Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Among the PBP, there are cases where the binding cleft is predominantly closed in the absence of ligand (18Walmsley A.R. Shaw J.G. Kelly D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8064-8072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other cases, multiple crystal forms of the ligand-free states have revealed a spectrum of open conformations (20Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a result of these considerations, it would be advantageous to perform scattering measurements in solution, to assess the conformational behavior of the iGluR LBD in different functional states without the potential conformational restrictions imposed by crystal lattice formation. This is technically challenging, because in contrast to the PBP, where ligand binding can be associated with cleft closures of up to ~60°, full agonists induce a maximal 20–22° closure in the GluR2 LBD (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on a GluR4 LBD construct had been unable to detect changes between empty and glutamate-bound forms of the domain, presumably due to the small magnitude of the change (22Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, calculations based on the crystallographic models suggest that the corresponding conformational changes should be detectable by SAXS measurements designed for optimal sensitivity (Table I).Table ICalculated and experimental radii of gyration for S1S2J complexesSampleRg GuinierRgP(r)DmaxÅExperimentalS1S2J-DNQX20.8 ± 0.320.8 ± 0.265 ± 3S1S2J apo20.5 ± 0.220.4 ± 0.262 ± 3S1S2J-AMPA20.0 ± 0.219.9 ± 0.159 ± 2CalculatedaValues calculated from crystal structures 1FTL chain A or B (DNQX), 1FTO chain A or B (apo), and 1FTM chain A, B, or C (AMPA) using CRYSOL (32).S1S2J-DNQX20.220.263 ± 2S1S2J apo20.520.462 ± 2S1S2J-AMPA19.819.661 ± 2a Values calculated from crystal structures 1FTL chain A or B (DNQX), 1FTO chain A or B (apo), and 1FTM chain A, B, or C (AMPA) using CRYSOL (32Svergun D.I.

Open table in a new tab Here, we present a collaborative series of SAXS experiments that establish the conformational behavior of the iGluR LBD in solution. A small but reproducible conformational change is observed between the open, antagonist bound state and the closed, agonist bound state, consistent with the crystal structures. The apo state, however, appears to sample a conformational equilibrium, whose balance is possibly influenced by components that lie outside the PBP-homologous core. Protein Expression and Purification—The core GluR2 LBD (“S1S2J”) that had been used in crystallographic studies of the domain was expressed bacterially, purified, and refolded as described (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 23Chen G-Q. Sun Y. Jin R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2623-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The full-length GluR4 LBD construct that had been used in previous solution scattering experiments (“S1S2-D”) was generated using the baculovirus expression system and purified as previously described (24Madden D.R. Abele R. Andersson A. Keinänen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, a full-length GluR2 LBD (“S1S2L”) was also refolded from bacterially expressed protein (23Chen G-Q. Sun Y. Jin R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2623-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). S1S2L consisted of residues Ser383–Glu524 (S1), a GTDGN linker, and Glu627–Asn791 (S2), corresponding approximately to the GluR4 construct, but lacking N- and C-terminal FLAG and c-Myc tags, and with a shorter linker. Protein and Ligand Concentration—Purified protein solutions were initially concentrated to 6–8 mg/ml in Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon) and dialyzed extensively against SAXS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 at 22 °C, 0.02% NaN3) or SAXS-G buffer (SAXS buffer, including 10%(v/v) glycerol) using a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000. The dialysis procedure was designed to ensure the thorough removal of residual glutamate from the protein samples. For the S1S2-D construct, affinity and ion-exchange purifications in the absence of glutamate were followed by serial dialysis against glutamate-free SAXS buffers (overall volumetric dilution ≥~1.5 × 107-fold). This protocol has been used in previous spectroscopic studies that would have been sensitive to the presence of significant levels of bound agonist: none was detected (9Abele R. Keinänen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Madden D.R. Thiran S. Zimmermann H. Romm J. Jayaraman V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37821-37826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Madden D.R. Cheng Q. Thiran S. Rajan S. Rigo F. Keinänen K. Reinelt S. Zimmermann H. Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15838-15844Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the S1S2J and S1S2L constructs, 1 mm glutamate was present in the samples following ion-exchange purification, but was removed by serial dialysis against glutamate-free SAXS buffers (overall volumetric dilution ≥1013-fold). Taking into account the protein concentration of the dialysate (260 μm) and the reported affinity of the S1S2J domain for glutamate of 0.8 μm (13Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), <5% of the protein could have remained in complex with glutamate. Similar procedures have been used to generate protein for binding studies of S1S2J as well as for crystallization of the apo form (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 13Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Again, no evidence of residual glutamate has been observed. As described below, immediately prior to SAXS measurements the dialyzed samples of S1S2J and S1S2-D were additionally subjected to a final size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification step, which reduced levels of residual agonist even further. At LURE (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Électromagnétique, Orsay, France), some samples were concentrated to yield stock solutions of 25–40 mg/ml and then diluted to 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/ml for initial low angle measurements. Subsequently, to remove higher molecular weight material, stock solutions first concentrated to ~15–32 mg/ml were purified by SEC on a Superdex-75 10/30 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted isocratically in SAXS or SAXS-G buffer at 0.8 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected manually and used to prepare scattering samples without further dilution, at final concentrations between 3.5 and 4.3 mg/ml. Higher resolution scattering measurements were performed using undiluted stock solutions that had been concentrated to ~15 mg/ml. Ligand stock solutions were prepared in 30 mm NaOH at the following concentrations: 7.5 mm α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), 15 mm 6-cyano-7-nitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (CNQX), 15 mm 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (DNQX), and 75 mm glutamate. All ligands were used at the same volume dilution (8:52), yielding final concentrations of 1, 2, 2, and 10 mm, respectively. For measurements in the absence of ligand, an equivalent volume of 30 mm NaOH was added to the protein stock solution. Background scattering for each protein/ligand combination was measured for buffer supplemented with the corresponding volume of ligand stock solution. To minimize variability, calibrated positive displacement pipettes were used to prepare protein/ligand samples in parallel. Small-angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS measurements were performed using the synchrotron radiation beam line D24 at the DCI storage ring of LURE. The instrument, the data acquisition system (27Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. 1986; A249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the evacuated measuring cell (28Dubuisson J-M. Decamps T. Vachette P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 49-54Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have already been described. Measurements were performed in a quartz capillary (diameter ~ 1.5 mm) maintained at 15 °C (S1S2J, S1S2L, or S1S2-D not purified by SEC) and 5 °C (S1S2-D purified by SEC). For S1S2SJ and S1S2L samples, two series of eight frames of 100 s each were recorded over the range of modulus of the scattering vector s from 0.0028 to 0.052 Å–1 (s = 2 sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the radiation wavelength, λ = 1.488 Å). In the case of S1S2-D, eight frames of 200 s each were recorded over the s-range 0.0022–0.032 Å–1 for the solution eluted from the SEC column, and over the s-range 0.0032–0.052 Å–1 for concentrated solutions (29–37 mg/ml) not subjected to SEC purification. Frames were visually inspected to check for x-ray damage, and those few exhibiting even a slight indication of damage were eliminated. Data were scaled to the transmitted intensity, before computing the average and standard deviation of each measurement and subtracting the scattering from the corresponding buffer. Subsequently, patterns recorded using dilute and concentrated samples were scaled to concentration before splicing using the least-square procedure implemented in the PRIMUS software (29Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar) and the resulting “complete” curve was further analyzed. Finally, the scattering from a 4.5 mg/ml solution of bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, freshly eluted from an SEC column was recorded and used for molecular mass calibration. The structural parameters characterizing both S1S2J and S1S2-D constructs in solution were calculated using the following standard procedures. At very small angles, the intensity scattered by a particle can be approximated by a Gaussian curve (30Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar), and the slope of a Guinier plot (ln{I(s)} versus s2) readily yields the value of the radius of gyration Rg of the particle and the value of the intensity at the origin I(0). This approximation is valid over a restricted s-range (typically 2π Rgs < 1.3). The distance distribution function p(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances between any two volume elements within one particle. It has been determined using the indirect transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (31Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). This function provides an alternative estimate of the radius of gyration. Scattering intensities were computed from the atomic coordinates of the crystal structures of S1S2J either unliganded (pdb entry 1fto) or bound to the agonist AMPA (pdb entry 1ftm) or to the antagonist DNQX (pdb entry 1ftl) (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) using the program CRYSOL, which takes into account the hydration water by introducing a 3-Å-thick border layer surrounding the molecule (32Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Each Protein Data Bank entry contains multiple copies of the S1S2J domain within the asymmetric unit. All curves presented here have been calculated using chain A, but the results were essentially independent of the copy chosen. The calculated scattering profile is fitted to the experimental pattern using only two adjustable parameters, the excluded volume of the particle V and the electron density in the border layer ρb, to minimize the discrepancy, x2=1N−1∑i=1N(Ie(Si)−I(Si)σ(Si))(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points, and Ie(si) and σ(si) denote the experimental scattering curve and its standard deviation, respectively. All fits were obtained with values of Δρb = ρb–ρ0 in the range (0.03–0.04 e–/Å3) corresponding to a density of about 1.10 times that of the bulk solvent and commonly observed with soluble proteins. Three iGluR LBD constructs were used in this work. The S1S2J construct corresponds to the refolded, bacterially expressed PBP-homologous core of the GluR2flop subunit used in most crystallographic studies (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 33Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9409-9419Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The S1S2-D construct corresponds to the LBD of the GluR4flip subunit, expressed as a secreted protein in the baculovirus system and used in previous biophysical studies (9Abele R. Keinänen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Madden D.R. Abele R. Andersson A. Keinänen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It contains the peptides that link the core domain to the adjacent transmembrane and oligomerization domains. The S1S2L construct is a bacterially expressed LBD from GluR2flop whose boundaries correspond closely to those of S1S2-D. Controlling Protein Conformation and Oligomeric Status— Previous solution-scattering measurements compared the apo- and glutamate-bound forms of the S1S2-D domain (22Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that conformational changes might have been obscured because the apo state spontaneously samples either fully or partially closed conformations, measurements were performed not only in the presence and absence of agonist, but also in the presence of the antagonist DNQX, which has been shown crystallographically to stabilize the open conformation of the domain (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). To ensure maximal occupancy of the binding site in the presence of agonist, the higher affinity agonist AMPA was used instead of glutamate. Ligand concentrations were selected to ensure >99% saturation even at the high protein concentrations required for SAXS measurements. Finally, to enhance the sensitivity of the experiments to the very small changes expected, particular efforts were taken to reduce the scattering background and eliminate parasitic scatter. To enhance protein homogeneity and stability, measurements were performed at controlled temperatures, and protein was stored prior to experiments at intermediate concentrations (~6–8 mg/ml) and only concentrated to 15–40 mg/ml immediately prior to analysis. During the final concentration step, the bacterially expressed, full-length S1S2L domain of GluR2 exhibited precipitation. Initial inspection of Guinier plots obtained from S1S2L following centrifugation revealed significant residual aggregation, and further analysis of this construct was not pursued. Only slight evidence of higher molecular weight species was seen with the bacterially expressed core S1S2J construct or with the insect cell-derived S1S2-D construct. Nevertheless, to optimize sample homogeneity, both proteins were purified by preparative SEC. A small shoulder close to the dimer molecular weight was observed for S1S2J and S1S2-D. For S1S2-D, analytical SEC of the pooled monomeric peak revealed that its magnitude had been reduced from 2.6–3.2% to 1.7–1.8%. Solution-scattering experiments with the SEC-purified proteins did not reveal any evidence of residual heterogeneity. The S1S2J Ligand-binding Domain Core—SAXS data clearly show that the S1S2J core construct is more compact in the presence of AMPA than in the presence of DNQX or in the absence of ligand. Clear differences were observed between the DNQX- and AMPA-bound scattering curves, with a non-random distribution of intensity differences extending up to three to five times estimated standard deviation on both sides of the baseline (Fig. 1B). Smaller differences following the same trend were also seen between the apo- and the AMPA-bound scattering curves (Fig. 1C). The associated conformational changes are reflected in the real-space distance-distribution function P(r), which represents a one-dimensional analog of the crystallographic Patterson function. The P(r) distribution obtained in the presence of AMPA shows a clear shift toward smaller intramolecular distances compared with the distributions observed in the apo- or DNQX-bound states (Fig. 1D). This change is also reflected in the values for the radius of gyration Rg and the maximum intraparticle distance Dmax (Table I). Overall, the conformational changes detected by solution scattering are consistent with those seen crystallographically, although the magnitude of the difference appears to be somewhat larger between the agonist- and antagonist-bound states in solution (Table I and Fig. 1E). Solution-scattering data for S1S2J in complex with AMPA provide an excellent match to those calculated based on the corresponding crystallographic structure, as modeled using the program CRYSOL (32Svergun D.I.

For the S1S2J-DNQX complex, calculated scattering intensities exhibit some differences from the experimental data with a χ value of 2.3 and a markedly non-random distribution of reduced residuals (Fig. 2C). If anything, the S1S2J-DNQX complex appears to be somewhat more open in solution than in the crystal lattice: the Rg value determined by solution scattering is larger than that calculated from the crystal structure for the DNQX complex (Table I). For the ligand-free domain, interpretation of the scattering data is more complex than for the agonist- or antagonist-bound states. As for the AMPA complex, the experimental Rg of the apo domain is in good agreement with that calculated from the corresponding crystal structure (Table I), indicating that the overall degree of compactness of the apo domain may be similar to that seen in the crystallographic structure. However, unlike the AMPA complex, for which the reduced residuals are approximately random (Fig. 2A), those for the apo-S1S2J domain exhibit a non-random, oscillatory pattern, with a χ value of 2.0 (Fig. 2B), suggestive of a modest conformational difference. Of the two measures, the residual plot is more sensitive to changes than is the radius of gyration, which is an aggregate description of the electron density distribution of the domain and can therefore mask compensatory conformational changes. Both the scattering curve (Fig. 1A) and the distance distribution function (Fig. 1D) for the apo form lie between the corresponding curves for the DNQX- and AMPA-bound states, suggesting that the time-averaged conformation of the apo state of S1S2J is intermediate between the antagonist- and agonist-bound forms. Based on the P(r) curves, it is conceivable that the apo state represents a single, well defined conformation with incomplete cleft closure, similar to that seen in the crystal structure of the complex of S1S2J with kainate, a partial agonist (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Indeed, the scattering curve calculated from the S1S2J-kainate complex provides a better fit to the SAXS apo curve (χ = 1.4) than does the calculated apo-S1S2J curve. However, the reduced residuals are still not randomly distributed (data not shown), and the Rg calculated for the kainate complex is 20.0 Å, indicating that the kainate model is too compact. In comparison to the single-curve fits, a 45:55 linear combination of the experimental curves for the DNQX and AMPA complexes yields an excellent fit to both the scattering curve (χ = 1.3; Fig. 2B) and the Rg (20.4 Å). This suggests that a time-averaged conformation is observed, with the apo state spontaneously sampling both open and closed conformations with comparable frequencies. The observation of an open:closed conformational equilibrium for the apo state differs from the picture provided by the crystal structures of the GluR2 LBD, in which the apo form has the most widely open cleft, ~2.5° more open than the DNQX complex (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, additional crystal structures are available for the apo-LBD from other glutamate receptors: taken together, the full set of models includes both open and closed conformations of the domain (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 16Mayer M.L. Olson R. Gouaux E. J. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Thus, the assumption of an essentially binary equilibrium between open and closed states provides the most parsimonious explanation of the observed SAXS data that is also consistent with all crystallographic evidence. It is also consistent with the energetics of lattice formation, which are most likely to favor crystallization of conformations already existing in solution rather than distorting a unique, stable intermediate conformation, forcing the two lobes together or apart. Finally, the hypothesis that the apo state samples the closed state frequently enough to contribute significantly to the SAXS pattern of the solution is also consistent with molecular dynamics calculations in the absence of agonist (35Arinaminpathy Y. Sansom M.S.P. Biggin P.C. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 676-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the existence of more complex conformational equilibria, analogous to the multiple open conformations seen for the allose- and ribose-binding proteins (20Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), cannot be excluded. Indeed, some plasticity of the open state is implied by the observation of crystallographically independent open apo states whose degree of cleft closure differs by ~4–5° (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) and by modeling studies suggesting a greater conformational flexibility of the GluR2 apo domain compared with the agonist-bound state (35Arinaminpathy Y. Sansom M.S.P. Biggin P.C. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 676-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There have been suggestions that changes in intra- and interdomain mobility upon agonist binding may also be involved in channel gating (10McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10472-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Arinaminpathy Y. Sansom M.S.P. Biggin P.C. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 676-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we still do not understand the extent to which the apparently greater degree of conformational flexibility in the apo state of the ligand-binding domain is related to channel gating and desensitization, nor the extent and frequency with which the ligand-free binding domain may undergo spontaneous closure in the context of an intact receptor. Whatever the interpretation of the data for the apo form of the core LBD, it is clearly different from the static description of a single, wide-open form seen in the crystal. Full-length Ligand-binding Domain—Analogous scattering experiments were performed on S1S2-D. Preliminary measurements on protein that had not been purified by size-exclusion chromatography revealed Rg values of ~29 Å for both the DNQX and AMPA complexes; however, no clear difference could be observed (data not shown). All further experiments were therefore performed with the SEC-purified material. In addition, we decided to increase the redundancy of the measurements to provide internal consistency checks. In addition to DNQX and AMPA, experiments were performed on complexes with the antagonist CNQX and the full agonist glutamate. Furthermore, two datasets were collected for each complex, using protein from two independent protein preparations. Under these conditions, a clear and reproducible difference could be detected between the radii of gyration of the antagonist-bound complexes on the one hand and the agonist-bound complexes on the other (Table II). This difference is also clearly reflected in the distance-distribution functions, whose peak is shifted to smaller interparticle distances in the presence of agonists (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with the second dataset (data not shown).Table IIExperimental scattering parameters for S1S2-D complexesSampleRg GuinierRgP(r)RmaxDmaxÅCNQX28.7 ± 0.329.8 ± 0.328.9115 ± 5DNQX29.0 ± 0.330.0 ± 0.329.2110 ± 5Apo28.5 ± 0.330.1 ± 0.328.6112 ± 5Glu28.0 ± 0.329.0 ± 0.327.5104 ± 5AMPA28.2 ± 0.328.9 ± 0.327.7106 ± 5 Open table in a new tab A comparison of the distance-distribution function of the apo-S1S2-D domain with those of the antagonist-bound proteins revealed only very small differences (Fig. 3B). Changes are concentrated along the falling edge (35 Å ≤ r ≤ 60 Å) but are only slightly greater than the variability seen comparing three independent P(r) curves for the S1S2-D-glutamate complex (not shown). As calculated from the Guinier plots, the Rg value for the apo state appears to be slightly smaller than that of the antagonists, as is the radius corresponding to maximum P(r) (Rmax), but the values derived from the distance distribution function show no significant difference (Table II). Thus, the difference between the apo- and antagonist-bound conformations, if any, appears to be smaller for S1S2-D than for the S1S2J core domain. The reason for this discrepancy with the core domain is not clear, but it suggests that the additional moieties included in the extended construct may preferentially stabilize the open state. Relative stabilization of the open state of the S1S2-D construct is supported by the kinetics of agonist docking, which indicate that the majority of ligand-free molecules are in an open, binding-competent conformation (9Abele R. Keinänen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Compared with the experimental and calculated Rg values for the core domain, the experimental values obtained for S1S2-D are significantly larger (~28–30 Å versus ~20–21 Å), consistent with the presence of additional protein and carbohydrate moieties on the full-length domain (Tables I and II). The maximum intraparticle distance (Dmax) is also significantly greater (~105–115 Å versus ~60–65 Å for S1S2J). These differences are larger than expected based solely on the increase in molecular mass (42 versus 29 kDa), which would yield Rg values of ~26 Å and Dmax values of ~74 Å for the extended construct, assuming similar axial ratios. The even larger values observed for S1S2-D thus most likely reflect the fact that it is significantly more elongated than the core domain, implying that the additional moieties of the full-length domain must be clustered near the ends of the core domain, as had been indicated by previous measurements on S1S2-D (22Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite this confirmation of the elongated nature of S1S2-D, the Rg values determined here are smaller than those measured previously (22Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar): 28–30 Å versus 31–34 Å. It is therefore possible that the earlier SAXS experiments were affected by residual higher molecular weight species, whose contribution to scattering may have helped to obscure the small conformational change associated with agonist binding. These data show that both the core and extended iGluR LBD constructs undergo a transition in solution from a more open, antagonist-bound conformation to a more compact, agonist-bound conformation corresponding broadly to that seen in the crystallographic structures of the core domain (11Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). As a result, all structural and biophysical data are now in agreement that the iGluR LBD undergoes a cleft closure stabilized by agonist binding and that the magnitude of this closure is smaller than those seen for many PBP. Together with recent evidence that the construct retains a high affinity binding site capable of ligand exchange and at least limited (~3°) cleft closure within the crystal lattice (15Jin R. Gouaux E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5201-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), these data underline the overall functional equivalence of the crystal and solution states of S1S2J in the presence of ligand. In the absence of ligand, it appears that the core domain samples a conformational equilibrium, including open and closed states, and that the equilibrium may be biased toward the open state by the addition of peptides that anchor the S1S2J core to the other domains in a complete iGluR subunit."

To maintain the vectorial transport of amino acids through the intestine and kidney epithelia a net basolateral efflux of amino acids is needed. This cannot be provided by LSHATs, as they are obligatory exchangers. A candidate for this efflux transporter is TAT1, which may contribute to the basolateral exit of aromatic amino acids (25Kim D.K.

Here we have functionally characterized arpAT, a new member of the LSHAT family. Its coexpression with both rBAT and 4F2hc elicits sodium-independent, low affinity transport activity for neutral amino acids and, with lower affinity, for dibasic amino acids. It shows preferential transport of the aromatic amino acids l-DOPA, l-tyrosine, and most likely l-tryptophan. Its expression in the brain and in the intestine suggests roles in dopamine homeostasis and aromatic amino acid absorption. We also report that despite conservation of the arpAT gene in vertebrates, it has become silenced during the evolution of primates. A preliminary evolutionary analysis of the arpAT gene in vertebrates is presented.

Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5298) Google Scholar), we detected two novel exonic regions with significant similarity to two subregions of the b0,+AT protein. By maximizing the identity to the known members of the LSHAT family we partially predicted the coding structure of this putative novel gene, which was used to define primers for the complete identification and cloning of the corresponding cDNA (later named as arpAT) as described below. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 3.2 μg of total RNA purified from mouse kidney using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen). Forward primer cr12F6, 5′-ATGGAGCGAAGTGAGGAG-3′, and reverse primer, cr12R5 5′-CCCAGTCAATGATCTTTAGTG-3′, corresponding to positions 1-18 and 1452-1472 nucleotides of the predicted cDNA were synthesized and used in the first PCR round. This amplification was carried out in a PerkinElmer 9600 thermocycler, and conditions were hot start for 2 min at 94 °C; 15 cycles of denaturing (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (62 °C for 30 s, reducing 1 °C every 3 cycles), and extension (68 °C for 2.2 min); 20 cycles of denaturing (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (57 °C for 30 s), and extension (68 °C for 2.2 min); and a final extension of 7 min at 68 °C. PCR-amplified DNA fragments with the expected length were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. The DNA sequences obtained were then compared with DNA and the protein sequence of the protein constructed in silico, which we later named arpAT. All amplified products were sequenced with d-Rhodamine Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (PerkinElmer). The sequence reactions were analyzed with Abi Prism 377 DNA sequencer. The arpAT cDNA was subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for use in functional expression experiments. The arpAT cDNA was also detected by PCR amplification in the previous conditions from total RNA purified from mouse white adipose tissue, brain, and small intestine (data not shown). Uptake and Efflux Measurements in HeLa-transfected Cells—Transfections with mouse arpAT, human b0,+AT, human rBAT, and human 4F2hc cDNAs in HeLa cells were performed as described previously (34Font M.A. Feliubadalo L. Estivill X. Nunes V. Golomb E. Kreiss Y. Pras E. Bisceglia L. d'Adamo A.P. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Bassi M.T. George Jr., A.L. Manzoni M. Riboni M. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Reig N. Fernandez E. Zorzano A. Bertran J. Palacin M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For uptake measurements, cells were washed twice in 1 ml of the transport medium (137 mmN-methyl-d-gluconate, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) equilibrated at 37 °C). Subsequently, 200 μl of the transport medium with substrate (50 μm l-[3H]alanine, l-[3H]serine, l-[3H]glutamine, l-[3H]arginine, l-[3H]cystine, l-[3H]tyrosine, or l-[3H]DOPA (2.5 μCi/ml)) was added and cells were incubated for 1 min (linear conditions, results not shown). After incubation, the uptake medium was removed and cells were washed three times in 1 ml of cold (4 °C) transport medium. Nonspecific binding was assessed by addition and immediate removal of the uptake solution at 4 °C. After washing, cells were lysed by addition of 250 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS per well; 100 μl was used for radioactivity counting and 20 μl was used to measure the protein content (BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)). Radioactivity was measured in a β-scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000TA; Beckman Instruments). For efflux measurements, HeLa cells were preloaded by incubation in transport medium containing 0.5 mm l-[3H]alanine or l-[3H]tyrosine or l-[3H]DOPA for 5 min. The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold transport medium and incubated in efflux solution in the presence or absence of different amino acids (1 mm). Aliquots of 50 μl of the efflux medium were removed at 0, 60, and 120 s and the radioactivity was measured by adding the 50 μl to 3 ml of scintillation liquid. The radioactivity remaining in the cells was also measured after lysis of the cells, as above. Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA from the tissues of 5 adult male CD1 mice was obtained with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen), and subsequently diluted with nuclease-free water to 1.7 ng/μl cDNA. Real-time PCR amplification mixtures (16 μl) contained 10 ng of template cDNA, 8 μl of 2× SYBR Green I Master Mix buffer (Applied Biosystems), and 400 nm forward and reverse primers. Reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The cycling conditions comprised a 10-min polymerase activation at 95 °C and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Each assay included a standard curve of five serial dilution points of small intestine cDNA (ranging from 10 ng to 625 pg in duplicate), a no template control (in triplicate; one control for each oligonucleotide set), and 10 ng of each test cDNA. All PCR efficiencies were above 95%. The SDS 2.1 software was used for the quantifications. Mouse peptidylprolyl isomerase A was used to normalize expression of arpAT in different tissues. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A did not vary more than 5-fold between tissues, and arpAT CT values ranged from 23.5 in the small intestine to 32 in the kidney. The primers used for arpAT were the pair arpAT1F 5′-ACCTTTGCCTGTCTTCTGTATTTG-3′ and arpAT1R 5′-AACCTTGTAAGTGTGGGGGAGATTC-3′; and the pair arpAT2F 5′-GGGGCTGTGGTCCTTTGATG-3′ and 5′-AGGTTCTGCTTTGGATTCTTGAG-3′. For peptidylprolyl isomerase A the primers were CYPF, 5′-CAAATGCTGGACCAAACACAAAC-3′, and CYPR, 5′-TGCCATCCAGCCATTCAGTC-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (30 μg) from mouse intestine was separated on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized overnight with a 32P-labeled 403-bp probe (nucleotides 1-403 of the arpAT coding region). After hybridization, the blot was washed twice at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS (each for 30 min). In addition, one mouse poly(A+) membrane from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) was also hybridized with the same probe according to the manufacturer's instructions and washed identically. Western Blot Analysis of HeLa Cell Proteins—The Western blot analyses of HeLa cells transfected with the cDNAs of mouse arpAT, human b0,+AT, human xCT, human rBAT, and human 4F2hc cDNAs were performed as described previously (35Pineda M. Wagner C.A. Broer A. Stehberger P.A. Kaltenbach S. Gelpi J.L. Martin D.R. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Riboprobes corresponding to the nucleotide sequence coding for two fragments of the arpAT protein were prepared from in vitro transcription and used for in situ hybridization. In preparation for the riboprobe, 196-bp (5′-probe, nucleotides 69 to 264 of the arpAT coding region) and 224-bp (3′-probe, nucleotides 1088 to 1311 of the arpAT coding region) fragments were amplified using the following two sets of oligonucleotides: cr12F10 (5′-GGGGCTGATGCTGAAGAG-3′) and cr12R8 (5′-GCCCAGTTCAGCATAGCAC-3′) for the 5′-probe; and cr12F11 (5′-CGGCTGTGGCTTTACTGCTG-3′) and cr12R10 (5′-CGGGTGGTCAATGATGGGTG-3′) for the 3′-probe. The amplified fragments were purified, ligated to a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced to determine sequence orientation. The cRNA were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by transcription in sense and antisense orientations using the mMessage mMachine SP6 and T7 in vitro transcription system (Ambion). The quality and the quantity of the riboprobes were evaluated using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric reading, respectively. Mouse tissues were embedded in paraffin after whole animal fixation with paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer. 5-μm sections were cut in a Leica RM 2135 microtome, mounted on silanized slides (PerkinElmer), and deparafined. In situ hybridization was performed as described elsewhere (6Pineda M. Fernandez E. Torrents D. Estevez R. Lopez C. Camps M. Lloberas J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19738-19744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Slides were examined on an Olympus microscope and the images were captured in a Leica IM50 Image manager at the Serveis Científico Tècnics (University of Barcelona). Comparative Analysis of the Evolution of arpAT Genes in Vertebrates—The alignment for the phylogenetic tree has been performed with the T-Coffee program (36Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). To evaluate the patterns of evolution associated with the arpAT genes of different vertebrates we have used available tools for sequence analysis and sequence evolution. To detect arpAT orthologs, we have used the mouse arpAT protein sequence as query in BLAST comparisons against the genome of rat (assembly of June 2003), dog (assembly of June 2004), chicken (assembly of February 2004), human (build35), and chimp (assembly of November 2003). For each of the identified regions, we predicted the structure and the resulting peptide sequence using GENEWISE (37Birney E. Clamp M. Durbin R. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), which in addition, reports the position of all possible coding disablements found in-frame (stop codons or frameshits). These regions were considered true arpAT orthologs because: (a) flanking genes were also similar between compared genomes, and (b) the genomic regions identified appeared as first and best match when using mouse arpAT as query (tBLASTN), and the comparison using tBLASTx of the predicted peptides back to the mouse genome found again the arpAT gene as the best matching region (best reciprocal match). The levels of selective constraints associated with a certain genomic region can be inferred by the ratio of silent (synonymous, dS) to amino acid replacement (non-synonymous, dN) nucleotide substitutions. dN/dS ratios of non-functional regions and those of the vast majority of genes are generally different, as mutations in genes causing amino acid replacements with functional consequences are selected against (i.e. dN values are lower), in contrast to mutations occurring in dispensable regions, such as silenced genes or pseudogenes (with dN/dS close to 1). We have calculated dN/dS in different steps. We first aligned the predicted peptide sequences of all identified arpAT orthologs using CLUSTALW (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54864) Google Scholar) followed by manual refinement. We next removed all regions containing gaps in at least one of the peptide sequences. Based on aligned positions we replaced each of the amino acids by the corresponding coding codon, obtaining a protein-based DNA alignment, which was then use to calculate (through maximum likelihood using codeml: unrooted tree and model 1; (39Yang Z. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 555-556PubMed Google Scholar)) the specific rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) nucleotide substitutions for each of the sequences. In Silico Cloning of arpAT—Our goal was to identify new members of the LSHAT family. BLAST searches with the known human and mouse LSHATs protein sequences identified a region spanning 10.2 Mb on mouse chromosome 12 (12-A1.3 band, region 8.674000-8.688000 of the June 2003 mouse genome assembly), which contained a putative new open reading frame fulfilling the criteria for a bona fide LSHAT: 1) the ORF exhibited high similarity to mammalian LSHATs along the whole sequence, without significant gaps (e.g. 43% identity, 64% similarity with mouse b0,+AT; and see Fig. 1A, where a phylogenetic tree of the mouse LSHAT family is shown); 2) its predicted topology revealed 12 transmembrane domains with intracellular N and C termini like the recently proven topology for the LSHAT xCT (40Gasol E. Jimenez-Vidal M. Chillaron J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); 3) the cysteine involved in the conserved disulfide bond in the putative second extracellular loop (41Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is also present. Fig. 1B shows the alignment of mouse b0,+AT and the new LSHAT member, which we named arpAT because of its functional properties (see below). The predicted open reading frame codes for a 53.1-kDa protein of 488 amino acids with two potential N-glycosylation sites. One lies in the putative 7th transmembrane domain and it is therefore unlikely to be used. The second site, located in the 3rd extracellular loop, is also present in human LAT1 where it was shown not to be used in vivo (42Yanagida O. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Segawa H. Nii T. Cha S.H. Matsuo H. Fukushima J.I. Fukasawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A Kozak consensus sequence (5′-gaaATGg-3′) and a putative canonical polyadenylation signal (AATAA) 837 bp downstream of the stop codon were also present (Fig. 1B). Two RIKEN cDNA clones map onto the mouse arpAT region (see Fig. A in the Supplemental Materials). Comparative Analysis of the Evolution of arpAT in Vertebrates—We identified the arpAT orthologs in rat, dog, and chicken with complete ORFs (see Fig. B in the Supplemental Materials). The proteins showed 92 (rat), 80 (dog), and 59% (chicken) identity with the mouse arpAT. We also found the human and chimpanzee arpAT orthologous regions (chr2: 20507813-20517977 and chr12:21334250-21344417, respectively; see Fig. A in the Supplementary Materials). Their predicted ORFs were 75 and 76% identical to mouse for human and chimpanzee, respectively, and revealed 10 frame-disrupting insertions/deletions and 4 in-frame stop codons, which should prevent the expression of functional arpAT protein. Moreover, an Alu sequence element disrupted exon 1. Nearly all of these coding disablements (including the Alu insertion) share the same position in both organisms, indicating that silencing of the arpAT gene t"

Invasive diseases due to GBS are attributed to the ability of the pathogen to translocate across human epithelial surfaces. The alpha C protein (ACP) has been identified as an invasin that plays a role in internalization and translocation of GBS across epithelial cells. The soluble N-terminal domain of ACP (NtACP) blocks the internalization of GBS. We determined the 1.86-Å resolution crystal structure of NtACP comprising residues Ser52 through Leu225 of the full-length ACP. NtACP has two domains, an N-terminal β-sandwich and a C-terminal three-helix bundle. Structural and topological alignments reveal that the β-sandwich shares structural elements with the type III fibronectin fold (FnIII), but includes structural elaborations that make it unique. We have identified a potential integrin-binding motif consisting of Lys-Thr-Asp146, Arg110, and Asp118. A similar arrangement of charged residues has been described in other invasins. ACP shows a heparin binding activity that requires NtACP. We propose a possible heparin-binding site, including one surface of the three-helix bundle, and nearby portions of the sandwich and repeat domains. We have validated this prediction using assays of the heparin binding and cell-adhesion properties of engineered fragments of ACP. This is the first crystal structure of a member of the highly conserved Gram-positive surface alpha-like protein family, and it will enable the internalization mechanism of GBS to be dissected at the atomic level.

Little is known about the bacterial components that allow this pathogen to adhere to and penetrate cellular membranes. Previous studies suggest that surface proteins are significantly involved in the process (11Tamura G.S. Kuypers J.M. Smith S. Raff H. Rubens C.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bulgakova T.N. Grabovskaya K.B. Ryc M. Jelinkova J. Folia Microbiol. (Praha). 1986; 31: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The surface-expressed GBS alpha C protein (ACP) has been shown to act as an invasin (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ACP is the prototype of a family of surface-expressed proteins containing long tandem repeats (alpha-like proteins (Alp)). Members of this family of proteins have a high degree of sequence homology with each other and are thought to share similar function. Indeed, the Alp expressed in group A Streptococcus, R28, has been associated with cell adhesion (17Stalhammar-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T. Larsson C. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and that of Enterococcus faecalis, Esp, has been associated with virulence (18Shankar N. Lockatell C.V. Baghdayan A.S. Drachenberg C. Gilmore M.S. Johnson D.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4366-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Deletion of the ACP gene bca attenuates the virulence of GBS 5-7-fold and the internalization of GBS into cervical epithelial cells by 80% (19Li J. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Rosner B. Michel J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount of internalized GBS within human cervical epithelial cells in vitro is inhibited by 75% in the presence of the N-terminal domain of ACP (NtACP) (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that ACP is a major determinant of virulence. Recently, ACP has been reported to bind glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (20Baron M.J. Bolduc G.R. Goldberg M.B. Auperin T.C. Madoff L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24714-24723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ACP consists of an N-terminal domain (174 amino acids), a variable number of tandem repeats of 82 amino acids each, and a 45-amino acid C-terminal domain containing a LPXTG peptidoglycan-binding motif. NtACP mediates GBS internalization within human epithelial cells (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell.

Moreover, both the alpha C protein and the isolated N-terminal domain are immunogenic and elicit antibodies that protect against GBS infections in experimental animals (21Gravekamp C. Kasper D.L.

Immun. 1997; 65: 1462-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To provide further clues concerning the role of NtACP in adherence, entry, virulence, and immunity, we have determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.86 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography. The mostly negative surface of NtACP includes a regular linear arrangement of positive charges that strongly suggested the location of the heparin-binding site and provided preliminary indications regarding their detailed intermolecular interaction. To confirm these structurally based predictions and define the limits of the binding site more precisely, we have conducted in vitro and in vivo binding assays using engineered fragments of ACP. This is the first crystal structure of a member of the highly conserved Gram-positive surface alpha-like protein family, and it will enable the internalization mechanism of GBS to be further dissected at the atomic level. All amino acid residues in this paper and in the coordinates file are numbered according to the alpha C protein numbering (23Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Olson K. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10060-10064Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the first methionine of the recombinant proteins is numbered Met39, as the first residue of the alpha C protein 2The nucleotide sequence for the alpha C protein gene has been deposited in the GenBank data base under accession number M97256 (23Michel J.L.

The amino acid sequence of this protein can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession number AAA26848 (23Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Olson K. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M.

Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of NtACP—Cloning of the DNA encoding for the N-terminal domain of alpha C protein (pDEK14) has been described previously (22Kling D.E. Gravekamp C. Madoff L.C. Michel J.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1462-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two leucine residues were substituted with methionine residues (L88M and L94M) using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forward primer 5′-GATTTATATGATGTAAAAATGGGTAAAATAGATCCAATGCAATTAATTGTTTTAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTAAAACAATTAATTGCATTGGATCTATTTTACCCATTTTTACATCATATAAATC-3′, and pDEK14 template were used. The resulting construct, pGB1, was cloned into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for expression of the mutant form of NtACP. Based on the structure of NtACP, the DNA encoding for D2-R was produced using PCR forward primer 5′-CACCTTGAGGGATAAGATT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCATAGTTTATTTCCTTTACC-3′ to amplify a 504-base-pair portion of ACP including approximately one-third of the NtACP (i.e. Leu164-Leu225, most of domain 2), an adjacent repeat, and 13 amino acid residues of the C-terminal region from plasmid pT7LM39 (24Gravekamp C. Horensky D.S. Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3576-3583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer includes a CACC sequence, and the reverse primer includes a TCA stop codon added as directed for use with the pET200 Directional TOPO Expression Kit (Invitrogen). The PCR product was cloned into the pET200/D-TOPO vector using the manufacturer's instructions, and the resulting construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Sample Preparation—The native and mutant recombinant NtACP were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) with a His6 tag fused at their C-terminal end and purified as previously described (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Selenomethionyl (SeMet) proteins were expressed overnight in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 25 °C following a protocol previously described for the use of non-auxotrophic cells (25Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). SeMet mutant proteins were purified in the presence of 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. Complete substitution of methionine residues and loss of the N-terminal methionine in native and SeMet-labeled proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight). Final preparations were dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm dithiothreitol. E. coli BLR (Novagen) was used to express full-length 9-repeat ACP, as well as the 9-repeat region (9RR, without N- or C-terminal regions). Full-length 9-repeat ACP, 9RR, and D2-R were expressed and purified as described previously (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Gravekamp C. Horensky D.S. Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3576-3583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 21 °C using a 2-μl drop. Native and SeMet mutant proteins (18 mg/ml) were mixed separately with an equal volume of the well solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6-5.1, and 10-15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (well solution for SeMet proteins included 10 mm dithiothreitol). The resulting elongated crystals (typical dimensions 0.6 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm for the native and 2.0-3.0 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm for the SeMet derivative) grow in space group P6122 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 56.5 and c = 271.6 Å for the native and a = b = 56.7 and c = 272.2 Å for the SeMet derivative (see Table I). These crystals had 1 NtACP molecule/asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.88 Å3/Da) and a solvent content of 57%. In advance of cryocooling the crystals, the native crystals were quickly soaked in 100 mm sodium acetate, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 25% glycerol, whereas the SeMet crystals were cryoprotected by bringing the mother liquor to a final concentration of 20% glycerol in small steps (3% increments every 30 min), and were frozen in liquid nitrogen.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsNativeMutant SeMetData collectionSpace groupP6122P6122Unit cell parametersa, b, c, Å56.46, 56.46, 271.6256.97, 56.97, 272.23α, β, γ, °90, 90, 12090, 90, 120Molecules/asymmetric unit11Wavelength, Å1.01000.9763Resolution range, Å40-1.86 (1.93-1.86)30-2.6 (2.69-2.60)Completeness, %95.1 (71.7)aHighest resolution shell values are given in parentheses97.4 (99.2)Observations total/unique267,765/19,465 (1,462)110,146/8.581 (828)Redundancy14.012.8Rsym, %bRsym = 100*(Σ|I - 〈I〉|/Σ I), where I is the observed intensity of an individual reflection, and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of that reflection5.3 (33.9)6.8 (13.4)〈I〉/〈σ(I)〉27.5 (4.7)30.7 (24.7)Heavy atoms sites (Se)02RefinementOrdered amino acid residues180 (Ser57-His236)172 (Pro60-Leu231)No. of non-hydrogen atomsof the protein1,4101,300of the solvent52851Resolution range, Å39.5-1.86 (1.96-1.86)12-2.6 (2.73-2.60)Rcryst, %cRcryst = 100*(Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ |Fo|), where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively19.3 (21.6)aHighest resolution shell values are given in parentheses26.9 (32.7)Rfree, %dRfree, Rcryst calculated for a subset of the reflections (10.1% for the native, 9.8% for the SeMet), which were omitted during the refinement and used to monitor its convergence23.3 (27.5)30.8 (39.5)Root mean square deviation bond length, Å0.0150.010Root mean square deviation bond angle, °1.4061.552a Highest resolution shell values are given in parenthesesb Rsym = 100*(Σ|I - 〈I〉|/Σ I), where I is the observed intensity of an individual reflection, and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of that reflectionc Rcryst = 100*(Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ |Fo|), where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectivelyd Rfree, Rcryst calculated for a subset of the reflections (10.1% for the native, 9.8% for the SeMet), which were omitted during the refinement and used to monitor its convergence Open table in a new tab Data Collection—Data for the native crystals were collected using a 1.01-Å radiation on a nine-element CCD detector at beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set of the SeMet mutant crystal was collected at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, at three different x-ray energies around the K absorption edge of selenium and recorded on an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector (Table I). Structure Determination and Refinement—The present structure determination depended solely on the anomalous scattering from two selenium atoms (for 180 residues). The crystal structure of SeMet NtACP was determined by the single anomalous dispersion method, using its peak wavelength data set (Table I). The data were integrated and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Atomic positions for two selenium atoms (SeMet88 and SeMet94) were located by SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and the phases were calculated. A solvent-flattened map (RESOLVE) at 2.60 Å resolution was of high quality (see Fig. 1A). Clearly defined solvent boundaries were present, and most of the side chain densities were visible. Model building was performed using XtalView (28McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, New York1993Google Scholar), and the atomic model was refined using REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar), with experimental phases included as restraints and with intermittent model rebuilding. The resulting model for residues 60-231 with most side chains present gave an R factor and Rfree of 26.9 and 30.9%, respectively, versus the SeMet data (Table I). A rigid body fit of the SeMet model to the native data were performed by molecular replacement using EPMR (30Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) at 4 Å resolution. Further refinement of the atomic model and phase extension to 1.86 Å resolution were done with REFMAC5 and additional model rebuilding was performed with XtalView. Solvent molecules (water, dithiothreitol, and glycerol) were built based on expected hydrogen bond geometry and electron density. The final R factor and Rfree of the NtACP (Fig. 1B) were 19.3 and 23.3%, respectively, at 1.86 Å nominal resolution (Table I). Analysis using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows 97.1% of non-proline and non-glycine residues in the most favored region and 2.85% in the additionally allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. However, one residue (Asn76) could not be built into the electron density envelope in a single low energy conformation, suggesting that multiple conformations of the main chain may be present. Dot Blot Assay—Protein binding to heparin was studied with a modified dot blot technique (20Baron M.J. Bolduc G.R. Goldberg M.B. Auperin T.C. Madoff L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24714-24723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) modeled after an immunoblot assay. Proteins (1 μg of each) were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking for 1 h with 5% skim milk. The membrane was then incubated with heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) at 0.05 mg/ml for 1 h, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin (Pierce) for 1 h prior to washing and developing. Flow Cytometry—Fluorescent labeling of proteins was performed using the AlexaFluor 488 Protein Labeling Kit (A-10235; Molecular Probes), to conjugate AlexaFluor 488 dye to protein samples, according to manufacturer's instructions as described previously (15Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Gravekamp C. Lachenauer C.S. Madoff L.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ME180 human cervical epithelial cells (ATCC) were grown to monolayer confluence in 6-well plates with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), including 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The day prior to the assay, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, AlexaFluor-labeled protein was added to the wells to a final concentration of 0.1 μm. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1.5 h. The medium was removed from the wells, and the monolayers were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS to remove unbound proteins. 350 μl of trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA-4Na, Invitrogen) was added to the wells, and plates were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were detached by repeated pipetting and harvested by centrifugation at 650 rpm (50 × g) for 8 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS before incubation at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed with 1 ml of PBS to remove the fixative, resuspended in 0.4 ml of PBS, filtered through a cell-strainer cap (Falcon), and analyzed by flow cytometry on the MoFLo (Cytomation) machine. The cell population of interest was identified by using the AlexaFluor-labeled bovine serum albumin sample to define nonspecific staining and/or autofluorescence levels. Positive cells were defined to have a fluorescent signal greater than that of 98.5% of the bovine serum albumin-treated control cell population. Overall Structure—The crystal structure of the NtACP, residues 52-225, has been determined to 1.86 Å resolution by single anomalous dispersion (Table I and Fig. 2). The final model has acceptable geometry, with an R factor and Rfree of 19.3 and 23.3%, respectively (Table I). The molecule is elongated with overall dimensions of 82 × 34 × 27 Å. It is composed of two major domains, the membrane-distal domain 1 (D1) is comprised of Ser57-Asp160, and domain 2 (D2) includes Ser161-Leu225. Domain 1 contains eight β-strands arranged into three β-sheets: a large flat sheet containing strands F-E-G-I and two smaller sheets, A-D and B-C (Fig. 2). These sheets enclose a hydrophobic core that is highly conserved among the Alp family members (Fig. 3). The F-E-G-I and the A-D sheets are arranged to form a typical β-sandwich, but the basic pattern is elaborated in a distinctive way by the addition of an α-helix (H1, 6 residues) and two 310-helices (H2, 4 residues, and H3, 5 residues). Domain 2 is composed of three antiparallel α-helices (H4, H5, and H6) arranged in a ∼35-Å long left-handed three-helix bundle, a very common structural motif that delimits a highly conserved hydrophobic core (Figs. 2 and 3). The three α-helices are composed of 16 amino acids (Ser161-Asn176), 22 amino acids (Thr181-Asn202), and 17 amino acids (Thr205-Lys221), respectively. An additional, though biologically irrelevant, α-helix (H7, 9 residues), corresponding to the linker from the pET24a vector connecting the protein to the His6 tag, immediately follows domain 2.Fig. 3Sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of the Alp family members.

Except for the Alps, homology searches at the nucleotide and amino acid levels did not identify any other proteins with meaningful similarities to NtACP. The structure comparison program DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) found no protein that aligned well with domain 1 in its entirety. However, several protein structures align with a root mean square deviation of <3.0 Å with a subset of the Cα comprising 70% of the NtACP domain 1, which includes the F, E, G, and I strands of the large β-sheet and the A and D strands of the smaller sheet of the β-sandwich. The most significant structural homologues include several proteins known to be involved in cell adhesion, including MADCAM-1 (PDB code 1bqs (33Tan K. Casasnovas J.M. Liu J.H. Briskin M.J.

Our results suggest that the membrane domain contains eight transmembrane helices and an alleged cytoplasmic loop that contains two additional helices. The latter region forms a dynamic structure, as evidenced by the alternation of residues near its ends between faced-in and faced-out states.

In addition to its ability to phosphorylate its sugar substrate, BglF phosphorylates the transcriptional regulator BglG in the absence of β-glucosides and dephosphorylates P-BglG upon addition of β-glucosides to the growth medium (2Amster-Choder O.

By controlling the phosphorylation state of BglG, BglF controls the dimeric state of BglG and, thus, its ability to bind RNA and antiterminate transcription of the bgl operon (4Amster-Choder O.

BglF dimerizes spontaneously in the membrane, and its dimeric form can catalyze all the above mentioned activities (5Chen Q. Amster-Choder O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8714-8723Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several other enzymes II of PTS were shown to regulate activity of transcription factors. Two representative examples are SacX, a sucrose permease from Bacillus subtilis, which regulates the activity of the BglG homologue SacY by reversible phosphorylation (6Crutz A.M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Roselyne R. Le Cog D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Idelson M. Amster-Choder O. J.

The phosphate flux in PTS starts with a phosphoryl group, donated by phosphoenolpyruvate, which is passed through the general PTS proteins, enzyme I, and HPr, to the various sugar-specific permeases. Like many other PTS permeases, BglF is composed of three domains: the hydrophilic A and B domains (IIAbgl and IIBbgl) and the hydrophobic C domain (IICbgl) (reviewed in Refs. 10Postma P.W.

The A domain is phosphorylated by HPr; the phosphate is then transferred to the B domain and subsequently to β-glucosides; the membrane-spanning C domain presumably forms the sugar translocation channel and at least part of the sugar-binding site. Cys-24, residing in the B domain, was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of both the incoming sugar and the BglG protein and for the dephosphorylation of P-BglG (13Chen Q. Arents J.C.

The mechanism that ensures correct delivery of the phosphoryl group to the right entity, sugar or protein, by the same active site is not known. A clue to this mechanism seems to lie in the different domain requirements of the distinct functions; whereas the B domain is sufficient for BglG phosphorylation, both the B and C domains, connected in the order BC, are required for the sugar-stimulated functions, i.e. sugar phosphotransfer and P-BglG dephosphorylation (15Chen Q. Amster-Choder O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17040-17047Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Amster-Choder O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 462-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Catalysis of the sugar-stimulated functions involves specific interaction(s) between the active site-containing B domain and the integral membrane C domain (17Chen Q. Nussbaum-Shochat A. Amster-Choder O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44751-44756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To understand better how BglF catalyzes its different activities, we investigated its membrane topology. To examine the way BglF traverses through the membrane, we constructed a set of single-Cys BglF variants by site-directed mutagenesis, and we assessed the exposure and the sidedness of the planted cysteines, in whole cells and in membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation, by chemical modification with thiol-specific reagents. Of the 36 constructed single-Cys mutants, only one was not expressed. Because the BglF-active site is a cysteine residue (Cys-24Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9433) Google Scholar), single-Cys mutants are not active. Hence, we constructed a parallel set of di-Cys mutants, each containing Cys-24 in the B domain and a single cysteine in the membrane C domain. We used the di-Cys mutants to test the effect of the Cys replacements on BglF activities. All mutants catalyzed phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of BglG, and except for one, they were all capable of β-glucosides phosphotransfer, implying that they retained proper folding. The topology of single- and di-Cys BglF variants was studied by the use of membrane-permeant and impermeant thiol-binding reagents. Most significantly, the experiments performed with the two sets of mutants led to the same conclusions, indicating that the mutation in the B domain does not affect the folding and the membrane topology of the BglF variant proteins. Based on the results presented here, we suggest that BglF contains eight transmembrane helices (TMs I-VIII). The periplasmic loops are close to the membrane, the first being a reentrant loop. The region between TM VI and TM VII, an alleged cytoplasmic loop, is rather sizeable. It contains a pair of putative α-helices and positions near its termini flip occasionally between faced-in and faced-out states. The accessibility to one position in this region is blocked by the sugar substrate. We suggest that this region and the two TMs encompassing it form the sugar translocation channel. Our study is the first detailed topological study of a PTS sugar permease in the context of the intact protein. Previous systematic topological studies of PTS permeases were performed with fusion proteins between progressively or randomly truncated PTS permeases and β-galactosidase or alkaline phosphatase (reviewed in Ref. 18Siebold C. Flukiger K. Beutler R. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These studies also suggested the existence of a large cytoplasmic loop, which is likely to be involved in sugar phosphotransfer. The actual dynamics of this region between the cytoplasm and periplasm is manifested here for the first time. Chemicals—Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM), p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG), salicin, arbutin, imidazole, lysozyme, DNase, and RNase were obtained from Sigma. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Calbiochem. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from Qiagen. Fluorescein 5-maleimide (5-FM) was obtained from Pierce. 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA), [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. Anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride was obtained from Acros Organics. Strains—The following E. coli K12 strains were used: AG1688 (MC1061 (F′128lacIq lac::Tn5)) was used for the construction of single- and di-Cys BglF mutants. HMS174(DE3) (F-recA1 hsdR(rK12-mK12+) RifR (DE3)), obtained from Novagen, was used for monitoring expression of the BglF variants as His-tagged proteins from pET15b and for assaying sugar phosphotransfer and accessibility of the planted cysteines to thiol reagents. MA200-1, which carries a bgl′-lacZ fusion on its chromosome (λ bglR7 bglG′ lacZ+lacY+) and a defective bglF gene (19Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used for assaying BglG regulation by the BglF variants. Plasmids—Plasmid pT7OAC-F, which carries the entire bglF gene cloned downstream of the phage T7 late promoter in pT712 (2Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was used as a reagent to construct two plasmids encoding BglF variants, one devoid of Cys codons (Cys-less) and the other containing the active site cysteine as a sole cysteine (Cys-24 only). In both variants the native cysteines were replaced by serines. These two plasmids were used as reagents to construct two parallel sets of plasmids encoding BglF mutants with either single- or di-cysteines, respectively, each set comprising 36 mutants with Cys substitutions as specified under “Results.” All mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, which was carried out by overlap extension with PCR (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6869) Google Scholar). The mutations introduced or eliminated sites for restriction enzymes, which were useful during the screening for the mutant plasmids. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The bglF alleles encoding the single- and di-Cys variants were cloned in pET15b, to generate N-terminal His-tagged BglF variants. More details on plasmid constructions are available from the authors upon request. pZGM-B, obtained from G. Monderer-Rothkoff, was used for the expression of the bglB gene required for assaying salicin phosphotransfer. Induction of the bglB gene was achieved by the addition of 100 ng of anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride to the growth medium. β-Glucoside Phosphotransfer—To estimate qualitatively the ability of the BglF variants to transfer β-glucosides into the cells while phosphorylating them, HMS174(DE3) cells expressing the di-Cys BglF mutants were plated on MacConkey-arbutin and MacConkeysalicin plates. Utilization of the β-glucosides arbutin and salicin depended on the ability of the plasmid-encoded BglF variants to transport and phosphorylate these sugars, which were then cleaved by the products of the constitutively expressed chromosomal bglA gene and the plasmid-encoded bglB gene, respectively. Hence, the formation of red colonies on MacConkey-arbutin and MacConkeysalicin plates was indicative of the ability of the di-Cys BglF mutants to catalyze β-glucosides phosphotransfer. To estimate quantitatively the ability of the BglF variants to phosphotransfer β-glucosides, the assay described by Schaefler (21Schaefler S. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 254-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out with minor modifications. HMS174(DE3) cells expressing the di-Cys BglF mutants were grown in M63 minimal medium, supplemented with 0.4% succinate as a carbon source, at 37 °C. When cells reached A600 = 0.4-0.5, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 30 min, cultures were put on ice for 20 min, and their absorbance was measured (A600). Cells (1 ml) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.9 ml of 0.075 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgSO4. The reaction was started by adding 0.1 ml of the β-glucoside pNPG at a final concentration of 20 mm. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2 m Na2CO3. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the amount of p-nitrophenol was estimated by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. The units of enzyme activity were calculated using the following equation: units = (A410 × 1000)/(A600 × 1 ml × 10 min). Cysteine Accessibility to Thiol Reagents in Whole Cells—Cysteine accessibility to thiol reagents was assayed essentially as described by Ninio et al. (22Ninio S. Elbaz Y. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HMS174(DE3) cells expressing single- and di-Cys BglF variants were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. When cells reached A600 = 0.3, expression of the BglF variants was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 1.5 h, 4 aliquots of 1 ml of culture were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with Tris-NaCl buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5), pelleted again, and resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-NaCl buffer. Freshly made MTSET, MTSES, or MTSEA, at final concentrations of 1, 1, and 2.5 mm, respectively, were added, each to 1 aliquot. The fourth aliquot served as a control and hence was not treated with MTS reagents. After 10 min of incubation at either 25 or 4 °C, as indicated in the text, cells were pelleted, washed with Tris-NaCl buffer, and pelleted again. The cells were lysed by resuspending them in 100 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 50 μg/ml lysozyme and incubating them for 15 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 600 μl of 15 mm MgSO4 containing 5 μg/ml DNase, incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-NaCl buffer. Membranes were solubilized by the addition of DM to a final concentration of 0.8% and gentle rotation of the tubes for 15 min at room temperature. The BglF variant proteins were purified to near-homogeneity by using nickel-chelate chromatography as follows. To each aliquot, 300 μl of Tris-NaCl buffer containing 30 mm imidazole and 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (formerly washed twice with Tris-NaCl buffer and once with the Tris-NaCl buffer containing 0.08% DM and 30 mm imidazole) were added, and the tubes were rotated for 1 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed with denaturation buffer (Tris-NaCl buffer containing 6 m urea and 0.5% SDS), pelleted, and resuspended in 100 μl of denaturation buffer containing 0.25 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (5-FM, dissolved in Me2SO). Tubes were rotated for 20 min at room temperature, and excess of 5-FM was quenched by the addition of 300 μm denaturation buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 3 min. The beads were pelleted, and the His-tagged BglF proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 10 min at 30 °C in 28 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 0.07 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Following a short spin, samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescent profiles were recorded with ImageMaster VDS-CL imaging system (UV 312 nm, filter band pass 520 nm). The protein content in each lane was evaluated by staining the same gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The Coomassie-stained profile was recorded with ImageMaster VDS-CL imaging system (white light, no filter). The amounts of the fluorescent BglF bands were normalized to the amounts of the stained bands using the TINA 2.0 software. The percentage of labeling of each mutant protein with 5-FM after treatment with MTS reagents was assessed relative to the 5-FM labeling of the same protein that has not been treated with MTS reagents, which was defined as 100%. The percentage of inhibition of 5-FM labeling by the MTS reagents was calculated as 100% minus the percentage of 5-FM labeling. The results obtained with the untreated samples ruled out the possibility that free cysteines are oxidized in this procedure after cell lysis. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles with an Inside-out Orientation and Cys Accessibility Analyses—HMS174(DE3) cells expressing single-Cys BglF variants were grown and induced as described above, and inside-out (ISO) membrane vesicles were prepared essentially as described before (23Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm choline chloride, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 μg/μl DNase. The suspension was passed once through a French press cell operated at 10,000 pounds/square inch. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4 and 10% glycerol at a protein concentration of 15-20 mg/ml. ISO membranes were incubated for 2 min at 25 °C in Tris-NaCl buffer (see above) in the presence or absence of MTSET at a final concentration of 0.01 mm and washed twice with Tris-NaCl buffer. The BglF protein variants were purified and labeled with 5-FM as described above for whole cells. Membrane Topology Prediction Methods—Five topology prediction methods, TMHMM (24Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9433) Google Scholar), HMMTOP (25Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), MEMSAT (26Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), TOPPRED (27von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar), and PHD (28Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), were used in their single-sequence mode. All user-adjustable parameters were left at their default values. All these methods are available on-line. Prediction of Transmembrane Segments and Construction of Single- and Di-cysteine BglF Mutants—We used five topology prediction algorithms, HMMTOP, TMHMM, TOPRED, MEMSAT, and PHD (see “Experimental Procedures”), to predict the membrane topology of BglF (Fig. 1, first five lines). The extent of agreement between these frequently used prediction methods, provided by a simple “majority vote” approach, was shown to be a good indication for the reliability of the predicted topology of E. coli membrane proteins (29Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The consensus prediction approach was extended to also include cases where only part of the global topology was covered by the agreement (30Nilsson J. Persson B. Von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2974-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The five algorithms predicted that the C domain of BglF contains 7-12 transmembrane (TM) helices. As shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table I, the different methods give very similar predictions for the location of the first five TMs (five out of five for helices I, II, and IV and four out of five for helices III and V) and for the last TM (five out of five). The five methods also predicted the existence of two helices in the middle, with a high degree of agreement on their borders (designated i and ii in Fig. 1). It was argued that the fraction of correctly predicted topologies of E. coli inner membrane proteins is close to one when four or more of these methods agree (29Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We made use of these predictions to choose residues, which were predicted with a high degree of certainty to face either the cytoplasm or the periplasm, and others, on which there is no consensus between the predictions, and we mutated them to cysteines in a background of a Cys-less BglF derivative. In addition, we constructed variants that contain each of the native cysteines in BglF as a single cysteine, including one in the B domain and one in the linker connecting the C and A domains, which are presumed to be inside the cell. This collection of these single-Cys BglF variants was expected to provide useful tools for establishing the operational parameters for our experimental approach and for investigating the actual membrane topology of BglF.Table IPrediction of transmembrane helices in BglF The numbers correspond to amino acid positions in the BglF protein.HMMTOPTMHMMPHDhtmTOPPREDMEMSATThis work102–121100–119108–125100–120100–124100–117142–164139–161144–161140–160140–164144–161171–190168–190170–190172–190173–190211–230205–227209–227211–231203–227208–230245–264234–256246–265245–265244–264246–263273–292260–282286–304287–307273–293274–296299–320287–309300–317325–346324–346325–345324–345355–374353–373355–375383–400381–400385–402381–401383–399407–424404–424406–422413–430429–448426–448427–446429–449429–449437–454No. of TMs1210711128 Open table in a new tab All together, 36 single-Cys BglF derivatives (with single cysteines between positions 97 and 480) were engineered as histidine-tagged proteins. The expression of only one mutant, T130C, was not detected after affinity purification or metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine (not shown). All other 35 single-Cys mutants were expressed in levels comparable with wild-type BglF, with the exception of variants with single-Cys at positions 141, 297, 313, 433 and 434, which where produced at slightly reduced levels (50-70% of wild-type level) (not shown). All single-Cys BglF variants were found in the membrane fraction after cell fractionation (not shown). The collection of single-Cys BglF mutants, whose expression was detected, was used to study the topology of the membrane C domain by cysteine accessibility analyses, as described below. Because the BglF active site, which phosphorylates the incoming β-glucosides and the BglG protein and also accepts the phosphate from P-BglG, is a cysteine residue (Cys-24), single-Cys BglF mutants are not active. Hence, we constructed a parallel set of di-Cys mutants, each containing Cys-24, residing in the B domain, plus one of the 35 cysteines described above to test the effect of the cysteine substitution in the C domain on BglF activity. The pattern of expression of the di-Cys variants was the same as that of the single-Cys mutants (not shown). The protocol of chemical modification by thiol-specific reagents was repeated with the di-Cys mutants. Most significantly, the results obtained with the two sets of mutants led to the same conclusions, as detailed below, indicating that a replacement of Cys-24 in the B domain by a serine does not affect the arrangement of the BglF derivatives in the membrane. Catalytic Activities of the Cys-replacement BglF Mutants—We assayed the ability of the di-Cys BglF mutants, containing the active site cysteine in the hydrophilic B domain, and a single cysteine in the C domain, to catalyze the various activities of BglF, i.e. sugar phosphotransfer and BglG phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. As a preliminary qualitative assay for sugar phosphotransfer, cells expressing the different di-Cys BglF variants were grown on MacConkey indicator plates containing the β-glucoside salicin or arbutin. Cells expressing functional BglF proteins catalyze uptake of salicin and arbutin; subsequent metabolism of these sugars leads to acidification of the medium and the appearance of red colonies. Cells expressing inactive BglF mutants form white colonies on MacConkey salicin/arbutin plates, whereas mutants with an intermediate activity grow as pink colonies. Of the 35 di-Cys mutants, only one, in position 432, formed white colonies on the indicator plates, and five others gave pink colonies (Table II). All other mutants grew as red colonies, indistinguishable from cells expressing wild-type BglF or the variant containing Cys-24 as a single cysteine (Cys-24 only). Hence, we concluded that all the di-Cys mutants, excluding one, retained at least some ability to transport and phosphorylate β-glucosides.Table IIThe activity of di-Cys BglF variants as sugar phosphotransferases and as BglG-negative regulators The background for all di-Cys BglF proteins was a BglF variant containing the active site cysteine as a sole cysteine (Cys-24 only).BglF mutantsβ-Glucosides phosphotransferaSugar phosphotransfer was studied in strain HMS174(DE3), which carries a cryptic bgl operon on its chromosomeRegulation of BglG activity in vivobThe ability of di-Cys BglF variants to negatively regulate BglG activity, depending on β-glucoside addition to the growth medium, was assayed in MA200-1, which carries a bgl′-lacZ transcriptional fusion on its chromosome and a defective bglF genePhenotype on MacConkey-arbutin platesc0.5% arbutin or 0.4% salicin were added to the growth medium when indicatedPhenotype on MacConkey-salicin platesc0.5% arbutin or 0.4% salicin were added to the growth medium when indicated,dTo assay salicin phosphotransfer, pZGM-B encoding the bglB gene, whose product hydrolyzes phosphorylated salicin, was introduced into the cells% Activity in pNPC assayeActivity was calculated as following: (A410 × 1000)/(A600 × 1 ml × 10 min).

Unlike other end-joining reactions, signal joint formation is a specialized case of NHEJ that also requires the lymphoid-specific RAG proteins.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2520-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Coding joints are then formed by the imprecise fusion of coding ends, whereas signal joints are formed by joining signal ends without nucleotide loss or addition. Like other double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, repair of RAG1/2-induced breaks requires ubiquitously expressed factors of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway (6Rooney S. Chaudhuri J. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the repair phase of V(D)J recombination is a specialized case of NHEJ, where the repair of double-strand breaks is dependent not only on components of the NHEJ pathway but also on the RAG proteins themselves. Mutations in both RAG1 and RAG2 have been identified that interfere with V(D)J joining but not V(D)J cleavage in vivo and in vitro (7Qiu J.X. Kale S.B. Yarnell Schultz H. Roth D.B. Mol.

Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution of the joining phase of V(D)J recombination shows a dependence on RAG1 and RAG2 (11Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of the RAG proteins in the post-cleavage events of V(D)J recombination is not known, RAG1 and RAG2 do remain associated with the DNA ends in a stable, heparin-resistant, synaptic complex post-cleavage in vitro (12Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Hiom K. Gellert M.

A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, nuclease-resistant complexes containing the RAG proteins and cleaved signal ends have recently been isolated from mammalian cells (16Jiang H. Ross A.E. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8478-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the notion that, in addition to DNA cleavage functions, the RAG proteins play at least an architectural role in the joining phase of the reaction either by binding and aligning ends prior to joining, or by protecting ends from random nuclease digestion, or possibly by recruiting repair factors to the post-cleavage complex (10Tsai C. Drejer A.H. Schatz D.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently it has been suggested that in mammalian cells the RAG proteins may actually function post-cleavage as molecular shepherds that guide the repair of broken ends down the NHEJ pathway and away from inappropriate repair by homologous recombination (17Lee G.S. Neiditch M.B. Salus S.S. Roth D.B. Cell. 2004; 117: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to RAG1 and RAG2, at least four ubiquitously expressed factors are also known to be required for joining signal ends in mammalian cells: Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV. These factors and possibly others mediate the fusion of blunt signal ends to one another without loss or addition of nucleotides to create a precise signal joint (6Rooney S. Chaudhuri J. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Exactly how these factors facilitate signal joint formation has not been well defined, but biochemical activities for each of these proteins have been characterized. Ku70 and Ku80, which together compose the Ku heterodimer, bind DNA ends. The DNA end-binding activity of the Ku proteins may function to protect ends from degradation and may also function to recruit other NHEJ factors to the site of the double-strand break (18Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The joining of DNA ends requires DNA ligase IV, which physically interacts with XRCC4; the interaction with XRCC4 is thought to enhance the stability and activity of DNA ligase IV (19Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 20Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV are also necessary for the joining of coding ends, although the greater complexity of coding joint formation requires at least two additional factors: DNA-PKcs and Artemis (6Rooney S. Chaudhuri J. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Based on genetic and biochemical data, Artemis is thought to be responsible for the nucleolytic opening of hairpin coding ends (24Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 25Rooney S. Sekiguchi J. Zhu C. Cheng H. Manis J. Whitlow S. DeVido J. Foy D. Chaudhuri J. Lombard D.

Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Budding yeast also has an Artemis homologue (PSO2) (27Brendel M. Bonatto D. Strauss M. Revers L.F. Pungartnik C. Saffi J. Henriques J.A. Mutat. Res. 2003; 544: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which proves to be necessary either for the excision of the Activator/Dissociaters (Ac/Ds) transposable element or for processing of hairpin ends generated by Ac/Ds transposon excision (28Yu J. Marshall K. Yamaguchi M. Haber J.E. Weil C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1351-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additional factors are also likely to be involved in V(D)J joining but they await identification (29Dai Y. Kysela B. Hanakahi L.A. Manolis K. Riballo E. Stumm M. Harville T.O. West S.C. Oettinger M.A. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2462-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Three interesting candidates for involvement in the repair phase of V(D)J recombination are members of the MRN complex: Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1. The MRN complex is a nuclear protein complex that is thought to be intimately involved in sensing and signaling the presence of double-strand breaks in yeast and mammals (30Petrini J.H. Stracker T.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The complex has been implicated in an array of cellular responses involving the repair of double-strand breaks: homologous recombination, telomere length maintenance, cell cycle checkpoint signaling, and NHEJ (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (31D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). As discussed below, a variety of results from immunofluorescence studies in mammalian cells, genetic analyses in yeast, and biochemical investigations with purified proteins suggest that the MRN complex could potentially be involved in the repair of V(D)J intermediates. Studies in S. cerevisiae have demonstrated an absolute requirement for Mre11p, Rad50p, and the functional orthologue of Nbs1, Xrs2p, for NHEJ. Yeast strains with null mutations in any member of the complex are extremely sensitive to ionizing radiation and severely defective in DNA repair by NHEJ (32Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 33Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Nbs1 is found to localize to an actively recombining locus in developing thymocytes (34Chen H.T. Bhandoola A. Difilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Brown M.J. Tai X. Rogakou E.P. Brotz T.M. Bonner W.M. Reid T. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2000; 290: 1962-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the complex itself localizes to sites of DNA damage very rapidly after the damage is induced (35Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H.J. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). More recent work in mice with conditional null mutations in Nbs1 and in mammalian cells harboring hypomorphic mutations in members of the MRN complex indicate that the complex is involved in another recombination process that requires the repair of double-strand breaks, class switch recombination (36Kracker S. Bergmann Y. Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Christine R. Wang Z. Sperling K. Digweed M. Radbruch A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1584-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37Lahdesmaki A. Taylor A.M. Chrzanowska K.H. Pan-Hammarstrom Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16479-16487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Reina-San-Martin Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Difilippantonio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A number of biochemical experiments also suggest that the MRN complex is important for the joining of both compatible and incompatible ends. Purified Mre11 has 3′–5′-exonuclease activity and single-stranded endonuclease activity, which is necessary to facilitate the joining of incompatible ends in vitro (39Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 40Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.F. Lee E.Y.H.P. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, efficient joining of cohesive-ended DNA in vitro by the human Ku proteins, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV is dependent upon a cellular fraction containing Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (41Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings make the MRN complex an attractive candidate for involvement in V(D)J recombination. However, this has remained a controversial and open question. Studies in chicken cells and fission yeast have suggested that this complex may not be absolutely required for NHEJ in eukaryotes other than S. cerevisiae. Null mutations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe RAD50 and the S. pombe MRE11 homologue, RAD32, have wild-type levels of NHEJ activity in plasmid repair assays (42Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Studies in chicken MRE11–/–DT-40 cells engineered to carry a tetracycline-repressible chicken MRE11 transgene indicate that Mre11 repression does not interfere with Ku-dependent end-joining in this system (43Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita Y.M. Yagi T. Takata M. Price C. Kakazu N. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6619-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Moreover, hypomorphic mutations in any member of the complex do not appear to decrease V(D)J recombination frequencies in mammalian cells (44Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and conditional null NBS1 mutant mice have wild-type levels of mature B-cells (36Kracker S. Bergmann Y. Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Christine R. Wang Z. Sperling K. Digweed M. Radbruch A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2005; 102: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, assessing the involvement of the MRN complex in V(D)J recombination based on hypomorphic mutations has been difficult. Hypomorphic mutations in members of the MRN complex can result in reduced expression levels of the proteins and aberrant subcellular distribution, but they do not substantially interfere with MRN complex formation in vivo or DNA binding and exonuclease activity in vitro (44Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45171-45181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether the residual activity of these mutant proteins is facilitating V(D)J recombination in these cells. Moreover, hypomorphic mutations in Mre11 and Nbs1 are associated with an increased frequency of trans-rearrangements between T-cell receptor β and γ loci, indicating that mutations in members of MRN can ultimately result in aberrant V(D)J recombination reactions (48Theunissen J.W. Kaplan M.I. Hunt P.A. Williams B.R. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similar to studies utilizing hypomorphic mutations in members of the MRN complex, evaluating the role of the MRN complex in V(D)J recombination in conditional null Nbs1 mouse models is difficult. This is because conditional deletion of NBS1 is incomplete in these models (36Kracker S. Bergmann Y. Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Christine R. Wang Z. Sperling K. Digweed M. Radbruch A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1584-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Reina-San-Martin Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Difilippantonio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 51Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Melchers A. Lobitz S. Stockl L. Varon R. Herceg Z. Sperling K. Wang Z. Digweed M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), particularly in developing lymphocyte populations (51Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Melchers A. Lobitz S. Stockl L. Varon R. Herceg Z. Sperling K. Wang Z. Digweed M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the recombination that is occurring is being mediated by Nbs1 synthesized prior to disruption in these cells or in cells in which NBS1 has not yet been deleted. Although there is no specific block in B-cell development in one conditional null Nbs1 model (38Reina-San-Martin Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Difilippantonio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it is clear that the Nbs1 protein is still present even in the splenic B-cell population, albeit at lower levels. Moreover, in one conditional null Nbs1 mouse model at least 50% of Nbs1 null mutant cells are lost from the bone marrow and even more from the thymus (51Demuth I. Frappart P. Hildebrand G. Melchers A. Lobitz S. Stockl L. Varon R. Herceg Z. Sperling K. Wang Z. Digweed M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), indicating that Nbs1 null lymphocytes are unable to complete essential developmental processes, such as V(D)J recombination and/or DNA replication, and this ultimately results in cell death. Participation of the MRN complex in the resolution of V(D)J intermediates has been difficult to assess unequivocally because absolute null mutations in any member of the MRN complex in mammalian cells are lethal (hence the reliance on hypomorphic mutations and conditional null mutations in Nbs1). In S. cerevisiae however, strains with null mutations in MRE11, RAD50, or XRS2 are still viable (32Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 33Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Yeast can be induced to carry out V(D)J recombination by introducing the V(D)J recombinase (i.e. RAG1 and RAG2) and a recombination substrate (52Clatworthy A.E. Valencia M.A. Haber J.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As in mammalian cells, the signal joints formed in yeast are precise junctions and their formation is dependent on the yeast XRCC4 homologue, LIF1 (53Herrmann G. Lindahl T. Schar P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4188-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, the RAG proteins appear to play a role in the joining process in yeast, as they do in mammalian cells. Therefore, it is possible to test whether the MRX complex is required for this specialized form of double-strand break repair by examining signal joint formation in yeast. Here we show that signal joining in yeast is dependent on the same factors known to be required in mammalian cells. In addition, we find that the members of the yeast MRX complex, MRE11, RAD50, and XRS2, as well as the yeast-specific NHEJ factor, NEJ1 (54Ooi S.L. Shoemaker D.D. Boeke J.D. Science. 2001; 294: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 55Valencia M. Bentele M. Vaze M.B. Herrmann G. Kraus E. Lee S.E. Schar P. Haber J.E.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), are also necessary for precise signal joint formation. None of these factors are required for RAG-mediated transposition, an alternative fate of signal ends in yeast, although the loss of RAD50p affects the types of transposition products that are recovered. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains used in these experiments are described in Table I. Strains with disruptions in DNA repair genes were made by standard PCR-based gene replacement techniques. Strains MAV109, MAV134, MAV135-2, MAV144, MAV288, MAV312, MAV320, and MAV321 were derived from parental strain BY4704 by replacing the NEJ1, LIG4, YKU70, PSO2, RAD50, RAD52, MRE11, or XRS2 open reading frames, respectively, with the kanMX4 cassette. The resulting strains were then each transformed with the RAG expression plasmids pCCY3 and pCCY4 and the recombination substrate pACY16 creating the following: ACY176, ACY177, ACY211, ACY214, ACY195, ACY209, ACY197, ACY222, ACY199, ACY201, ACY220, ACY221, ACY212, ACY215, ACY213, and ACY217, respectively (Table I).Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceBY4704MATa ade2Δ::hisG his3Δ200 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 met15Δ0 trp1Δ6378Brachmann C.B.

Roughly one transposition product or signal joint is recovered per 2 million cells. Thus, a rough estimate of the frequency of transposition and signal joint formation in wild-type yeast is 5 × 10–7 per cell. This number differs from our previous report (49Maser R.S. Zinkel R. Petrini J.H. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) in which the frequency calculation was based on the number of events per μg of DNA as measured by A260. However, the A260 of yeast DNA preparations does not accurately reflect the amount of DNA present in the sample. 2K. Struhl, personal communication. The precision of signal joint formation was assessed by sequence analysis in all strains. Incidence of Transposition—The incidence of transposition in wild-type (ACY142 and ACY159) and NHEJ-disrupted strains (ACY195, -209, -174, -175, -176, -177, -211, -214, -212, -215, -199, -201, -213, and -217) was calculated by dividing the number of transposition products recovered by the number of nested PCRs performed for every induction in each strain (supplemental Fig. 1A). The mean incidence of transposition and the standard deviation from the mean was then calculated from the combined values for incidence of transposition per induction in each set of yeast strains (supplemental Fig. 1B).

However, little information exists about specific conformations of a receptor. We recently applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine distances from distinct points distributed over the surface and within the helical bundle of the cholecystokinin receptor to the amino terminus of a full agonist CCK analogue (Harikumar, K. G., Pinon, D. I., Wessels, W. S., Dawson, E. S., Lybrand, T. P., Prendergast, F. G., and Miller, L. J. (2004) Mol. Pharmacol. 65, 28–35). Here, we apply the same experimental strategy to determine distances from the same receptor positions to an analogous point at the amino terminus of structurally related partial agonist (Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]phenethyl ester) and antagonist (Alexa488-Gly-[(d-Trp31, Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]phenethyl ester) ligands. A high degree of spectral overlap and fluorescence transfer was observed for ligand-occupied fluorescent-tagged receptors with no transfer observed for the ligand-occupied pseudo-wild type null cysteine-reactive mutant receptor (C94S). For the partial agonist, calculated distances to receptor positions 94, 102, 204, and 341, representing sites within the helical confluence, and the first, second, and third loops, were 21 ± 0.4, 18 ± 0.4, 25 ± 1, and 17 ± 1 Å, not different from those measured previously for the analogous full agonist. For the antagonist, the analogous distances were 21 ± 2, 28 ± 2, 15 ± 1 and 21 ± 1 Å. Distances to the first and third loops were longer and the distance to the second loop was shorter for the antagonist relative to both the full and partial agonist probes, whereas all three probes demonstrated similar distances to the intrahelical reference point. This supports the possibilities of changes in the conformation of the probe and/or the receptor induced by structurally similar ligands having distinct intrinsic biological activities.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CCKR, type A cholecystokinin receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium; CCK, cholecystokinin; MTS, methanethiosulfonate. is a powerful biophysical tool to determine the distances between a donor and an acceptor (2Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). This methodology can be applied to distinct positions within a ligand and receptor as they exist within a molecular complex to elucidate spatial constraints. By utilizing ligands with distinct biological properties, stabilizing the receptor into fully active, partially active, and inactive conformations, this approach can be useful for the elucidation of the conformational changes that are associated with receptor activation. Recently, we utilized this technique to measure a series of intermolecular distances between a fixed point at the amino-terminal end of a CCK analogue that represents a full agonist and distinct points on the exposed surfaces of the CCK receptor (1Harikumar K.G.

This was accomplished by the individual introduction of reactive Cys residues at positions thought likely to accommodate this modification without having negative functional implications based on structure-activity relationships among structurally related receptors. This was fully validated (3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells expressing these receptor constructs were allowed to react with a cell-impermeant, fluorescent, thiol-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagent that was specially prepared (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescent donor was provided to the system in a highly specific way, taking advantage of the structural specificity of interaction between hormone and receptor, utilizing a fluorescent analogue of the natural peptide ligand of this receptor. A series of controls established that transfer only occurred between the receptor-bound ligand and the specific sites within the receptor (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S.

These have provided a workable model of the CCK-ligand-occupied type A CCK receptor as well as insights into the types of conformational changes that might occur upon receptor activation. The data in the current work provide the first quantitative measurements to be applied to these working models to help describe the details of the conformational changes that are associated with agonist-stimulated receptor activation and initiation of signaling. Materials—Synthetic CCK octapeptide (CCK-26–33, using the numbering convention based on the 33-residue CCK peptide first isolated from porcine duodenum) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). 2-Aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate hydrochloride was from Toronto Research Chemicals, (Ontario, Canada). Alexa488-N-hydroxysuccinimide and Alexa568-N-hydroxysuccinimide were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were analytical grade. Design and Preparation of Fluorescence Donors and Acceptors for FRET Studies—As we reported earlier in analogous agonist ligand studies of the same receptor, we chose Alexa488 incorporated into the ligand as donor and Alexa568-derivatized sites within the receptor as acceptors (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For this pair of fluorophores, adequate spectral overlap exists between donor emission and acceptor excitation for the demonstration and quantitation of distances less than 62 Å (distance at which 50% energy is transferred). CCK peptides derivatized with Alexa488 were chosen for this study rather than other previously described fluorescent derivatives of this hormone that utilize fluorophores such as acrylodan and nitrobenzoxadiazole because the latter have been shown to be quenched by KI much less effectively than the Alexa488, suggesting that they might not be optimal for FRET studies (7Harikumar K.G.

Like the previously studied CCK agonist analogue, the fluorescence donor was positioned at the amino terminus of the probes in position 24, with the partial agonist representing Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]phenethyl ester (Alexa488-partial agonist) and antagonist representing Alexa488-Gly-[(d-Trp31,Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]phenethyl ester (Alexa488-antagonist) (Fig. 1). These peptides were synthesized and purified to homogeneity in our laboratory, as we described previously (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The parental peptides each have a single reactive amino group, which could be derivatized in solution with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Alexa488. These fluorescent peptides were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC using a C-18 column and were characterized by mass spectrometry. Previous structure-activity studies have shown that the amino terminus of these peptides can tolerate such a modification (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The antagonist fluorescent probe was recently shown to bind specifically and saturably to the CCK receptor and to inhibit the CCK-stimulated increase in intracellular calcium (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The acceptor Alexa568 was covalently attached to specifically engineered Cys residues present within the ectodomain of the CCK receptor. These were prepared by the reaction of a thiol-reactive fluorescent MTS reagent (Alexa568-MTS) with intact cells previously prepared to express a series of pseudo-wild type CCK receptor constructs with each having a single reactive Cys residue in a distinct receptor ectodomain (3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar). These monoreactive receptor constructs were previously characterized and validated as being fully biologically active (3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol-reactive fluorescent reagent was prepared by acylation of the free amino group of 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate hydrochloride with Alexa568-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, as we reported previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Of note, these receptor constructs were also truncated to eliminate the first 30 residues of the amino-terminal tail region, known to have no functional influence on peptide ligand binding or biological activity (3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar) and believed to act as a cover of the peptide-binding cleft (8Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing each of the relevant CCK receptor constructs, representing the null Cys-reactive pseudo-wild type (C94S) and the series of monoreactive pseudo-wild type receptors, have been previously prepared and characterized (3Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Schuetz M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 83-91PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone-2 (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were passaged approximately two times/week. Fluorescent Labeling of Intact Cells—The procedure utilized for the fluorescent labeling of the receptor-bearing cells was identical to that reported previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were detached from the flasks using non-enzymatic cell dissociation medium (Sigma). Intact cells were incubated with 1 μm Alexa568-MTS reagent for 20 min at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Unreacted Alexa568-MTS reagent was removed by centrifugation and repeated washing. Labeled cells were then incubated with 25 nm Alexa488-partial agonist or Alexa488-antagonist for 2 h at 4 °C in KRH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Temperature control was critical to ensure absence of internalization of receptor-bound ligand. Unbound ligand in the medium was subsequently removed by centrifugation and repeated washing with iced buffer, and the cells were suspended in ice-cold KRH medium for FRET studies. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state fluorescence was recorded using a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorophotometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) at 25 °C using intact cells in suspension in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Multiple fluorescence spectra were accumulated after excitation at 482 nm, with the emission spectra collected from 490 to 700 nm using an integral of 0.3 s/nm. Unlabeled CHO cells not expressing this receptor were used to control for background fluorescence and light scattering, and these data were subtracted from those collected under experimental conditions. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—FRET studies were carried out using the procedure that we validated previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, the critical distance (Ro) represents a constant that is characteristic of the donor-acceptor pair being utilized and corresponds to the distance at which transfer efficiency is 50% between the donor (Alexa488-ligands) and acceptor (Alexa568-CCK receptor). This was calculated using the Förster equation (2Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 9Lakowicz J.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1980; 2: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar),Ro=9786(Jn−4κ2QD)1/6Åeq.1 A value of 1.4 was used for n, the refractive index of aqueous medium. κ2 is a geometric factor describing the relative orientation of the transition dipole of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. If donor and/or acceptor are able to exhibit isotropic, dynamic orientation within the time scale of the fluorescence lifetime of the probes, then this orientation factor converges toward a value of ⅔. Support for this assignment comes from our previously published reports of evidence for rotational freedom of the receptor-bound agonist and antagonist probes (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and from our unpublished data for the partial agonist probe. The receptor-bound probes exhibited steady-state fluorescence anisotropy under the conditions of the FRET assay (room temperature) of 0.04, 0.05, and 0.12 for the agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist probes, respectively. Additional support for this comes from rotational correlation times (φ) for the receptor-bound agonist (fast component 0.36 ns, slow component 34 ns), partial antagonist (0.32 and 49.1 ns, respectively), and antagonist (0.30 and 55.6 ns, respectively). QD is the quantum yield for fluorescence of the donor in the absence of acceptor. Quantum yields were measured for the antagonist and partial agonist probes in solution by comparing their emission intensities with those of sodium fluorescein in 0.1 n NaOH, where it has a standard quantum yield value of 0.92. Values for quantum yield of both Alexa488-ligands in solution were 0.60. Direct measurement of the quantum yields of the receptor-bound probes was also performed. For this, a plasma membrane-enriched particulate fraction of the CHO-CCKR cells was utilized. Membranes (50 μg) were incubated with a 10 nm fluorescent probe for 20 min at 25 °C. At that point, free probe was removed from the membrane-bound probe by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C and washing with iced KRH buffer. Fluorescence emission spectra between 500 and 600 nm were collected after excitation at 482 nm. In a second identical tube, probe-bound membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 1 μm non-fluorescent peptide, and the fluorescence spectra were similarly acquired. To be certain that this incubation with excess non-fluorescent ligand was able to dissociate the fluorescent ligand from the receptor, another identical tube was similarly treated, but rather than acquire the fluorescence spectra of the entire contents, the membranes and supernatant were separated by centrifugation, and both were separately evaluated. Indeed, quantitation of the fluorescence in the membranes represented only 4–5% of the membrane-bound fluorescence at the start of the competition. Similarly, the supernatant was shown to contain 90–91% of the membrane-bound fluorescence at the start of the competition. This established the validity of the comparison of quantum yields of the receptor-bound probe relative to that of the dissociated probe free in solution. The quantum yields of the receptor-bound partial agonist and antagonist probes were 95 and 96% of the values measured in solution. Thus, the quantum yields were 0.58 for both receptor-bound probes. These values were utilized for calculations. J is the integral of the spectral overlap between donor emission (F(λ)) and acceptor absorbance (∈(λ)) spectra. It was calculated by the following equation,J=∫F(λ)∈(λ)λ4dλ/∫F(λ)dλeq.2 where λ is the wavelength in cm, F(λ) is the normalized and integrated fluorescence of the donor at wavelength λ, and ∈(λ) is acceptor absorption in absorbance units at wavelength λ for the overlapping area. The efficiency of fluorescence energy transfer (E) was calculated by the fractional decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the donor (D) in approximation with the acceptor (A),E=1−FDA/FDeq.3 where FDA and FD are the fluorescence intensities of the donor (Alexa488-ligands) in the absence and presence of the acceptor (Alexa568-CCK receptor). A series of controls was used. These included the addition of 100-fold molar excess of non-fluorescent CCK competitor, the use of cell lines expressing a null-reactive CCK receptor, and the use of the parental CHO cell line that does not express the CCK receptor at all. These were exposed to the standard labeling procedure using the fluorescent reagent, and they were subsequently incubated with the fluorescent donor ligand. The efficiency of FRET is dependent on the inverse sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor (2Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Using the calculated efficiency of transfer, E, the average proximal distance, R, between donor and acceptor was calculated by the equation,R=Ro[(1−E)/E]1/6Åeq.4 where Ro is the distance between donor and acceptor with an efficiency of energy transfer of 50%. Development and Characterization of Receptor Probes—The fluorescent partial agonist probe, Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–32]phenethyl ester, was synthesized and purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase HPLC. Its structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The analogous fluorescent antagonist and agonist probes have previously been prepared and characterized (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S.

This partial agonist probe was found to bind to the CCK receptor specifically and saturably (Ki value 73 ± 10 nm), with affinity approximately an order of magnitude lower than its non-fluorescent analogue (Ki value 3.4 ± 0.2 nm) (Fig. 2). The ability of this probe to stimulate intracellular calcium was monitored as an indication of its predicted partial agonist status. As expected, it was able to stimulate a submaximal intracellular calcium response in CCK receptor-bearing CHO-CCKR cells that was similar to its non-fluorescent analogue (even though the highest concentrations could not be achieved with the fluorescent probe) (Fig. 2). Preparation of Donor and Acceptor for FRET Studies—Key for the success of this experimental strategy is the lack of interference by non-receptor-bound fluorescence donor and fluorescence acceptor that might be attached to membrane proteins other than the receptor of interest. Critical to the success of this type of experiment is the spatial approximation between the fluorophore within the receptor-bound ligand and the fluorophore labeling of the receptor itself, while other positions of potential donor and acceptor molecules would be too far away from each other to induce significant energy transfer. Controls for each of these conditions were performed previously (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and were once again included here. Shown in Fig. 3 are the fluorescence emission spectra of the donor and acceptor. The fluorescence donor peptide demonstrated peak emission at 518 nm after excitation at 482 nm. The fluorescence acceptor demonstrated peak emission at 603 nm after excitation at 578 nm with minimal emission at this wavelength after it was excited at 482 nm. When these reagents were in appropriate spatial approximation with each other (50% energy transfer at 62 Å) in the receptor-bearing cellular system, energy transfer from donor to acceptor could be observed (Fig. 4). Here, emission is demonstrated at 603 nm after excitation at 482 nm. No such energy transfer was observed when receptor occupation with the fluorescent ligand was blocked by saturation of the normal ligand-binding site with non-fluorescent CCK (Fig. 4, left panel) or when the experiment was performed with non-receptor-bearing parental CHO cells or with the null Cys-reactive pseudo-wild type CCK receptor-bearing CHO cell line (C94S) (Fig. 4, right panel).Fig. 4Fluorescence emission spectra when donor and acceptor are in the same cellular context. CHO cell lines expressing a representative monoreactive CCK receptor construct (T341C) (left panel) and the null cysteine-reactive CCK receptor construct (C94S) (right panel) were treated with the Alexa568-MTS reagent and subsequently allowed to bind fluorescent Alexa488-antagonist ligand as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then excited by light at 482 nm, and their emission spectra were collected. Both cellular systems demonstrated the expected emission maximum at 518 nm. However, only the monoreactive construct also demonstrated significant emission at 603 nm, reflecting energy transfer. This emission was substantially blocked by competing for receptor occupation with the fluorescent ligand by using a saturating concentration (1 μm) of nonfluorescent CCK in the incubation (left panel). Also shown is the same experiment performed with non-receptor-bearing CHO cells, demonstrating an absence of significant emission at 603 nm (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A significant fluorescence energy transfer signal was observed between Alexa488-labeled antagonist and partial agonist when bound to the monoreactive Cys mutant CCK receptor constructs that had been derivatized with Alexa568-MTS. These include CCK receptor constructs that had been labeled at position 94 within the second transmembrane segment, position 102 (N102C) within the first extracellular loop, position 204 (A204C) within the second extracellular loop, and position 341 (T341C) within the third extracellular loop. The profile of fluorescence emission shown in the left panel of Fig. 4 is representative of experiments with each of these constructs and with each of these probes. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The extent of spectral overlap was calculated for each of the monoreactive CCK receptor constructs, which are listed in Table I. For the fluorescent antagonist the highest degree of spectral overlap was observed for position 204 within the CCK receptor, whereas for the fluorescent partial agonist the highest degree of spectral overlap was observed for positions 102 and 341 within the receptor. The efficiency of energy transfer and the corrected distances were calculated for both antagonist and partial agonist probes and are illustrated in Table II.Table IMeasured distances and spectral overlap between donor Alexa488-ligands and acceptor Alexa568-CCK receptor constructsCCK receptor mutantRoJ × 10-15 cm3m-1ÅFluorescent partial agonist donorC9421 ± 11.3 ± 0.1N102C18 ± 10.4 ± 0.1A204C26 ± 14 ± 1.0T341C17 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1Fluorescent antagonist donorC9423 ± 22 ± 1N102C29 ± 29 ± 2A204C18 ± 10.4 ± 0.1T341C22 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IIEfficiency of energy transfer and the proximal distance between donor Alexa488-ligands and acceptor Alexa568-CCK receptor constructsCCK receptor mutantEfficiencyR%ÅFluorescent partial agonist donorC9455 ± 221 ± 0.4N102C53 ± 118 ± 0.4A204C57 ± 225 ± 1T341C50 ± 417 ± 1Fluorescent antagonist donorC9457 ± 421 ± 2N102C55 ± 228 ± 2A204C74 ± 115 ± 1T341C55 ± 221 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Current understanding of the active and inactive conformations of members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily is quite limited. Our best insights have come from rhodopsin, for which a high-resolution crystal structure is available for the inactive state (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.Le. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Exposure to light cracks those crystals as a result of a conformational change, but the details of that conformation have not been clearly defined. Other biophysical studies with the same receptor and with the β2-adrenergic receptor, including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, alterations in cysteine accessibility, and use of engineered zinc-binding sites, have provided insights into the types of conformational changes believed to correlate with receptor activation (11Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Lin S. Gether U. Kobilka B.K.

These have suggested that there is movement of the third and sixth transmembrane segments, with the cytoplasmic ends of these two helices close together in the inactive state and released to move apart in the active state. A counterclockwise rotation of the sixth transmembrane segment (when viewed from the extracellular side of the membrane) has also been predicted (14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The rhodopsin structure has provided a good template for the confluence of helices for Class I G protein-coupled receptors. However, there are strong data to suggest that even this is not relevant to the Class II G protein-coupled receptors (15Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that the loop and tail domains of rhodopsin are not relevant even to other members of the Class I family (6Ding X.Q. Pinon D.I. Furse K.E. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The helical bundle pattern of rhodopsin has provided particularly useful insights into the structure of biogenic amine receptors in the Class I family (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.Le. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Complementary studies with photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis have supported such structural predictions. We have been particularly interested in the CCK receptor that represents a peptide receptor within the Class I family of G protein-coupled receptors. Extensive structure-activity insights for both CCK and its receptor, photoaffinity labeling data using probes throughout the pharmacophoric domain, and fluorescence studies have all resulted in a molecular model of the agonist-bound active conformation of this receptor that has a helical bundle region quite analogous to that of rhodopsin (1Harikumar K.G.

Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Indeed, the root mean square deviation of the backbone of residues within the helices was found to be only 2.5 Å (6Ding X.Q. Pinon D.I. Furse K.E. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clearly, the least well defined portions of this receptor represent the loop and tail domains. The first real insights into the conformations of the external loop and tail domains of the CCK receptor came from our recent work that utilized FRET of the active conformation of this receptor occupied by a full agonist ligand (1Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The current report extends those insights quite substantially by including the partial agonist- and antagonist-occupied CCK receptor that, for purposes of functional coupling with heterotrimeric G proteins, must be in distinct conformations. For purposes of interpretation of the results with these additional probes that possess distinct biological activities, it is important to understand the degree of similarity or difference in their position of docking to the CCK receptor. These probes have similar primary structures, sharing the critical amino acid functional groups that have been shown to be responsible for the specificity of CCK receptor binding, pointing toward similarity in the position of their docking to this receptor. Additional support for similar docking comes from photoaffinity labeling studies in which the same segment of the CCK receptor was covalently labeled by each of three analogous photolabile probes, with sites of covalent attachment through a benzoyl phenylalanine at position 24, the same position as that of the fluorescence indicator in the probes used in the current work (16Dong M. Ding X.Q. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Oda R.P. Landers J.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4778-4785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For still further validation of the similarity of the docking of these probes and for purposes of registration, in the current work all three of these structurally similar ligands resulted in a fixed distance measured between the fluorophore at the amino terminus of the probes at position 24 and receptor residue 94 within the intramembranous region of helix two. It is quite interesting that the partial agonist-occupied receptor resulted in FRET distances that were not different from those of the full agonist probe except for a slightly longer distance to the second loop residue. This suggests that there were, indeed, subtle differences from the fully active to the partially active conformation of this receptor. This could certainly result in different coupling to a distinct G protein or different kinetics of coupling with the same G protein. Either of these approaches could provide enough of a difference to explain the distinct biology of this partial agonist ligand. There were very significant differences in the distances to the first and second loop residues measured for the antagonist-occupied inactive conformation of the CCK receptor. The change in the distance to the first loop might be consistent with the movement of the third transmembrane segment that has been proposed previously (11Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Lin S. Gether U. Kobilka B.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14445-14451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), with this segment serving as one of the anchors of this loop. The movement of the sixth transmembrane segment could be expected to affect the third loop distance, and although this was indeed different in the active and inactive states, it was not a marked difference. The major change in the second loop distance is perhaps the most interesting and hardest to explain at the current time. Movements in the transmembrane segments (four and five) that anchor this loop have not been prominently described in previous studies. Also, this loop is the longest of the three extracellular loops in the CCK receptor (lengths of the first, second, and third extracellular loops of the CCK receptor are predicted to be ∼15, 28, and 12 residues, respectively). Therefore, it would not be expected to have its conformation markedly affected by movement of those helices, and conversely, its movement might not be expected to easily exert tension upon the helical segments. We recently studied the fluorescence properties of a series of fluorescent agonist probes of the CCK receptor as bound to this receptor (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using manipulations of the G protein-coupling interface, we were able to demonstrate that receptor activation results in the fluorophore moving into a more exposed, hydrophilic environment that is more amenable to quenching by iodide and also shows a lower anisotropy and a shorter lifetime (7Harikumar K.G.

This movement was confirmed in analogous studies using a fluorescent antagonist probe (7Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.L. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite the design of the current studies, utilizing probes with distinct biological characteristics representing full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist, with shared functionalities for similar receptor docking and sharing the positions of the fluorescence donor (position 24), the possibility (and even the likelihood) of distinct conformations of the probes adds a variable to the interpretation of the results. We know from a very recent report from this laboratory (17Arlander S.J.H. Dong M. Ding X.Q. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that the established spatial approximation between the tyrosine sulfate in position 27 of the agonist ligand and receptor residue Arg197 (within the second extracellular loop) is not present in the inactive complex occupied by the peptide antagonist. Like the FRET distances reported here, that could reflect either (or both) changes in ligand conformation or changes in receptor conformation. We expect that both are relevant. Because of the degrees of freedom contributed by ligand and receptor conformation, we have not proposed a distinct conformational model for the inactive antagonist-occupied complex. A meaningful model for such a complex will require additional experimentally derived constraints. However, the distances provided in the current report clearly help move closer to this goal.

In addition, the present study confirms the co-existence of surrogate λ and κ receptors that are proposed to work in concert to promote B lymphocyte maturation. The remarkable diversity of the eukaryotic genome stems from the distinct expression patterns of genes in different tissues. Whereas some gene products are required for basal cell functions and are constitutively expressed by most cells, a restricted transcription and translation dictate tissue- and cell-specific functions. For instance, the expression of antigen (Ag) 1The abbreviations used are: Ag, antigen; RT, reverse transcriptase; IP, immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; μHC, μ heavy chain; SLC, surrogate light chain. 1The abbreviations used are: Ag, antigen; RT, reverse transcriptase; IP, immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; μHC, μ heavy chain; SLC, surrogate light chain. receptor genes is developmentally controlled, and it is exclusive of the immune cells. A problem with such restriction, as experienced by the adaptive immune system in mammals, is the requirement of a broad repertoire of Ag receptor genes that surpasses the encoded capacity of the genome (1Yang X.O. Doty R.T. Hicks J.S. Willerford D.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, nature has tailored gene rearrangement mechanisms to circumvent the diversity constraints of the Ag receptor loci and to ensure a large repertoire of Ag specificities (2Chen J. Alt F.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Rajewsky K. Nature. 1996; 381: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 4Sleckman B.P. Gorman J.R. Alt F.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Indeed, the paired variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) protein sequences that furnish Ag specificity are encoded by distinct gene segments, which in their germline configuration are distantly separated and cannot produce a contiguous transcript. Thus, during gene rearrangement, B and T lymphocyte progenitor/precursors use one of the many V, D, and J segments that are distantly clustered, in a manner that results in a clonally unique Ag-binding sequence (5Tonegawa S.

Although V[D]J rearrangement can be accomplished by both B and T lymphocytes (10Oltz E.M. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), B cells rearrange the immunoglobulin (Ig) Ag receptor (BCR) genes, and T cells rearrange T cell receptor (TCR) genes.Whereas the transcription of unrearranged/germline Ig-like genes has long emerged as a major function by which progenitor and precursor lymphoid cells can regulate V[D]J rearrangement (11Frances V.

Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it was prematurely concluded that the expression of germline Ig genes was sterile and limited to transcription, with no other function than promoting chromatin changes and gene loci accessibility. However several studies in B lymphocytes have demonstrated that Ig gene rearrangement is initiated by signals that are driven through the λ-like PreB cell receptor, which is formed by the μ heavy chain (μHC) in conjunction with unrearranged/germline surrogate light chains (SLC) λ5 and VpreB (13Karasuyama H.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 6286-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that other germline PreB receptor molecules, which functioned similarly to the λ5 and VpreB proteins, could take over to back-up PreB receptor function (18Kitamura D. Kudo A. Schaal S. Muller W. Melchers F. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1992; 69: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In line with this prediction, a surrogate Jκ-Cκ (SJCκ) germline transcript, encoding a protein with the capacity to covalently associate with μHC at the surface of Pro/PreB cells, was identified and characterized as a candidate to form the alternative κ-like PreB receptor (11Frances V.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5937-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).As the λ5 PreB receptor is formed by μHC, λ5, and VpreB, we postulated that by analogy, the κ PreB receptor should be constituted by μHC, SJCκ, and a putative Vκ-like molecule (11Frances V.

The use of poly(A)+ RNA as a template and oligo d(T) as a primer in the RT reaction was aimed at preventing PCR amplifications originating from potential genomic DNA contaminants. A total of 2 μl of RT reaction product was amplified through 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) using a previously described method (11Frances V. Pandrau-Garcia D. Guret C. Ho S. Wang Z. Duvert V. Saeland S. Martinez-Valdez H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5937-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the Expand™ High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The 5′ forward primers are consensus oligonucleotides covering each of the known LVκ gene families (24, Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Teid-Miller, M., Perry, H. M., and Gottesman, K. S. (1987) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed.Google Scholar). The 3′ reverse primer was either a germline consensus sequence at the heptamer/spacer/nonamer segment or an oligonucleotide designed from the Cκ region (24, Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Teid-Miller, M., Perry, H. M., and Gottesman, K. S. (1987) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed.Google Scholar).Normal Bone Marrow Pro/PreB—The RT-PCR analysis was carried out as mentioned above except that the forward (5′) and reverse (3′) primers were based on the cloned full-length Vκ4-like cDNA.cDNA Construction and AnalysisGeneration and screening of the pre-ALP cDNA library was carried out by using the λ-ZAP system (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) as previously reported (11Frances V. Pandrau-Garcia D. Guret C. Ho S. Wang Z. Duvert V. Saeland S. Martinez-Valdez H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5937-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the RT-PCR-generated germline Vκ cDNA probes. Sequencing was carried out by automated DNA sequencing (The University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center DNA sequencing core facility).ImmunoprecipitationFor immunoprecipitation, 2 × 107 cells were lysed and precipitated with anti-IgM or anti-Vκ-like antibodies. To assess the molecular association of the μHC with the Vκ-like molecule, we performed IPs using 2 mg of protein lysates of Blin-1 or freshly isolated normal ProB/PreB cells. The immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-IgM monoclonal antibodies coupled to agarose beads (Sigma) and anti-Vκ-like antibodies. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the anti-Vκ-like antibodies were pulled-down using protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). The IgM and Vκ-like immunocomplexes were extensively washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and analyzed by Western blots.Western BlottingImmunoblotting analyses were carried out following SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) using a commercial electrotransfer system (Bio-Rad) according to the supplier's protocol. Reactivity to Vκ moieties was determined by the binding of the antipeptide sera p42–58, which reacts with the variable κ domain, and pGL121–142, which specifically targets the germline Vκ molecule. Reactivity to p42–58 was directly tested by Western blotting without a precipitation step. To enhance the specificity toward Ig complexes, western binding to pGL121–142 was preceded by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with either protein A (known to bind Ig Fc domain) or anti-μHC + protein A. Western blots were revealed by autoradiography (15 min) after the chemiluminescence reaction, using the SuperSignal™ West Pico Chemiluminescent System (Pierce).Flow CytometryVκ-like-enriched normal ProB/PreB cells (Fig. 6a), were multi-parametrically stained with the following antibodies: CD19 Tricolor, and CD10 APC (Caltag Labs, Burlingame, CA); CD34 PE-Cy7 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA); custom-produced affinity-purified rabbit-anti Vκ (pGL121–142, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Montgomery, TX), followed by goat anti-rabbit-FITC (Caltag); mouse anti-human IgM (BD Pharmigen, San Diego, CA), followed by an anti-mouse-FITC (Caltag). Cells were selectively gated for the Vκ-like or IgM-expressing cells and subsequently phenotyped for CD34, CD19, and CD10. The phenotype analysis was carried out on a Moflo flow cytometer (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser (Enterprise II, Coherent Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and a 647-nm Argon/Krypton laser (Innova 70 Spectrum, Coherent). Individually stained control cells were used to set the compensation. 500,000 events were acquired for the final analysis.Surface Staining, Enzymatic Amplification, and Flow CytometryAn enzymatic amplification staining (EAS) kit (FlowAmp Systems, Ltd.) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 Blin-1 cells were washed with staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4; 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% sodium azide). Cells were then reacted with the pGL121–142 antibody (1.0 μg/106 cells) at 4 °C for 20 min in 50 μl of staining buffer. The reaction was followed by two 2.0-ml washes with staining buffer, and the cell pellets were subsequently reacted by incubating them at 4 °C for 20 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit second antibody (diluted 1:100) in 50 μl of staining buffer. Cells were subsequently washed at least three times with sodium azide-free staining buffer. After a thorough cell washing to remove the sodium azide, cells were exposed to the EAS amplifier reagent (diluted 1:20) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by a 10-min incubation with the detector reagent (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin, diluted 1:100) at room temperature. Surface anti-Vκ-like reactivity was detected by flow cytometry in an Epics Profile analyzer (Beckman/Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA).Fluorescence Surface StainingNormal ProB/PreB and Blin-1 cells were washed with PBS, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to stain the nuclei. Alternatively, nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 marker (Molecular Probes). Typically, 1–5 × 104 cells were cytocentrifuged onto microscope slides. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 5% goat sera and 2% fetal bovine serum for 1.0 h at room temperature. After the blocking of nonspecific sites, cells were washed three times with PBS and simultaneously reacted overnight at 4 °C in a humidity chamber with anti-μH and the pGL121–142 antibodies in PBS + 2% fetal bovine serum. After the overnight incubation cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and simultaneously stained in the dark for 1.0 h at room temperature with Alexa488 (green fluorescence)-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa594 (red fluorescence)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes). Unbound antibody was removed by three washes with PBS, universal mount was added (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), and coverslips were applied. Surface anti-μHC and anti-Vκ-like reactivity was analyzed by three-channel (green, red, and blue fluorescence) confocal microscopy (Olympus 1X71; PMT 0–900 V; Scan speed 0.005184 s/line). Alternatively, images were captured or standard fluorescence microscopy.RESULTSGermline Vκ Transcription—As previously reported, (11Frances V. Pandrau-Garcia D. Guret C. Ho S. Wang Z. Duvert V. Saeland S. Martinez-Valdez H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5937-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) the PreB acute lymphocytic leukemia (PreB ALL) cell line PreALP (26Pandrau D. Frances V. Martinez-Valdez H. Pages M.P. Manel A.M. Philippe N. Banchereau J. Saeland S. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 635-642PubMed Google Scholar) has both κ and λ gene loci in germline configuration but expresses germline Ig κ light chain (LC) transcripts. To determine whether PreALP does express germline Vκ transcripts, RT-PCR analysis was designed to specifically target germline sequences. Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from either PreALP or mature B cell lines by standard methods and converted into cDNA. PCR reactions were carried out using forward 5′ degenerate Vκ leader (LVκ) oligonucleotide primers in combination with consensus reverse 3′ primers, spanning a sequence from the germline heptamer/spacer/nonamer region (Fig. 1a). The degeneracy of the designed primers allows comprehensive coverage of the known Vκ (LVκ 1–6) gene families (24, Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Teid-Miller, M., Perry, H. M., and Gottesman, K. S. (1987) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, a 360-bp germline Vκ transcript was detected in the RT-PCR reactions in which degenerate primers from the LVκ3 and LVκ5 gene family pools were used. To rule out the germline Vκ transcription as an isolated phenomenon of the cell line PreALP, RT-PCR experiments were carried out with the cell line Blin-1, also known to express germline Vκ transcripts (27Martin D. Huang R.Q. LeBien T. Van Ness B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As also shown in Fig. 1a, a comparable amplification of the 360-bp germline Vκ transcript was obtained with Blin-1 and PreALP mRNAs, thus ruling out a PreALP cell line idiosyncrasy.Fig. 1Germline Vκ transcription by RT-PCR. a, depicts the PCR strategy and the results for the amplification of germline Vκ transcripts, using RT-generated cDNA templates from the PreB ALL cell line PreALP (26Pandrau D. Frances V. Martinez-Valdez H. Pages M.P. Manel A.M. Philippe N. Banchereau J. Saeland S. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 635-642PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ forward primers are consensus oligonucleotides covering each of the known leader Vκ (LVκ 1–6) gene families (24, Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Teid-Miller, M., Perry, H. M., and Gottesman, K. S. (1987) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed.Google Scholar). The 3′ reverse primer was a germline consensus sequence, spanning a region at the heptamer/spacer/nonamer segment. The numbers 1–6 shown in each reaction lane represent the corresponding LVκ 1–6 (the respective primer sequences have been previously reported) (27Martin D. Huang R.Q. LeBien T. Van Ness B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lanes 7 and 8 show a comparative RT-PCR amplification of the germline Vκ mRNA between the two PreB ALL cell lines PreALP and Blin-1, in which an equimolar 5′ forward LVκ 1–6 primer mix were used in combination with the 3′-reverse germline primer. b, shows the RT-PCR scheme and results for the detection of rearranged κLC transcripts, using mRNA purified from the PreB ALL cell line PreALP (lanes 1–7) and the mature B cell lines Daudi (lane 8), and B207 (lane 9). The 5′ forward primers are also the consensus oligonucleotides covering each of the known leader Vκ (LVκ 1–6) sequences, which were used in combination with an oligonucleotide designed from the constant κ (Cκ) region. Lane 7 in panel b represents an equimolar mixture of the 5′ LVκ primers used in combination with the 3′ Cκ primer. Controls for the compatibility of LVκ mix and Cκ primers that were used for the amplification of rearranged κLC transcripts are presented in lanes 8 and 9, in which mRNA from mature Daudi and B207 cell lines was efficiently amplified. The random appearance of RT-PCR fragments below the predicted 360- or 450-bp products result from secondary RNA structures that are incompletely reverse-transcribed (Frances et al. unpublished data).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether the PreALP cells have spontaneously undergone LC rearrangement, by testing the expression of rearranged Vκ-transcripts. To that end, RT-PCR experiments were carried, using the forward (5′) LVκ primer pool in combination with a reverse (3′) Cκ region primer. Fig. 1b shows that whereas the mature B cells Daudi and B207 expressed the expected 450-bp rearranged Vκ transcripts, PreALP routinely lacked conventional κLC expression.Cloning and Sequencing of Full-length Germline Vκ cDNA—The germline Vκ expression revealed by RT-PCR amplification depicted transcripts that could be assigned to distinct LVκ gene families. Namely, one strong and predominant amplified with degenerate primer pools that related to the gene family Vκ3 and a weaker one, whose amplifying primers related to the gene family Vκ5 (Fig. 1a). Although the primer pools (LVκ 1–6 in Fig. 1a) do correspond to bona fide LVκ genes (24, Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Teid-Miller, M., Perry, H. M., and Gottesman, K. S. (1987) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed.Google Scholar), the degeneracy of the oligonucleotides could result in cDNA amplifications with LVκ gene family overlap. Therefore, the identity of the transcript encoding the putative Vκ-like molecule could only be established by the cloning and sequencing of the full-length germline Vκ cDNA. In keeping with this rationale, a cDNA library that originated from the cell line PreALP was screened, using an equimolar ratio of the RT-PCR-generated Vκ3 and Vκ5-like cDNA probes. A single cDNA of 700 bp was identified, cloned, and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 180 amino acids that predicted a polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 19 kDa (Fig. 2).Fig. 2The Vκ-like amino acid sequence. A PreALP cDNA library was constructed and screened using the PCR-generated (gel-purified) germline Vκ probes. The cDNA sequence is identical to the one previously reported by Thompson et al. (22Thompson A. Brouns G.S. Schuurman R.K. Borst J. Timmers E. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Alignment of the Vκ-like protein sequence to germline Vκ4 gene subgroup p06312 (28Klobeck H.G. Bornkamm G.W. Combriato G. Mocikat R. Pohlenz H.D. Zachau H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6515-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was performed by the Clustal method (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI), revealing a 100% identity up to amino acid 120 (black contig). From there onward, the sequence is unique (gray contig) and depicts a germline Vκ sequence that includes amino acids encoded by the heptamer/spacer/nonamer region (boxed). The amino acids spanning the peptides that were chosen for the generation of p42–58 and pGL121–142 anti-Vκ-like antibodies are shown in bold letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The deduced Vκ-like protein exhibited three distinct features: (a) a variable κ domain from amino acids 1–120 that is identical to the Vκ4 gene p06312 (28Klobeck H.G. Bornkamm G.W. Combriato G. Mocikat R. Pohlenz H.D. Zachau H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6515-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and possesses a signal peptide and three complementarity determining regions (CDRs); (b) the Vκ4 sequence similarity ends at amino acid 120 and has no identifiable Jκ segment; and (c) it has a unique segment from amino acids 121–180 that includes the heptamer-spacer-nonamer region, which is a bona fide signature of its germline configuration. Intriguingly, the Vκ4 identity of the Vκ-like protein, as deduced from its full-length cDNA, appeared to be at odds with the LVκ3 and LVκ5 gene assignments of the primers that amplified the germline transcripts (Fig. 1a). However and as stressed earlier, the degeneracy of the oligonucleotide primer pools used in the amplification of Vκ-like cDNA cannot provide unambiguous Vκ gene identity, whereas the full-length cDNA cloning and sequencing can. These data show that PreB cells express germline Vκ transcripts that can potentially translate into a Vκ-like protein and support the hypothesis of a surrogate Vκ-like protein that could be a structural component of the κ PreB receptor.Expression and Germline Identity of the Vκ-like Protein— Although the cloned cDNA does encode a Vκ-like protein, there is no evidence that the germline Vκ transcript can indeed translate into the deduced protein. To assess the expression of the Vκ-like protein and at the same time confirm its germline identity, two affinity-purified anti-Vκ antibodies were generated. The first antibody p42–58 was raised against a peptide that spanned amino acids 42–58 from the deduced Vκ4 sequence of the cloned Vκ-like cDNA. In contrast, the reactivity of second antibody pGL121–142 aimed at the exclusive recognition of germline Vκ4-like proteins by the use of a peptide within amino acids 121–142, which included the heptamer-spacer-nonamer region of the Vκ4-like protein. Fig. 3a shows the results of the Western blot analysis obtained with the PreB cell lines PreALP and Blin-1, which revealed the antibody p42–58 reactivity to Vκ-like proteins of the predicted molecular size. In contrast, the cell line 1E8, a mature B cell derivative of Blin-1 (29Weng W.K. Shah N. O'Brien D. Van Ness B. LeBien T.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5502-5508PubMed Google Scholar), expressed only trace levels of the Vκ-like molecule. These results are consistent with the productive translation of the germline Vκ transcripts expressed by the PreALP and Blin-1 cells and stress the relevance of their expression during B cell ontogeny. The germline nature of the Vκ-like molecule was subsequently confirmed by the specific reactivity of the affinity-purified antibody pGL121–142, which can only detect proteins that possess the cDNA-deduced germline Vκ4 structure (Fig. 3b). The likelihood for the existence of other Vκ-like proteins involving distinct but closely related Vκ genes was again prompted by the detection of additional protein bands revealed by both p42–56 and pGL121–142 antibodies. Because the anti-Vκ p42–58 antibody may target an epitope common to other Vκ-like proteins, its stronger reactivity could be anticipated, since the pGL121–142 antibody can only react with unique germline protein residues. Nevertheless, the anti-Vκ pGL121–142 antibody does reveal (albeit with weaker strength) the same molecular species as p42–56 and further confirms the germline nature of the detected Vκ-like proteins, whose different sizes could have alternatively derived from distinct post-translational processing.Fig. 3Expression and germline identity of the surrogate Vκ-like protein. a, Western blot analysis of PreALP (lane 1), Blin-1 (lane 2), and 1E8 (lane 3) protein lysates, using the anti-Vκ p42–58 antibody.

The kinetics of phosphate association and dissociation are slow, allowing both free and GAPN·phosphate complexes to be observed by differential scanning calorimetry and to be separated by native polyacrylamide electrophoresis run in phosphate buffer. Analysis of a set of mutants of GAPN strongly suggests that phosphate is bound to the substrate C-3 subsite. In addition, the substrate analog glycerol-3-phosphate has similar effects as does phosphate on the thermal behavior of GAPN.

(EC 1.2.1.9) catalyzes the irreversible, NADP-dependent oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-GAP) into 3-phosphoglycerate. It belongs to the widely distributed aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, which participates in many levels of the cellular metabolism in the three kingdoms. As an enzyme involved in the production of NADPH equivalents required in biosynthetic pathways, GAPN is found in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic cells of higher plants, photosynthetic microorganisms, and some eubacteria, such as certain strains of Streptococci (1Habenicht A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1413-1419PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boyd D.A. Cvitkovitch D.G. Hamilton I.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2622-2627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAPN from Streptococcus mutans catalyzes the oxidation of d-GAP via a two-step mechanism, following an ordered sequential mechanism, with NADP acting as the first binding substrate and d-GAP as the second binding substrate. At high concentration, d-GAP behaves as a competitive substrate inhibitor, thus indicating that GAP can bind to the apoenzyme (3Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the acylation step, a covalent thiohemiacetal intermediate is formed with the catalytic residue Cys-302, preceding the oxidoreduction process that leads to a thioacyl intermediate and formation of NADPH. The deacylation step includes the attack of a water molecule on the thioacyl intermediate and the release of 3-phosphoglycerate and NADPH. Previous enzymatic and structural studies have highlighted the importance of ligand binding and local reorganization of the active site in the mechanism, affording high catalytic efficiency to GAPN. Specifically, the binding of NADP induces a local conformational rearrangement that leads to the accessibility of the thiol of Cys-302, combined to a shift of pKapp from 8.5 to 6.2, and a positioning adapted to subsequently form the competent thiohemiacetal intermediate. This rearrangement of the GAPN·NADP binary complex is strongly kinetically favored when the ternary complex enzyme·cofactor·substrate is formed (4Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the side chains of Glu-268 and Arg-459 rotate, thus leading to the breaking of the ionic bridge that exists in the Apo1 crystal form (see next paragraph). At this point, the side chain of Arg-459 is orientated toward the substrate binding site. During this rearrangement, the distance between the functional groups of Glu-268 and Cys-302 decreases from 7.6 to 3.6 Å. Concomitantly, the oxyanion hole is formed, comprising at least the amide side chain of Asn-169 and the main chain amide of Cys-302, and is postulated to be responsible for the stabilization of the tetrahedral transition states produced during the acylation and deacylation steps (3Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Marchal S. Branlant G.

Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this latter step, the side chain of Glu-268 has been shown to be responsible for the activation of the water molecule involved in the hydrolysis of the thioacyl intermediate (3Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent studies on human cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDHs have suggested an isomerization event of the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety of the cofactor, which would be required for Glu-268 to play this role in the deacylation step (6Hammen P.K. Allali-Hassani A. Hallenga K. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7156-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Three sulfate binding sites have been described in the crystal structures of the apoforms of GAPN obtained so far, which provided bases for the characterization of the ligand binding sites (5Cobessi D. Tete-Favier F. Marchal S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Cobessi D. Tete-Favier F. Marchal S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The first one, the SO4a site, exists both in Apo1 and Apo2 forms of GAPN and includes Arg-124 and Arg-301 side chains and Arg-459 and Gly-460 main-chain amide groups. In the Apo1 structure, Arg-459 and Glu-268 side chains interact via an ionic bridge, which is split in the Apo2 structure. The second sulfate site, the SO4b site, has only been found in the Apo2 structure and is shaped by Arg-301 and Arg-459 guanidinium groups, Asn-169 side-chain and Cys-302 and Thr-303 main-chain amide groups. The Thr-303 residue also interacts with the sulfate ions in both sites through the hydroxyl group of its side chain. The sulfate anion bound in the SO4b site most likely mimics the tetrahedral transition states of the substrate C-1 involved in the acylation and deacylation steps. A systematic study of the role of these arginine residues led to the conclusions that Arg-124 is only involved in stabilizing d-GAP binding via an interaction with the C-3 phosphate, and the Arg-301 side chain and Arg-459 main chain participate, not only in d-GAP binding via interaction with C-3 phosphate, but also in positioning efficiently d-GAP relative to Cys-302 within the ternary complex GAPN·NADP·GAP (9Marchal S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39235-39242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The third sulfate site corresponds to the subsite of the 2′-phosphate group of the adenosine part of NADP and comprises residues Lys-192 and Thr-195 side chains (10Marchal S.

The role of ligand interactions on the structure of the active site, as revealed by enzymatic, biochemical, and structural approaches, raises the question of the identification and characterization of such interactions and of their potential catalytic significance. In this work, we used the thermal unfolding of GAPN followed by adiabatic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the relationships between thermal stability and active site interactions of GAPN with ligands, with respect to the catalytic mechanism. Materials, Site-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—Production and purification procedures were carried out as described previously (4Marchal S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12950-12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purification process was carried out in 50 mm potassium inorganic phosphate buffer, pH 6.4. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the method of Kunkel et al. (12Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The enzymes were isolated as the apoform, judging by the absorbance ratio A280/A260 of 2.0 and by the fact that no NADP was enzymatically detectable after acidic denaturation. In the text, GAPN will therefore refer to apoGAPN. Enzyme purity was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis using 7.5% resolving gel. The GAPN monomer concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 5.01 × 104m–1·cm–1, as deduced by the method of Scopes (13Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Subunit molecular mass (∼51 kDa) of wild-type and mutant GAPNs were checked by mass spectrometry. For all experiments described, the samples of GAPN were stored in saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 6.4, at –20 °C and were desalted by gel filtration, either on a Sephadex G-25 column or an Econo-Pac 10 DG polyacrylamide gel column (Bio-Rad), or dialyzed for at least 20 h against the appropriate buffer before the experiments. Both gel filtration and dialysis procedures gave very similar DSC results. The activity of the enzyme was not significantly affected by the sample preparation. All other materials were reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. Potassium Pi was from BDH, NADP was from Roche Applied Science, and DTNB and G3P were from Sigma. dl-GAP (Sigma) was hydrolyzed from dl-GAP diethylacetal according to the manufacturers' instructions and enzymatically titrated with GAPN. Enzyme Kinetics—Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C spectrophotometrically by following the appearance of NADPH at 340 nm. Because GAPN is equally active with the D and L isomers of GAP, dl-GAP was used for activity measurements. The standard experimental conditions were 1 mm NADP, 0.2 mm dl-GAP, 50 mm TES buffer, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.2. The competitive inhibition constant of G3P for GAP was determined under conditions where GAP does not significantly behave as a competitive substrate inhibitor, i.e. below 0.2 mm (3Marchal S. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were made using a DASM-4 adiabatic microcalorimeter (Biopribor, Poushchino, Russia) with 0.47-ml platinum capillary spiral cells at excessive pressure of 2 atmospheres as described previously (14Levashov P. Orlov V. Boschi-Muller S. Talfournier F. Asryants R. Bulatnikov I. Muronetz V. Branlant G. Nagradova N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Roitel O. Ivinova O. Muronetz V. Nagradova N. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7556-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The calorimetric reversibility of the thermally induced transitions was checked by reheating the protein solution in the calorimeter after cooling from the first run, stopped at the end of the transition (i.e. ∼55 and ∼80 °C for transition B and A, respectively, see “Results”). Temperature scanning rates (ν) of 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.2 °C/min were tested. Subsequently, most experiments in this study were performed at a constant scan rate of 1 °C/min. The thermograms were recorded in the range of 0.1–1.2 mg/ml protein. Instrumental baselines recorded with both cells filled with buffer were subtracted from the experimental traces to obtain the heat capacity curves (ΔCp, excess heat capacity, versus temperature). Original software was used for recording the DSC data, and MicroCal Origin versions 1.16 and 7.0 were used to determine the Tmax (maximum of the thermal transition peak) and calorimetric enthalpies (ΔHcal) values. For ionic strength controls and kinetic experiments, DSC was performed on a Microcal VP-DSC apparatus equipped with cylindrical 0.54-ml cells under identical conditions, except for the protein concentration fixed at 0.1–0.2 mg/ml. The Tmax and ΔHcal values measured on thermograms obtained with both calorimeters under the same conditions were very similar. Because of the irreversibility of the heat denaturation process, it was impossible to calculate the value of the van't Hoff enthalpy. CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of GAPN (0.1 mg/ml) were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter using dedicated software. Measurements were recorded in a quartz cuvette with a 1-mm path length at 25 and 55 °C. Spectra were recorded as an average of six to eight scans from 205 to 260 nm. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column using a Pharmacia Corporation fast protein liquid chromatography system at room temperature. Protein (4.9 μm) in a 200-μl aliquot was applied onto the column equilibrated with 50 or 250 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 8.2, at 25 °C. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the protein was detected spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), horse myoglobin (17.5 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) were used as references to calibrate the column. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation of GAPN was studied using a model E Spinco analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Spinco) equipped with a photoelectric scanner, a multiplexer, and a monochromator. An analytical titanium rotor Model F and double-sector cells were used. UV light scanning was carried out at 280 nm. The sedimentation studies were performed at 25 and 45 °C and 261,600 × g in 50 or 250 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 8.2. The sedimentation coefficients were normalized to the standard conditions, i.e. a solvent with the density and viscosity of water at 20 °C. Before both gel filtration and ultracentrifugation experiments, GAPN samples were desalted in the indicated buffers by gel filtration from the stock suspension in saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 6.4. Native PAGE—Mini Protean 3 cell (Bio-Rad) was used for native PAGE analyses in 8% acrylamide gel (with 2.67% methylene-bis-acrylamide). The temperature of the cell was regulated to 4 °C to avoid overheating. The samples were desalted by gel filtration from the stock suspension in saturated ammonium sulfate into the appropriate running buffer (pH 8.2) prior to the experiment. A voltage of 50 V was used for 1.5 h for gels run in potassium Pi buffers, pH 8.2, and 100 V for 1 h for gels run in 80 mm Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.2. Inorganic Phosphate Determination—The C302A GAPN was desalted from the ammonium sulfate stock suspension in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 6.4, by gel filtration in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 8.2, or eluted with water from polyacrylamide gel after native PAGE in 80 mm Tris-glycine, pH 8.2, and then precipitated using trifluoroacetic acid before phosphate determination in the supernatant, according to Van Veldhoven et al. and Cogan et al. (16Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 17Cogan E.B. Birrell G.B. Griffith O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the method is based on the formation of phosphomolybdate complexes revealed by interaction with malachite green under acidic conditions in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol to stabilize the interaction. Ammonium heptamolybdate in 7.30 n H2SO4 was added at 0.29% (w/v) final concentration, incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by a mixture of malachite green (0.005% (w/v) final) and polyvinyl alcohol (0.05% (w/v) final). After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, absorbance was measured at 610 nm. At least three independent experiments were performed for each determination. Accessible Cysteine Content in Enzyme Preparations Measured with DTNB—The amount of reacted cysteines was deduced from the absorbance of thionitrobenzoate released after reaction with DTNB using an extinction coefficient of 13 600 m–1·cm–1 at 412 nm. The enzyme was desalted in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 8.2, before adding the sulfhydryl reagent in large excess relative to the enzyme and following the reaction at 25 °C. The Thermal Denaturation of Wild-type GAPN in the Presence of Phosphate—The thermal behavior of GAPN was first studied by DSC at a scan rate of 1 °C/min in the presence of increasing concentrations of potassium Pi at pH 8.2. As shown in Fig. 1a, the thermograms of GAPN revealed two endotherms showing Tmax values differing by at least 15 °C (15–30 °C), referred to as A and B for the high and low temperature transitions, respectively. Increasing potassium Pi concentration resulted in an increase of the area of endotherm B at the expense of that of endotherm A, with a concomitant increase of Tmax from 41.9 to 54.7 °C. Conversely, at high potassium Pi concentrations (>125 mm), the Tmax of endotherm A tended to decrease from 72 to 67 °C. At 500 mm potassium Pi, the “conversion” of endotherm A into endotherm B was complete. Decreasing the potassium Pi concentration from 500 to 50 mm by extensive dialysis (for 20 h, see “Kinetics of the GAPN-Phosphate Interaction”) restored the GAPN thermogram back to the initial observation in 50 mm potassium Pi (Fig. 1b). To test whether the observed phenomenon corresponded to a specific or a nonspecific ionic strength-dependent interaction between phosphate ions and GAPN, the effect of the presence of 300 mm NaCl in a solution of GAPN in 50 mm potassium Pi was compared with the effect of phosphate at the similar ionic strength of ∼0.45 m in 150 mm potassium Pi. As shown on Fig. 2, NaCl does not affect significantly the characteristics of endotherm B, whereas higher potassium Pi concentration increases both the area and Tmax of the endotherm. The Tmax of endotherm A was decreased in the presence of increased potassium Pi or NaCl concentration at fixed ionic strength. Higher concentrations of NaCl (up to 1.35 m) added to 20 mm potassium Pi solutions, which lead to ionic strength values of up to ∼1.5 m (corresponding to 500 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.2), resulted in similar effects either on endotherm B (no significant effect) or on endotherm A (decrease of Tmax) (data not shown). Both B and A thermal transitions were irreversible and scan rate-dependent. Decreasing the scanning rate from 1.5 to 0.2 °C/min resulted in a shift of Tmax toward lower temperatures (Fig. 3). Analysis of the scan rate dependence of the wild-type GAPN thermogram in 50 mm potassium Pi showed the non-saturating, linear dependence of Tmax as a function of scan rate, suggesting kinetically controlled processes for both transitions (18Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 19Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar)(curves not shown). The agreement of the mechanism of thermal unfolding to a simple first-order kinetic model was checked according to the criteria developed by Kurganov et al. (20Kurganov B.I. Lyubarev A.E. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Shnyrov V.I. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 69: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For scan rates 0.5–1.5 °C/min, good superpositioning of the ln ΔCp versus 1/T and 1/T versus ln(νΔCp/(ΔHcal – ΔH(T))) profiles for transition A (with ΔH(T), corresponding to the denaturation heat capacity at temperature T) suggests that the unfolding mechanism of GAPN that gives rise to this transition is very close to a simple first-order process (curves not shown). Determination of the apparent activation energy of transition A according to different methods described by Sanchez-Ruiz et al. (18Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) gave consistent values, with an average of 454 ± 3 kJ/mol. Similar analysis for the B transition revealed deviations from the simple model, suggesting the involvement of intermediates in the unfolding mechanism (curves not shown). Nevertheless, an approximate mean value of 441 ± 6 kJ/mol could be determined for the activation energy of this transition. Due to the irreversible nature of the thermal denaturation process, the ΔHcal values for both transitions likely are not strictly proportional to each species concentration, because they can be affected by the mechanism of irreversible thermal unfolding. This precluded a rigorous quantitative analysis of the DSC data, which were used only to provide estimates of the kinetics of the processes observed, required for this study. Endotherms A and B Correspond to Two Species of Tetrameric GAPN—Regarding the origin of transitions A and B, the latter could result from the dissociation of the GAPN tetramer into subunits. However, the following experiments excluded this assumption. First, neither the A nor the B transitions were dependent on the protein concentration, indicating that the rate-limiting step of the thermally induced processes occurs prior to the dissociation of the subunits. Second, gel filtration on Superose 12 in the presence of 50 and 250 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 8.2, showed only one peak corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼200,000 at 25 °C (curve not shown). Third, only one type of species with a sedimentation coefficient (Sw,20) of 8.32 ± 0.27 S, corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼200,000, was shown from sedimentation experiments run in 50 and 250 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 8.2, at 25 and 45 °C, respectively. Altogether, these experiments showed that endotherms A and B observed in the presence of phosphate correspond to two species of tetrameric GAPN. The thermal destabilization of GAPN upon increase of the potassium Pi concentration was further studied by far-UV CD analysis. For GAPN samples containing 10 and 500 mm 2A low concentration of phosphate is required to maintain the full activity of GAPN. Indeed, in the absence of phosphate, e.g. in Tris-glycine buffer, GAPN is transformed into the inactive GAPN* form (see “Results”). potassium Pi, pH 8.2, respectively, CD spectra showed similar profiles, thereby indicating that high concentrations of potassium Pi do not significantly affect the secondary structure content of GAPN (Fig. 4, curves 1 and 2). In contrast, after heating at 55 °C for 20 min, drastic changes were observed in the CD profile of the sample containing 500 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.2, as shown by the loss of the content of the secondary structures (Fig. 4, curve 4). The minor changes occurring after thermal treatment of GAPN under the same conditions in the presence of 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.2, are thus roughly consistent with the loss of the amount of the thermolabile species existing at this concentration (Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, curve 3). Finally, two well separated bands were revealed by native PAGE of GAPN solutions run in potassium Pi buffers, pH 8.2 (Fig. 5a). In the presence of increasing concentration of potassium Pi from 4 to 250 mm, the slower-migrating band became relatively less abundant compared with the faster one. Altogether, this result combined to the DSC and CD data suggests that 1) the slower-migrating band corresponds to the species unfolding in transition A by DSC and 2) phosphate binds to GAPN, resulting in the formation of a GAPN·phosphate binary complex characterized by a lower thermostability (thermal unfolding transition B) and a higher electrophoretic mobility than the unliganded GAPN species. Phosphate Content in C302A GAPN—To titrate the phosphate content of both GAPN species, the PAGE technique in a buffer devoid of phosphate (i.e. 80 mm Tris-glycine, pH 8.2) appeared as a method of choice to isolate the two forms, provided that the kinetics of phosphate dissociation were slow enough compared with the timescale of the PAGE separation (see “Kinetics of the Phosphate-GAPN Interaction”). Attempts to visualize a band corresponding to the faster-migrating band in samples of wild-type GAPN were unsuccessful. Only one slower-migrating band was seen under these conditions. In contrast, under the same conditions, two bands were visualized for C302A GAPN (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the phosphate content was investigated on each band of C302A GAPN using a colorimetric method based on the interaction of malachite green with phosphomolybdate complexes. First, the phosphate content in the C302A enzyme sample was determined after desalting from the stock suspension as ammonium sulfate precipitate in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 6.4, through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 8.2. Under these conditions, 1 mol of C302A GAPN tetramer contained an average of 1.36 ± 0.09 mol of phosphate. Second, in a separate experiment, the same sample of C302A GAPN was migrated on PAGE run in 80 mm Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.2. Strips corresponding to each band were cut, and the phosphate content was determined in each band after elution, followed by protein precipitation. Only the strip corresponding to the faster-migrating band contained phosphate, with a stoichiometry of 3.8 ± 0.4 mol/mol of GAPN tetramer, which strongly suggested a stoichiometry of 1 phosphate/C302A mutant GAPN subunit. This result, which can reasonably be extrapolated to the phosphate content of the wild-type enzyme, even though the faster-migrating band could not be isolated in the wild type under the conditions used, again supports the existence of a GAPN·phosphate binary complex. Kinetics of the GAPN-Phosphate Interaction—To get insight into the influence of the dynamics of the interaction on the timescale of the DSC and PAGE experiments, we measured the evolution of the endotherm B area in solutions of wild-type and C302A GAPNs prepared in 500 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.2 (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), dialyzed as a function of time against a 4 mm concentration of the same buffer at 4 °C. The data were analyzed as first-order kinetics (curves not shown) to provide estimates for the rate constants of 0.4 ± 0.1 and 0.011 ± 0.003 h–1 (t½ of 1.7 and 63 h) for wild-type and C302A GAPNs, respectively. Similarly, the kinetics of appearance of the endotherm B were followed by the evolution of endotherm B area in solutions of wild-type GAPN prepared in 4 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.2, dialyzed for increasing time against 500 mm of the same buffer. The rate constant of the process was estimated to 0.3 ± 0.1 h–1 for wild-type GAPN (t½ of 2.3 h). In addition, when a sample of wild-type GAPN was dialyzed fro"

Recently, we have identified the insulin-response element-binding protein-1 (IRE-BP1) as a transcription factor that appears to mediate insulin action on multiple target genes. To examine the possibility that IRE-BP1 is an insulin-responsive glucoregulatory factor involved in the metabolic actions of insulin, we investigated the effect of adenoviral overexpression of hepatic IRE-BP1 on the glycemic control of insulin-resistant diabetic rats. Adenoviral IRE-BP1 lowered both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, and microarray of hepatic RNA revealed modulation of the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. The insulin mimetic effects of IRE-BP1 were also confirmed in L6 myocytes; stable constitutive expressions of IRE-BP1 enhanced glucose transporter expression, glucose uptake, and glycogen accumulation in these cells. These findings showed physiologic sufficiency of IRE-BP1 as the transcriptional mediator of the metabolic action of insulin. Understanding IRE-BP1 action should constitute a useful probe into the mechanisms of metabolic regulation and an important target to develop therapeutic agents that mimic or enhance insulin action.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased substantially over the past decade, but the pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of the disease remain poorly understood (1Green A. Christian H.M. Pramming S.K. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2003; 19: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that major factors contributing to the pathogenesis of diabetes include decreased insulin effects on target tissues, increased endogenous glucose production, and elevated circulating free fatty acids and lipid oxidation (2Kruszynska Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Investig. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar, 3Taylor S.I. Cell. 1999; 97: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 4Song S. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the liver, insulin acts to suppress transcription of genes encoding gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic enzymes and stimulates transcription of genes encoding glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, resulting in decreased glucose (5Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 6Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis is increased compared with control subjects, and hepatic resistance to the actions of insulin has been suggested to contribute to the development of fasting hyperglycemia, but the mechanism for impaired suppression of gluconeogenesis remains unknown (7Beck-Nielsen H. Vaag A. Poulsen P. Gaster M. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 17: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Shah P. Basu A. Rizza R. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2003; 3: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which insulin transduces its effects on hepatic glucose production may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes. Insulin stimulates gene transcription through both the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways (9Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar, 10Kido Y. Nakae J. Accili D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 972-979PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have concluded that insulin-induced signals through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway play a significant role in the metabolic actions of insulin, and Akt has been proposed to link insulin receptor binding to the activities of various insulin-responsive genes (11Kops J.P.L. Burgering B.M.T. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Recently, the forkhead transcription factor Foxo 01 was found to be phosphorylated by Akt and to control glucose homeostasis in vivo. Haploinsufficiency of Foxo 01 was found to normalize blood glucose in an insulin-resistant mouse model and expression of a mutant cDNA that is resistant to inactivation by insulin-elevated fasting blood glucose levels (13Altomonte J. Richter A. Harbaran S. Suriawinata J. Nakae J. Thung S.N. Meseck M. Accili D. Dong H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E718-E728Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Puigserver P. Rhee J.

Therefore, Foxo 01 may be a negative regulator of insulin action, but the transcription factor(s) that mediates the positive actions of insulin on glucose control has not been identified. This laboratory recently identified a novel transcription factor that binds directly to the insulin-responsive elements of multiple genes, including the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IRE-BP1, insulin-response element-binding protein-1; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; ZDF, Zucker diabetic fatty; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GTT, glucose tolerance test; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IRE-BP1, insulin-response element-binding protein-1; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; ZDF, Zucker diabetic fatty; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GTT, glucose tolerance test; GFP, green fluorescent protein. IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and IGFBP-1 genes (15Villafuerte B.C. Phillips L.S. Rane M.J. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36650-36659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The transcription factor insulin-response element-binding protein-1 (IRE-BP1) appears to be an Akt substrate, because it is phosphorylated by Akt in vivo and in vitro. Changes in expression level, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation modulate the transactivation effects of the factor on the insulin-responsive element reporter genes. The level of expression of IRE-BP1 is decreased in insulin-deficient diabetes. Although the IGFBP-3 gene, which was the basis for cloning of IRE-BP1, is known to be regulated by insulin, it has no established connection to the metabolic actions of insulin. To begin to study the biological effects of IRE-BP1, we established stable cell lines that express IRE-BP1 in L6 myocytes, and we examined the cells for metabolic changes relevant to insulin action. To determine whether expression of IRE-BP1 affects glucose control in vivo, we used recombinant adenovirus to express IRE-BP1 in diabetic rats, and we assessed for changes in glucose homeostasis. We also used microarray of hepatic RNA to identify genes that are targeted by IRE-BP1. Our study shows that IRE-BP1 enhances some of the metabolic effects of insulin, including glucose uptake, glucose transporter expression, and glycogen accumulation in L6 myocytes. Overexpression of IRE-BP1 in the liver reduced both fasting and postprandial glucose levels in Zucker diabetic rats, probably through a mechanism that involves decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipogenesis, and decreased lipid oxidation. Thus, we propose that IRE-BP1 may mediate some of the positive actions of insulin involved in lowering blood glucose levels, and we speculate that IRE-BP1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Plasmid Construction and Stable Cell Line Expression of IRE-BP1—A 1503-bp fragment (+1641/+3144) of rat IRE-BP1 cDNA was inserted into the pCMV-tag2 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the SmaI site. Stable transfections were achieved with Targefect F2 and Virofect enhancer (Targeting Systems, San Diego); 60-mm dishes of L6 cells at 90% confluence were transfected with 6 μg of the IRE-BP1/pCMV-Tag2B construct or the empty vector overnight, followed by 48 h of recovery in fresh media. After the recovery period, G418 (Invitrogen) was added at 800 μg/ml for 14 days, when colonies were picked and expanded under G418 selection. Measurement of Glucose Uptake—L6 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight at 37 °C and glucose-starved for 4 h before studies were conducted. Cells were stimulated with or without insulin (10 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 2.8 μCi/ml in HBS buffer for 10 min. The plates were then washed to remove excess labeled glucose and lysed with 0.2 n NaOH (16Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The samples were counted in a scintillation counter. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay, and the data are expressed as deoxyglucose uptake (cpm)/μg protein. Glycogen Content of the Cells—To stain for glycogen, L6 cells were oxidized with 0.5% periodic acid for 5 min, washed with water, and incubated with Schiff's reagent for 15 min. The cells were then rinsed with 10% sodium metabisulfite solution, and counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin solution for 30 s (17van der Laarse W.J. van Noort P. Diegenbach P.C. Biotech. Histochem. 1992; 67: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To quantitate the glycogen content, a combined amyloglucosidase/glucose hexokinase assay was performed. Quantitative PCR—The optimal primer pairs for amplification of IRE-BP1 cDNA (forward primer, 5′-GGGACCCACTTGTGAATCAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTTCCAACCAGGTCAACACA-3′) were designed. The 5′-end of the 5′-primer was modified with addition of the T7 promoter and with an oligo(dT) at the 5′-end of the 3′-primer, as described by Totzke et al. (18Totzke G. Sachinidis A. Vetter H. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1996; 10: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PCR products were amplified with the modified primer pairs, quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and used for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase to produce IRE-BP1 cRNA, as described by Fronhoffs et al. (19Fronhoffs S. Totzke G. Stier S. Werner N. Rothe M. Bruning T. Koch B. Sachinidis A. Vetter H. Ko Y. Mol. Cell. Probes. 2002; 16: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Reactions provided a DNA fragment of 197 bp. A standard curve of known amounts of IRE-BP1 cRNA was constructed by log dilutions of the in vitro transcription reaction product and converted to molecule number. Liver RNA was collected from 12-week-old lean, obese, and diabetic Zucker rats and from ad libitum fed and 3-day fasted Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 2–3 per group). The total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in parallel with the cRNA (1011 to 104 molecules) in the standard curve, and the cDNAs were then used for real time PCRs using SIBYL green incorporation for detection of the amplified products (Stratagene MX4000, La Jolla, CA). The number of molecules of IRE-BP1 mRNA was determined by plotting the amplified signals of the samples against signals produced by the coamplified standard mRNAs. Unknowns were quantitated by the threshold cycle number where the fluorescent signals were detected. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed utilizing primers designed to identify 13 S ribosomes to confirm equal loading of RNA. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus—Using the AdEasy system (Qbiogene, Inc.), the +1641 to +3144 fragment of rat IRE-BP1 cDNA was cloned into a shuttle vector (pShuttle-CMV). Once constructed, the shuttle vector was linearized with Pme1 and cotransformed into BJ5183 together with AdEasy-1, the supercoiled viral DNA plasmid. Transformants were selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombinants were subsequently identified by restriction digestion. Purified recombinant Ad plasmid DNA was digested with PacI to expose its inverted terminal repeats and then used to transfect AD-293 cells where deleted viral assembly genes are complemented in vivo. Recombinant adenovirus was obtained by plaque purification, amplified, and purified by Dr. Jude Samulski and co-workers at the University of North Carolina Vector Core Facility, Chapel Hill, NC. The adenovirus expressing IRE-BP1 was injected intravenously via the tail vein into Zucker diabetic rats, and the rats were monitored for blood glucose changes, as described under “Results.” Metabolic Studies—Serum glucose was measured using glucose oxidase strips. Rat insulin was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit from Linco Research in the Emory Endocrine Core Laboratory (interassay coefficient of variation = 0.20, intra-assay coefficient of variation = 0.06). To determine insulin sensitivity in vivo, insulin tolerance tests were conducted by administering a fixed bolus of regular insulin (2 units/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, and the decrease in plasma glucose was analyzed over the following 60 min. The slope of the linear decline in plasma glucose (KITT) was calculated by dividing 0.693 by plasma glucose half-time (50% from base line) using the following formula: KITT = 0.693/t½ × 100, where t½ represents the half-life of plasma glucose decrease (20Monzillo L.U. Hamdy O. Nutr. Rev. 2003; 61: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and ITT is insulin tolerance test. Normal KITT is >2.0%/min and values <1.5% are considered abnormal (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). All animal studies were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the Emory University and the University of Louisville. Microarray Gene Analysis—To study the differential expression of genes expressed in rats treated with control vector or Ad IRE-BP1, we obtained hepatic RNA after overnight fasting from virus-treated rats 12 days after gene therapy. Six rat genome U34 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, California) consisting of 7,000 known genes and 1,000 ESTs, with ∼16 pairs of oligonucleotide probes measuring the transcript level of each gene, were hybridized with hepatic tissue RNA obtained from three independent vector-treated and three Ad IRE-BP1-treated rats. Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the cDNA from total RNA (20 μg/sample). Biotin-labeled antisense cRNA was synthesized from the cDNA by in vitro transcription (BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit, Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and hybridized initially with test chips to assess for hybridization background and sample quality, including determination of the hybridization ratio of the 3′-probe set to the 5′-probe set for actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Hybridization was performed with 10 μg of cRNA per GeneChip, and with 50 pmol of oligonucleotide B12, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin in 100 mm MES, 1 m [Na+], 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20 at 45 °C for 16 h with mixing on a rotisserie at 60 rpm, then washed with 100 mm MES, 0.1 m [Na+], 0.01% Tween 20. Controls for hybridization included known concentrations of bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre cRNAs. After washing with eukaryotic GEWS2-V4 solution in Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400, probe arrays were scanned with an Agilent G2500A confocal laser scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Expression signals were analyzed by using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.1 software and Datamining Tool version 3.0, scaled globally to a constant value, and data analysis generated detection p value and signal value, which assigned a relative measure of abundance to the transcript. Change in transcript expression when two arrays were compared, including the magnitude and direction of change, is expressed as signal log ratio and fold change. Cluster analysis was done using a Spearman correlation for similarity measures (Genespring version 6.0, Silicon Genetics) after normalization to the median of the control samples. Statistical Methods—All values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Experiments involving multiple sampling times, i.e. blood glucose and weight measurements over the 12-day study period, and the insulin tolerance test were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance using SigmaStat. For all other two-group comparisons, a nonpaired Student's t test was used. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Biological Effects of IRE-BP1 in L6 Myoblasts—Using confocal microscopy, we previously showed that the NH2-terminal segment of IRE-BP1 is localized to the cytoplasm, whereas the carboxyl segment is found predominantly in the nucleus of HepG2 cells (15Villafuerte B.C. Phillips L.S. Rane M.J. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36650-36659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 1.5-kb cDNA construct that encodes the 50-kDa carboxyl segment of IRE-BP1 transactivated the IGFBP-3 insulin-responsive element reporter gene, whereas addition of 5′-sequence to the cDNA attenuated the transcriptional activity of the expression vector, suggesting that IRE-BP1 is proteolyzed and that its carboxyl segment may translocate to the nucleus to bind and transactivate insulin-responsive sequences (15Villafuerte B.C. Phillips L.S. Rane M.J. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36650-36659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this investigation and throughout the studies shown here, we used the 1.5-kb carboxyl segment of the cDNA to examine the biological consequences of IRE-BP1 expression. Initially, the 1.5-kb cDNA was subcloned into pCMV-Tag2 to obtain an 8-amino acid “FLAG” tag at the N terminus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and stable transfectants were produced in L6 myocytes. As shown in Fig. 1a, cell lysates from transfected cells expressed immunoreactive IRE-BP1 as a –70-kDa protein as detected by anti-FLAG antibody; the increase in size above the expected 50 kDa may reflect post-translational modifications. Uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was increased –3-fold in the IRE-BP1-overexpressing cell line, compared with vector-transfected or wild type cells (Fig. 1b). After addition of 10–8 m insulin for 10 min, there was a 2- and 5-fold increase in glucose uptake in vector- and IRE-BP1-transfected cells compared with wild type cells, suggesting that IRE-BP1 may confer insulin-mimetic enhancement of glucose uptake. We also compared the effects of IRE-BP1 to those of pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione used to increase insulin sensitivity and lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes. As shown in Fig. 1c, 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake rose ∼3-fold in wild type cells treated with pioglitazone for 16 h, consistent with previous reports (21Shin Y. Nishimura H. Shintani M. Inoue R. Yamamoto Y. Masuzaki H. Ogawa Y. Hosada K. Inoue G. Hayashi T. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2001; 50: 1093-1101Google Scholar, 22Shintani M. Nishimura H. Yonemitsu S. Ogawa Y. Hayashi T. Hosada K. Inoue G. Nakao K. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2001; 50: 2296-2300Google Scholar), and was comparable with glucose uptake in IRE-BP1-overexpressing cells. However, the addition of pioglitazone produced no further increase in glucose uptake in the IRE-BP1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that IRE-BP1 may be sufficient to confer most of the stimulation of pioglitazone for glucose uptake. Because insulin promotes glucose storage as well as glucose uptake in vivo, we used periodic acid-Schiff staining to evaluate the glycogen content of the transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1d, IRE-BP1-overexpressing L6 cells exhibited much higher glycogen content than vector-transfected cells, with an accompanying change in morphology from a predominantly spindle shape to a more cuboidal shape in association with expansion of the cytoplasm. Compared with vector-transfected cells, IRE-BP1 overexpression increased glycogen content of the two cell lines by 106 ± 10 and by 115 ± 7%, as measured by the amyloglucosidase-hexokinase assays (both p < 0.05 versus vector control, Fig. 1e). To explore the mechanisms underlying the impact of IRE-BP1 on glucose uptake, glucose transporter expression was examined. As shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 1f, wild type L6 or vector-overexpressing cells contain low levels of the Glut 1 transporter, but the IRE-BP1-overexpressing cells exhibited a 3-fold increase in Glut 1 compared with vector-transfected cells. In addition, although the Glut 4 transporter that is the major effector of glucose transport in skeletal muscle is often expressed at a low level in muscle cell lines in the absence of insulin (23Wang Q.T. Somwar R. Bilan P. Liu Z. Jin Jr., J. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), Glut 4 was detected even without added insulin in IRE-BP1-transfected cells (Fig. 1g). Moreover, the Glut 4 antibody provided no significant reaction with vector-transfected cells, although immunostaining was strongly positive in IRE-BP1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1h). To investigate further the relationship between IRE-BP1 and insulin action in stimulating Glut 4, we immunoprecipitated Glut 4 from cells grown in the presence or absence of insulin. As shown in Fig. 1i, Glut 4 expression was low in both the mock- and vector-transfected cells but was high in IRE-BP1-transfected cells. When 10–8 m insulin was added for 48 h, Glut 4 was significantly stimulated in mock- and vector-transfected cells but was not stimulated further in IRE-BP1-transfected cells; a decrease in Glut 4 with addition of insulin may be related to a sample loading problem, because the control IgG was also lower. This result suggests that IRE-BP1 may be sufficient to increase Glut 4 expression or that IRE-BP1 may mediate insulin stimulation of Glut 4, because insulin provided no additional effect in the presence of IRE-BP1 overexpression. Together, these findings show that IRE-BP1 increased glucose transporter expression, glucose uptake, and glycogen storage, the biological processes that mimic insulin action. The effect of IRE-BP1 appears not to be related to differentiation of the myogenic cell line, because two of the helix-loop-helix proteins (myoD and myogenin) known to regulate muscle cell development were not significantly affected; and furthermore, induction of L6 myocytes to myotubes did not affect the biological activity induced by IRE-BP1 (data not shown). Regulation of Hepatic IRE-BP1 in Vivo—We have shown previously that hepatic IRE-BP1 mRNA is decreased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats compared with normal rats (15Villafuerte B.C. Phillips L.S. Rane M.J. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36650-36659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar decrease in IRE-BP1 expression occurs in type 2 diabetes, we compared the hepatic expression of IRE-BP1 in Zucker diabetic rats to that of lean and obese non-diabetic Zucker rats. The Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)-drt rat expresses mutant forms of the leptin receptor and is a model of obesity complicated by diabetes (24Peterson R.G. Shaw W.N. Neel M.A. Little L.A. Eichberg J. ILAR News. 1990; 32: 16-19Crossref Google Scholar). In this experiment, we designed primers that amplified a 197-bp region of IRE-BP1 cDNA, and we used real time PCR to measure the mRNA expression of IRE-BP1. Our studies show that liver from 12-week-old diabetic rats have 51 ± 3% lower expression of IRE-BP1 mRNA than age-matched lean controls (p = 0.027 versus control, Fig. 2a). There was also a 32 ± 9% decrease in IRE-BP1 expression in obese rats (p = 0.08 versus control), suggesting that insulin resistance in obesity as well as type 2 diabetes is associated with decreased hepatic IRE-BP1 expression. Because fasting affects the regulation of hepatic enzymes involved in maintaining the blood glucose level, we also determined whether hepatic IRE-BP1 expression was affected in the transition from fasting to feeding. We obtained livers from Sprague-Dawley rats that were fed ad libitum or subjected to 72 h of fasting, and we found no significant change in the expression of IRE-BP1 (p = 0.47 for fed versus fasting, Fig. 2b). No change in IRE-BP1 was also found after 48 h of fasting (data not shown). To determine whether fasting affects the protein translation of IRE-BP1, we obtained total liver extracts and assessed for changes in the IRE-BP1 protein. As shown by Western blotting in Fig. 2c, compared with fed animals, there was no significant change in the IRE-BP1 protein levels with prolonged fasting. Because nuclear translocation of IRE-BP1 affected its transactivation activity, we also prepared tissue sections from rat liver, and we determined the cellular localization of the protein. As shown in Fig. 2d, there was a dramatic change in the cellular localization of IRE-BP1 with prolonged fasting, as detected by an antibody that recognized the carboxyl segment of the protein. During normal feeding, confocal microscopy showed that IRE-BP1 was localized predominantly to the nuclei of hepatocytes. With prolonged fasting, however, IRE-BP1 was localized mainly to the cytoplasm. Therefore, there is either decreased nuclear translocation of the protein, or the protein is exported from the nucleus with fasting. In either case, the transcriptional program stimulated by IRE-BP1 will be expected to be low in fasted animals. In Vivo Effects of IRE-BP1 in Diabetes—Because our previous study showed that proteolysis of IRE-BP1 affects its transcriptional activity, the physiologic function of IRE-BP1 was tested further by determining whether the truncated IRE-BP1 had insulin-like effects in vivo. In this experiment, we constructed an adenoviral vector containing the transcriptionally active fragment of IRE-BP1 (+1641/+3144), and we confirmed that the recombinant virus (Ad IRE-BP1) increased expression of ∼50-kDa IRE-BP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3a). The adenoviral constructs at a dose of 5.0 × 107 plaque-forming units/g body weight were introduced via tail vein infusion into 10-week-old male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Controls included age-matched ZDF rats infused with virus encoding the green fluorescent protein (Ad GFP) at a dose equivalent to that of Ad IRE-BP1. Because we used a fusion construct of GFP and IRE-BP1, we were able to track the tissue distribution of the autofluorescent protein after administration. Tissue sections showed high expression of Ad IRE-BP1 in the liver, particularly in hepatocyte nuclei, and also high expression in mesenteric adipocytes and mesenteric veins (Fig. 3b), whereas Ad GFP was localized mainly to the hepatic sinusoidal area. There was no significant fluorescent signal detected in either the pancreas or skeletal muscles (data not shown). Northern blotting showed that hepatic IRE-BP1 was increased by administration of the transgene (Fig. 3c). Preliminary studies showed no difference between vehicle or Ad GFP (viral vector) infusions in glucose levels in the ZDF rats, and that the effects of Ad IRE-BP1 were similar whether the adenovirus was introduced via the portal vein or tail vein. Before treatment, base-line glucose levels in ad libitum fed Ad IRE-BP1- and Ad GFP-treated rats (n = 6 per group) were not significantly different (245 ± 17 versus 258 ± 25 mg/dl; Fig. 3d). There was a transient increase in plasma glucose 24 h after administration of Ad IRE-BP1, followed by a gradual decline over 10–12 days. Compared with base line, there was a significant decrease in the glucose levels of IRE-BP1-treated rats at 12 days (245 ± 17 versus 151 ± 9 mg/dl, p < 0.05). In contrast, glucose levels remained high in GFP-treated rats (base line of 258 ± 25 versus 282 ± 48 mg/dl at 12 days, p = not significant). Body weights increased in parallel in both groups and were not significantly different between the two groups at the end of the study (367 ± 6 versus 373 ± 8 g for IRE-BP1-treated and control rats, respectively, Fig. 3e). On day 11, both groups of animals were fasted overnight (16 h) and had a glucose tolerance test (GTT) with intraperitoneal injection of 50% dextrose at 2 g/kg body weight (Fig. 3f). Tail vein fasting glucose levels were slightly lower in IRE-BP1-treated compared with GFP-treated rats (101 ± 5 versus 116 ± 6 mg/dl), but the difference was not significant. During the GTT, gluco"
