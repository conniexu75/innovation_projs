This detection of the moths by the jays was affected by the background upon which the moth was placed and its body orientation, thus providing an objective measure of crypticity. These procedures are useful for the study of visual detection of prey."
https://openalex.org/W2085578230,"Several grains of barley have been recovered from archeological sites at Wadi Kubbaniya, near Aswan in Egypt. The sites are typical Late Paleolithic and are firmly dated between 18,300 and 17,000 years ago. They seem to represent a very early use of ground grain in the Nile Valley, and evidence is presented for its continued use over the subsequent 6000 years. The Egyptian findings possibly record an initial stage of food production, and if they indeed do, then they suggest that food production may not have been brought about by environmental stress and may not have led inevitably to radical social changes."
https://openalex.org/W2091167360,The strongest spectral features in the Venus night airglow between 3000 and 8000 angstroms are identified as the Herzberg II (c1σ-u - X3σ-g) bands of molecular oxygen. These bands have been produced in a laboratory afterglow by the recombination of oxygen atoms in the presence of carbon dioxide molecules. It is hypothesized that the same mechanism produces this emission in the upper atmosphere of Venus.
https://openalex.org/W2048118789,"Studies with radioisotopes indicate that in the laboratory pea plants and pine tree seedlings release zinc and lead into the atmosphere. Field studies carried out on radiolabeled plots vegetated with a variety of grasses and small herbaceous plants also show that these elements are released into the atmosphere. The metals, associated with particles of various sizes, are released from the plant surfaces, and the loss mechanism is influenced by growth conditions, the concentrations of the elements in the leaves, and meteorological factors. For plants whose leaves have about equal concentrations of zinc and lead, the amount of zinc released is usually two orders of magnitude greater than the amount of lead. The significance of the process is discussed in terms of the overall trace metal composition of atmospheric particulates."

The new genus of carnosaur is related to Allosaurus. The two new genera of sauropods are cetiosaurids, comparable with but different from Cetiosaurus, and more primitive than Haplocanthosaurus."

In many respects the June 1966 sequence was a remarkably detailed repetition of the June 1934 sequence, suggesting a recurring recognizable pattern of stress and fault zone behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2015905976,"Upon emergence as adults, brothers of Euodynerus foraminatus compete among themselves for the microterritory around their natal nest. The winning male inseminates his sisters as they emerge several days later. Unlike most species that inbreed in a similar fashion, both sexes of this common wasp are strong fliers. The possibility is raised that siblings may be preferred as mates even when out-breeding is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2012709467,"Fluctuating magnetic gradients over oceans come from electric currents flowing in seawater arising from its motions across the earth's magnetic field. Gradients of 0.3 to 0.6 picoteslas per meter for each meter of internal wave displacement have been measured at frequencies of 2 to 5 millihertz with a superconductive magnetic gradiometer supported 7 meters above the surface of water 18 meters deep about 1.5 kilometers offshore from San Diego, California."
https://openalex.org/W1992503437,"The thermal structure of the Pacific Ocean between water depths of about 1 and 4.5 kilometers is estimated from the oxygen isotopic ratio of benthonic foraminifera from deep-drilled and piston cores of early Pliocene age (about 3 to 5 million years ago). The ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in the early Pliocene at each site varies by an average of only ± 0.12 per mil (1 standard deviation). A plot of the oxygen isotopic ratio against modern bottom-water temperature is adequately fit by a line having a slope of – 0.26 per mil per degree Celsius (the equilibrium temperature dependence of calcite-water fractionation), suggesting that the temperature gradient of the Pacific Ocean during the early Pliocene was similar to that of today."

https://openalex.org/W2006295782,Aerosol concentrations were measured during a 54-hour circum-navigation of the earth at altitudes between 238 and 162 millibars and concurrently by a separate flight at lower altitudes over the Pacific Ocean. The aerosol concentrations were found to be symmetrically distributed about the earth. Concurrent meteorological measurements indicate that tropospheric aerosols enter the stratosphere in the vicinity of jet streams and that surface aerosols are carried aloft over the intertropical convergence and Antarctic polar front.
https://openalex.org/W1964300462,"An analysis of data from the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) System is outlined, and it is concluded that rail transit is an energy waster. Improvement of the efficiency of transportation systems could only be achieved by emphasis on the development of more efficient automobiles and the development of bus-oriented transit systems. In this analysis, the criterion of passenger-miles per British thermal unit (PM/Btu) is used to evaluate the relative efficiencies of rail transit and highways. A comparison of construction energy costs reveals that BART used 25.2 times as much energy as required to construct an urban freeway. The operating-energies of BART, buses, and cars are 4740, 2900, and 8310 Btu/PM respectively including both propulsion energy and a pro rata share of the energy involved in constructing the vehicle. BART like all rail transit systems attracts passengers from existing bus systems. Although BART has a high auto-diversion, its net energy saving is only 680 Btu/PM."

In agreement with previous results for polycarbonate, substantial molecular mobility at the glass transition temperature is."
