https://openalex.org/W2018019380,"Mitochondria form a highly dynamic tubular network, the morphology of which is regulated by frequent fission and fusion events. However, the role of mitochondrial fission in homeostasis of the organelle is still unknown. Here we report that preventing mitochondrial fission, by down-regulating expression of Drp1 in mammalian cells leads to a loss of mitochondrial DNA and a decrease of mitochondrial respiration coupled to an increase in the levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the lack of fission leads to a drop in the levels of cellular ATP, an inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in autophagy. In conclusion, we propose that mitochondrial fission is required for preservation of mitochondrial function and thereby for maintenance of cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2006455330,"The composition of chromatin-remodeling complexes dictates how these enzymes control transcriptional programs and cellular identity. In the present study we investigated the composition of SWI/SNF complexes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In contrast to differentiated cells, ESCs have a biased incorporation of certain paralogous SWI/SNF subunits with low levels of BRM, BAF170, and ARID1B. Upon differentiation, the expression of these subunits increases, resulting in a higher diversity of compositionally distinct SWI/SNF enzymes. We also identified BRD7 as a novel component of the Polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor (PBAF) complex in both ESCs and differentiated cells. Using short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of BRG1, we showed that SWI/SNF can function as both a repressor and an activator in pluripotent cells, regulating expression of developmental modifiers and signaling components such as Nodal, ADAMTS1, BMI-1, CRABP1, and thyroid releasing hormone. Knockdown studies of PBAF-specific BRD7 and of a signature subunit within the BAF complex, ARID1A, showed that these two subcomplexes affect SWI/SNF target genes differentially, in some cases even antagonistically. This may be due to their different biochemical properties. Finally we examined the role of SWI/SNF in regulating its target genes during differentiation. We found that SWI/SNF affects recruitment of components of the preinitiation complex in a promoter-specific manner to modulate transcription positively or negatively. Taken together, our results provide insight into the function of compositionally diverse SWI/SNF enzymes that underlie their inherent gene-specific mode of action.

Chromatin plays a key role in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression during development and differentiation (1Muller C. Leutz A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This chromatin structure is dictated by stem cell-specific transcription factors, chromatin architecture, and epigenetic regulation (5Niwa H. Development. 2007; 134: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and is a prerequisite for self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers (6Meshorer E. Misteli T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Important determinants of this unique genomic plasticity are ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. These multisubunit enzymes catalyze non-covalent eviction, restructuring or repositioning of nucleosomes to modulate the accessibility of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to chromosomal DNA (7Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Multiple distinct families of chromatin-remodeling complexes exist, some of which have been implicated in developmental processes (8de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Rev.

For example, genomic disruption of specific chromatin-remodeling components results in early embryonic lethality (10Stopka T. Skoultchi A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stem Cells (Dayton). 2008; 26: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Specific components of chromatin remodelers confer specialized activities and selective gene targeting to distinct complexes. For example, the evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF family exists in several subgroups and is implicated in regulating cellular processes such as transcription, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis (8de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Simone C. J. Cell.

Each subgroup contains one of two highly homologous ATPases, BRG1 or BRM, and a variable composition of BRG1-associated factors (BAFs) (20Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 21Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). BRG1- and BRM-SWI/SNF complexes have very different functions as shown by gene knock-out experiments in which loss of BRG1, but not BRM, is embryonic lethal (11Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). BAF subunits that constitute “core” SWI/SNF complexes include BAFs 170, 155, 60, 57, 53, and 47 (SNF5/INI1) and actin (20Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 21Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Additionally “specificity” subunits like ARID2 (AT-rich interactive domain 2, BAF200) and Polybromo (BAF180) distinguish Polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) from BAF complexes, which are specified by ARID1 (BAF250) (23Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Orthologous “signature” subunits also have been shown to confer specialized activities to SWI/SNF complexes in Drosophila (24Moshkin Y.M. Mohrmann L. van Ijcken W.F. Verrijzer C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly some subunits exist as paralogues that are differentially expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, such as BAF60A, -B, and -C, and impart specific functions to SWI/SNF (18Simone C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly incorporation of distinct, mutually exclusive paralogues of the ARID1 protein family into SWI/SNF complexes determines whether SWI/SNF functions as a corepressor (ARID1A) or coactivator (ARID1B) of cell cycle control genes (25Nagl Jr., N.G. Wang X. Patsialou A. Van Scoy M. Moran E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Given the diverse nature of SWI/SNF enzymes and the requirement for some, but not all, of its subunits in embryonic stem cells, we investigated which complexes exist in pluripotent cells. Our results indicate that several BAF subunits form a core that is contained in the majority of SWI/SNF enzymes. Surprisingly in ESCs specific paralogues predominate in SWI/SNF complexes, and incorporation of related proteins is restricted by transcriptional repression of their genes. This indicates a reduced diversity of SWI/SNF complexes in pluripotent cells that is reversed upon differentiation, probably reflecting the need to regulate more intricate transcriptional programs. Our functional analysis of BRG1 in pluripotent cells revealed that SWI/SNF can both repress and activate target genes. We also identified novel stoichiometric components of SWI/SNF complexes, among them the PBAF-specific bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) protein. Using an RNAi-based approach for BRD7 and ARID1A, we showed that both BAF and PBAF complexes can play important roles in gene-specific repression and activation. Overall our results add new insights into how the composition of SWI/SNF complexes imposes transcriptional regulation on individual target genes. Cell Culture and Differentiation—293T and R1 mouse ESCs were obtained from ATCC. ES cells were cultivated on feeder cells according to ATCC guidelines. R201 cells, R218 cells, and their derivatives were maintained on gelatinized tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 15% fetal bovine serum and leukemia-inhibitory factor. For retinoic acid (RA) differentiation, leukemia-inhibitory factor was omitted, and medium was supplied with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid and changed daily. Lentiviral Production and Infection—Lentiviral expression vectors are based on pWPT-GFP, which contain an SV40-puro cassette. All transgenes are expressed by an EF1α promoter. Detailed maps are available upon request. Lentiviral shRNAs were constructed as described previously (26Tiscornia G. Singer O. Ikawa M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1844-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) for BRG1 and the control hairpin targeting GLUT4 (27Liao W. Nguyen M.T. Imamura T. Singer O. Verma I.M. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2245-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or purchased from Sigma (ARID1A, BRD7, and scrambled hairpin control). The targeted sequence in BRG1 is AAGCACCAGGAGTACCTCAAC. Lentiviral particles were produced and concentrated as described previously (28Tiscornia G. Singer O. Verma I.M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). To establish stably expressing cell lines, 105 ESCs were infected at low multiplicity and selected with puromycin (0.25 mg/liter) for 7 days. Cell lines R201 and R218 were derived by infection of R1 with viruses expressing Nanog-HA and Nanog-MYC, respectively, and single cell-cloned. Antibodies, Protein Purification, and ATPase Assay—For immunodetection or ChIP, the following antibodies were used: BRG1 (G7), BAF155 (H76), BAF170 (H116), HA probe (F9), TFIIB (C-18), TFIID (N-12), and RNA polymerase II (POLII) (H-224) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; BAF47 (612110) and BAF60 (611728) from BD Transduction Laboratories; FLAG probe (M2) from Sigma; BRM (ab15597) from Abcam; and BRD7 (51009-2-AP) from Proteintech. Antibodies recognizing ARID2, BAF57, BAF53, and J1 were generous gifts from Dr. Weidong Wang; ARID1A was from Dr. Elisabeth Moran. For protein purification and co-IPs, cells were lysed in DBP-IP (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors). After disruption by brief sonication, chromatin proteins were extracted by increasing NaCl to 420 mm. After pelleting insoluble material, protein complexes were purified using M2 FLAG affinity matrix (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were washed six times with DBP-IP containing 420 mm NaCl and 20 μg/ml ethidium bromide and eluted in BC0.1 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl) and a 0.5 mg/ml concentration of the corresponding peptide. ATPase assays were essentially performed as described previously (29Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 200 ng of purified SWI/SNF were incubated with trace amounts of 32P-labeled γ-ATP and incubated at 37 °C. DNA stimulation was performed with 20 ng of genomic DNA. Different phosphate species were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Multidimensional Protein Identification Technique (MudPIT) Analysis—Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated IP samples were resuspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5; reduced; alkylated; diluted to 2 m urea, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5; and digested with trypsin. The tryptic digests were supplemented with formic acid to 5% and analyzed using the anion and cation exchange MudPIT method as described previously (30Motoyama A. Xu T. Ruse C.I. Wohlschlegel J.A. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly the samples were loaded onto a 250-μm-inner diameter column with a Kasil frit containing a 2.5-cm reverse phase section packed with 5-μm, 125-Å Aqua C18 resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and a 2.5-cm anion and cation exchange section proximal to the frit. The anion and cation exchange section was packed with a 1:2 mixture of strong cation exchange resin (Partisphere 5-μm SCX resin from Whatman) and anion exchange resin (PolyWAX LP from PolyLC Inc., Columbia, MD). After desalting, this biphasic column was connected to a 10-cm-long, 100-μm-inner diameter analytical reverse phase column made of 3-μm, 125-Å Aqua C18 resin (Phenomenex). MS analysis was performed on a linear trap quadrupole mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a three-step MudPIT method with salt pulses at 0, 40, and 100% buffer C. Each full MS scan was followed by five MS/MS scans. The MS/MS spectra were searched with SEQUEST against a mouse International Protein Index protein data base using a 3-atomic mass unit mass tolerance. The search results were filtered with a modified version of DTASelect (31Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) with a 5% false positive cutoff at the spectrum level, requiring peptides to be half- or fully tryptic and a minimum of two peptides per protein identification. The false positive rate for protein identification is 2% or lower. SWI/SNF subunits were absent in the control sample (Fig. 1, no tagged subunit) except BRG1 (three peptides) and BAF53A (two peptides). Mowse protein scores are derived from peptide scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein hits. Peptide score is −10 × log(p) where p is the probability that the observed match is a random event. Individual peptide scores >27 indicate identity or extensive homology (p < 0.05). Chromatin IP—ChIP was performed as described previously (32Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with buffers described by Upstate with the following modifications: ∼40 × 106 cross-linked cells were resuspended in 2 ml of SDS lysis buffer and sonicated 4 × 8 s, power 4. Soluble complexes were diluted in 3 volumes of ChIP dilution buffer, and lysate corresponding to ∼107 cells was incubated with 2 μg of antibody (HA, TFIIB, TFIID, or POLII) or 2 μl of J1 prebound on 20 μl of Dynal protein G beads. After two washes in high salt wash buffer, two washes in LiCl wash buffer, and two washes in high salt wash buffer, complexes were decross-linked at 65 °C for 6 h. DNA was precipitated using 10 μg of yeast tRNA and 10 μg of glycogen. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed with 0.5 μg of total RNA, random hexamers, and SuperScript III polymerase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed on a Stratagene Mx3005P system using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). The error bars shown represent duplicate measurements from independent biological duplicates. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental materials. Composition of SWI/SNF in Pluripotent ES Cells—Initially we investigated which forms of the SWI/SNF multisubunit complex exist in ESCs. We used a strategy in which epitope-tagged subunits are virally integrated into the ESC genome. Affinity purification is then accomplished in a simple one-step procedure, resulting in native multisubunit protein preparations of high yield and purity (33Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We expressed several well characterized subunits to increase our ability to purify most of the compositionally distinct forms of SWI/SNF that may be present in ESCs. BAF47, BAF57, BAF155, BAF170, and BRG1 are all core subunits that associate with both BAF and PBAF complexes (Fig. 1A). To purify SWI/SNF from substantial amounts of homogeneously undifferentiated ESCs, we created the cell lines R201 and R218. Both were derived from the R1 ESC line by infection with lentiviruses expressing Nanog-HA and Nanog-MYC, respectively. Both cell lines exhibit morphological features similar to pluripotent ES cells and differentiate upon leukemia-inhibitory factor withdrawal or RA treatment (supplemental Fig. 1). We also compared gene expression in parental R1 and R218 cells in response to RA and found them to be very similar albeit with a slower Oct4 mRNA decrease in R218 cells. Additionally the R218 line was capable of differentiating into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes with efficiency similar to that reported previously (34Wobus A.M. Kaomei G. Shan J. Wellner M.C. Rohwedel J. Ji G. Fleischmann B. Katus H.A. Hescheler J. Franz W.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1525-1539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) (data not shown). SWI/SNF in Embryonic Stem Cells Is Composed of a Limited Subset of Components—To prepare purified SWI/SNF complexes, R201 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing a C-terminal FLAG-tagged cDNA of Baf47, Baf57, Baf155, Baf170, or Brg1. Except for BAF170, ectopic expression of SWI/SNF subunits did not lead to an overall increase in protein levels (Fig. 1B). To examine SWI/SNF composition in an unbiased manner, we purified sufficient material to analyze by silver staining and MudPIT. As shown in Fig. 1C, anti-FLAG eluates from ESCs expressing individual FLAG-tagged BAFs 47, 57, 155, or 170 or BRG1 contained a similar set of proteins, which resembles the subunit pattern observed in the initial SWI/SNF purifications (35Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting, mass spectroscopy on the individual bands, and differences in migration upon expression of the FLAG-tagged subunits (supplemental Fig. 2), we co-localized the known SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, ARID2, BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, BAF60, BAF57, and BAF53 with the indicated bands. The Majority of SWI/SNF Complexes Contain the Core Subunits BAFs 47, 57, and 155 and BRG1—We then examined by Western blotting whether any subunits were preferentially assembled into particular complexes by unique associations with other BAF proteins. We observed that the bait for the purification was in general slightly overrepresented (Fig. 1D). However, with the exception of the BAF170 sample, the preparations showed a remarkably similar ratio between the other examined core components. This is consistent with the notion that the majority of purified complexes contain all four subunits: BAFs 47, 57, and 155 and BRG1. BAF170 was below detection in all samples except where it was ectopically expressed, suggesting that it is rare in ESCs and that the lentiviral expression increased its abundance above normal, endogenous levels. As expected, its ectopic expression and incorporation in SWI/SNF complexes resulted in the replacement of one or both molecules of its paralogue BAF155, explaining why BAF155 levels are lower in complexes purified through BAF170. Because of the overexpression of BAF170, we did not analyze this sample any further. Several Paralogous Subunits Are Overrepresented by Specific Forms—A comparison of the samples by MudPIT revealed unique peptides of 14 previously documented SWI/SNF components in the four subunit-specific ESC and HeLa purifications (Table 1). The control sample only contained a total of five peptides from two different subunits (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because certain groups of paralogous subunits (BRG1/BRM, BAF155/BAF170, and ARID1A/ARID1B) share substantial sequence homology (>50% in each group), we only included peptides in our analysis that could be unambiguously attributed to one specific polypeptide. Because BRM and BRG1 are mutually exclusive subunits (21Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), the single unique BRM peptide in our BRG1 purification reflects the expected false positive identification rate of 2% or lower. We expected roughly similar amounts of unambiguous peptides when comparing the paralogous subunits within their groups as observed in our analysis of SWI/SNF from HeLa cells. However, we found that in ESCs specific paralogous subunits were preferentially incorporated. In the case of BRG1/BRM, our results suggest that the underrepresented protein BRM might exist in negligible quantities in ESCs in agreement with its low expression during early development (36Dauvillier S. Ott M.O. Renard J.P. Legouy E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the postmitotic neuron-specific BAF53B of which we could not find any unambiguous peptides (37Olave I. Wang W. Xue Y. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Also in contrast to HeLa cells, BAF170 and ARID1B had considerably fewer unambiguous peptides in ESCs than their counterparts BAF155 and ARID1A, implying that these subunits are less abundant. ARID1B-containing BAF enzymes were shown to interact with transcriptional activators as opposed to complexes with ARID1A that associate with transcriptional repressors (25Nagl Jr., N.G. Wang X. Patsialou A. Van Scoy M. Moran E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that in ESCs SWI/SNF might be compositionally better suited for a repressive role.TABLE 1Biased paralogue usage in ES cellsHeLa BAF47ESCBRG1BAF47BAF57BAF155BAF471823212115BRG13476484550BRM341122BAF1554467526237BAF170601214105BAF60A1934303227BAF60B171091511BAF60C25332BAF53A2538152518BAF572217212817PB5139373125ARID1A4861496450ARID1B3611141512ARID23018241416 Open table in a new tab Differentiation Increases Incorporation of Previously Under-represented SWI/SNF Components—Because we observed a surprisingly biased usage of paralogous SWI/SNF subunits in pluripotent cells, we examined the changes in SWI/SNF composition during ESC differentiation. We used RA for 2 and 6 days to differentiate pluripotent stem cells into restricted descendants. SWI/SNF complexes were purified from differentiating cells using a tagged version of BAF47 as described previously (33Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and compared with a preparation from undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2A). To identify subunit-specific changes, we performed Western blot analyses (Fig. 2B). Each SWI/SNF preparation was standardized to give approximately the same levels of the core components BAF47 and BAF57. Throughout the course of differentiation, we observed considerable induction of some subunits, such as BAF53, BAF170, and BRM. Conversely ARID2 and ARID1A decreased by day 6 of differentiation. BAF155 exhibited a decrease in the immunoreactive 155-kDa band but an increase in the signal at 120 kDa. Mass spectroscopy of this silver-stainable band at 120 kDa identified 18 individual peptides of BAF155, supporting the notion of a splice variant, specific cleavage, or degradation product of BAF155, which may represent the previously observed BAF110 (21Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). RA-mediated Differentiation Increases ARID1B at the Expense of ARID1A—Several distinct mechanisms could be responsible for the changes in SWI/SNF composition, such as differences in subunit transcription, protein stability, or variations in subunit incorporation rates. It was shown previously that differentiation leads to changes in cellular protein levels that are very similar to the variations we observed in SWI/SNF composition (17Yan Z. Wang Z. Sharova L. Sharov A.A. Ling C. Piao Y. Aiba K. Matoba R. Wang W. Ko M.S. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2008; 26: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether differences in subunit transcription might explain the changes in SWI/SNF composition by measuring their individual RNA expression levels (Fig. 2C). We observed little change, if any, in expression of Baf155 and Brg1, whereas considerable increases in Brm and Baf170 transcripts were apparent. This corroborated our measurements of protein levels and the indications obtained from MudPIT analysis of these samples (Table 2). We also detected a reduction in Arid1a message, confirming the decrease observed in Western blotting by 6 days of differentiation. Interestingly Arid1b exhibits an opposing phenotype revealed by the increase in both transcript and unique peptides in mass spectroscopy. Unfortunately we could not confirm this by Western blotting because we lacked antibodies that recognized ARID1B under these conditions. The compositional changes we observed by different approaches (and suggested by MudPIT for ARID1B) are summarized in Fig. 2D.TABLE 2Differentiation increases usage of previously underrepresented paraloguesESCDay 2Day 6BAF47443746BRG1606887BRM2120BAF15598123108BAF170215576BAF60A413839BAF60B122130BAF60C3731BAF53A212933BAF57262832PB927575ARID1A584966ARID1B71941ARID2453722 Open table in a new tab B-cell Leukemia Protein 7 (BCL7) Fa"

At least part of the impact of heparanase in driving the aggressive tumor phenotype is due to its effect on increasing the expression and shedding of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1, a molecule known to promote myeloma progression. The present work demonstrated that elevation in heparanase expression in myeloma cells stimulates sustained ERK phosphorylation that in turn drives MMP-9 expression. In addition, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA receptor expression levels increased, and blocking the proteolytic activation of either MMP-9 or uPA inhibited the heparanase-induced increase in syndecan-1 shedding. Together these data provide a mechanism for heparanase-induced syndecan-1 shedding and, more importantly, demonstrate that heparanase activity in myeloma cells can lead to increased levels of proteases that are known to play important roles in the aggressive behavior of myeloma tumors. This in addition to its other known biological roles, indicates that heparanase acts as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype by up-regulating protease expression and activity within the tumor microenvironment.

Heparanase is a heparan sulfate degrading endoglycosidase that becomes up-regulated in many human cancers causing significant increases in both the angiogenic and metastatic potential of tumor cells (1Vlodavsky I.

Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 2018-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Studies on tissues from human cancer patients strongly support an association between heparanase expression and poor prognosis, and high levels of heparanase are associated with a shorter postoperative survival time compared with cancer patients with low levels of heparanase (2Ilan N.

Experimental models have been used to extend these correlative studies in patients and have demonstrated an important role for heparanase in driving aggressive tumor progression. For example, pancreatic cells engineered to express heparanase exhibit increased invasiveness in Boyden chamber assays as compared with controls, and inhibitors of heparanase block tumor growth in an animal model of pancreatic cancer (4Koliopanos A.

Knockdown of heparanase expression in either lymphoma or melanoma cells using antiheparanase ribozymes decreases metastasis and increases survival in animal models (8Edovitsky E. Elkin M. Zcharia E. Peretz T. Vlodavsky I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Inhibition of heparanase expression by a heparanase-specific antisense approach inhibits lung and esophageal cancer cells invasion in vitro as well as the pleural dissemination of cells implanted into nude mice (9Uno F. Fujiwara T. Takata Y. Ohtani S. Katsuda K. Takaoka M. Ohkawa T. Naomoto Y. Nakajima M. Tanaka N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7855-7860PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of heparanase in cancer may not solely be due to its enzymatic activity because mutated, non-enzymatically active heparanase retains some biological functions. For example, heparanase enhances Akt signaling and stimulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase- and p38-dependent migration and invasion of endothelial cells, and this can occur via mutated heparanase that lacks enzymatic activity (10Gingis-Velitski S.

In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor expression is up-regulated in several tumor cell lines following their transfection with mutated heparanase and down-regulated in melanoma cells transfected with heparanase-specific small interfering RNA (11Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Edovitsky E. Levy-Adam F. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Overall the data from cancer patients coupled with experimental data from animal models strongly point to heparanase as a potent protumorigenic, proangiogenic, and prometastatic enzyme. Multiple myeloma is a devastating cancer that resides predominantly within the bone marrow microenvironment and is characterized by fatigue, intractable bone pain, renal failure, and recurrent infections. These effects result from widespread tumor dissemination with accompanying high tumor burden, cytokine dysregulation, osteolytic bone disease, and deposition of high levels of immunoglobulin light chain (12Barlogie B. Shaughnessy J. Epstein J. Sanderson R. Anaissie E. Walker R. Tricot G. Lichtman M.A. Beutler E. Kipps T.J. Seligsohn U. Kaushansky K. Prchal J.T. Williams Hematology. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2006: 1501-1534Google Scholar). The syndecan-1 heparan sulfate proteoglycan is expressed by almost all myeloma tumors and when present at high levels in the serum of patients is an indicator of poor prognosis (13Ridley R.C. Xiao H.Q. Hata H. Woodliff J. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 767-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dhodapkar M.V. Kelly T. Theus A. Athota A.B. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Br. J.

Blood. 2000; 95: 388-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the shed form of syndecan-1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (16Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because heparanase modulates the structure and function of syndecan-1 by cleaving its heparan sulfate chains, in previous studies we investigated its expression and function in myeloma. We discovered that enzymatically active heparanase is present at high levels in the bone marrow plasma of many myeloma patients, and this correlates with high microvessel density, suggesting that high heparanase is associated with poor prognosis (17Kelly T.

Using in vivo models we also demonstrated that heparanase promotes the growth and spontaneous metastasis of myeloma tumors to bone and that an inhibitor of heparanase potently blocks tumor growth (19Yang Y. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M. Miao H.Q. Kussie P. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2005; 105: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Yang Y.

Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2007; 110: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly heparanase also regulates both the level and location of syndecan-1 within the myeloma microenvironment by enhancing syndecan-1 expression and shedding (18Mahtouk K. Hose D. Raynaud P. Hundemer M. Jourdan M. Jourdan E. Pantesco V. Baudard M. De Vos J. Larroque M. Moehler T. Rossi J.F. Reme T. Goldschmidt H. Klein B.

This suggests an important functional link between heparanase expression, syndecan-1 shedding, and an aggressive tumor phenotype. The present study was undertaken to examine the mechanism by which heparanase promotes syndecan-1 shedding. We found that elevation of heparanase expression stimulates a prolonged ERK 2The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. 2The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. signaling by the myeloma cells. This signaling up-regulated expression of MMP-9 and uPA/uPA receptor (uPAR), which appear to work in concert to enhance syndecan-1 shedding. This enhanced shedding of syndecan-1 likely has an impact on tumor behavior, but more importantly, the up-regulated proteases are known to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and bone disease. Together these data imply that heparanase acts as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype in myeloma. Cells and Transfections—CAG cells were established from a bone marrow aspirate of a myeloma patient at the Arkansas Cancer Research Center as described previously (22Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). CAG and ARH-77 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. As described previously, the cells were transfected with either empty vector or vector containing the human heparanase cDNA to generate heparanase low and heparanase high cells, respectively (17Kelly T.

For construction of vectors carrying mutations in the enzyme active site of heparanase, mutations were generated at Glu-225 or Glu-343 as described previously (21Yang Y. Macleod V. Miao H.Q. Theus A. Zhan F. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Sawyer J. Li J.P. Zcharia E. Vlodavsky I. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13326-13333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Gelatin Zymography—After cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 48 h, supernatants were collected and concentrated in Centriplus columns with a 30-kDa cutoff value (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein in the concentrated media was quantified using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), and an equal amount of protein (50 μg) was mixed with non-reducing sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with gelatin (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was carried out at 10 mA for 2 h. The SDS in the acrylamide gel was extracted by incubation with 2.5% Triton X-100 solution for 2 h at room temperature, and gelatinolytic activities were developed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35 at 37 °C overnight. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue. Following destaining, sites of proteolytic activities were visualized as clear bands against the blue background of stained gelatin. For some experiments, cells were treated with recombinant human heparanase (kindly provided by Dr. Israel Vlodavsky and prepared as described previously (23Nardella C. Lahm A. Pallaoro M. Brunetti M. Vannini A. Steinkuhler C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1862-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) or MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem) (50 μm) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. NIH Image (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to quantify the bands. Western Blotting—For MMP-9 and uPA detection, serum-free media conditioned for 48 h were concentrated using Centriplus YM30 (Millipore), and proteins (20 μg for MMP-9 blots and 80 μg for uPA blots) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and probed with either rabbit anti-human MMP-9 antibody (Chemicon, Inc., Temecula, CA) or rabbit anti-human uPA (H-140) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Bands were quantified using NIH Image. MMP-9 within tumors was detected by Western blotting following their homogenization in lysis buffer (1:4, w/v) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. uPAR expression was detected in the cell lysate using a mouse anti-human uPAR antibody (CD87) (R&D System Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and heparanase expression was detected using a rabbit anti-human heparanase polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Hua-Quan Miao, Imclone, Inc.)

Equal loading of protein was confirmed by staining membranes for human β-actin (Sigma). For analysis of signaling pathways, equal amounts of cell lysate protein from heparanase high or heparanase low cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either of the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), rabbit polyclonal phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or rabbit polyclonal phospho-Src (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) followed by the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). After stripping, the same blots were reprobed with antibodies to total ERK, p38, or Src (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Knockdown of Heparanase by shRNA—Using the nucleotide target sequence (423GGAATCAACCTTTGAAGAG441) (6Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), a double-stranded oligonucleotide was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) to knock down heparanase: oligonucleotide 1, CGCGTCCCCGGAATCAACCTTTGAAGAGTTCAAGAGACTCTTCAAAGGTTGATTCCTTTTTTGGAAAT; oligonucleotide 2, CGATTTCCAAAAAAGGAATCAACCTTTGAAGAGTCTCTTGAACTCTTCAAAGGTTGATTCCGGGGA. The control shRNA includes a scrambled sequence that does not match any sequence of human genes: scrambled oligonucleotide 1, CGCGTCCCCGTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTTCAAGAGAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGACTTTTTGGAAAT; scrambled oligonucleotide 2, CGATTTCCAAAAAGTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTCTCTTGAAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGACGGGGA. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated between MluI and ClaI restriction sites on pLVTHM vector (containing the H1 promoter), and lentivirus was packaged by transfection of the pLVTHM vector and plasmids pMD2G and pCMV-dR8.91 (vectors and plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Didier Trono, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) into 293FT cells (Invitrogen). The conditioned medium of the transfected 293FT cells was filtered (0.45 μm), and the titer of virus was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and calculated by the percentage of green fluorescent protein-positive cells after 48 h postinfection of CAG cells. CAG cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 followed by cell sorting by green fluorescent protein expression. The reduction of heparanase expression was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting. For PCR, the forward and reverse primers were 5′-CGCGTAGTGATGCCATGTAACTGAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCTTCGATCCCAAGAAGGAATCAAC-3′ (reverse) for heparanase and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The PCR was performed as an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 32 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and ended by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunohistochemistry—Sections from tumors formed from heparanase low and heparanase high cells were deparaffinized with xylene and then rehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol and distilled water. Epitope retrieval was performed by steaming the slides for 20 min in citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0). Slides were washed and incubated with 2.5% H2O2 for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxide activities and then were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then stained overnight with rabbit anti-human MMP-9 antibody (10 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin and phosphate-buffered saline) at 4 °C. The sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) for another 1 h at room temperature. Detection was accomplished using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Photographs were taken using an Olympus BX60 System Microscope. Quantification of Syndecan-1—Equal numbers of cells (106 cells/ml) were plated in wells of 12-well plates in complete RPMI 1640 medium. MMP-9 neutralizing antibody 6-6B (Calbiochem) or MMP-9 inhibitor 1 (Calbiochem) was added to some wells. In some experiments the cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-human uPAR antibody, which blocks uPA activation (R&D System, Inc.). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cell culture media were collected, and the levels of shed syndecan-1 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay using an Eli-pair kit from Diaclone (Cell Sciences Inc., Norwood, MA). The standard curve was linear between 8 and 256 ng/ml, and all samples were diluted to concentrations within that range. Matrigel Invasion Assay—The invasiveness of myeloma cells was analyzed using Biocoat matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). The matrigel invasion chamber consists of cell culture inserts containing an 8-μm-pore size polyethylene membrane precoated with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix. 500 μl of warm RPMI 1640 medium was added to the interior of the inserts and to each well, and the matrigel was allowed to rehydrate for 2 h in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After rehydration the medium was carefully removed without disturbing the layer of matrigel matrix on the membrane. Cells (2 × 105) suspended in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium were seeded in the upper compartment of chambers. To examine the role of uPA/uPAR in invasion, cells together with mouse anti-human uPAR antibody were loaded into the upper compartment of the matrigel invasion chamber. 750 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, which served as the chemoattractant, was added to the lower compartment of the invasion chamber and incubated for 22 h. Cells that invaded the matrigel-coated filters were recovered from the lower compartment and counted using a Coulter Z1 Particle counter. Each assay was carried out in triplicate. Heparanase Enhances the Expression of MMP-9 in Myeloma Cells—Previously we demonstrated that up-regulated expression of heparanase enhances the synthesis and shedding of syndecan-1 from the surface of myeloma cells, thereby contributing to tumor progression by elevating levels of syndecan-1 in the tumor microenvironment (16Yang Y.

Because MMP-9 is known to be present in myeloma tumors we examined its level of expression by CAG myeloma cells expressing high or low levels of the enzyme. Western blotting revealed a significant increase in MMP-9 protein levels in medium conditioned by the cells having high heparanase expression as compared with those having low expression of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated a 3-fold increase in MMP-9 mRNA expressed in the heparanase high versus low cells, 3A. Purushothaman and R. Sanderson, unpublished observation. thus confirming the Western blot data. As we have shown previously, it is important to note that the level of heparanase expression and enzymatic activity in the heparanase high CAG cells is similar to that found in some myeloma patient tumors (17Kelly T. Miao H.Q. Yang Y. Navarro E. Kussie P. Huang Y. MacLeod V. Casciano J. Joseph L. Zhan F. Zangari M. Barlogie B. Shaughnessy J. Sanderson R.D.

Thus, the increase in MMP-9 expression by these cells is not due to an enhancement of heparanase expression beyond that likely to be found in the human myeloma microenvironment. To further explore MMP-9 expression in these cells, serum-free conditioned medium from myeloma cells was subjected to zymography. Heparanase high cells exhibited high gelatinolytic activity corresponding to pro-MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) as compared with heparanase low cells (Fig. 1A). Analysis of heparanase-transfected ARH-77 human lymphoblastoid (myeloma-like) cells also demonstrated a similar increase in MMP-9 enzyme activity as compared with heparanase low cells, suggesting that the up-regulation of MMP-9 is not cell-line specific. However, in contrast to what was observed in myeloma cells, zymogram analysis of heparanase-transfected MDA-MET breast cancer cells (a highly metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells) (30Bendre M.S. Gaddy-Kurten D. Mon-Foote T. Akel N.S. Skinner R.A. Nicholas R.W. Suva L.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5571-5579PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a decrease in MMP-9 expression as compared with controls.3 Thus, the effect of heparanase on MMP-9 expression may vary depending on the tumor type. To determine whether the enhanced expression of MMP-9 by heparanase high myeloma cells requires the enzymatic (heparan sulfate-degrading) activity of heparanase, we examined MMP-9 activity levels in media from CAG cells expressing heparanase mutated at the active site of the enzyme (mutated at amino acid 225 (M225) or 343 (M343)) (31Hulett M.D. Hornby J.R. Ohms S.J. Zuegg J. Freeman C. Gready J.E. Parish C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15659-15667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In previous work we demonstrated that these cells express high levels of heparanase protein but exhibit low heparan sulfate-degrading activity as compared with cells expressing high levels of wild-type heparanase (21Yang Y. Macleod V. Miao H.Q. Theus A. Zhan F. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Sawyer J. Li J.P. Zcharia E. Vlodavsky I. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol.

When the conditioned medium from cells expressing these heparanase mutants was analyzed by zymogram, the gelatinase activity corresponding to MMP-9 was not elevated as compared with cells expressing the active enzyme (heparanase high cells) (Fig. 1B). This indicates that heparanase enzymatic activity is required to enhance MMP-9 expression in these cells. We previously found that addition of recombinant heparanase to cells would enhance their shedding of syndecan-1 (21Yang Y. Macleod V. Miao H.Q. Theus A. Zhan F. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Sawyer J.

To determine whether recombinant heparanase would affect MMP-9 expression, recombinant heparanase was added to wild-type CAG cells growing in culture. Over a 24-h time period, the activity of MMP-9 in the medium of cells treated with 10 ng/ml recombinant heparanase was almost 3-fold higher than that from cells not exposed to exogenous heparanase (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the up-regulation of MMP-9 in the heparanase high CAG myeloma cells is not simply an artifact related to their transfection with the cDNA for heparanase and that heparanase can stimulate a relatively rapid increase in MMP-9 levels. Moreover this result provides further evidence that extracellular heparanase can influence behavior of cells that are not actually expressing the enzyme (32Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V.

https://openalex.org/W2125928172,"One of the characteristic features of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is the competence for self-renewal and pluripotency. To date, little is known about cell cycle regulation in these cells and how the cell cycle machinery influences hESCs properties. A common feature of human, murine and primate ESCs is the presence of a short G1 phase, which has been viewed as a time window during which stem cells are exposed to differentiation signals. We used the hESCs differentiation model and comparisons to human embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells to study the key regulators of G1 to S transition in hESCs. Our studies show that hESCs express all G1-specific CYCLINs (D1, D2, D3 and E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) at variable levels. In contrast to murine ESCs, most of the cell cycle regulators in hESCs show cell cycle-dependent expression, thus revealing important differences in the expression of cell cycle regulatory components between these two embryonic cell types. Knockdown of CDK2 using RNA interference resulted in hESCs arrest at G1 phase of the cell cycle and differentiation to extraembryonic lineages. This suggests an important role for CDK2 in cell cycle regulation in hESCs that are likely to bear significant impacts on the maintenance of their pluripotent phenotype."

The silencing phase can be mimicked in vitro by LPS stimulation. We reported that the TNFα transcription is disrupted in endotoxin tolerant THP-1 human promonocyte due to changes in transcription factor binding and enrichment with histone H3 dimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9). Here we show that the TNFα promoter is hypermethylated during endotoxin tolerance and that H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation interact to silence TNFα expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA interference analysis demonstrated that, in tolerant cells, TNFα promoter is bound by the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a which dimethylates H3K9 and creates a platform for HP1 binding, leading to the recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a/b and an increase in promoter CpG methylation. Knockdown of HP1 resulted in a decreased Dnmt3a/b binding, sustained G9a binding, and a modest increase in TNFα transcription, but had no effect on H3K9 dimethylation. In contrast, G9a knockdown-disrupted promoter silencing and restored TNFα transcription in tolerant cells. This correlated with a near loss of H3K9 dimethylation, a significant decrease in HP1 and Dnmt3a/b binding and promoter CpG methylation. Our results demonstrate a central role for G9a in this process and suggest that histone methylation and DNA methylation cooperatively interact via HP1 to silence TNFα expression during endotoxin tolerance and may have implication for proinflammatory gene silencing associated with severe systemic inflammation.

Epigenetic mechanisms generate heritable marks on DNA and N-terminal tails of histones that maintain stable patterns of gene expression and are crucial in regulating gene activity as they impact chromatin structure and dynamics. These chromatin-based modifications control the recruitment of specific transcription factors and/or chromatin effectors, thereby providing a mechanism by which histones and DNA modifications regulate gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Brenner C.

Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) and DNA on 5-cytosine bases, within the context of CpG dinucleotides, are two epigenetic marks whose increased levels are associated with heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing of several gene promoters (4Craig J.M. Bioessays. 2005; 27: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).H3K9 can exist in mono-, di-, or trimethylated state. Mono- and dimethylation are catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase G9a, whereas trimethylation is catalyzed by the methyltransferase SUV39h and is predominant in pericentric (constitutive) heterochromatin domains (1Brenner C.

This methylation is catalyzed by the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/b. Dnmt1 is the primary methyltransferase for the maintenance of hemimethylated DNA and is found mainly in pericenteric heterochromatin (12Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol.

The three variants of mammalian HP1 (α, β, γ) localize to regions of constitutive heterochromatin and euchromatin (2Dormann H.L. Tseng B.S. Allis C.D. Funabiki H. Fischle W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

This epigenetic mark correlates with disruption of TNFα transcription due to diminished binding of active NF-κB RelA/p65 and increased binding of repressive RelB protein, as well as binding of HP1. Endotoxin tolerance is defined by reprogramming of gene expression, including silencing of acute proinflammatory mediators, such as TNFα and IL-1β, in response to the stimulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 by bacterial endodoxin (LPS) (30McCall C.E.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA interference analysis revealed that the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a interacts with the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a/b to silence the TNFα transcription during endotoxin tolerance. This interaction is mediated by HP1. Dnmt3a/b and HP1 recruitment is dependent on G9a binding to the promoter, as loss of G9a results in a significant decrease in both DNA and H3K9 methylation at the promoter region and restores TNFα transcription. These findings suggest that H3K9 dimethylation by G9a is causative in the process of TNFα gene silencing and does so via HP1 and Dnmt3a/b. Our studies provide a functional connection between DNA methylation and histone methylation, in which HP1 plays an important role, and further support a model of interdependence between these two epigenetic pathways in proinflammatory gene silencing during endotoxin tolerance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and LPS Tolerance—The human promonocytic cells, THP-1, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For induction of tolerance (38LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), cells were incubated for 16 h with 1 μg/ml of Gram-negative bacterial LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma). LPS-tolerant and LPS-responsive (normal) cells were washed with minimal medium, cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated times.Methylation-specific Genomic Sequencing—To assess DNA methylation at the TNFα promoter, ∼150 ng of genomic DNA isolated from normal and LPS tolerant cells were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the methylSEQR Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol, to convert cytosine in the genomic DNA to uracil. Converted DNA was then purified using an affinity column.Sequence-specific PCR of the bisulfite-treated DNA was performed using primers specific to the human TNFα promoter designed using the Methyl Primer Express v1.0 (Applied Biosystems). The primers were specifically designed to screen a 300-bp promoter fragment containing 8 CpG doublets surrounding the NF-κB binding site at −98 bp (see Fig. 1A), and their sequence coordinates are: forward 5′-3′ (−349 to −336) and reverse 5′-3′ (−50 to −71). PCR was carried out in a volume of 50 μl containing 1× PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20–40 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Emeryville, CA). PCR conditions were: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min.DNA sequencing was performed using the POP7 sequencing polymer and ABI 3730XL Capillary DNA Analyzer as described previously (40Hawkins G.A. Tantisira K. Meyers D.A. Ampleford E.J. Moore W.C. Klanderman B. Liggett S.B. Peters S.P. Weiss S.T. Bleecker E.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 174: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this CpG methyl-specific sequencing, cytosine that is protected by methylation is read as “C” in the DNA sequence while unmethylated cytosine is read as “T”, the structural analog of uracil. All sequencing data were analyzed using the DNA analysis program Seqencher v8 (Gene Codes, Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and compared with reference sequences representing methylated and unmethylated DNA.ChIP Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to assess H3K9 dimethylation and chromatin protein interactions around the NF-κB binding site of the TNFα proximal promoter, using ChIP kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were harvested and proteins were cross-linked with DNA by the fixation in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 1% SDS for 30 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated to shear DNA using Branson 250 sonicator (two 15-s pulses at 40% power in an ice bath, with 1 min between each pulse). These shearing conditions generate DNA fragments ranging in size from 500–1000 bp. Chromatin solution was pre-cleared with protein G-coated magnetic beads for 2 h at 4 °C. 10 μl of the chromatin solution was reserved as “input” sample. The remaining chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of antibody specific to HP1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, RelB, IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), SUV39h1, G9a, or di-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The chromatin/antibody complexes captured on the beads were washed several times and then eluted in 50 μl elution buffer. The immunoprecipitated and “input” sample cross-links were reversed by incubation for 2.5 h at 65 °C. After treatment with proteinase K at for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped and the resulting DNA was stored at −20 °C until analyzed by standard and real-time PCR as described below. For ChIP reimmunoprecipitation (ChIP-ReIP) experiment, chromatin was first immunoprecipitated with the primary antibody (αHP1) and washed. Complexes were then eluted from the primary immunoprecipitates by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 25 min, diluted in IP buffer, and reimmunoprecipitated with the second antibodies (αSUV39h1, αDnmt3a/b). The remaining ChIP procedures were followed to reverse the cross-links and recover the DNA, as described above.Semiquantitative PCR—PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 5 μl of the ChIP DNA, 1 μm of each primer, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm dNTPs, and 0.04 units/μl AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each, and a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were run on 1.2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and images were captured using Quantity One Imager (Bio-Rad). The primers used in PCR were designed to amplify a sequence in the human TNFα proximal promoter region containing the κB3 site at −98 bp relative to the transcription start site (41Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and were as follows: TNFα forward (5′-TACCGCTTCCTCCAGATGAG-3′) and TNFα reverse (5′-TGCTGGCTGGGTGTGCCAA-3′).Quantitative PCR for Immunoprecipitated DNA—Real-time PCR was performed to precisely quantify the TNFα promoter sequence in the ChIP DNA. The same primers described above, labeled with an internal fluorogenic probe (5′-FAM-CTTGGTGGAGAAACC-TAMRA-3′), were used (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR reaction (25 μl) contained 5 μl of ChIP DNA, 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal Master Mix containing DNA polymerase and dNTPs, 300 nm of each primer, and 100 nm internal probe. Reactions were run in duplicates at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min (combined annealing and extension), using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). A IgG-immunoprecipitated DNA sample was also amplified as a negative control (data not shown). Sample data were normalized to the input DNA and are presented as fold change relative to DNA from unstimulated cells (0 h).RNA Interference—Exponentially growing cells were harvested and washed with sterile PBS. Control (nonspecific), or HP1 or G9a-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with a 3′-dTdT overhang were transfected by electroporation with 5 μl of (0.5 μm) siRNA in 100 μl of Nucleofector (AMAXA, Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immediately after transfection, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS, to induce tolerance. After 36 h, cells were harvested, washed with minimal medium, and left unstimulated or stimulated for 3 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. G9a was silenced by a pool of three target-specific 20–25 nucleotides siRNAs. HP1 was silenced by three pools of siRNAs.mRNA Analysis—Expression of TNFα was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 extraction kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX)). Two micrograms RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a 25-μl volume containing 0.2 μm dNTPs, 2.5 μm oligo d(T), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 units/μl of murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). The RT reaction was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C and 5 min at 99 °C. The PCR was performed using 5 μl of cDNA and TNFα and GAPDH predesigned TaqMan primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as described above. Sample data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA values and are presented as percentage change relative to mRNA from endotoxin-responsive cells (set as 100%).Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear proteins were extracted by incubating cells on ice for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Titon X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined. Whole cell extracts were prepared using the same nuclei lysis buffer. Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce). Membranes were blocked and probed overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of primary Abs against HP1, Dnmt3a/b, SUV39h1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and G9a (Upstate). This was followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized using high sensitivity ECL system (Pierce). Blots were stripped and reprobed with control Ab.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and are presented as the mean (±S.E.) of three independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between groups. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSTNFα Promoter Is Hypermethylated in Endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 Cells—Our previous studies showed that the TNFα promoter nucleosome is dimethylated on H3K9 and bound by HP1 during transcriptional silencing in endotoxin-tolerant cells (28El G.M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a phenotype that naturally occurs in blood leukocytes during the course of severe systemic inflammation in animals and sepsis in human where the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines is silenced after the initial induction phase that follows LPS exposure (30McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).We sought to determine the DNA methylation state of TNFα proximal promoter. This fragment contains 8 CpG dinucleotides around the NF-κB binding site and the TATA box (see Fig. 1). Bisulfite sequencing of the genomic DNA extracted from endotoxin-responsive (normal) and endotoxin-tolerant cells showed that most of these CpG doublets were methylated in greater numbers in tolerant cells versus responsive cells (Fig. 1). The total number of methylated CpGs in responsive untreated cells was assigned as 100% methylation and all other samples were calculated relative to this value. We observed a marked decrease in CpG methylation at 0.5 and 1 h after adding LPS to responsive cells. These two time points coincide with active TNFα transcription in endotoxin-responsive cells (28El G.M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). By 4 h of stimulation, the methylation level retuned to near 0 h level. However, the level of CpG methylation was significantly higher in tolerant-untreated cells compared with responsive cells, and remained significantly high at all the time points tested. We also observed that CpGs at −239 and −245 were always methylated every time the experiment was repeated. These results demonstrate that the TNFα promoter is hypermethylated during endotoxin tolerance, which may contribute to TNFα gene silencing.Histone and DNA Methyltransferases Bind to TNFα Promoter during Transcription Silencing—Our data indicated that, in tolerant cells, the TNFα promoter was hypermethylated on CpGs (Fig. 1) and dimethylated on H3K9 and bound by HP1 (28El G.M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These two epigenetic modifications contribute to gene silencing (1Brenner C. Fuks F. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 843-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Craig J.M. Bioessays. 2005; 27: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that histone methylation and DNA methylation may cooperatively interact to mediate TNFα silencing during endotoxin tolerance. In addition, HP1 may act as an adapter in mediating histone and DNA methylation through its binding to and recruitment of histone and DNA methyltransferases. If HP1 is indeed involved in the silencing of TNFα promoter, then its depletion will affects histone and/or DNA methylation. We used RNA interference and ChIP assays to test this hypothesis. Cells were transfected with a pool of siRNAs specifically designed to silence the three HP1 isoforms and then stimulated with LPS to induce tolerance. After 36 h, responsive and tolerant cells were harvested and stimulated for the indicated times. In the control experiment, cells were transfected with siRNAs not known to bind to HP1 sequences specifically. We first determined HP1 binding after HP1 knockdown. Fig. 3, A and B shows that HP1 binding to the TNFα promoter was markedly reduced after HP1-specific, but not control, siRNA transfection into responsive and tolerant cells. Also, HP1 nuclear protein level was markedly reduced after the knockdown (Fig. 3C). We next determined whether loss of HP1 would result in change"
https://openalex.org/W2163959161,"The ribosome catalyzes peptide bond formation between peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. Here, we show that the nature of the C-terminal amino acid residue in the P-site peptidyl-tRNA strongly affects the rate of peptidyl transfer. Depending on the C-terminal amino acid of the peptidyl-tRNA, the rate of reaction with the small A-site substrate puromycin varied between 100 and 0.14 s–1, regardless of the tRNA identity. The reactivity decreased in the order Lys = Arg > Ala > Ser > Phe = Val > Asp ≫ Pro, with Pro being by far the slowest. However, when Phe-tRNAPhe was used as A-site substrate, the rate of peptide bond formation with any peptidyl-tRNA was ∼7 s–1, which corresponds to the rate of binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site (accommodation). Because accommodation is rate-limiting for peptide bond formation, the reaction rate is uniform for all peptidyl-tRNAs, regardless of the variations of the intrinsic chemical reactivities. On the other hand, the 50-fold increase in the reaction rate for peptidyl-tRNA ending with Pro suggests that full-length aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site greatly accelerates peptide bond formation.

The enzymatic activity of the ribosome is to catalyze peptide bond formation. During the peptidyl transfer reaction, the α-amino group of aminoacyl-tRNA bound to the A site of the ribosome attacks the ester bond of peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, which results in peptidyl-tRNA extended by one amino acid in the A site and deacylated tRNA in the P site. The tRNA substrates are aligned in the active center of the ribosome by interactions of their CCA ends with 23 S rRNA bases (1Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A.

In contrast, no Pmn reaction was observed with the N-acetyl-Asp-tRNAAsp fragment (20Monro R.E. Cerna J. Marcker K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, the importance of the C-terminal amino acid of peptidyl-tRNA was demonstrated for erythromycin-dependent ribosome stalling in synthesis of ErmC protein (21Vazquez-Laslop N. Thum C. Mankin A.S. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 190-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Peptidyl-tRNA with a C-terminal Pro residue was reported to be exceptionally slow in peptidyl transfer to Pmn on the ribosome (22Muto H. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, the C-terminal Pro is essential for the tryptophan-induced ribosome stalling at the end of the tnaC open reading frame (24Cruz-Vera L.R. New A. Squires C. Yanofsky C. J.

However, the effect of different amino acids at the C-terminal position in peptidyl-tRNA on the reaction with aminoacyl-tRNA as A-site substrate has not been studied. Here, we systematically quantified the effect of various C-terminal amino acids in peptidyl-tRNA on the kinetics of peptide bond formation using both Pmn and full-length aminoacyl-tRNA as A-site substrates. Rate constants were measured using the quench-flow technique, and the effects of the amino acid residues and the tRNA identity were distinguished using ribozyme-misacylated tRNAs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBiochemical Methods—Experiments were carried out in buffer A (20 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, and 7 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Ribosomes from Escherichia coli MRE600, initiation factors, EF-Tu, EF-G, [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet, and [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe were prepared as described (12Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W.

The mRNAs used were 122-nucleotide-long derivatives of m022 mRNA (28Calogero R.A. Pon C.L. Canonaco M.A. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initiation complexes were prepared by incubating 70 S ribosomes (1 μm) with a 3-fold excess of mRNA; 1.5 μm initiation factors 1, 2, and 3; 1.5 μm[3H]fMet-tRNAfMet; and 1 mm GTP in buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C. Initiation complexes were purified by centrifugation through 400-μl sucrose cushions (1.1 m sucrose in buffer A) at 260,000 × g for 2 h (RC M120 GX ultracentrifuge, Sorvall). Pellets were dissolved in buffer A to a final concentration of 5 μm, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Total tRNA from E. coli was aminoacylated with 14C-labeled amino acids as described (29Kothe U. Paleskava A. Konevega A.L. Rodnina M.V. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To prepare EF-Tu·GTP· aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complexes, EF-Tu (1 μm) was incubated with pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml), phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mm), and GTP (1 mm) in buffer A for 15 min at 37 °C and added to aminoacyl-tRNA in 2-fold excess. Pre-translocation complexes were formed by mixing equal amounts of initiation complexes and ternary complexes. Translocation was initiated by addition of EF-G (0.05 μm) and GTP (0.5 mm) for 20 s at 37 °C. The resulting post-translocation complexes with peptidyl-tRNA in the P site were purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A at 4 °C. Fractions containing ribosome complexes were identified by 14C radioactivity and absorbance at 260 nm, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Ribosome occupancy with peptidyl-tRNA was ∼70% as estimated from the ratio of 3H and 14C radioactivity to the ribosome concentration measured by absorbance.Preparation of Phe-tRNAArg and Phe-tRNALys—t-Butoxycarbonyl-Phe-cyanomethyl ester (CME) was synthesized and deprotected as described (30Saito H.

Soc. 1991; 113: 2722-2729Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Purified tRNAArg, tRNALys, and tRNAPhe were aminoacylated by the RNA enzyme Flexizyme (Fx3) using Phe-CME as substrate (32Murakami H. Kourouklis D. Suga H. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1077-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fx3 selectively charges the 3′-end of tRNAs; in the absence of Fx3, Phe-CME did not react with tRNA (33Saito H. Suga H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7178-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). tRNA and Fx3 were dissolved in 50 mm EPPS (pH 7.5) and 12.5 mm KCl, and RNAs were refolded by heating for 3 min at 95 °C followed by cooling to 25 °C within 3 min. After adding MgCl2 (500 mm), tRNA (1 μm) was mixed with Fx3 (2 μm), and the reaction was started by addition of Phe-CME (10 mm) in Me2SO (final concentration of 20% (v/v)). After incubation for 2 h on ice, the reaction was stopped by ethanol precipitation. After two ethanol precipitations, the resulting aminoacyl-tRNA was used to prepare ternary complexes with EF-Tu·GTP.Rapid Kinetics—Measurements were performed in buffer A, except for the experiment shown in Fig. 2C, which was carried out in polymix buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 95 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm NH4Cl, 8 mm putrescine, and 1 mm spermidine) (34Jelenc P.C. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Time courses of peptide bond formation were measured at 37 °C in a quench-flow apparatus (KIN-TEK Laboratories, Inc.) upon mixing equal volumes (14 μl) each of post-translocation complex (0.4 μm) and Pmn or EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe. Reactions were quenched with KOH (0.5 m); peptides were released by alkaline hydrolysis for 45 min at 37 °C, analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (LiChrospher 100 RP-8, Merck), and quantified by double-label radioactivity counting.RESULTSRate Constants of Pmn Reaction with Different Peptidyl-tRNAs—The reactivity of different peptidyl-tRNAs was first studied with Pmn as A-site substrate. Compared with full-length aminoacyl-tRNA, the reaction with Pmn is slower and more sensitive to pH-dependent changes of the ribosome than that with the native substrate (35Bieling P. Beringer M. Adio S. Rodnina M.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, at high concentrations, Pmn can be used to monitor the rate of the chemistry step (12Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An alternative model substrate that includes the terminal CA of aminoacyl-tRNA (C-Pmn, puromycin attached to a cytidine residue representing the universally conserved C75 of aminoacyl-tRNA) has the same (low) affinity for the A site as Pmn (10Brunelle J.L. Youngman E.M. Sharma D. Green R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 33-39Google Scholar) and could not be supplied in saturating concentrations required to determine rate constants. At low concentrations, binding of C-Pmn to the A site appeared to be rate-limiting (data not shown), precluding its use at an affordable concentration. The reaction rate with the longer model substrate CC-Pmn (puromycin derivative corresponding to the complete aminoacylated CCA terminus linked to O-methyltyrosine) or the full-length substrate aminoacyl-tRNA on the 70 S ribosome is partially or completely limited by accommodation in the A site (10Brunelle J.L. Youngman E.M. Sharma D. Green R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 33-39Google Scholar, 35Bieling P. Beringer M. Adio S. Rodnina M.V. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2007; 388: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which makes it difficult to interpret the results for the following peptidyl transfer reaction.Post-translocation complexes were prepared with P site-bound dipeptidyl-tRNA of the type fMetX-tRNAX, where X was Ala, Arg, Asp, Lys, Phe, Pro, Ser, or Val (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1A). The complexes were mixed with excess Pmn in a quench-flow apparatus, and the time courses of fMetX-Pmn formation were measured at increasing Pmn concentrations (Fig. 1, B and C). The rate constants of peptide bond formation (kpep) were determined at Pmn saturation (Fig. 1C). The rate constants of the Pmn reaction with fMetX-tRNAX decreased in the order X = (Lys, Arg) > Ala > Ser > (Phe, Val) > Asp ≫ Pro from 100 s–1 (Lys) to 0.14 s–1 (Pro) (Table 1). The apparent affinities (K½) of Pmn binding to complexes with different peptidyl-tRNAs varied within the range of 4–35 mm (Table 1).FIGURE 1Pmn reaction with different peptidyl-tRNAs. A, experimental approach. Ribosome complexes with dipeptidyl-tRNA (fMetX-tRNAX) in the P site were rapidly mixed with Pmn in the quench-flow apparatus. After the desired incubation time, the reaction was quenched, and the tripeptide fMetX-Pmn was analyzed by HPLC.

Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which reveals two ionizing groups, the α-amino group of Pmn and a ribosomal group contributing to the rate observed at a given pH. To test whether the increased kpep observed with the positively charged C-terminal amino acids Lys and Arg may be related to an altered pH/rate profile, we measured the pH dependence of the reaction with fMet-Arg-tRNAArg (Fig. 2A). Measurements in the pH range from 6.5 to 8.5 indicated that fMet-Arg-tRNAArg and fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe exhibit a similar pH dependence. Assuming a pKa for Pmn of 6.9 (12Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the pKa for the putative ribosomal ionizing group was ∼7.4 for both peptidyl-tRNAs, and the rate difference between the two P-site substrates remained constant over the pH range studied. Thus, the higher reactivity of fMet-Arg-tRNAArg compared with fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe is not due to an altered pH dependence of the reaction, but rather reflects an intrinsically higher activity of fMet-Arg-tRNAArg on the ribosome.The ribosome accelerates the reaction between Pmn and fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe by 107-fold compared with the uncatalyzed peptidyl transfer reaction in solution (4Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodnina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Schroeder G.K. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4037-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The acceleration is achieved by lowering the activation entropy. The temperature/rate profiles measured with fMet-Arg-tRNAArg and fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe indicated that the reaction enthalpies were very similar and that the differences in peptidyl transfer rates originated from differences in the activation entropies (Fig. 2B). This observation supports the conclusion that peptide bond formation by the ribosome is an entropy-driven process (4Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodnina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the difference in the rate constants of peptide bond formation for fMet-Arg-tRNAArg and fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe appears to be almost independent of temperature, as indicated by the parallel lines in the Arrhenius plot, suggesting that the differences are observed at any temperature in the physiological range.The observed rate of dipeptide formation when initiation complexes and ternary complexes are mixed appears to depend on the buffer conditions, as an ∼10-fold higher rate has been reported for polymix buffer (37Johansson M. Bouakaz E. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) compared with buffer A used in this work. However, the rate of the Pmn reaction was comparable in polymix buffer and buffer A, and the large difference between the Pmn reaction rates with fMet-Lys-tRNALys and fMet-Asp-tRNAAsp was observed in both buffers (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the rate differences observed for various peptidyl-tRNAs are robust and are not limited to particular buffer conditions.Amino Acid Versus tRNA Identity—In addition to the amino acid, the tRNA molecule plays an important role during various steps of elongation, e.g. in determining the rate of decoding (38LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Fahlman R.P. Dale T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 799-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the above experiments, peptidyl-tRNAs differed not only in the C-terminal amino acid, but in the nature of the tRNA as well. Therefore, it was important to test whether the effects on the rate of Pmn reaction described above were due to the C-terminal amino acid or the tRNA identity. We addressed this question by studying the reaction with different tRNAs (tRNAPhe, tRNALys, and tRNAArg) that were charged with the same amino acid, Phe (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3A). The resulting Phe-tRNAs were used to prepare post-translocation ribosomes with fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe, fMet-Phe-tRNAArg, or fMet-Phe-tRNALys in the P site. Aminoacylation by the ribozyme produced functionally unaltered aminoacyl-tRNA because the rate of Pmn reaction was identical on ribosomes with peptidyl-tRNA containing Phe-tRNAPhe aminoacylated by Phe-tRNA synthetase or by the ribozyme (Fig. 3B). Replacing the C-terminal amino acid in fMet-Arg-tRNAArg or fMet-Lys-tRNALys by Phe resulted in a decrease in the Pmn reaction rate to the value measured for fMet-Phe-tRNAPhe (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the differences in the rates of the Pmn reaction with various peptidyl-tRNAs are due to the nature of the C-terminal amino acid rather than the tRNA identity.FIGURE 3Pmn reaction with misaminoacylated tRNA. A, schematic of the misaminoacylation procedure utilizing ribozyme Fx3 (32Murakami H. Kourouklis D. Suga H. Chem.

B, rates of Pmn (20 mm) reaction with fMet-Phe-tRNAX, where X = Phe, Lys, or Arg. White bars show the rates for aminoacyl-tRNAs that were aminoacylated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Black bars show the rates for aminoacyl-tRNAs that were charged by Fx3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction between Native Substrates—The rates of the peptidyl transfer reaction were also measured between P site-bound fMetX-tRNAX and Phe-tRNAPhe as A-site substrate. Strikingly, very similar time courses (kpep = 7 s–1) were obtained with peptidyl-tRNAs containing X = Phe or Pro (Fig. 4A), for which the rates of the Pmn reaction differed by >100-fold, suggesting a large acceleration of the peptidyl transfer reaction from fMet-Pro-tRNA to the natural A-site substrate. Based on the comparison of the rates of the reaction of fMet-Pro-tRNAPro with Pmn and Phe-tRNAPhe, the rate enhancement brought about by the full-length tRNA substrate in the A site must be at least 50-fold. Furthermore, practically the same reaction rates were obtained for X = Arg, Asp, Phe, and Pro or with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site (Fig. 4B). The observed rates reflect the accommodation of Phe-tRNA in the A site, which is rate-limiting for the peptidyl transfer reaction (35Bieling P. Beringer M. Adio S. Rodnina M.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V.

Peptidyl-tRNAs with longer peptide chains reacted with Pmn more rapidly than those with shorter ones (12Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Panet A. de Groot N. Lapidot Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which may result from reduced mobility of the longer peptide chains and thus better positioning of the reactive groups in the catalytic center of the ribosome. The length of the peptide had no effect on the rate of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in solution (41Novogrodsky A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect on the ribosome is due to the environment of either the peptidyltransferase center or the peptide exit tunnel. In fact, certain nascent peptides were shown to affect the activity of the peptidyltransferase center, indicating specific interactions between the nascent peptide and residues of the ribosome tunnel that are signaled to the catalytic center (reviewed in Ref. 42Beringer M. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2008; 14: 795-801Google Scholar).Although the length of nascent peptide affects peptide bond formation only in the ribosomal environment, the nature of the C-terminal amino acid of peptidyl-tRNA affects both ribosome-catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions (this work and Refs. 13Krayevsky A.A.

Experiments with tRNAPro misaminoacylated with different Pro derivatives suggested that the C-terminal amino acid has an influence on the reaction with Pmn (22Muto H. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control handles misfolded secretory and membrane proteins and is well characterized. However, less is known about the quality control of misfolded cytosolic proteins (CytoQC). To study CytoQC, we have employed a genetic system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a transplantable degron, CL1 (1Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G.

As shown previously, we observe that the ER-localized ubiquitin E2 (Ubc6p, Ubc7p, and Cue1p) and E3 (Doa10p) machinery involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) are also responsible for the degradation of the cytosolic substrate Ura3p-CL1. Importantly, we find that the cytosol/ER membrane-localized chaperones Ydj1p and Ssa1p, known to be necessary for the ERAD of membrane proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains, are also required for the ubiquitination and degradation of Ura3p-CL1. In addition, we show a role for the Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p complex in the degradation of Ura3p-CL1. When ubiquitination is blocked, a portion of Ura3p-CL1 is ER membrane-localized. Furthermore, access to the cytosolic face of the ER is required for the degradation of CL1 degron-containing proteins. The ER is distributed throughout the cytosol, and our data, together with previous studies, suggest that the cytosolic face of the ER membrane serves as a “platform” for the degradation of Ura3p-CL1, which may also be the case for other CytoQC substrates.

Mutation, errors in transcription or translation, and cellular stress can cause alterations in amino acids that may prevent proteins from attaining their properly folded, native conformations. Protein “quality control” is an essential process monitoring protein folding, ultimately targeting misfolded proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The importance of protein quality control is best exemplified by the numerous human diseases that can result from protein misfolding due to mutational or physiological causes and include cystic fibrosis, Parkinson disease, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency (2Gregersen N.

Scott M.D. Frydman J. Cell. 2005; 121: 739-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Park S.H. Bolender N. Eisele F. Kostova Z. Takeuchi J. Coffino P. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether distinct degradation pathways exist for different substrates and what overlap, if any, there may be with the ERAD-C pathway. The identification of many ubiquitin-proteasome components in yeast was pioneered using the Deg1 degron of the MATα2 transcriptional repressor. Deg1 is a transplantable, 67-amino acid sequence within MATα2 that targets the repressor for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (23Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A.

Selection for mutants that stabilized Deg1 revealed, among others, the ER-localized, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc6p and Ubc7p, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Doa10p, found to also be involved in ERAD-C (26Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that Deg1 has a nuclear localization signal and needs to be localized to the nucleus for efficient degradation and is in fact ubiquitinated by a specific nuclear subpopulation of Doa10p (28Deng M. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 2006; 443: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Lenk U. Sommer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39403-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deg1 is predicted to form an amphipathic helix, and the hydrophobic residues of the helix are crucial for its instability (30Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the context of MATα2, Deg1 is masked by interactions with the MATα2 binding partner, MATa1, and MATα2 is stable. In the absence of MATa1, Deg1 is exposed, and MATα2is targeted for degradation. Similarly, hydrophobic residues or other degradation signals in a wide variety of proteins, normally buried in the context of native protein conformation, may be exposed by protein misfolding and act as degrons to target the misfolded or binding partner-deficient protein for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this way, the Deg1 degron may resemble a misfolded protein when it is exposed. The hypothesis that degrons display characteristics similar to misfolded protein domains, in light of the insight gained through characterization of the degradation requirements of Deg1, has led us to make use of another less well characterized degron, the CL1 degron (1Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), to study CytoQC. The CL1 degron was identified in a powerful screen to identify genomic sequences that destabilized the cytosolic yeast protein, Ura3p, by targeting it for degradation via Ubc6p/Ubc7p (1Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The degradation of Ura3p-CL1 has subsequently been shown to be dependent on Doa10p and the proteasome (31Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Ravid T. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CL1 is a 16-amino acid sequence (ACKNWFSSLSHFVIHL) predicted to form an amphipathic helix that, like Deg1, depends on hydrophobic residues to function as a degron (31Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, our sequence analysis suggests that CL1 is an out of frame region of the yeast PMD1 gene. 3M. Maurer and S. Michaelis, unpublished data. Thus, studies of CL1 may also reveal insight into the fate of improper translation products. Here, we have extended the analysis of Ura3p-CL1 by analyzing its ubiquitination status and determining its additional degradation requirements. Interestingly, we find several parallels (in addition to the involvement of Ubc6p/Ubc7p, Cue1p, and Doa10p) between the degradation requirements of Ura3p-CL1 and ERAD-C substrates, such as Ste6p*, with misfolded cytosolic domains. In particular, we find a requirement for the cytosol/ER-localized chaperones Ydj1p and Ssa1p for the ubiquitination and degradation of Ura3p-CL1. We also find a role for the Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p AAA-ATPase complex in the degradation of Ura3p-CL1. Interestingly, when ubiquitination is blocked, a portion of Ura3p-CL1 localizes to the ER membrane, and access of CL1 to the cytosolic face of the ER is required for the degradation of CL1 degron-containing proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that the cytosolic face of the ER serves as a “platform” for the degradation of Ura3p-CL1, and, as the ER forms a reticular network throughout the cytosol, this may also be the case for many CytoQC substrates.

First, ubc6::HIS3 was PCR-amplified with 500 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence from MHY552 (27Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The PCR product was transformed into BY4742 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), and recombinants were identified, yielding a MATα ubc6::HIS3 strain (SM5347). This strain was backcrossed to SM4460 (BY4741; Open Biosystems), diploids were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to yield a MATa ubc6::HIS3 strain (SM5492). The ubc6Δ ubc7Δ double mutant strain (SM5362) was constructed by mating a MATα ubc6::HIS3 strain (SM5347) to a MATa ubc7::NatMX strain, generated by replacing the KanMX cassette of ubc7::KanMX (Open Biosystems) by recombination with the NatMX cassette generated from digestion of pAG25 (35Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) with NotI. After selection for diploids, cells were sporulated and dissected to recover a MATa ubc6::HIS3 ubc7::NatMX segregant (SM5362). The ubc6::HIS3 ubc7::NatMX doa10::KanMX mutant strain (SM5495) was generated by mating a MATα ubc6::HIS3 ubc7::NatMX strain (SM5361) with a MATa doa10::KanMX (SM4820). Diploids were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to yield a MATa ubc6::HIS3 ubc7::NatMX doa10::KanMX segregant (SM5495). Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. Relevant regions of all newly made constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid pSM1959 (2μ LEU2 SEC63-RFP) was generated using recombinational cloning to first replace the GFP in pSM1462 (CEN URA3 SEC63-GFP) (36Huyer G. Longsworth G.L. Mason D.L. Mallampalli M.P.

First, URA3 (including 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions) was PCR-amplified from pRS316 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adding flanking HindIII and SpeI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Following digestion with HindIII and SpeI, the insert was cloned into the same sites in pRS315 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a CEN LEU2 plasmid expressing URA3. HA and GFP with and without the CL1 degron were added by recombination of a PCR product encoding HA, HA-CL1, GFP, or GFP-CL1 into the region 3′ of the URA3 ORF, eliminating its stop codon, to generate CEN LEU2 URA3-HA (pSM2287), CEN LEU2 URA3-HA-CL1 (pSM2288), CEN LEU2 URA3-GFP (pSM2289), and CEN LEU2 URA3-GFP-CL1 (pSM2290). Plasmids pSM2291 (CEN HIS3 URA3-HA-CL1) and pSM2292 (CEN TRP1 URA3-HA-CL1) were generated by subcloning URA3-HA-CL1 from pSM2288 into pRS313 and pRS314 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, using the XhoI and NaeI sites. HIS3 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and recombined into pSM2287 and pSM2288 to exactly replace the URA3 ORF with HIS3 to generate pSM2293 (CEN LEU2 HIS3-HA-CL1) or pSM2318 (CEN LEU2 HIS3-HA), respectively. The plasmids pSM2294 (CEN LEU2 VMA12-URA3-HA), pSM2295 (CEN LEU2 VMA12-URA3-HA-CL1), pSM2296 (CEN LEU2 VMA12-URA3-GFP), and pSM2297 (CEN LEU2 VMA12-URA3-GFP-CL1) were generated by PCR-amplifying the VMA12 ORF (lacking its stop codon) from p414MET25-Deg1-Vma12-URA3 4Kreft and Hochstrasser, unpublished data. and recombining into pSM2287, pSM2288, pSM2289, pSM2290, respectively, resulting in the introduction of VMA12 upstream of URA3. The plasmids pSM2298 (CEN LEU2 TOM20-URA3-HA), pSM2299 (CEN LEU2 TOM20-URA3-HA-CL1), pSM2300 (CEN LEU2 TOM20-URA3-GFP), and pSM2301 (CEN LEU2 TOM20-URA3-GFP-CL1) were generated by PCR amplifying TOM20 (lacking its stop codon) from genomic DNA and recombining into pSM2287, pSM2288, pSM2289, pSM2290, respectively, resulting in the introduction of the TOM20 ORF upstream of URA3. CPY (PRC1) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and recombined into pSM2287 and pSM2288 to exactly replace the URA3 ORF with CPY to generate pSM2302 (CEN LEU2 CPY-HA) and pSM2303 (CEN LEU2 CPY-HA-CL1). Spot Growth Assay—Log phase cultures growing in selective media were diluted to an A600 of 0.1, and four serial 10-fold dilutions were made in 96-well plates to yield a dilution series in adjacent wells. 10 μl of each dilution was spotted onto the indicated media using a multichannel Pipetman, and plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C unless otherwise indicated. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—Cell extracts and immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (39Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 A600 units of cells were grown logarithmically in synthetic drop-out media and lysed by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol/NaOH. Proteins were precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and protein pellets were resuspended in trichloroacetic acid sample buffer (3.5% SDS, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 80 mm Tris, 8 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue). To remove N-linked glycosylations from CPY, 0.2 A600 unit equivalents of protein extracts resuspended in trichloroacetic acid sample buffer were treated with 1,000 units of endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C. Protein samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and blocking for 1 h at room temperature in 10% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science). For immunoblotting, all antibodies were diluted in 1× TBST containing 5% blocking reagent for 1 h at room temperature unless otherwise noted. HA epitope-tagged proteins were detected using the 12CA5 mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:10,000. GFP-tagged proteins were detected using the mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:2,000. Hexokinase was detected using rabbit anti-hexokinase antibodies (a generous gift of Rob Jensen, The Johns Hopkins University) diluted 1:200,000. Sec61p was detected using rabbit anti-Sec61p antibodies (a generous gift of Colin Stirling, University of Manchester) diluted 1:4,000. Ssa1p was detected using rabbit anti-Ssa1p antibodies (a generous gift of Jeff Brodsky, University of Pittsburgh) diluted 1:2,000. Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were detected using rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies to ubiquitin were generated by Babco (Hazelton, PA) by immunizing rabbits with purified ubiquitin. The antibodies were affinity-purified by C. Pickart against purified ubiquitin. For immunoblotting, these antibodies were diluted 1:4000 in 1× TBST containing 5% blocking reagent and incubated overnight at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1971078892,"Osteoporosis and muscle frailty are important health problems in elderly men and may be partly related to biological androgen activity. This androgen action can be mediated directly through stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly through stimulation of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) following aromatization of androgens into estrogens. To assess the differential action of AR and ERalpha pathways on bone and body composition, AR-ERalpha double-knockout mice were generated and characterized. AR disruption decreased trabecular bone mass, whereas ERalpha disruption had no additional effect on the AR-dependent trabecular bone loss. In contrast, combined AR and ERalpha inactivation additionally reduced cortical bone and muscle mass compared with either AR or ERalpha disruption alone. ERalpha inactivation--in the presence or absence of AR--increased fat mass. We demonstrate that AR activation is solely responsible for the development and maintenance of male trabecular bone mass. Both AR and ERalpha activation, however, are needed to optimize the acquisition of cortical bone and muscle mass. ERalpha activation alone is sufficient for the regulation of fat mass. Our findings clearly define the relative importance of AR and ERalpha signaling on trabecular and cortical bone mass as well as body composition in male mice."
https://openalex.org/W2167054778,"Background Colonisation of sessile eukaryotic host surfaces (e.g. invertebrates and seaweeds) by bacteria is common in the marine environment and is expected to create significant inter-species competition and other interactions. The bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata is a successful competitor on marine surfaces owing primarily to its ability to produce a number of inhibitory molecules. As such P. tunicata has become a model organism for the studies into processes of surface colonisation and eukaryotic host-bacteria interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings To gain a broader understanding into the adaptation to a surface-associated life-style, we have sequenced and analysed the genome of P. tunicata and compared it to the genomes of closely related strains. We found that the P. tunicata genome contains several genes and gene clusters that are involved in the production of inhibitory compounds against surface competitors and secondary colonisers. Features of P. tunicata's oxidative stress response, iron scavenging and nutrient acquisition show that the organism is well adapted to high-density communities on surfaces. Variation of the P. tunicata genome is suggested by several landmarks of genetic rearrangements and mobile genetic elements (e.g. transposons, CRISPRs, phage). Surface attachment is likely to be mediated by curli, novel pili, a number of extracellular polymers and potentially other unexpected cell surface proteins. The P. tunicata genome also shows a utilisation pattern of extracellular polymers that would avoid a degradation of its recognised hosts, while potentially causing detrimental effects on other host types. In addition, the prevalence of recognised virulence genes suggests that P. tunicata has the potential for pathogenic interactions. Conclusions/Significance The genome analysis has revealed several physiological features that would provide P. tunciata with competitive advantage against other members of the surface-associated community. We have also identified properties that could mediate interactions with surfaces other than its currently recognised hosts. This together with the detection of known virulence genes leads to the hypothesis that P. tunicata maintains a carefully regulated balance between beneficial and detrimental interactions with a range of host surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2088848243,"The redox state of tissues tends to become progressively more prooxidizing during the aging process. The hypothesis tested in this study was that enhancement of reductive capacity by overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a key enzyme for NADPH biosynthesis, could protect against oxidative stress and extend the life span of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. Overexpression of G6PD was achieved by combining a UAS-G6PD responder transgene at one of four independent loci with either a broad expression (armadillo-GAL4, Tubulin-GAL4, C23-GAL4, and da-GAL4) or a neuronal driver (D42-GAL4 and Appl-GAL4). The mean life spans of G6PD overexpressor flies were extended, in comparison with driver and responder controls, as follows: armadillo-GAL4 (up to 38%), Tubulin-GAL4 (up to 29%), C23-GAL4 (up to 27%), da-GAL4 (up to 24%), D42-GAL4 (up to 18%), and Appl-GAL4 (up to 16%). The G6PD enzymatic activity was increased, as were the levels of NADPH, NADH, and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Resistance to experimental oxidative stress was enhanced. Furthermore, metabolic rates and fertility were essentially the same in G6PD overexpressors and control flies. Collectively, the results demonstrate that enhancement of the NADPH biosynthetic capability can extend the life span of a relatively long-lived strain of flies, which supports the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging.

Collectively, the results demonstrate that enhancement of the NADPH biosynthetic capability can extend the life span of a relatively long-lived strain of flies, which supports the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which is the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic pathway serves multiple cellular functions, such as the supply of pentose intermediates for nucleotide synthesis, interconversion of 3–7 carbon sugars for various metabolic purposes, and the generation of reducing power in the form of NADPH. The latter metabolite plays an integral role in a broad range of cellular functions, such as (i) acting as a cofactor in reductive biosynthesis, (ii) detoxification of xenobiotics, and (iii) maintenance of the cellular redox state by providing reducing equivalents to antioxidative systems, among others (1Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The concept that maintenance of an optimal redox state is essential to cellular survival is now firmly established. Significant amounts of superoxide anion radical and its stoichiometric product, hydrogen peroxide, are generated in mitochondria and peroxisomes under normal physiological conditions (2Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide is detoxified by catalase and peroxidases. The activity of the peroxidases is dependent upon the availability of reduced forms of glutathione (GSH) or thioredoxin, and it results in the oxidation of GSH to GSSG and of reduced thioredoxinred (Trx-(SH)2) 2The abbreviations used are: Trx-(SH)2, reduced thioredoxinred; Trx-(S)2, oxidized thioredoxinox; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RFP, red fluorescent protein; MPA, meta-phosphoric acid. to oxidized thioredoxinox (Trx-(S)2). The reducing equivalents for the reductions of GSSG by glutathione reductase and thioredoxinox by thioredoxin reductase are supplied by NADPH (3Wolin M.S. Ahmad M. Gupte S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: L159-L173Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, the regeneration of two major cellular antioxidants, GSH and thioredoxin, is dependent upon the supply of NADPH. In insects, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase are absent, and their functions are assumed by the thioredoxin system, which consists of (i) thioredoxin, (ii) thioredoxin reductase (TR in Reaction 3), and (iii) thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx in reaction 2) (4Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Muller H.-M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for the reduction of GSSG and removal of peroxides by the thioredoxin system are as follows (Reactions 1-3). Trx−(SH) 2+GSSG→Trx−(S) 2+2GSHH2O2+Trx−(SH) 2TPx→Trx−(S) 2+2H2OTrx−(S) 2+NADPH+H+(TR)→Trx−(SH) 2+NADP+ REACTIONS 1–3 There are strong indications that the level of oxidative stress is elevated during the aging process (5Sohal R.S.

For instance, rates of mitochondrial superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide generation, as well as the steady-state amounts of the products of free radical attacks on macromolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, increase in the aged organisms (5Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Older flies become more prooxidizing with age, as measured by the ratio between GSH and GSSG (7Rebrin I. Bayne A.-C.V. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the old animals are relatively more susceptible to induced oxidative stress. In previous studies directed at testing the role of oxidative stress in the aging process, the most frequently used approach was to enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases, catalase, and thioredoxin reductase, in transgenic animals (9Seto N.O.L. Hayashi S. Tener G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Orr W.C. Sohal R.S.

In general, either there was little effect on longevity, or the life span extensions occurred in genetic backgrounds where life spans of the recipient controls were relatively short. Such effects were not replicated in long-lived backgrounds (14Orr W.C. Mockett R.J. Benes J.J. Sohal R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26418-26422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this context, we hypothesized that transgenic overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in Drosophila melanogaster and the consequent increase in the ability to synthesize NADPH would enhance resistance to oxidative stress and extend the life span of flies. The underlying assumption was that compared with the elevations of activities of particular antioxidative enzymes, augmentation of reductive capacity by the efficient supply of NADPH would support a relatively broader range of mechanisms of antioxidative defenses. Results indicate that the life span of Drosophila can indeed be significantly extended by overexpression of G6PD and thereby support the concept that oxidative stress plays a causal role in the aging process. Chemicals and Reagents—HPLC calibration standards were obtained from Sigma and prepared exactly as described previously (15Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Milli-Q grade water was prepared by reverse osmosis on a Millipore® water purification system. All chemicals were either analytical grade or of the highest purity commercially available. Construction of pP[UAST]-G6PD Responder Lines—A 2074-bp EcoRI-XhoI G6PD cDNA fragment was subcloned into pP[UAST]. Twelve pP[UAST]-G6PD transgenic responder lines were established by co-injecting pP[UAST]-G6PD and pTurbo DNA (16Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into Drosophila, y w early stage embryos using standard P element-mediated methodology. G1 progeny of injected flies were scored for the presence of the w+ marker gene. The presence of single pP[UAST]-G6PD insertions was confirmed by chromosome mapping and Southern blot analysis for six distinct transgenic responder lines, which were then backcrossed with y w for 6 generations to obtain isogenic stocks. The driver lines used for subsequent crosses were similarly backcrossed into the same background. G6PD Overexpression—Male flies, homozygous with respect to the pP[UAST]-G6PD transgene, were crossed with virgin females containing one of six distinct GAL4 drivers: da-GAL4, Tubulin-GAL4, armadillo-GAL4, or C23-GAL4 for broad overexpression in multiple tissues and D42-GAL4 or Appl-GAL4 for neuronal overexpression. The driver lines were provided by Dr. B. Rogina (University of Connecticut Health Science Center). Control flies were obtained from crosses in which the yw parental strain was substituted for either the driver or the pP[UAST]-G6PD responder. G6PD enzymatic activity was quantified in flies aged 7–70 days. Flies (four) were homogenized in 100 μl of ice-cold 0.01 m KH2PO4, K2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,500 rpm, 4 °C, the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Rates of NADPH production were determined by measuring the change in absorbance at A340 for 10 min (modified from Refs. 17Clark A.G. Keith L.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 565-607Google Scholar and 18Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, New York1971: 62-66Google Scholar). Evaluation of Reporter Gene Expression—A transgenic line carrying a UAS-AUG-DsRed insertion (Bloomington stock number 6282) was crossed to six different driver lines: da-GAL4, Tubulin-GAL4, armadillo-GAL4, C23-GAL4, D42-GAL4, and Appl-GAL4. The expression of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter gene was evaluated in whole-mount organ preparations or cryosections made from 10–14-day-old adult progeny using fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) and MetaMorph software. Life Span—Life span studies were conducted as described previously (16Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Flies tested in mortality experiments were reared at a constant density and collected within 24 h posteclosion. At least two replicate experiments were performed at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity for four responder lines combined with each of the six drivers, using ∼200 flies/line. Flies (25/vial) were transferred every 1–2 days into 8-dram shell vials containing a sugar-yeast-corn meal-agar medium. Experimental Oxidative Stress—Resistance to oxidative stress was measured by exposing 10-day-old male flies (n = 100; 25 flies/vial) continuously to reactive oxygen species generators, including 100% oxygen and paraquat, and scoring for mortality once or twice daily. For measurements of resistance to hyperoxia, flies were placed in vials containing standard medium, covered with nylon to facilitate the passage of oxygen, and transferred to a plastic container, through which 100% oxygen was passed at a constant rate. Flies were exposed to paraquat in vials containing six layers of Kimwipe soaked in 1% sucrose, 5 mm paraquat; they were scored once or twice daily and transferred every 1–2 days into vials containing a freshly prepared sucrose/paraquat solution. Stress experiments were conducted twice. Oxygen Consumption—The rate of respiration was determined using an Oxzilla Dual Absolute and Differential Oxygen Analyzer (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV), as described previously (19Orr W.C. Radyuk S.N. Prabhudesai L. Toroser D. Benes J.J. Luchak J.M. Mockett R.J. Rebrin I. Hubbard J.G. Sohal R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37331-37338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), except (i) groups of 50 male flies were used, with 25 each in two parallel chambers, (ii) the air stream, which was pumped from outdoors and scrubbed to remove water and carbon dioxide, was rehydrated immediately prior to entry into the respiration chambers and dehydrated after exiting the chambers but before entering the respirometer, and (iii) the calculated rate of oxygen consumption for each group was the mean of four consecutive chamber minus base-line estimations, with chamber sampling for 12 min and base lining for 8 min, and estimation for at least 4 min after stabilization of the oxygen concentration in the chamber versus reference channel in each interval. For da-GAL4 and C23-GAL4 genotypes, carbon dioxide scrubbing was repeated during the dehydration of air leaving the respiration chambers. Fertility—The lifetime reproductive output was determined using the armadillo-GAL4 driver. Reciprocal outcrosses of G6PD overexpressors and respective control flies to yw virgins were performed within 24–72 h posteclosion. Individual female flies were crossed with three yw males in vials containing standard medium supplemented with dry yeast. Fresh vials were provided daily for the first 2 weeks and every other day subsequently, and adult progeny were counted. Analysis of Oxidized and Reduced Pyridine Dinucleotides—Amounts of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH were measured in whole fruit fly homogenates by HPLC with fluorescent detection, by a modification of the method described previously (15Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, to prevent degradation and oxidation of pyridine dinucleotides, flies were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Ten frozen flies were homogenized in 200 μl of freshly prepared ice-cold solution, containing 0.2 m KCN, 0.06 m KOH, and 1 mm bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid, using 1.5-ml plastic tubes and pestles obtained from RPI (Mt. Prospect, IL). The homogenates were incubated for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then extracted twice with 0.8 ml of ice-cold chloroform, and the samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm PTFE Acrodisk CR 4-mm syringe filters obtained from Gelman Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). Filtrates were transferred to sampling vials and either analyzed immediately or stored at −80 °C for up to 1 week. NADH, NADPH, and cyanide adducts with NAD+ and NADP+ (CN1 and CN2 derivatives) were separated by HPLC, fitted with a Shimadzu Call VP solvent delivery system, using a reverse phase C18 Luna (II) column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3-μm particle size) obtained from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). A guard cartridge, C18 Luna (II) (3 × 4 mm), was used for column protection and replaced after 100–200 injections. The mobile phases for gradient elution were 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.9, containing 3.5% (v/v) methanol (solvent A) and 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.9, containing 6.0% (v/v) methanol (solvent B). A linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B over a 30-min separation time was used with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Pyridine dinucleotides were detected with a RF10-AXL fluorescent detector from Shimadzu (excitation wavelength 330 nm and emission wavelength 460 nm). Calibration standards of pyridine dinucleotides (1 mg/ml stock solutions stored at −80 °C) were prepared by appropriate dilutions of stock solutions in 0.2 m KCN, 0.06 m KOH, and 1 mm bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid. Linear relationships between the peak area and pyridine nucleotide amounts were established between 1 and 1000 ng for each standard. Each sample was injected twice, and the average of the peak areas was used for quantification. HPLC Analysis of GSH, GSSG, and Methionine—25–50 flies were immobilized on ice for 1–2 min, weighed, and homogenized in 10 volumes of freshly prepared ice-cold 5% (w/v) meta-phosphoric acid (MPA), using 1.5-ml plastic tubes and pestles obtained from RPI (Mt. Prospect, IL). The homogenates were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were filtered using 0.45-μm PTFE Acrodisc® CR 4-mm syringe filters, obtained from Gelman Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI); filtrates were transferred to sampling vials and either analyzed immediately or stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month. The procedure for detection and quantification of aminothiols (GSH, GSSG, and methionine) used here and the precautionary measures taken to minimize spontaneous GSH oxidation have been described by us previously (7Rebrin I. Bayne A.-C.V. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Rebrin I. Kamzalov S. Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Briefly, aminothiols were separated by HPLC, fitted with a Shimadzu Class VP solvent delivery system, using a reverse phase C18 Luna (II) column (3μ; 4.6 × 150 mm), obtained from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). The mobile phase for isocratic elution consisted of 25 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, a 0.120 mm concentration of the ion-pairing agent 1-octane sulfonic acid, 1% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 2.75, adjusted with 85% phosphoric acid. The flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. Under these conditions, the separation was completed in 30 min; GSSG was the last eluting peak, with a retention time of ∼22 min. Calibration standards were prepared in 5% (w/v) MPA. Aminothiols were detected with a model 5600 CoulArray® electrochemical detector (ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA), equipped with an eight-channel analytical cell, using potentials from +500 mV in 100-mV increments. GSH was monitored at +800 mV, whereas GSSG and methionine were monitored at +900 mV. Each sample was injected twice, and the average of the peak areas was used for quantification. Statistical Analysis—All analyses were performed using SYSTAT 10 or Microsoft EXCEL software. Differences in G6PD enzymatic activities, rates of oxygen consumption, and NADP+ and NADPH content were compared between groups by analysis of variance, with post hoc pairwise comparisons where appropriate. In studies of life span and resistance to oxidative stress, differences between survivorship curves were assessed using semiparametric log rank tests. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in mean life spans, using vial mean life spans as input data, in order to minimize the effects of pseudoreplication, as discussed previously (20Tatar M. Am. Nat. 1999; 154: S67-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Bayne A.-C.V. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Overexpression of G6PD—A total of six transgenic lines (responders) containing single pP[UAST]-G6PD insertions were subjected to preliminary studies of survivorship, prior to backcrossing. In the presence of the Tubulin-GAL4 driver, each responder line exhibited extension of life span; however, one of the responder lines was recessive lethal, raising the likelihood of an adverse, insertional position effect, and two of the remaining lines were derived from a single transformant. Consequently, four completely independent responder lines were selected for biochemical and physiological characterization. Enhancement of G6PD enzymatic activity was observed in all of the transgenic lines containing GAL4 driver. As expected, the magnitude of G6PD overexpression varied considerably among the drivers. In whole body homogenates, activity was increased 27–65-fold (Tubulin-GAL4), 33–97-fold (da-GAL4), 1.9–3.8-fold (arm-GAL4), 11–20-fold (C23-GAL4), 9–20-fold (D42-GAL4), and 1.8–4-fold (Appl-GAL4) (Table 1). In isolated heads and bodies (thoraces plus abdomens), the activity was increased 14–55-fold and 0.75–7.5-fold, respectively, in the presence of the Appl-GAL4 driver (results not shown).TABLE 1G6PD enzyme activity/mg of proteinGenotypeRateS.D.S.E.μmol/min+/G6PD4c0.160.060.04+/G6PD5f0.180.050.03+/G6PD7b0.150.040.02+/G6PD9g0.110.020.01arm/+0.120.020.02arm/4c0.300.030.02arm/5f0.450.060.04arm/7b0.320.080.06arm/9g0.440.060.04Tubulin/+0.160.050.03Tubulin/4c6.710.260.02Tubulin/5f8.430.450.26Tubulin/7b4.451.020.59Tubulin/9g7.370.490.28da/+0.150.060.04da/4c8.582.961.71da/5f6.131.330.76da/7b5.551.060.61da/9g10.972.791.61Appl/+0.200.020.02Appl/4c0.380.040.02Appl/5f0.720.120.08Appl/7b0.380.040.02Appl/9g0.350.010.01D42/+0.130.070.04D42/4c2.1000D42/5f1.930.460.26D42/7b1.400.330.19D42/9g2.250.920.652703/+0.140.030.02C23/4c2.220.680.48C23/5f2.260.470.34C23/7b1.650.350.25C23/9g2.280.880.63 Open table in a new tab Evaluation of Driver Tissue Specificity—RFP was used as a reporter to evaluate patterns of tissue-specific expression elicited by the GAL4 driver lines used in the present study. A transgenic line containing the UAS-AUG-DsRed insertion was crossed to driver lines, and red fluorescence was evaluated in whole mount organ preparations and/or cryosections made from adult flies. The UAS-AUG-DsRed transgenic line crossed to the reference y w strain was used as a control. The data are summarized in Table 2. Three of the drivers have been reported to exhibit a relatively broad expression pattern in adults (armadillo, tubulin, and da), and this was confirmed, although expression was by no means uniform. For instance, as observed in Fig. 1, there were distinct brain and ventral ganglion expression patterns for each of the drivers. Expression driven by the C23 driver was also relatively broad in adult flies, whereas previously it had only been characterized in embryonic tissue, where it was localized to transverse muscle. Regarding the neuronal D42 and Appl drivers, our results are consistent with earlier studies (11Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat.

As expected, RFP expression driven by D42 was quite prominent in motor neurons but was also observed in adult cardia and salivary gland. Distinct neuronal expression patterns were noted for all six drivers with overlap in the motor neurons and certain areas of the midbrain. Overall, the global drivers selected for this study exhibited a more patterned than uniform expression of the reporter gene, whereas candidate tissue-specific drivers permitted broader expression than expected.TABLE 2Tissue-specific expression of RFP in adult flies carrying a reporter gene construct in combination with different GAL4 driver linesTissueDriverArmTubDaC23ApplD42Brain++++++++++++Ventral ganglionaA pronounced expression of RFP was observed in motor neurons++++++Cardia±+++++++Gut++Malpighian tubules+Salivary gland±++++++++++Muscles+++++++Fat bodybA slight nonspecific fluorescence was observed in fat bodies isolated from both control flies and flies expressing RFP±±±±±±Oenocytes++a A pronounced expression of RFP was observed in motor neuronsb A slight nonspecific fluorescence was observed in fat bodies isolated from both control flies and flies expressing RFP Open table in a new tab Overexpression of G6PD Extends Life Span—Life span experiments were performed using all four responders in combination with all of the six drivers, typically utilizing 200–225 flies in each of two independent experiments for a total of more than 20,000 flies. The mean life span was greater in each experiment for every G6PD overexpressor genotype than for the corresponding driver/+ and +/responder controls (Fig. 2 and Table S1). These results represent a total of 102 comparisons, among which 78 individual comparisons revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). The magnitude of the increase, in comparison with the stronger driver control in each case, was up to 38% for arm/G6PD, 29% for Tubulin/G6PD, 27% for C23/G6PD, 24% for da/G6PD, 18% for D42/G6PD, and 16% for Appl/G6PD. The maximum life span (time to 90% mortality) was also extended (Table S1). Moreover, the longevity effects did not appear to be sex-specific. We conducted survivorship studies on females using two broad expression drivers (arm and Tubulin) and observed life span extensions that were comparable with those observed in the males (data not shown). Collectively, the results lend strong support to the hypothesis that increasing G6PD activity, either broadly or in neuronal tissue, is associated with extension of life span in Drosophila. Resistance to Experimental Oxidative Stress—In order to determine the effects of G6PD overexpression on resistance to oxidative stress, flies were exposed continuously to 100% oxygen. The survival times of three arm/G6PD genotypes were increased by 19–38%, p < 0.0005 (Fig. 3). Resistance to paraquat was also enhanced by 25–47% in two Appl/G6PD genotypes (p < 0.0005) and by 9–26% in two arm/G6PD genotypes (p ≤ 0.005 for G6PD 4c and p = 0.12 for G6PD 5f) (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Resistance to paraquat. Male flies overexpressing G6PD driven by arm-GAL4 (A) and Appl-GAL4 (B) were exposed to 5 mm paraquat. n = 94–98 flies/group. p < 0.01 for comparisons of mean survival times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxygen Consumption—The rate of oxygen consumption was measured in experimental flies overexpressing G6PD driven either by Tubulin-GAL4, da-GAL4, C23-GAL4, or arm/GAL4. The Tubulin/G6PD genotypes all exhibited significantly lower rates of respiration than the corresponding +/G6PD controls (p < 0.01), by amounts ranging from 20 to 29%, but there was no significant difference in comparison with the Tubulin/+ control. Respiration rates exhibited only nonsignificant decreases in da/G6PD and C23/G6PD genotypes (results not shown). The respiration rate was slightly lower in arm/G6PD experimental versus control flies (Fig. 5), but the effect was not statistically significant with respect to both controls. These results suggest that the life span extensions displayed by flies overexpressing G6PD cannot be ascribed to reductions in metabolic rate. Fertility—The fertility of G6PD overexpressor and control flies was determined in reciprocal crosses with the yw parental strain by counting the number of adult progeny. There were no consistent differences in female fertility between experimental and control flies, based on two different transgenic lines (Fig. 6); nor were any differences observed in male fertility (data not shown). Pyridine Dinucleotide Content—Comparisons of amounts of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH were made between da/G6PD flies and respective controls at 10 and 36 days of age. The da driver was selected for this experiment because the da/G6PD flies exhibited the highest G6PD enzyme activity among the G6PD overexpressors (Table 1). There were no significant differences in the amounts of NAD+ and NADP+ between the experimental and control groups at either age (Fig. 7). In contrast, significant increases in amounts of both NADPH and NADH were found in the older (36-day) experimental flies (da/G6PD 4c and da/G6PD 9g) versus controls. In the 10-day-old flies, small increases were also observed, but these only reached statistical significance in the case of NADH levels (Fig. 7). Glutathione and Methionine Content—Comparisons of amounts of GSH, GSSG, and methionine were made between da/G6PD flies and respective controls at 10 and 36 days. An increase in GSH/GSSG ratio was found in da/G6PD flies at 36 days compared with the control groups (Fig. 8). This increase was due to a significantly lower GSSG content in the da/G6PD overexpressors, whereas GSH was not significantly affected. Similarly, there were higher amounts of methionine in experimental as compared with control groups at 36 days of age (Fig. 8). The main finding of this study was that enhancement of the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, either broadly or in neuronal tissues, is associated with an extension of life span in transgenic D. melanogaster, the basis for which may lie in the observed modulation of cellular reductive capacity. Additionally, the increased activity of this enzyme was associated with enhanced resistance to experimental oxidative stress and could not be explained by a decrease in the metabolic rate or fertility. Neuronal tissue overexpression alone is sufficient to support a moderate increase in life span. Given that all six drivers confer overexpression in the motor neurons, based on RFP analysis, and in view of a previous report that D42-driven overexpression of SOD1 extends life span, it is tempting to speculate that the motor neurons are weak links wherein antioxidant overexpression has particularly beneficial effects on longevity. Notwithstanding, our analysis of driver-dependent RFP expression revealed other potential common regions in the mid-brain (Fig. 1), which could also represent candidate weak links, a possibility that is presently under investigation. Notably, the strongest longevity effects were associated with transgenic lines where G6PD is driven by armadillo and the other broad expression drivers, suggesting that one or more nonneuronal domains may also be weak links. Initial indications would point to muscle tissue as a candidate based on our RFP analysis (Table 2), which shows that muscle expression is associated with the four broad expression drivers but not the neuronal drivers. The use of drivers with greater specificity should help to test this notion. G6PD catalyzes the committed step in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts NADP+ to NADPH and diverts metabolites from energy production to biosynthesis. In this study, high levels of G6PD enzymatic activity were detected in an in vitro assay, but there were only modest increases in the levels of NADPH. These results are consistent with the tight regulation of both G6PD activity and NADPH levels known to occur in vivo. G6PD activity is inhibited by NADPH and is stimulated as the physiological demands for NADPH increase (23Luzzatto L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 146: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Post-translational regulation of the enzyme and feedback inhibition of NADPH levels modulate the redox balance in vivo (24Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Corcoran C.M. Fraser P. Martini G. Luzzatto L. Mason P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this context, the observed modest increases in NADPH, especially notable in older flies, may represent the enhanced capacity of the transgenic overexpressors to resist normal, age-related oxidative stress as well as the increased oxidative stress associated with exposure to 100% oxygen or paraquat. NADPH is an indirectly acting antioxidant, which participates as an electron donor in the regeneration of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin (26Kirsch M. De Groot H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It was therefore notable that the increase in NADPH was accompanied by an increase in the GSH/GSSG redox ratio in the G6PD overexpressors, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of GSSG. It may be parenthetically added that the latter constitutes less than 1% of the total glutathione content. Therefore, the observed decrease in GSSG amount in overexpressors would not be expected to have a readily discernible effect on glutathione content. Since flies do not have the glutathione reductase enzyme, which normally converts GSSG to GSH, the thioredoxin system serves in its stead. As depicted above, reduction of GSSG is thought to be mediated directly by reduced thioredoxin (Reaction 1), which itself can be generated from its oxidized form using NADPH (Reaction 3). The finding that an enhanced capacity for reduction of NADPH is associated with extension of life span provides support for the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging. Such support reinforces the conclusions of a recent study demonstrating extension of life span in Drosophila by overexpression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of glutathione (19Orr W.C. Radyuk S.N. Prabhudesai L. Toroser D. Benes J.J. Luchak J.M. Mockett R.J. Rebrin I. Hubbard J.G. Sohal R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37331-37338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In each case, overexpression of enzymes with broad effects on the cellular redox buffer system exhibited beneficial effects. NADPH, in particular, is both a direct and indirect determinant of the redox state, via the NADPH/NADP+ couple and the GSH/GSSG couple, respectively (27Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NADPH may also affect the levels of NADH via the activity of proton-motive force dependent transdehydrogenase (Reaction 4). The increase in NADPH in the G6PD overexpressors could dampen the forward reaction, providing a sparing effect that results in the increased NADH levels observed in this study. NADP++NADH+HP+=NADPH+NAD++HN+ REACTION 4 Thus, redox couple fluctuations, particularly those that might be occurring under prooxidizing conditions that accompany aging, might be deleterious at the level of antioxidant defenses and/or redox-sensitive signal transduction. Bolstering the capacity to maintain critical redox couple ratios may underlie the beneficial effects on survival observed in animals overexpressing either G6PD or glutamate-cysteine ligase. The results of both glutamate-cysteine ligase and G6PD overexpression are notable not only because the life spans were extended but also because these extensions took place in comparison with long-lived reference strains and were not accompanied by a marked depression of metabolic rate. A critical issue in the interpretation of life span studies involving transgenic Drosophila is the strength of the recipient strain. If the controls are weak, then antioxidant overexpressors could live relatively longer due to a remedial or compensatory effect. Alternatively, treatments that decrease energy utilization can extend the life span without exerting a direct effect on the underlying rate of aging (5Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). For flies overexpressing G6PD, mean life spans were frequently greater than 80 days and occasionally greater than 90 days, but there was not a simultaneous, statistically significant change in the rate of metabolism in comparison with both driver and responder controls. In contrast, overexpression of the antioxidative enzyme, superoxide dismutase, generally extended life spans in short- but not long-lived genetic backgrounds (28Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collectively, the results of this study suggest that an augmentation of G6PD activity and supply of NADPH in Drosophila improves the in vivo response to age-related oxidative stress. The fact that the life span of the flies is extended, both in the presence and absence of experimental stress and in a long-lived genetic background, provides powerful evidence supporting the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging.

https://openalex.org/W2143299485,"It is essential to understand the molecular processes underlying long-term memory to provide therapeutic targets of aberrant memory that produce pathological behaviour in humans. Under conditions of recall, fully-consolidated memories can undergo reconsolidation or extinction. These retrieval-mediated memory processes may rely on distinct molecular processes. The cellular mechanisms initiating the signature molecular events are not known. Using infusions of protein synthesis inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotide targeting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA or tPA-STOP (an inhibitor of the proteolysis of BDNF protein) into the hippocampus of the awake rat, we show that acquisition and extinction of contextual fear memory depended on the increased and decreased proteolysis of proBDNF (precursor BDNF) in the hippocampus, respectively. Conditions of retrieval that are known to initiate the reconsolidation of contextual fear memory, a BDNF-independent memory process, were not correlated with altered proBDNF cleavage. Thus, the processing of BDNF was associated with the acquisition of new information and the updating of information about a salient stimulus. Furthermore, the differential requirement for the processing of proBDNF by tPA in distinct memory processes suggest that the molecular events actively engaged to support the storage and/or the successful retrieval of memory depends on the integration of ongoing experience with past learning."
https://openalex.org/W2107162585,"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents the minimum maintenance energy requirement of an endotherm and has far-reaching consequences for interactions between animals and their environments. Avian BMR exhibits considerable variation that is independent of body mass. Some long-distance migrants have been found to exhibit particularly high BMR, traditionally interpreted as being related to the energetic demands of long-distance migration. Here we use a global dataset to evaluate differences in BMR between migrants and non-migrants, and to examine the effects of environmental variables. The BMR of migrant species is significantly higher than that of non-migrants. Intriguingly, while the elevated BMR of migrants on their breeding grounds may reflect the metabolic machinery required for long-distance movements, an alternative (and statistically stronger) explanation is their occupation of predominantly cold high-latitude breeding areas. Among several environmental predictors, average annual temperature has the strongest effect on BMR, with a 50% reduction associated with a 20 degrees C gradient. The negative effects of temperature variables on BMR hold separately for migrants and non-migrants and are not due their different climatic associations. BMR in migrants shows a much lower degree of phylogenetic inertia. Our findings indicate that migratory tendency need not necessarily be invoked to explain the higher BMR of migrants. A weaker phylogenetic signal observed in migrants supports the notion of strong phenotypic flexibility in this group which facilitates migration-related BMR adjustments that occur above and beyond environmental conditions. In contrast to the findings of previous analyses of mammalian BMR, primary productivity, aridity or precipitation variability do not appear to be important environmental correlates of avian BMR. The strong effects of temperature-related variables and varying phylogenetic effects reiterate the importance of addressing both broad-scale and individual-scale variation for understanding the determinants of BMR."
https://openalex.org/W2146057307,"Traditionally, the visual enumeration of a small number of items (1 to about 4), referred to as subitizing, has been thought of as a parallel and pre-attentive process and functionally different from the serial attentive enumeration of larger numerosities. We tested this hypothesis by employing a dual task paradigm that systematically manipulated the attentional resources available to an enumeration task. Enumeration accuracy for small numerosities was severely decreased as more attentional resources were taken away from the numerical task, challenging the traditionally held notion of subitizing as a pre-attentive, capacity-independent process. Judgement of larger numerosities was also affected by dual task conditions and attentional load. These results challenge the proposal that small numerosities are enumerated by a mechanism separate from large numerosities and support the idea of a single, attention-demanding enumeration mechanism."

This study used diffusion tensor imaging to examine frontal white matter structure in depressed subjects undergoing a 12-week trial of sertraline. We hypothesized that remission would be associated with higher frontal anisotropy measures, and failure to remit with lower anisotropy. Methods 74 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder and age 60 years or older were enrolled in a twelve-week open-label trial of sertraline and completed clinical assessments and 1.5T magnetic resonance brain imaging. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in regions of interest placed in the white matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and corpus callosum. Differences in ADC and FA values between subjects who did and did not remit to treatment over the study period were assessed using generalized estimating equations, controlling for age, sex, medical comorbidity and baseline depression severity. Results Subjects who did not remit to sertraline exhibited higher FA values in the superior frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortices bilaterally. There were no statistically significant associations between ADC measures and remission. Conclusions Failure to remit to sertraline is associated with higher frontal FA values. Functional imaging studies demonstrate that depression is characterized by functional disconnection between frontal and limbic regions. Those individuals where this disconnection is related to structural changes as detected by DTI may be more likely to respond to antidepressants. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00339066"

Integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelial ligands of the Ig-superfamily induces intracellular signaling in endothelial cells, which promotes leukocyte transendothelial migration. We identified the actin cross-linking molecule filamin B as a novel binding partner for intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Immune precipitation as well as laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed the specific interaction and co-localization of endogenous filamin B with ICAM-1. Importantly, clustering of ICAM-1 promotes the ICAM-1-filamin B interaction. To investigate the functional consequences of filamin B binding to ICAM-1, we used small interfering RNA to reduce filamin B expression in ICAM-1-GFP expressing HeLa cells. We found that filamin B is required for the lateral mobility of ICAM-1 and for ICAM-1-induced transmigration of leukocytes. Reducing filamin B expression in primary human endothelial cells resulted in reduced recruitment of ICAM-1 to endothelial docking structures, reduced firm adhesion of the leukocytes to the endothelium, and inhibition of transendothelial migration.

In conclusion, this study identifies filamin B as a molecular linker that mediates ICAM-1-driven transendothelial migration. Endothelial cells are highly specialized to create a relatively impermeable barrier between the circulating blood and underlying tissue. The endothelium plays an important role in the migration of leukocytes across the vascular barrier, which is essential for host defense and is an important aspect of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis (1Stemme S. Hansson G.K. Ann. Med. 1994; 26: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transendothelial migration involves initial tethering of activated leukocytes to the inflamed vessel wall, followed by the rolling of leukocytes over the endothelium (2Springer T.A.

The leukocytes then firmly adhere, which is followed by spreading and migration across the endothelium. Firm adhesion between leukocytes and the endothelium is mediated by interactions between leukocyte integrins and endothelial immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules (Ig-CAMs), such as the intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) 4The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1; FRAP, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TEM, transendothelial migration; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 4The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1; FRAP, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TEM, transendothelial migration; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 876-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is composed of five extracellular Ig-like repeats, a single transmembrane spanning part and a short intracellular domain consisting of 28 amino acids.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293, COS-7, HL60, and HeLa were maintained in (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium) (BioWhittaker, Verviers Belgium) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Breda The Netherlands), 300 μg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Cambrex (Baltimore, MD) and cultured during regular passaging and for experiments following fibronectin (10 μg/ml) coating of the (Sigma) tissue culture flasks (Invitrogen) or glass slides in EGM2 containing singlequots (Lonza, Baltimore, MD). Endothelial cells were cultured until passage 9. For siRNA transfection experiments early passages (<5) were used. siRNA Transfections—For siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Caveolin-1, filamin A, and filamin B the following sequences were used: Caveolin-1, 5′-AAUCUCAAUCAGGAAGCUC-3′; filamin A, 5′-CACAGAAAUUGACCAAGAUAAGUAU-3′; filamin B, 5′-GCCCAUUUACCGUGAAGAU-3′. Oligos were purchased from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium); control siRNA was used from Dharmacon (Perbio, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). An expression construct for ICAM-1-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. F. Sanchez (University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain), hemagglutinin-tagged filamin B and filamin A repeats 19–24 as well as the GST-filamin B-(19–24) and the GST-filamin B-var-(19–24) were a kind gift from Dr. A. Sonnenberg (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Double strand siRNA oligos were transfected in HUVEC using Interferin transfection reagent and transfection medium (Tebu-Bio, Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used to transfect siRNA oligos and expression constructs in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected when ∼70% confluent. 0.300 μmol of siRNA was diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM and left for 5 min at room temperature. 15 μl of Oligofectamine was mixed with 60 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, the two mixtures were pooled and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the cells for 6 h and replaced with fresh culture medium. Both HeLa cells and HUVEC were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibody (mAb) to ICAM-1 and anti-ICAM-1-fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); the anti-VCAM-1 mAb was from Beckman Coulter (Marseille, France); the goat polyclonal Ab to VCAM-1 (C-19) was purchased from Tebu-Bio. Filamin A mAb was purchased from Serotec (Oxford UK); polyclonal filamin B Ab was from Millipore (Amsterdam, The Netherlands); the polyclonal caveolin-1 Ab was from BD Transduction Laboratories; mAb anti-hemagglutinin (12CA5) was from Boehringer (Almere, The Netherlands); isotype control IgG was from Sanquin (Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Alexa 488-labeled chicken anti-mouse, Alexa 488 chicken anti-rabbit, Alexa 594 chicken anti-mouse, Alexa 594 chicken anti-rabbit, and Alexa 647 chicken anti-goat were purchased from Invitrogen. For F-actin staining BODIPY-650/665-phalloidin and Texas Red-phalloidin were used (Invitrogen). Coating of Beads—Magnetic goat anti-mouse IgG-coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were coated with ICAM-1 mAb, VCAM-1 mAb, or IgG isotype control according to the manufacturer's protocol. In short, beads were washed with ice-cold PBS (+0.1% BSA, 2 mm EDTA) and incubated with 1 μg of antibody per 1 × 107 beads for 45 min at 4 °C under constant head over head rotation. The beads were subsequently washed twice to remove any unbound antibody. Polystyrene 10 and 3-μm beads (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) were coated with antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Beads were washed in PBS and incubated overnight with glutaraldehyde at room temperature under constant rotation. Beads were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1 μg of antibody per 2 × 106 beads for 4–5 h. After washing, the beads were incubated in 0.5 m ethanolamine in PBS for 30 min and subsequently washed and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 30 min. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Silver Staining—SDS-PAGE samples were analyzed on 7.5, 10, or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels depending on the size of the proteins of interest and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Following blocking in 5% low fat milk in TBST (Tris-bufferd saline, Tween 20) the blots were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times for 10 min in TBST, and subsequently incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (dilution: 1:7000) in TBST for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by washing 3 times with TBST for 20 min each and development of the blot by ECL (GE Healthcare). For silver staining, and subsequent mass spectrometry, pre-cast gradient 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, reduced, alkylated, and in-gel digested using trypsin (modified, sequencing grade, Promega) as previously described (40Steen H. Pandey A. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Science's STKE. 2002; 2002: L16Google Scholar). After digestion, peptides were collected using two rounds of extraction with 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at -20 °C prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. For LC-MS analysis, samples were injected onto a nano-LC system (Ultimate, Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a peptide trap column (Pepmap 100, 0.3 inner diameter × 1 mm) and an analytical column (Pepmap 100, 0.075 inner diameter × 150 mm, Dionex). The mobile phases consisted of (A) 0.04% formic acid, 0.4% acetonitrile and (B) 0.04% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile. A 45-min linear gradient from 0 to 60% B was applied at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The outlet of the LC system was coupled to an HCT ion-trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) using a nano-electrospray ionization source. Eluting peptides were analyzed in the data dependent MS/MS mode over a 400–1600 m/z range. Mass spectra were evaluated using the Data Analysis 3.1 software package (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). MS/MS spectra were searched against the human IPI data base using the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK), allowing mass tolerances of 1.5 Da for MS and 0.5 Da for MS/MS and one missed cleavage site. Carbamidomethylcysteine was taken as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. Pull-down Assay and Immunoprecipitation—A synthetic, biotinylated peptide encoding the intracellular domain of human ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or empty beads were used in pull-down assays as previously described (41ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The following sequences were synthesized from the N to C terminus: ICAM-1, NH2-RQRKIKKYRLQQAQKGTPMKPNTQATPPCOOH; VCAM-1, NH2-IIYFARKANMKGSYSLVEAQKSKVCOOH. A confluent HUVEC monolayer in a 100-mm Petri dish was washed with cold PBS (+ 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2) and lysed in cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini EDTA, Roche) for 5 min. After lysis, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C). Supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of biotinylated peptide comprising the intracellular tail of ICAM-1 or indicated controls and 30 μl (concentration of 2.4 mg/ml packed gel) of streptavidin beads for 2–3 h under constant head over head rotation at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Alternatively, antibody-coated magnetic beads were resuspended in EGM2 and incubated on a HUVEC monolayer at a concentration of ∼4–8 beads per cell for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. For subsequent immunoprecipitation, cells were gently washed in cold PBS (supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2) to remove unbound beads and lysed in cold RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS Beads were extracted from cell lysates using a magnetic pen (PickPen 1M, BioNobile), and subsequently washed five times in a Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) to reduce coagulation of the beads, 15 units of DNase I (Fermentas, Germany) was added to the lysis buffer and in the first washing step. Finally, beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for ICAM-1. Additionally, a pull-down assay was performed using GST-filamin B-(19–24) and GST-filamin B-var-(19–24)-GST recombinant protein as described by van der Flier et al. (32van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GST proteins were purified from BL21 bacteria as described (41ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and isolated from GST beads using PreScission Protease according to the manufacturer's protocol. Supernatant containing the filamin-GST proteins was used in a pull-down experiment as described above. Transmigration and Adhesion Assay—Transmigration was analyzed using Transwell permeable supports from Costar (d = 6.5 mm; 5 μm pore size). A monolayer of HeLa ICAM-1-GFP expressing cells were cultured on the filter and transfected with siRNA for filamin B or with control siRNA (Dharmacon). The cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well 24 h after transfection and subsequently cultured for an additional 24 h. The monolayer was then washed once with migration medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium) 2% FCS without antibiotics) and 1 × 105 differentiated HL60 cells (4 days, 1.3% DMSO supplemented to culture medium) were transferred to the upper compartment and cells were allowed to migrate for 2 h toward the lower chamber in a chemotactic gradient with SDF-1. The number of migrated HL60 cells is quantified by flow cytometry using count beads according to van Hennik et al. (42van Hennik P.B. ten Klooster J.P. Halstead J.R. Voermans C. Anthony E.C. Divecha N. Hordijk P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39166-39175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following the migration assay, the monolayer was fixed, permeabilized, stained with Texas Red-phalloidin to visualize F-actin and analyzed by microscopy to ensure that the monolayer was confluent. Transmigration under Flow—Primary HUVECs were cultured to confluence in EGM2 (Cambrex) on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips transfected with either control or filamin B siRNA according to manufacturer's protocol using siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α overnight. Next, cells were mounted onto the microscope stage using a POC-mini chamber system (LaCon, Staig, Germany) and connected to a perfusion pump. Using physiological flow conditions (5 dyns/cm2), 1 × 106 differentiated HL60 cells/ml were perfused over the endothelial cells, followed by another 20 min of fluid-flow. Transmigration was characterized by adhesive cells crossing the monolayer during this time frame, changing from a bright to a dim appearance (see Fig. 8C). Migrated cells were quantified by counting per field-of-view. From one experiment, five fields were analyzed. Adhesion of anti-ICAM-1 antibody-coated beads was analyzed in a 24-well plate containing fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. HeLa-expressing ICAM-1-GFP cells, transfected with control or filamin B siRNA were cultured on the coverslips to confluence. Cells were left on ice for 3 min and equal amounts of anti-ICAM-1-coated beads (10 μm diameter) were added. Cells were left on ice for an additional 3 min to allow sedimentation of the beads onto the monolayer. Subsequently the beads were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and transferred onto ice again. Next, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Confocal microscopy was used to make overviews at fixed positions in the coverslips. Subsequently the total number of beads were counted using Zeiss LSM Image software. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, HUVECs or HeLa ICAM-1-GFP cells were grown on fibronectin-coated 14- or 30-mm coverslips. After treatment, cells were washed in cold PBSA (PBS, 0.1% BSA) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After fixation, cells were permeabilized in PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min followed by a blocking step in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA. Cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies and after each step, washed 3 times in PBSA. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Peterborough UK) or Mowiol 4–88 reagent (Calbiochem) on microscope slides. For live cell imaging, HeLa ICAM-1-GFP, or controls were seeded on 30-mm coverslips and transfected with filamin B siRNA and siGlow (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were transferred to the POC-mini chamber system and mounted onto a heating block connected to a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). FRAP (fluorescent recovery after photobleaching) experiments were performed using 30 iterations with 488-nm laser illumination, at maximum power (25 milliwatts). Fluorescence recovery was measured by time lapse imaging. Image analysis was performed with LSM 510 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Graph-Pad Prism 4 was used for statistical analysis and nonlinear regression. For curve fitting a one exponential association was used (equatison; Y = Ymax (1 - exp(-K × X)), which starts at zero and ascends to Ymax with a rate constant K in which Ymax represents the mobile fraction and K represents the time characteristics of the curve. Identification of Proteins Associating to the Intracellular Domain of ICAM-1—Although the intracellular domain of ICAM-1 is short (28 amino acids) and contains no identified signaling domains, it has been shown that the lack of the intracellular tail of ICAM-1 results in a decrease of leukocyte transmigration and a loss of formation of apical cups around adhered leukocytes (4Lyck R. Reiss Y. Gerwin N. Greenwood J. Adamson P. Engelhardt B. Blood. 2003; 102: 3675-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Greenwood J. Amos C.L. Walters C.E. Couraud P.O. Lyck R.

Cell. 2007; 18: 2322-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the ICAM-1 intracellular tail initiates signaling pathways involved in TEM. To identify proteins that bind to the intracellular domain of ICAM-1 we performed pull-down assays with lysates of primary HUVEC using biotinylated peptides encoding the intracellular tail of ICAM-1. Following capture with streptavidin-coated beads, peptide-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1A). A peptide encoding the VCAM-1 intracellular domain was used as a specificity control. The most prominent protein band specifically interacting with the ICAM-1 peptide (migrating at an molecular mass above 200 kDa) was analyzed by mass spectrometry and identified as the cytoskeletal linker protein filamin B. To confirm the interaction of filamin B with the intracellular domain of ICAM-1, peptide-binding proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and filamin B was identified by Western blot. Fig. 1B shows that filamin B specifically binds to the intracellular domain of ICAM-1 and not to the intracellular domain of VCAM-1 or to streptavidin beads. There are three filamin homologues expressed in human, filamin A and filamin B, which are ubiquitously expressed, and a muscle-specific filamin C. Because filamin A and B share 70% sequence homology, we also tested the binding of filamin A to the ICAM-1 cytoplasmic domain. Like filamin B, filamin A also interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1, albeit less efficiently (Fig. 1B). In addition to filamin B, we detected another protein of ∼20 kDa binding to ICAM-1 (Fig. 1A). This protein was identified by Western blotting as caveolin-1. Recently, caveolin-1 has been reported to play a key role in ICAM-1-mediated transendothelial migration of T-lymphocytes (30Millan J. Hewlett L. Glyn M. Toomre D. Clark P. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolin-1 was previously reported to interact with filamin A and filamin B (30Millan J. Hewlett L. Glyn M. Toomre D. Clark P. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 31Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, ICAM-1 may form a complex with filamin proteins and caveolin-1 to mediate leukocyte transmigration. Filamin is a 280-kDa protein comprising an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a rod domain composed of 24 homologous repeats. We tested which region in filamin is involved in ICAM-1 binding. Because most reported interactions involve the C-terminal region of filamin B, we transfected a construct encoding repeats 19–24 of filamin B in COS-7 cells and perform"
https://openalex.org/W2128247024,"Snake presynaptic neurotoxins with phospholipase A(2) activity are potent inducers of paralysis through inhibition of the neuromuscular junction. These neurotoxins were recently shown to induce exocytosis of synaptic vesicles following the production of lysophospholipids and fatty acids and a sustained influx of Ca(2+) from the medium. Here, we show that these toxins are able to penetrate spinal cord motor neurons and cerebellar granule neurons and selectively bind to mitochondria. As a result of this interaction, mitochondria depolarize and undergo a profound shape change from elongated and spaghetti-like to round and swollen. We show that snake presynaptic phospholipase A(2) neurotoxins facilitate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an inner membrane high-conductance channel. The relative potency of the snake neurotoxins was similar for the permeability transition pore opening and for the phospholipid hydrolysis activities, suggesting a causal relationship, which is also supported by the effect of phospholipid hydrolysis products, lysophospholipids and fatty acids, on mitochondrial pore opening. These findings contribute to define the cellular events that lead to intoxication of nerve terminals by these snake neurotoxins and suggest that mitochondrial impairment is an important determinant of their toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2099195957,"Cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin interact to drive microtubule-based transport in the cell. The p150Glued subunit of dynactin binds to dynein, and directly to microtubules. We have identified alternatively spliced isoforms of p150Glued that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and which differ significantly in their affinity for microtubules. Live cell assays indicate that these alternatively spliced isoforms also differ significantly in their microtubule plus end-tracking activity, suggesting a mechanism by which the cell may regulate the dynamic localization of dynactin. To test the function of the microtubule-binding domain of p150Glued, we used RNAi to deplete the endogenous polypeptide from HeLa cells, followed by rescue with constructs encoding either the full-length polypeptide or an isoform lacking the microtubule-binding domain. Both constructs fully rescued defects in Golgi morphology induced by depletion of p150Glued, indicating that an independent microtubule-binding site in dynactin may not be required for dynactin-mediated trafficking in some mammalian cell types. In neurons, however, a mutation within the microtubule-binding domain of p150Glued results in motor neuron disease; here we investigate the effects of four other mutations in highly conserved domains of the polypeptide (M571T, R785W, R1101K, and T1249I) associated in genetic studies with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Both biochemical and cellular assays reveal that these amino acid substitutions do not result in functional differences, suggesting that these sequence changes are either allelic variants or contributory risk factors rather than causative for motor neuron disease. Together, these studies provide further insight into the regulation of dynein-dynactin function in the cell. Cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin interact to drive microtubule-based transport in the cell.

Together, these studies provide further insight into the regulation of dynein-dynactin function in the cell. Cytoplasmic dynein is the major minus end-directed microtubule motor in the cell. The multisubunit protein complex dynactin binds to dynein and is required for most of its cellular activities, including spindle assembly, vesicular trafficking, and cell migration. Because of these multiple essential cellular roles, loss of either dynein or dynactin is lethal early in embryogenesis in higher eukaryotes (1Harada A. Takei Y. Kanai Y. Tanaka Y. Nonaka S.

Missense mutations in the genes encoding dynein or dynactin cause progressive neuronal degeneration in both mice and humans (2Lai C. Lin X. Chandran J. Shim H. Yang W.J. Cai H. J.

Together, these observations suggest a key role for dynein and dynactin in neuronal maintenance and function.The mechanisms by which dynactin facilitates dynein-driven transport are not fully clear, but microtubule binding by dynactin has been shown to enhance the processivity of the dynein motor (6King S.J.

In addition to this domain, a stretch of basic amino acids directly C-terminal to the CAP-Gly domain has been identified as a second, lower affinity microtubule-binding site. This basic domain may further enhance dynein processivity by facilitating one-dimensional diffusion of dynactin along microtubules (11Culver-Hanlon T.L. Lex S.A. Stephens A.D. Quintyne N.J. King S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Expression of GFP-labeled p150Glued shows tracking of growing microtubule tips in the cell (12Vaughan P.S. Miura P.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plus end-tracking proteins (+TIPs), including p150Glued, have been hypothesized to regulate microtubule dynamics (for a review see Ref. 14Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Several of these +TIP proteins interact with microtubules through CAP-Gly domains, such as CLIP-115 and CLIP-170, while others interact with microtubules through basic/serine-rich regions, such as adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) and the CLASPs (14Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The mechanism of plus end-tracking of p150Glued, as well as the relative contributions of the tandem CAP-Gly and basic domains in this process, are not yet understood.Modulation of microtubule binding may serve to alter cellular function of p150Glued. Alternative splicing of DCTN1, the gene that encodes p150Glued, produces p135, a neuronal-enriched splice form that lacks the CAP-Gly and basic domains and cannot bind to microtubules (15Tokito M.K.

Also, a missense mutation in this CAP-Gly domain has been shown to cause neurodegeneration.

These substitutions occur in highly conserved residues that are located in the coiled-coiled and dynein intermediate chain (DIC)-binding regions of the protein, so they are predicted to act as either causative mutations or risk factors for human motor neuron disease. However, the effects of these mutations on the cellular function of p150Glued are not yet known.In this study, we address the functional effects of several genetic alterations in the p150Glued subunit of dynactin. We identify naturally occurring splice forms of p150Glued that lack exon 5, exons 5 and 6, or exons 5 through 7. RT-PCR analysis of human tissues indicates that alternatively spliced isoforms of p150Glued are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. Functional studies indicate that alternative splicing of these exons has a significant effect on microtubule binding affinity and on microtubule plus end-tracking activity in the cell. Additionally, we examine the functional consequences of sequence variants identified in patients with ALS. Together, these studies provide further insight into the regulation of dynein-dynactin function in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLibrary Screening and RT-PCR—Multiple isoforms of p150Glued were identified in a screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene). RT-PCR was performed using an Enhanced Avian RT-PCR kit (Sigma), poly(A)+ RNA from adult human brain, skeletal muscle and kidney (Clontech), and primers corresponding to sequences from the 5′-end of exon 3 and the 3′-end of exon 8 of the human DCTN1 gene. The PCR products were fractionated on 4% NuSieve-GTG (BMA, Rockland, ME) gel, and purified with QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) for TA cloning followed by sequence analysis.Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Immunocytochemistry—COS7, HeLa-M and MN1 cells were maintained as described (17Levy J.R. Sumner C.J. Caviston J.P. Tokito M.K. Ranganathan S. Ligon L.A. Wallace K.E. LaMonte B.H. Harmison G.G. Puls I. Fischbeck K.H. Holzbaur E.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays were performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) and plasmids encoding Myc-tagged or GFP-tagged forms of p150Glued. For immunofluorescence assays, COS7 and HeLa-M cells were fixed in -20 °C methanol for 10 min and MN1 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was performed using antibodies to tubulin (DM1A, Sigma or YL1/2, Serotech), p150Glued (BD Biosciences and polyclonal antibody UP502(17)), Myc (Invitrogen), Golgi protein GM130 (BD Biosciences), and TGN46 (Serotech).Live Cell Imaging—For time-lapse imaging using OpenLab software (Improvision), cells were seeded on glass bottom dishes (World Precision Instruments) and imaged in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 1% OxyFluor (Oxyrase), and sealed with mineral oil (Sigma). The microscope stage was maintained at 37 °C. Images were acquired at 5-s intervals for 5 min.RNA Interference—HeLa-M cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with 10 nm RNA duplexes (Dharmacon) targeted to the 3′-untranslated region of human DCTN1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_004082). Two independent RNA duplexes were used: UTR1, 5′-ccaccaccaaagguuaaguuu-3′ and UTR2, 5′-gacuucaccccuugauuaauu-3′, both of which gave similar results. Maximal p150Glued knockdown was achieved 72 h after transfection. Rescue experiments were performed by transfecting RNAi-treated cells 72 h later with the indicated DNA constructs using Fugene (Roche Diagnostics), in comparison to mock-treated controls. Overall levels of p150Glued expression were determined by quantitative Western blot of whole cell lysates; we observed no significant differences between the mean expression levels of mock-treated HeLa-M cells and cells rescued with either wild-type p150Glued or any of the specifically mutated constructs (p = 0.6 by one-way analysis of variance). We also compared the relative signal intensity at the cellular level via immunofluorescence measurements analyzed with NIH ImageJ and consistently found that expression of wild-type p150 to about 50% of the control level was sufficient to rescue Golgi morphology. We used this expression level as a standard to compare the effects of wild-type and mutant proteins. The average fluorescence intensity of p150 for each condition was: 113.5 ± 17.8 (n = 84 cells) for mock-treated cells, 56.2 ± 16.5 (n = 100 cells) for cells rescued with wild-type p150Glued, 55.5 ± 14.6 (n = 43 cells) for cells rescued with the M571T construct, 51.2 ± 15.7 (n = 60 cells) for cells rescued with the R785W construct, 48.0 ± 9.3 (n = 42 cells) for cells rescued with the R1101K construct, and 49.5 ± 13.1 (n = 44 cells) for cells rescued with the T1249I construct.Microtubule Binding Assay—His-tagged alternatively spliced isoforms of p150Glued, spanning residues 1-333, were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Alternatively, cDNA constructs encoding these isoforms or wild type and mutant forms of p150Glued were expressed in vitro using the TnTT7 Quick system (Promega) and clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min. Either the purified recombinant or in vitro-expressed proteins were then incubated with increasing concentrations of microtubules polymerized in vitro from purified bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton) in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP and 20 μm Taxol (Cytoskeleton) for 20 min at 37 °C. Microtubule-bound and unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Results were quantified by densitometry using NIH ImageJ.Dynein Intermediate Chain Pull-down Assay—His-tagged full-length recombinant dynein intermediate chain was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and then coupled to activated CH-Sepharose 4B beads (8Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged p150Glued proteins were expressed using the TnTT7 Quick system (Promega) and clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min. A fixed volume of DIC-Sepharose beads (equivalent to ∼15 μg DIC) were incubated with increasing amounts of p150Glued proteins for 1 h at 25 °C on a platform shaker at 200 rpm; bound and unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 2 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Results were quantified by densitometry using NIH ImageJ.Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—COS7 cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant p150Glued proteins were lysed using 100 mm Na-PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, N-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was layered over a 5-25% linear sucrose density gradient and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. 1-ml gradient fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies to Myc (Invitrogen), DIC (MAB 1618, Chemicon), and dynamitin (BD Biosciences). Results were quantified by densitometry using NIH ImageJ.RESULTSDifferential Expression of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms of p150Glued—The human gene encoding p150Glued is composed of 32 exons (20Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have previously identified an alternatively spliced form of p150Glued that lacks the N-terminal CAP-Gly and basic microtubule-binding domains (Fig. 1A). This p135 isoform is expressed primarily in neurons (15Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M. Holzbaur E.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We screened a fetal human cDNA library to probe for additional alternatively spliced isoforms of p150Glued and found multiple alternatively spliced cDNAs, which differ in an N-terminal domain encoded by exons 5-7; three small exons that encode 7, 6, and 7 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1A). Specifically, we identified isoforms lacking exons 5 and 6 (Δ5,6) and exons 5 through 7 (Δ5,6,7).We performed RT-PCR to compare the expression of these alternatively spliced transcripts in several human tissues, including brain, kidney, and muscle (Fig. 1B). The identity of the bands observed by gel electrophoresis was confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. We noted the expression of multiple isoforms of p150Glued in adult brain, including a major band corresponding to the full-length polypeptide that includes all three exons (FL), as well as two more minor bands corresponding to isoforms lacking either exons 5 and 6 (Δ5,6) or lacking exons 5 through 7 (Δ5,6,7). In skeletal muscle we also observed the expression of multiple p150Glued isoforms, including a major band corresponding to Δ5,6 and minor bands corresponding to an isoform lacking only exon 5 (Δ5) as well as Δ5,6,7. In contrast, the predominant isoform of p150Glued expressed in kidney was Δ5,6,7, which lacks the basic domain. Together, these observations suggest tissue-specific regulation of expression of p150Glued isoforms.Regulation of Tip Tracking Behavior by Differential Expression of p150Glued Isoforms—The region encoded by exons 5-7 spans a basic domain of the p150Glued polypeptide (Fig. 1A) that has recently been identified as possessing a weak affinity for microtubules (11Culver-Hanlon T.L. Lex S.A. Stephens A.D. Quintyne N.J. King S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Truncation constructs of p150Glued that lack the N-terminal CAP-Gly domain but include this basic domain have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule, termed “skating” behavior (11Culver-Hanlon T.L. Lex S.A. Stephens A.D. Quintyne N.J. King S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, constructs that include the N-terminal CAP-Gly domain bind more stably to the microtubule. Therefore, the additional splice forms that we identified may encode functionally distinct isoforms of the polypeptide, which differ in their relative association with the microtubule.We tested whether these isoforms differ in their affinity for microtubules. As shown in Fig. 2, a comparison of the binding of the p150-FL and p150-Δ5,6,7 isoforms in a microtubule sedimentation assay indicates that the loss of the basic domain significantly alters the overall affinity for microtubules. p150-FL bound to microtubules with a Kd of 0.40 ± 0.07 μm. p150-Δ5,6,7 bound to microtubules much more weakly; we did not reach saturation (the extrapolated Bmax was 0.7 ± 0.1) potentially due to weak binding, but we estimated a Kd of 5.3 ± 1.5 μm. Consistent with this observation, we have found that a recombinant construct of p150Glued spanning the CAP-Gly domain (residues 1-107) binds to microtubules with a significantly lower affinity than a longer construct (1-333) that also includes the basic domain (data not shown).FIGURE 2Alternatively spliced isoforms of p150Glued differ significantly in their binding affinity for microtubules. Microtubule binding affinities for the p150-FL and p150-Δ5,6,7 isoforms were measured in co-sedimentation assays with increasing concentrations of polymerized tubulin, and indicate that the basic domain encoded by exons 5, 6, and 7 contributes significantly to the overall affinity of p150Glued for the microtubule. Fitting the data to the equation [y = (Bmax×x)/(Kd+x)] by nonlinear regression yields a Kd of 0.40±0.07 μm for p150-FL; an estimated Kd of 5.3 ± 1.5 μm was obtained for p150-Δ5,6,7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular assays have demonstrated that GFP-labeled constructs of p150Glued can dynamically track growing microtubule plus ends (12Vaughan P.S. Miura P. Henderson M. Byrne B. Vaughan K.T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Vaughan K.T. Tynan S.H. Faulkner N.E. Echeverri C.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we have previously observed that the dynamic plus end localization of p150Glued is cell type-specific (21Ligon L.A. Shelly S.S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1405-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Given the cell type-specific expression of p150Glued isoforms, we hypothesized that the difference in tip tracking behavior might be due to the differential expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of the polypeptide.To test this hypothesis, we tagged both the p150-FL construct and the Δ5,6,7 isoform with GFP and expressed these polypeptides in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, we saw a clear difference in the cellular localization of these constructs. P150-FL fully decorates cellular microtubules. Microtubule bundling was observed at higher expression levels, as previously noted (10Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Δ5,6,7 isoform shows marked tip decoration at a similar expression level. Live cell assays demonstrate that the tip decoration seen in fixed cells is due to dynamic tip tracking of the alternatively spliced isoform (Fig. 3B for stills and see supplemental Movie S2). In contrast, tip tracking is not seen in dynamic assays with the p150-FL isoform (Fig. 3B and supplemental Movie S1). Similar results were obtained upon expression of these constructs in COS-7 cells (data not shown).FIGURE 3Regulation of tip tracking by differential expression of p150Glued isoforms. A, HeLa cells transfected with GFP-tagged p150Glued-FL (top) or GFP-tagged p150-Δ5,6,7 (bottom) were stained with antibodies to p150Glued (UP502, green) and tubulin (red). Full-length p150Glued demonstrates lattice binding of microtubules, but p150-Δ5,6,7 localizes predominantly to microtubule tips. B, still images from a time series observing GFP-tagged p150-FL (top) or p150-Δ5,6,7 (bottom). Arrowheads point to GFP- p150-Δ5,6,7 labeling of dynamic plus ends. Frames are displayed in 5-s intervals. The full-length isoform localizes along the length of the microtubule lattice, remaining associated with the microtubule during both growth and catastrophe. In contrast, the p150-Δ5,6,7 isoform demonstrates dynamic tip-tracking behavior with growing microtubule tips. See also supplemental Movies S1 and S2. C, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-tagged p150-FL (top) or GFP-tagged p150-Δ5,6,7 (bottom). Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection and stained with antibodies to p150Glued (UP502, green) and TGN46 (Golgi, red). Overexpression of either isoform causes Golgi disruption. The extent of Golgi disruption is dependent on expression levels; compare the relatively intact Golgi (single arrowhead) seen in a cell expressing low levels of the GFP-p150 with the dispersed Golgi (double arrowheads) in the cell expressing higher levels of GFP-p150. Scale bars, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Is the Microtubule Binding Domain of p150Glued Required for Dynactin Function?—The expression of distinct isoforms of p150Glued that vary in their affinity for microtubules both in vitro and in cellular assays suggests that modulation of microtubule binding may have a significant effect on dynactin function. While cytoplasmic dynein alone is a robust microtubule motor in vitro, dynactin is required for most of dynein functions in the cell. Dynactin is not required for processivity of the dynein motor, but single molecule studies have shown that dynactin enhances dynein run length along the microtubules, potentially due to the ATP-independent binding of dynactin to the microtubule (6King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Ross J.L. Wallace K. Shuman H. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies have shown that when multiple dynein motors are bound to the same bead cargo the effects of dynactin on overall run length are negligible (22Mallik R. Petrov D. Lex S.A. King S.J. Gross S.P. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2075-2085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that the microtubule-binding domain of dynactin may not be required for intracellular organelle transport; studies in Drosophila S2 cells support this hypothesis (23Kim H. Ling S.C. Rogers G.C. Kural C. Selvin P.R. Rogers S.L. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).We asked whether the microtubule-binding domain of p150Glued is required to maintain Golgi organization in mammalian cells. Dynactin is required to maintain a compact perinuclear Golgi in HeLa cells (17Levy J.R. Sumner C.J. Caviston J.P. Tokito M.K. Ranganathan S. Ligon L.A. Wallace K.E. LaMonte B.H. Harmison G.G. Puls I. Fischbeck K.H. Holzbaur E.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); either depletion or transient overexpression of p150Glued causes Golgi disruption. Transfection of HeLa cells with either the p150-FL or the p150-Δ5,6,7 isoforms leads to vesiculation of the Golgi (Fig. 3C). This disruption is expression-level dependent; lower levels of GFP-p150 expression do not measurably disrupt the Golgi (see cell marked with an arrowhead in Fig. 3C), but higher expression levels lead to complete dispersal (see cell marked with a double arrowhead in Fig. 3C).While the p150-Δ5,6,7 isoform binds to microtubules more weakly than the p150-FL polypeptide, this isoform still has an intact CAP-Gly domain. To more fully test the effects of the microtubule-binding domain, we compared the expression of p150-FL with p135, a neuronally expressed isoform that lacks both the CAP-Gly motif and the basic residues that mediate microtubule binding (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpression of p135 does not disrupt the Golgi to the same extent as expressio"

Thus, a therapeutically compatible and efficient method for differentiation of the PS is crucial for regenerative medicine. In this study, we developed chemically defined serum-free culture conditions for the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into the PS-like cells. Cultures supplemented with Wnt showed induction of expression of a PS marker, the brachyury gene, followed by induction of the anterior PS markers goosecoid and foxa2, a posterior PS marker, evx1, and the endoderm marker sox17. Similar differentiation of PS by Wnt was also observed in human ES cells. Moreover, we revealed that the activation of the Wnt canonical pathway is essential for PS differentiation in mouse ES cells. These results demonstrated that Wnt is an essential and sufficient factor for the induction of the PS-like cells in vitro. These conditions of induction could constitute the initial step in generating therapeutically useful cells of the definitive endoderm lineage, such as hepatocytes and pancreatic endocrine cells, under chemically defined conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2002420753,"Histone modifications in chromatin regulate gene expression. A transcriptional co-repressor complex containing LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 (termed LCH hereafter for simplicity) represses transcription by coordinately removing histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) recruits LCH to the promoters of neuron-specific genes, thereby silencing their transcription in non-neuronal tissues. ZNF198 is a member of a family of MYM-type zinc finger proteins that associate with LCH. Here, we show that ZNF198-like proteins are required for the repression of E-cadherin (a gene known to be repressed by LSD1), but not REST-responsive genes. ZNF198 binds preferentially to the intact LCH ternary complex, but not its individual subunits. ZNF198- and REST-binding to the LCH complex are mutually exclusive. ZNF198 associates with chromatin independently of LCH. Furthermore, modification of HDAC1 by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in vitro weakens its interaction with CoREST whereas sumoylation of HDAC1 stimulates its binding to ZNF198. Finally, we mapped the LCH- and HDAC1-SUMO-binding domains of ZNF198 to tandem repeats of MYM-type zinc fingers. Therefore, our results suggest that ZNF198, through its multiple protein-protein interaction interfaces, helps to maintain the intact LCH complex on specific, non-REST-responsive promoters and may also prevent SUMO-dependent dissociation of HDAC1."

Genetic deletion of the second through fourth coding exons in Sacytm1Lex/Sacytm1Lex knockout mice results in a male sterile phenotype. The absence of any major somatic phenotype is inconsistent with the variety of somatic functions identified for sAC using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference. Principal Findings We now use immunological and molecular biological methods to demonstrate that somatic tissues express a previously unknown isoform of sAC, which utilizes a unique start site, and which ‘escapes’ the design of the Sacytm1Lex knockout allele. Conclusions/Significance These studies reveal increased complexity at the sAC locus, and they suggest that the known isoforms of sAC play a unique function in male germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120313167,"Background Coral reefs worldwide face a variety of threats and many coral species are increasingly endangered. It is often assumed that rare coral species face higher risks of extinction because they have very small effective population sizes, a predicted consequence of which is decreased genetic diversity and adaptive potential. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that some Indo-Pacific members of the coral genus Acropora have very small global population sizes and are likely to be unidirectional hybrids. Whether this reflects hybrid origins or secondary hybridization following speciation is unclear. Conclusions/Significance The interspecific gene flow demonstrated here implies increased genetic diversity and adaptive potential in these coral species. Rare Acropora species may therefore be less vulnerable to extinction than has often been assumed because of their propensity for hybridization and introgression, which may increase their adaptive potential."
https://openalex.org/W2057697331,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a Ser/Thr kinase that plays essential roles in the regulation of a wide array of growth-related processes such as protein synthesis, cell sizing, and autophagy. mTOR forms two functionally distinct complexes, termed the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2); only the former of which is inhibited by rapamycin. Based on the similarity between the cellular responses caused by rapamycin treatment and by nutrient starvation, it has been widely accepted that modulation in the mTORC1 activity in response to nutrient status directs these cellular responses, although direct evidence has been scarce. Here we report isolation of hyperactive mutants of mTOR. The isolated mTOR mutants exhibited enhanced kinase activity in vitro and rendered cells refractory to the dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates upon amino acid starvation. Cells expressing the hyperactive mTOR mutant displayed larger cell size in a normal growing condition and were resistant to cell size reduction and autophagy induction in an amino acid-starved condition. These results indicate that the activity of mTORC1 actually directs these cellular processes in response to nutrient status and confirm the biological functions of mTORC1, which had been proposed solely from loss-of-function analyses using rapamycin and (molecular)genetic techniques. Additionally, the hyperactive mTOR mutant did not induce cellular transformation of NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting that concomitant activation of additional pathways is required for tumorigenesis. This hyperactive mTOR mutant will be a valuable tool for establishing physiological consequences of mTOR activation in cells as well as in organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2073049822,"Renal fibrosis is the common histological feature of advanced glomerular and tubulointerstitial disease leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, specific antifibrotic therapies to slow down the evolution to ESRD are still absent. Because persistent inflammation is a key event in the development of fibrosis, we hypothesized that the proinflammatory kinin B1 receptor (B1R) could be such a new target. Here we show that, in the unilateral ureteral obstruction model of renal fibrosis, the B1R is overexpressed and that delayed treatment with an orally active nonpeptide B1R antagonist blocks macrophage infiltration, leading to a reversal of the level of renal fibrosis. In vivo bone marrow transplantation studies as well as in vitro studies on renal cells show that part of this antifibrotic mechanism of B1R blockade involves a direct effect on resident renal cells by inhibiting chemokine CCL2 and CCL7 expression. These findings suggest that blocking the B1R is a promising antifibrotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2016116455,"Phage integrase genes often play a role in the establishment of lysogeny in temperate phage by catalyzing the integration of the phage into one of the host's replicons. To investigate temperate phage gene expression, an induced viral metagenome from Tampa Bay was sequenced by 454/Pyrosequencing. The sequencing yielded 294,068 reads with 6.6% identifiable. One hundred-three sequences had significant similarity to integrases by BLASTX analysis (e≤0.001). Four sequences with strongest amino-acid level similarity to integrases were selected and real-time PCR primers and probes were designed. Initial testing with microbial fraction DNA from Tampa Bay revealed 1.9×107, and 1300 gene copies of Vibrio-like integrase and Oceanicola-like integrase L−1 respectively. The other two integrases were not detected. The integrase assay was then tested on microbial fraction RNA extracted from 200 ml of Tampa Bay water sampled biweekly over a 12 month time series. Vibrio-like integrase gene expression was detected in three samples, with estimated copy numbers of 2.4-1280 L−1. Clostridium-like integrase gene expression was detected in 6 samples, with estimated copy numbers of 37 to 265 L−1. In all cases, detection of integrase gene expression corresponded to the occurrence of lysogeny as detected by prophage induction. Investigation of the environmental distribution of the two expressed integrases in the Global Ocean Survey Database found the Vibrio-like integrase was present in genome equivalents of 3.14% of microbial libraries and all four viral metagenomes. There were two similar genes in the library from British Columbia and one similar gene was detected in both the Gulf of Mexico and Sargasso Sea libraries. In contrast, in the Arctic library eleven similar genes were observed. The Clostridium-like integrase was less prevalent, being found in 0.58% of the microbial and none of the viral libraries. These results underscore the value of metagenomic data in discovering signature genes that play important roles in the environment through their expression, as demonstrated by integrases in lysogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2087029178,"Fructansucrases, members of glycoside hydrolase family 68, catalyze both sucrose hydrolysis and the polymerization of fructose to β-d-fructofuranose polymers. The resulting fructan polymers are distinguished by the nature of the glycosidic bond: inulin (β-(2–1)-fructofuranose) and levan (β-(2–6)-fructofuranose). In this study we demonstrate that <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i> levansucrase exists in two active forms, depending on the pH and ionic strength. At pH values above 7.0, the enzyme is mainly a dimer, whereas at pH values below 6.0, the protein forms well ordered microfibrils that precipitate out of the solution. These two forms are readily interchangeable simply by changing the pH. Surprisingly the manner in which the enzyme is arranged strongly affects its product specificity and kinetic properties. At pH values above 7.0, the activity of the enzyme as a dimer is mainly sucrose hydrolysis and the synthesis of short fructosaccharides (degree of polymerization, 3). At pH values below 6.0, in its microfibril form, the enzyme catalyzes almost exclusively the synthesis of levan (a degree of polymerization greater than 20,000). This difference in product specificity appears to depend on the form of the enzyme, dimer <i>versus</i> microfibril, and not directly on the pH. Images made by negative stain transmission electron microscopy reveal that the enzyme forms a very ordered structure of long fibrils that appear to be composed of repeating rings of six to eight protein units. A single amino acid replacement of H296R abolished the ability of the enzyme to form microfibrils with organized fibril networks and to synthesize levan at pH 6.0."
https://openalex.org/W2117616142,"Entry inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) have been the focus of much recent research. C34, a potent fusion inhibitor derived from the HR2 region of gp41, was engineered into a 1:1 human serum albumin conjugate through stable covalent attachment of a maleimido-C34 analog onto cysteine 34 of albumin. This bioconjugate, PC-1505, was designed to require less frequent dosing and less peptide than T-20 and was assessed for its antifusogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model. PC-1505 was essentially equipotent to the original C34 peptide and to T-20 in vitro. In HIV-1-infected SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice, T-20 lost activity with infrequent dosing, whereas the antiviral potency of PC-1505 was sustained, and PC-1505 was active against T-20-resistant (“DIV”) virus with a G36D substitution in gp41. The in vivo results are the direct result of a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile for the C34 peptide following albumin conjugation. Contrary to previous reports that the gp41 NHR trimer is poorly accessible to C34 fused to protein cargoes of increasing size (Hamburger, A. E., Kim, S., Welch, B. D., and Kay, M. S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 12567–12572), these results are the first demonstration of the capacity for a large, endogenous serum protein to gain unobstructed access to the transient gp41 intermediates that exist during the HIV fusion process, and it supports further development of albumin conjugation as a promising approach to inhibit HIV-1 entry.

Several small molecule drug candidates, including those that inhibit binding to CD4 or to the CCR5 coreceptor, are either in human clinical trials or are close to market approval (1Meanwell N.A. Kadow J.F. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2003; 6: 451-461PubMed Google Scholar, 2Olson W.C. Maddon P.J. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2003; 3: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, T-20 (DP-178, enfuvirtide, Fuzeon, Trimeris; Roche Applied Sciences), a synthetic peptide based on the C-terminal helical region (CHR) sequence of HIV-1 gp41, remains the only compound marketed to date that targets the conformational rearrangements of gp41. It had been widely believed that T-20 inhibition was due to its ability to bind to the hydrophobic grooves of the N-terminal helical region (NHR) of gp41, resulting in the inhibition of six-helix bundle formation (3Kliger Y. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of less common escape mutants against T-20 with mutations in the NHR of gp41 (4Roman F.

In contrast, another C-peptide, C34, composed of a peptide sequence that overlaps with T-20 but contains the gp41 coiled-coil cavity binding residues, 628WMEW631, is known to compete with the CHR of gp41 for the hydrophobic grooves of the NHR yet is incapable of functioning at a post-lipid mixing stage (6Liu S.

Despite the successes of T-20, its commercial utility has been somewhat restricted to salvage therapy (9Gilden D. GMHC Treat. Issues. 1998; 12: 6-7PubMed Google Scholar, 10Manfredi R. Sabbatani S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 2369-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The challenge in developing therapeutic peptides is complicated primarily by their rapid renal clearance, poor distribution, and susceptibility to peptidase degradation. Despite recent predictions that cross-linking C-peptide inhibitors to larger proteins will likely reduce their antiviral activity (11Hamburger A.E. Kim S. Welch B.D. Kay M.S. J. Biol.

Such conjugation reactions may be performed in vivo by administering the compound directly into the human patient followed by conjugation to endogenous serum albumin. Similarly, conjugation reactions may also be carried out in vitro by reacting the maleimido peptide with albumin prior to administering the bioconjugate to a subject. In this study, the C34 peptide derived from the CHR of gp41 (18Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, preformed albumin conjugates composed of maleimido-T-20 analogs were also generated. Each drug construct represented a 1:1 complex through specific and stable covalent attachment of the peptide to cysteine 34 of albumin, and each construct was assessed for its antiviral activity in vitro following infection in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based assay with the HIV-1 strain IIIB (20Popovic M.

Furthermore, using the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model of HIV-1 infection (23Rabin L. Hincenbergs M. Moreno M.B. Warren S. Linquist V. Datema R. Charpiot B. Seifert J. Kaneshima H. McCune J.M.

PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e655Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we evaluated the antiviral activity of one C34 human serum albumin (HSA) conjugate, PC-1505 and found that although T-20 lost activity with infrequent dosing, the antiviral potency of PC-1505 was sustained. Peptide Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—Chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used as received. The synthesis of all derivatives was performed using an automated solid phase procedure on a Symphony peptide synthesizer with manual intervention during the generation of the drug affinity complex moiety, which is the combination of a maleimide proprionic acid, a linker, and the peptide. The synthesis was performed on Fmoc-protected Ramage amide linker resin using Fmoc-protected amino acids methodology. Coupling of the amino acids was achieved by using O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate as activator in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and diisopropylethylamine as base. The Fmoc protective group was removed using 20% piperidine/DMF. When needed, a Boc-protected amino acid was used at the N terminus to generate the free Nα terminus after the peptide is cleaved from resin. All amino acids used during the synthesis possess the l-stereochemistry. When needed, the selective deprotection of the Lys (Aloc) group was performed manually and accomplished by treating the resin with a solution of 3 eq of Pd(PPh3)4 dissolved in 5 ml of C6H6 CHCl3 (1:1), 2.5% N-methyl morpholine (v/v), 5% acetic acid (v/v) for 2 h. The resin was then washed with CHCl3 (6 × 5 ml), 20% acetic acid in dichloromethane (6 × 5 ml), dichloromethane (6 × 5 ml), and DMF (6 × 5 ml). When needed, the synthesis was reautomated for the addition of the Fmoc-AEEA-acetic acid followed by the 3-maleimidopropionic acid. Between every coupling, the resin was washed three times with DMF and three times with isopropanol. The different peptides were cleaved from the resin using 85% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% triisopropyl-silane, 5% thioanisole, and 5% phenol, followed by precipitation by dry ice-cold diethyl ether prior to purification. The peptide crude products were purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using a Varian (Rainin) preparative binary HPLC system: gradient elution of 32–42% solvent B in solvent A (0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; solvent A and 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN; solvent B) over 180 min at 9.5 ml/min using a Phenomenex Luna 10-μ phenyl-hexyl, 21-mm × 250-mm column and UV detector (Varian Dynamax UVD II) at 214 and 254 nm resulting in peptides (native and drug affinity complex) of >95% purity, as determined by reverse phase HPLC. Purified peptides were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with gradient elution of 20–60% solvent B in solvent A over 20 min at 1.0 ml/min using a Luna 10-μ phenylhexyl, 4.6-mm × 250-mm column and UV detector at 214 and 254 nm. In addition, the mass of the purified peptides was measured by an Agilent 1100 series (liquid chromatography/electron impact-mass spectrometer with a gradient elution of 20–60% solvent B in solvent A over 30 min at 1.0 ml/min using a Luna 10-μ phenyl-hexyl, 4.6-mm × 250-mm column and UV detector at 214 nm followed by mass detection on the 1100 series electron impact-mass spectrometer. Preparation of Albumin Conjugates—The conjugation of maleimido-C34 and maleimido-T-20 derivatives to cysteine 34 of HSA and subsequent purification were performed as reported previously (13Jette L.

Mass spectrometry of each purified sample confirmed the most abundant protein product corresponded to a 1:1 covalent complex of HSA with each maleimido derivative, and reverse phase HPLC analysis of each purified sample confirmed the removal of essentially all unbound (free) maleimido derivative.

A T-20-sensitive NL4-3 D36G (NL4-3G) was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to match the consensus sequence at amino acid position 36 (aspartic acid replaced by glycine) of gp41. Stocks of NL4-3G and NL4-3D (original clone) were prepared by transfection of 293T cells and collection of supernatants on day 3. The virus stocks were titrated by 50% end point assay in phytohemagglutinin-activated PBMC with p24 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The data are expressed as the means of three independent assays. Pharmacokinetic Profiles of C34 Peptide, PC-1505, and Recombinant Human Albumin (rHA) in Rats—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4) were given a single injection of C34 peptide, PC-1505, or rHA either at 100 nmol/kg intravenously or at 500 nmol/kg subcutaneously. Blood samples were collected before injection and up to 96 h after dosing, and plasma samples were analyzed by three different sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. C34 peptide was measured using a pair of rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each end of the peptide. PC-1505 was captured via the albumin portion using a goat anti-HSA antibody and detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the C terminus of the C34 peptide. Human albumin concentrations were determined using a commercial kit using polyclonal goat anti-HSA antibodies (Bethyl Labs E80–129). SCID-hu Thy/Liv Mice—Coimplantation of thymus and liver fragments under the kidney capsule to create SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice and inoculation of the Thy/Liv implants with HIV-1 was carried out as described (23Rabin L. Hincenbergs M. Moreno M.B. Warren S. Linquist V. Datema R. Charpiot B. Seifert J. Kaneshima H. McCune J.M. Antimicrob.

PC-1505 was prepared in 8 mm sodium octanoate in 1.5% polysorbate 80, and maleimido-1505 was prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). T-20 (Fuzeon; obtained from the San Francisco General Hospital pharmacy) was dissolved in sterile water for injection and adjusted to pH 7 with HCl. The drugs were administered to mice (n = 5–7) by subcutaneous injection at the indicated dosage levels (peptide alone excluding albumin for PC-1505) beginning 24 h before direct injection of 1,000 TCID50 HIV-1 NL4-3G, NL4-3D, or RPMI 1640 (mock infection) into each Thy/Liv implant. Implants were collected 21 days after inoculation and dispersed into single-cell suspensions for quantification of p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and viral RNA by branched DNA assay and were stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD8 for analysis of T-cell subsets by flow cytometry as described previously (23Rabin L.

The animal protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Antiviral Activities In Vitro Using PBMC-based Assays—The antiviral activity of each albumin conjugate was compared with the original peptide inhibitors in vitro using a PBMC-based assay against HIV-1 IIIB. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of PC-1505 (compound B), compound C, and compound D were all found to be essentially equipotent to C34 peptide and T-20 in vitro (Table 1). Following albumin conjugation to T-20, there was excellent retention of antiviral activity when the reactive peptide is designed so that conjugation occurs at the N-terminal end of the peptide (compound E), whereas a significant decrease in the antiviral activity was observed when conjugated at the C-terminal end of the peptide (compound F).TABLE 1Structure and antiviral activity of HIV-1 entry inhibitors Peptides were synthesized using an automated solid phase procedure and purified by HPLC as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The HIV peptides are numbered as appropriate for HIV-1 HXB2.

Clearly, exposure of C34 peptide is improved dramatically following albumin conjugation, and the virtually identical pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-1505 and rHA confirm that the conjugated C34 peptide has a half-life closer to that of albumin. Superimposition of pharmacokinetic curves measuring C34 peptide and HSA have also been observed in BALB/c mice for at least 30 h following either intravenous or subcutaneous administration of PC-1505 (data not shown; T½ of albumin is shorter in mice than in rats). Conversely, a slow and continuous release of C34 peptide from the conjugate would cause the two pharmacokinetic profiles to no longer superimpose because the total exposure of PC-1505 would be inferior to that of rHA. Furthermore, C34 peptide released from the conjugate would be subject to a very short half-life in vivo with limited antiviral effectiveness as compared with the long lasting PC-1505. Hence, the bond linking maleimide to cysteine 34 is highly stable in vivo, and C34 peptide is rendered more stable against rapid renal clearance and against peptidase degradation. Taken together, it may be concluded the antiviral activities for all of the albumin conjugates in vitro and in vivo are solely the result of the action of chemically stable conjugates rather than of reversibility of the maleimide-cysteine 34 bond. Antiviral Activity in SCID-hu Thy/Liv Mice—To determine whether albumin conjugation could improve the antiviral potency of C34 peptide in vivo, we employed the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model of HIV-1 infection. The human thymus implant in these mice supports long term differentiation of human T cells, and the model has been standardized (23Rabin L. Hincenbergs M. Moreno M.B. Warren S. Linquist V. Datema R.

Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 755-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and validated with four classes of licensed antiretrovirals (24Stoddart C.A. Bales C.A. Bare J.C. Chkhenkeli G. Galkina S.A.

Importantly, new classes of agents such as the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C (the predecessor of vicriviroc) (29Strizki J.M. Xu S. Wagner N.E. Wojcik L. Liu J. Hou Y. Endres M. Palani A. Shapiro S.

Wild C.T. Martin D.E. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have shown potent dose-dependent antiviral activity in these mice after oral administration. The activity of the albumin conjugate, PC-1505, was compared with the unconjugated peptide, maleimido-1505, which forms a conjugate with mouse albumin in vivo after subcutaneous administration. When PC-1505 was compared head-to-head to maleimido-1505 in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice treated twice daily beginning 24 h before inoculation with NL4-3G, PC-1505 was approximately three times more potent than maleimido-1505 in reducing HIV-1 RNA in the implants (Fig. 2). Specifically, viral RNA was reduced by 3.1 log10 with 30 mg/kg/day PC-1505 and by 2.7 log10 with 100 mg/kg/day maleimido-1505. When PC-1505 and T-20 were compared in mice treated twice daily beginning 24 h before inoculation with NL4-3G, the two drugs had comparable dose-dependent activity at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Treated mice had statistically significant reductions in viral RNA, p24, Gag-p24+ thymocytes, and interferon-α-induced MHC-I expression on DP thymocytes compared with untreated mice (Fig. 3A). Reductions in viral load were accompanied by virtually complete protection of the Thy/Liv implants from thymocyte depletion, in terms of total cellularity, thymocyte viability, percentage of immature cortical CD4+CD8+ (double-positive, DP) thymocytes, and CD4/CD8 ratio (Fig. 3B). In a third SCID-hu study to compare the activity of PC-1505 and T-20 against T-20-resistant NL4-3D, 10 mg/kg/day of PC-1505 reduced viral RNA by 2 log10 more than did T-20 at 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 4A). When the data for viral RNA reductions in seven independent SCID-hu mouse experiments are analyzed together, it is clear that antiviral potency against T-20-resistant NL4-3D was maintained for PC-1505 (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4PC-1505 is >10 times more potent than T-20 against T-20-resistant NL4-3D.

Contrary to T-20, there was excellent conservation of antiviral activity for PC-1505 with infrequent dosing and with initiation of dosing delayed until 3 days after exposure. With the Q4D and Q7D dosing regimens, T-20 caused no significant reduction in HIV-1 RNA or p24, nor did it protect from thymocyte depletion. Finally, following a single elevated pre-exposure dose of each drug 1 day before NL4-3G inoculation (Fig. 6), only PC-1505 was highly effective at reducing viral RNA by nearly 3 log10 and p24 to almost undetectable levels as well as complete protection of immature human T cells from virus-mediated depletion.FIGURE 6PC-1505 has more sustained activity than T-20 against NL4-3G with a single pre-exposure dose. SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice were treated with one subcutaneous injection of 200 mg/kg 1 day before inoculation.

Expression of δ-catenin induces filopodia-like protrusions in neurons. Here we show that the small GTPases of the Rho family act coordinately as downstream effectors of δ-catenin. A dominant negative Rac preventedδ-catenin-induced protrusions, and Cdc42 activity was dramatically increased by δ-catenin expression. A kinase dead LIMK (LIM kinase) and a mutant Cofilin also prevented δ-catenin-induced protrusions. To link the effects of δ-catenin to a physiological pathway, we noted that (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors induced dendritic protrusions that are very similar to those induced by δ-catenin. Furthermore, δ-catenin RNA-mediated interference can block the induction of dendritic protrusions by DHPG. Interestingly, DHPG dissociated PSD-95 and N-cadherin from the δ-catenin complex, increased the association of δ-catenin with Cortactin, and induced the phosphorylation of δ-catenin within the sites that bind to these protein partners. δ-Catenin is a synaptic adherens junction protein pivotally positioned to serve as a signaling sensor and integrator.

Interestingly, DHPG dissociated PSD-95 and N-cadherin from the δ-catenin complex, increased the association of δ-catenin with Cortactin, and induced the phosphorylation of δ-catenin within the sites that bind to these protein partners. δ-Catenin is a component of the synaptic adherens junction that is necessary for normal learning and memory (1Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the absence of δ-catenin, mice have severe deficits in several types of memory as well as synaptic plasticity. However, the functional basis for these deficits is not obvious, particularly because the morphological changes in δ-catenin null mice are minimal. δ-Catenin contains 10 Armadillo repeats (a 42-amino acid motif, originally described in the Drosophila segment polarity gene, armadillo) spaced in the characteristic arrangement of all members of this gene family which includes the prototypical member, p120ctn, as well as p0071, ARVCF (Armadillo Repeat gene deleted in Velo-Cardio-Facial syndrome) (2Sirotkin H. O'Donnell H. DasGupta R. Halford S. St Jore B. Puech A. Parimoo S. Morrow B. Skoultchi A. Weissman S.M. Scambler P. Kucherlapati R. Genomics. 1997; 41: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the plakophilins, both components of the desmosome (3Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Heid H.W. Schmidt A. Zimbelmann R. Schafer S. Winter-Simanowski S. Stumpp S. Keith M. Figge U. Schnolzer M. Franke W.W.

The core functions of this protein family are stabilization of cadherins by binding to a highly conserved sequence in the juxtamembrane region and regulatory coordination over Rho GTPases (7Reynolds A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). δ-Catenin is localized to the post-synaptic adherens junction, collaborates with Rho GTPases to set a balance between neurite elongation and branching, and robustly induces dendritic protrusions (8Martinez M.C. Ochiishi T. Majewski M. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the cadherin binding family members, δ-catenin is the only one that is a neural-specific protein. However, δ-catenin null mice develop normally, whereas p120ctn can regulate synapse and spine development (9Elia L.P. Yamamoto M. Zang K. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 2006; 51: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because both p120ctn and δ-catenin are expressed in neurons, an important question is the added functionality provided by co-expression of these paralogs. In contrast to p120ctn, δ-catenin contains a short carboxyl-terminal motif that corresponds to a ligand sequence for PDZ (postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) 6The abbreviations used are: PSD-95, postsynaptic density protein 95; DHPG, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine; DIV, days in vitro; LIMK, LIM kinase; GluR, glutamate receptor; mGluR, metabotropic GluR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference. 6The abbreviations used are: PSD-95, postsynaptic density protein 95; DHPG, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine; DIV, days in vitro; LIMK, LIM kinase; GluR, glutamate receptor; mGluR, metabotropic GluR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference./discs large/zona occludens-1) domain-containing proteins. Through the versatility of this domain, the multiple complex interactions of δ-catenin with the synapse arise. δ-Catenin binds to the synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) (10Ide N. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Hirao K. Yao I. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and to PSD-95 (11Jones S.B. Lanford G.W. Chen Y.H. Morabito M. Kim K.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8505-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), both of which contain multiple PDZ domains. δ-Catenin also binds via a PDZ interaction to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-binding protein and the related glutamate receptor (GluR)-interacting protein (12Silverman J.B. Restituito S. Lu W. Lee-Edwards L. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8505-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These scaffolding proteins interact with neuroligin, a cell adhesion molecule, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (13Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8505-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). δ-Catenin also interacts with two members of the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains) family of proteins. These are Erbin (14Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

Berhorster K. Liew C.W. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). δ-Catenin interacts with p190RhoGEF through AKT1-mediated phosphorylation, indicating an additional essential role for δ-catenin in dendritic morphogenesis (17Kim H. Han J.R. Park J. Oh M. James S.E. Chang S. Lu Q. Lee K.Y. Ki H. Song W.J. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 977-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This complex set of interaction partners suggests that δ-catenin is pivotally positioned to coordinate synaptic activity with cell-cell adhesion properties. Given the minimal morphological changes in the brains of δ-catenin gene-disrupted animals, the role of δ-catenin will likely emerge with more dynamic experiments related to synaptic activation. Neuronal culture provides a means to assess an intrinsic role for the protein independent of the developmental confounders in the reported gene disruption study (1Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway downstream of metabotropic stimulation is particularly germane because the selective group 1 mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) leads to calcium release from intracellular stores, local protein synthesis, and importantly, dendritic protrusive activity (18Vanderklish P.W. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we suggest that δ-catenin lies at a hub in the metabotropic glutamatergic signaling network leading to actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Cell Culture and DHPG Treatment—Primary cultures were prepared from hippocampi of embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (19Rook M.S. Lu M. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6385-6393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the same atmospheric conditions. For DHPG treatment, 21 days in vitro (DIV) neurons were washed once with prewarmed Neurobasal medium. Immediately afterward, DHPG (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 100 μm, and cells were incubated for different time points at 37 °C. For the phosphoprotein analysis, cortical neurons were treated with DHPG for 30 min. Antibodies—The affinity-purified antibody raised against a δ-catenin peptide corresponding to amino acids 434-530 in rabbit was described previously (20Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A confirmatory δ-catenin antibody (monoclonal) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories; synaptophysin and cortactin antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich; PSD-95, phospho-Cofilin, GFP, and MAP2 antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); HA antibody was from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); N-cadherin, β-actin, and cyclophilin B antibodies were from Abcam; αN-catenin (rat monoclonal, NCAT2) antibody was from the Hybridoma Bank of the University of Iowa. Phospho-LIMK1 antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Cy3, or Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DNA Preparation and cDNA Transfections—A full-length δ-catenin cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or into pCMVTag3B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (20Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). pEGFP-δ-catenin* is a resistant full-length δ-catenin construct mutated at sites mapped to the region of Dplx1 siRNA, prepared using site-directed mutagenesis. Expression plasmids for HA-tagged LIMK1 and their mutants or for S3A Cofilin were constructed as described (21Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Rosso S. Bollati F. Bisbal M. Peretti D. Sumi T. Nakamura T. Quiroga S. Ferreira A. Caceres A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3433-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for Rac-dominant negative was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Hall (MRC, Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, London, UK). Three weeks after plating, hippocampal neurons were transfected with the Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad). To make the bullets, each cDNA was attached to gold particles. To achieve a uniform distribution of gold particles and reduce damage due to particle bombardment, mesh barriers (steel mesh plus 70-μm nylon mesh) were used as a diffusion screen for dissociated culture neurons. The expression of transfected cDNAs was detected 24-30 h later. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—A set of siRNAs corresponding to mouse and rat δ-catenin mRNA was designed and synthesized by (Dharmacon) as follows: Duplex0 (Dplx0)-(amino acid 581) 5′-GGCAGAGAUAAGGAGACAAUU; Duplex1 (Dplx1)-(amino acid 1216) 5′-GCAACUAUGUCGACUUCUAUU-3′; Duplex2 (Dplx2)-(amino acid 749) 5′-GCAGUGAGAUCGAUAGCAAUU-3′; Duplex3 (Dplx3)-(amino acid 1120) 5′-CCACGGAACUAAAGGAGAAUU-3′; Duplex4 (Dplx4)-(amino acid 1125) 5′-GAACACACCUCCAGAAAAGUU-3′. Duplexes 1-4 were mixed to form the SMART pool (Dharmacon). Cyclophilin B (catalog #D-001136-01-20; Dharmacon) was used as a positive control, and siCONTROL siRNA (catalog #D-001210-01; Dharmacon) used as negative control. Duplex0 and Duplex1 were used for all of the immunostaining experiments. Transfections of siRNAs into neurons were performed using TransMessenger™ Transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described (23Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11926-11929Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for co-transfections of reporter plasmid and siRNA sequences. Immunoblot Analysis and Quantification—Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Immunoblots of δ-catenin knockdown and DHPG treatments were quantified using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). β-Actin was used for loading normalization. Percent of inhibition was calculated relative to the mock-transfected samples. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test or analysis of variance. Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed 3 times in PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100. After washing and blocking, the cells were incubated with primary antibody for 90 min at room temperature or overnight at 4|°C. Secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 were used for double labeling and Cy3- and Cy5-were used in the presence of GFP-expressing cells. Immunoprecipitation—After each incubation, the medium was aspirated, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to stop the reaction and lysed with lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science), and protein G beads were added for preclearing for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody overnight at 4|°C, and the immunoprecipitates were captured by protein G beads or A beads (Pierce). Normal mouse or rabbit IgG were used as negative controls (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphoprotein Sequence Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Two-week-old cortical cultures were treated with vehicle control or 100-μm DHPG or 250 μm of the antagonist (S)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine for 30 min. Cells were lysed, and δ-catenin was immunoprecipitated using 50-70 μg of the δ-catenin polyclonal antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. δ-Catenin bands were cut from the gels and analyzed by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) as follows. Gel pieces were subjected to a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). On the day of analysis the samples were reconstituted in 5 μl of HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 5-μm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (75-μm inner diameter × 12-cm length) with a flame-drawn tip (25Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). After equilibrating the column, each sample was pressure-loaded off-line onto the column. The column was then reattached to the HPLC system. A gradient was formed, and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). As each peptide was eluted they were subjected to electrospray ionization, and then they entered into an LTQ linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Eluting peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Peptide sequences were determined by matching protein or translated nucleotide databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, Sequest (ThermoFinnigan) (26Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). The modification of 80 mass units to serine, threonine, and tyrosine was included in the data base searches to determine phosphopeptides. Each phosphopeptide that was determined by the Sequest program was also manually inspected in ensure confidence. Image Acquisition and Quantification—Confocal images were obtained with an Olympus FluoView1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. Olympus images were obtained using oil 60× and 40× objectives with sequential acquisition settings at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 and 512 × 512 pixels, respectively. Each image was a 0.5-μm z-series of 7-13 images averaged 2-4 times. Confocal scanning settings of pinhole, brightness, and contrast were kept the same for all images when intensity was compared. Additional digital zoom factor of ×3-5 was used as well. MetaMorph software was used for morphometric analysis. Maximum projection of the z-stack images was flattened into a single image and was used for all quantitative analysis, in parallel with the z-stack image. The density of dendritic protrusions and their lengths were measured blinded in neurons transfected with GFP or GFP-δ-catenin constructs. Representative counts were confirmed by an independent observer. DHPG/RNAi Quantification—After DHPG treatment the neurons were stained with δ-catenin and PSD-95 antibodies. GFP was used to visualize the shape of the cell and the protrusions. 7-10 neurons of three experiments were analyzed for each condition. 2-3 segments of 50-100-μm secondary branched dendrites were counted from each neuron. All the measurements were done using the three-dimensional reconstructed image as well as the flatten image to make sure all the protrusions were counted. The assignment of a protrusion as a spine or filopodium was based upon the criteria of Ziv and Smith(27Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) and Papa et al. (28Papa M. Bundman M.C. Greenberger V. Segal M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and discussion by others (29Papa M. Segal M. Neuroscience. 1996; 71: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Fiala J.C.

The category of 0-3 μm was predominantly represented by different types of spines (stubby, thin, and mushrooms). Mushroom-type spines were analyzed based on a thin neck and a relatively large tip (head) following these criteria; the distance of the spine head from the dendritic shaft is 0.5-2 μm in length, and spine head diameter is >0.6 μm in length. The category of 3-4-μm protrusions occasionally contained a head-like structure of spines. Protrusions of 4-10 μm were defined as filopodia-like and generally lacked heads at the tip and showed narrower and longer stalk properties than spines. Rac1 and Cdc42 Activation Assay—Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with either GFP or GFP-δ-catenin, and cell homogenates were processed for Rac1 or Cdc42 activation assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). The Rac-GTP quantification was developed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (G-LISATM Rac activation assay biochem kit-BK125, Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). δ-Catenin Recruits Small Rho GTPases to Induce Protrusive Activity—To understand the mechanistic basis for the observation that δ-catenin can induce dendritic protrusions, we overexpressed δ-catenin in mature primary cultured neurons and observed the expected increase in dendritic protrusions (Fig. 1). As shown previously (8Martinez M.C. Ochiishi T. Majewski M. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Kim H. Han J.R. Park J. Oh M. James S.E. Chang S.

Lanford G.W. Thakore C. Lu Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), δ-catenin dramatically induced protrusions. Neurons were transfected with either GFP alone or full-length GFP-δ-catenin and analyzed for the number of protrusions at 20 DIV based on GFP visualization, δ-catenin, and PSD95 immunolocalization (Fig. 1). The elaboration of protrusions was restricted to the dendritic tree despite GFP-δ-catenin signal throughout the neuron including the axon (Fig. 1A). We had previously linked δ-catenin-induced protrusions and branching to RhoA inhibition (8Martinez M.C. Ochiishi T. Majewski M. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a finding supported by studies of δ-catenin paralogs (34Goodwin M. Kovacs E.M. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rac activation by δ-catenin was demonstrated by increased Rac activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells which overexpressed δ-catenin (Fig. 2A, a and b). A dominant negative Rac prevented δ-catenin protrusive activity (Fig. 2Bi). Cdc42 activity also dramatically increased in the presence of δ-catenin expression (Fig. 2A, c and d), and a dominant negative Cdc42 prevented δ-catenin protrusive activity in 21 DIV neurons (Fig. 2C). Thus, activation of Rac and Cdc42 occurred simultaneously with Rho inhibition and collectively appeared to operate downstream of the δ-catenin ability to induce protrusions. Our data are not consistent with Kim et al. (17Kim H. Han J.R. Park J. Oh M. James S.E. Chang S. Lu Q. Lee K.Y. Ki H. Song W.J. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 977-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), who detected no effect on Cdc42 and Rac1 activity in the presence of δ-catenin overexpression. However, our data are consistent with many reports showing that the Rho family of small GTPases (particularly RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42) are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton that have profound influence on spine morphogenesis (35Newey S.E. Velamoor V. Govek E.E. Van Aelst L. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 58-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36Carlisle H.J. Kennedy M.B.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). An active form of Rac can increase the activity of LIMK1 (38Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Activation of LIMK phenocopied the increased protrusive activity associated with δ-catenin overexpression (Fig. 2B, g and h). Neurons co-transfected with δ-catenin and an HA-tagged LIMK1-kinase dead mutant did not elaborate protrusions (Fig. 2B, c, d, and f) and Table 1). If LIMK acts downstream of δ-catenin, one would expect to see a similar blockade of protrusive activity with mutant actin depolymerizing factor/Cofilin. Actin depolymerizing factor/Cofilin is the only substrate identified for LIMK (39Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) which phosphorylates Cofilin (at serine 3) when in its active phosphorylated state (phospho-LIMK1). The phosphorylation of Cofilin is an inactivation step that prevents actin binding and thereby promotes actin protrusive activity by reducing actin dynamics. S3A Cofilin is a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by LIMK1 and, therefore, is constitutively active. S3A is, therefore, functionally equivalent to the LIMK kinase dead mutant, and it too blocked δ-catenin-induced protrusions (Fig. 2Bj).TABLE 1Affect of regulators downstream of δ-catenin on dendritic protrusionsConstructs transfected (1 μg/construct)Number of protrusions/25 μmp Valuemean ± S.E.GFP6.2 ± 0.8NSGFP (2 μg)6.6 ± 0.4NSGFP-δ-catenin11.5 ± 0.5<0.01GFP-δ-catenin + LIMK1 wt19.5 ± 1.2<0.001GFP-δ-catenin + LIMK1 kd2.7 ± 0.4<0.01GFP-δ-catenin + S3A Cofilin2.9 ± 0.6<0.01GFP-δ-catenin + Rac-DN2.3 ± 0.8<0.01GFP-δ-catenin + Y2763222.7 ± 0.9<0.001GFP + LIMK1 wt9.2 ± 0.4<0.01GFP + LIMK1 kd1.8 ± 0.6<0.01GFP + Y2763214.4 ± 0.6<0.01 Open table in a new tab δ-Catenin Is an Intermediary in Group I mGluR Activation—Interestingly, we found that Group I mGluR activation also operates through these small Rho GTPases. 5 min after DHPG stimulation, 21 DIV hippocampal neurons increased Rac and Cdc42 activity significantly (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, delivery of DHPG to neurons induced spine elongation and filopodial elaboration (18Vanderklish P.W. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We replicated these morphological effects of DHPG (Fig. 3, B and C). We next sought to determine whether reduced levels of δ-catenin would interfere with the elaboration of DHPG-induced protrusions. A variety of siRNAs were tested for their ability to knockdown δ-catenin in heterologous cells by co-transfection of the siRNAs, GFP, and GFP-δ-catenin into HEK293 cells. Transfected proteins were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody and analyzed by Western blot with GFP and δ-catenin antibodies (Fig. 4A). Although all of the sequences showed some degree of knockdown of GFP-δ-catenin in HEK293 cells, sequences Dplx0 and Dplx1 were optimal (Fig. 4A). A developmental blot showed that δ-catenin started expressing 1 day after plating (supplemental Fig. S1A), and therefore, siRNAs were introduced to neurons at three DIV in culture. The two siRNAs Dplx0 and Dplx1 suppressed δ-catenin in neurons at 20 DIV by immunoblot (Fig. 4B) and by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S1B). On average, 80% of neurons showed inhibition of δ-catenin expression. Neurons at 20 DIV, when spines are clearly present, were profoundly affected by δ-catenin suppression (Fig. 4, and C and D). Quantification of δ-catenin signal indicated a 72% reduction with Dplx1 and a 35% reduction with Dplx0 (Fig. 4D). A dosage effect was observed in that the degree to which spines were reduced correlated with the degree of δ-catenin suppression (Fig. 4D). Induction of the same phenotype with two different siRNA reduced the likelihood that the spine loss was due to an off-target effect. Not surprisingly, δ-catenin siRNA treatment of neurons also resulted in synapse loss and decreased complexity of the dendritic tree (see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3 and Table SI). δ-Catenin knockdown caused a concomitant loss of N-cadherin by immunoblot (Fig. 5A) as previously reported in the δ-catenin gene-disrupted mouse (1Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A significant loss of αN-catenin also occurred (Fig. 5A). Quantitatively there was significant loss of 34% of the protein level of N-cadherin and 32% of αN-catenin (Fig. 5B). δ-Catenin RNAi induced a small reduction in MAP2 (data not shown) that just reached significance, perhaps due to the attenuation of the dendritic tree. The level of PSD-95 did not change by Western blot (data not shown). To rescue the phenotypic effect of δ-catenin inhibition on dendritic protrusions, we transfected a mutated form of GFP-δ-catenin* (resistant to Dplx1 siRNA) together with δ-catenin siRNA Dplx1 (Fig. 5, C a"
https://openalex.org/W2088362149,"Background Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease that affects mainly young children, and which features granulomas containing Langerhans-type dendritic cells. The role of several human herpesviruses (HHV) in the pathogenesis of LCH was suggested by numerous reports but remains debated. Epstein-barr virus (EBV, HHV-4), & Cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5) can infect Langerhans cells, and EBV, CMV and HHV-6 have been proposed to be associated with LCH based on the detection of these viruses in clinical samples. Methodology We have investigated the prevalence of EBV, CMV and HHV-6 infection, the characters of antibody response and the plasma viral load in a cohort of 83 patients and 236 age-matched controls, and the presence and cellular localization of the viruses in LCH tissue samples from 19 patients. Principal Findings The results show that prevalence, serological titers, and viral load for EBV, CMV and HHV-6 did not differ between patients and controls. EBV was found by PCR in tumoral sample from 3/19 patients, however, EBV small RNAs EBERs –when positive-, were detected by in situ double staining in bystander B CD20+ CD79a+ lymphocytes and not in CD1a+ LC. HHV-6 genome was detected in the biopsies of 5/19 patients with low copy number and viral Ag could not be detected in biopsies. CMV was not detected by PCR in this series. Conclusions/Significance Therefore, our findings do not support the hypothesis of a role of EBV, CMV, or HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of LCH, and indicate that the frequent detection of Epstein-barr virus (EBV) in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is accounted for by the infection of bystander B lymphocytes in LCH granuloma. The latter observation can be attributed to the immunosuppressive micro environment found in LCH granuloma."
https://openalex.org/W1994826925,"GABAB receptors mediate slow synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system and are important for synaptic plasticity as well as being implicated in disease. Located at pre- and postsynaptic sites, GABAB receptors will influence cell excitability, but their effectiveness in doing so will be dependent, in part, on their trafficking to, and stability on, the cell surface membrane. To examine the dynamic behavior of GABAB receptors in GIRK cells and neurons, we have devised a method that is based on tagging the receptor with the binding site components for the neurotoxin, α-bungarotoxin. By using the α-bungarotoxin binding site-tagged GABAB R1a subunit (R1aBBS), co-expressed with the R2 subunit, we can track receptor mobility using the small reporter, α-bungarotoxin-conjugated rhodamine. In this way, the rates of internalization and membrane insertion for these receptors could be measured with fixed and live cells. The results indicate that GABAB receptors rapidly turnover in the cell membrane, with the rate of internalization affected by the state of receptor activation. The bungarotoxin-based method of receptor-tagging seems ideally suited to follow the dynamic regulation of other G-protein-coupled receptors.

The GABAB receptor is a heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), requiring R1 and R2 subunits to co-assemble before trafficking to the cell surface to form functional receptors. The R1 subunit possesses an ER retention motif that is masked by binding to the R2 subunit (12.Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Although, generally, GPCRs are readily internalized from the cell surface following agonist activation and receptor phosphorylation (15.Marchese A. Paing M.M. Temple B.R. Trejo J. Annu. Rev.

However, other reports indicate that agonist activation of GABAB receptors may promote internalization and/or rapid recycling (10.Pooler A.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25349-25356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Laffray S. Tan K. Dulluc J. Bouali-Benazzouz R. Calver A.R. Nagy F. Landry M. Eur.

Pharmacol. 2003; 481: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address the topic of GABAB receptor trafficking, prior studies have used various techniques to monitor receptor movement, including: receptor biotinylation (8.Fairfax B.P. Pitcher J.A. Scott M.G.

Markovic B. Benke D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24157-24165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); as well as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (10.Pooler A.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25349-25356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These methods have therefore relied on the use of relatively large reporter molecules, such as antibodies. Although such studies have revealed some aspects of trafficking behavior for GABAB receptors, there is still uncertainty regarding: how stable GABAB receptors are in the surface membrane; over what time scale they are likely to traffic; and whether trafficking observed in secondary cell lines is relevant to the movements of GABAB receptors in neurons. To address these questions, we adopted a different strategy, based on incorporating a minimal-size epitope into the R1a subunit of the GABAB receptor. This comprised a 13-amino acid α-bungarotoxin binding site (BBS) motif, which retains high affinity for its ligand (19.Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M. Balass M. Fridkin M. Smit A.B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Katchalski-Katzir E. Sussman J.L. Fuchs S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mobility of GABAB receptors can then be tracked, in real time, using fluorescent derivatives of α-bungarotoxin (BTX), which is a small reporter molecule. This high affinity site has been previously incorporated into ligand-gated ion channels, including AMPA (20.Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17114-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and GABAA (6.Bogdanov Y. Michels G. Armstrong-Gold C. Haydon P.G. Lindstrom J. Pangalos M. Moss S.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) receptors, to monitor their trafficking, but its use in GPCRs is unexplored. Here, we report that in HEK-293 cells, stably expressing inwardly rectifying Kir3.1 and 3.2 potassium channels (GIRK cells), and in hippocampal neurons expressing R1aBBSR2 subunits, the GABAB receptor undergoes quite rapid endocytosis and exocytosis. This indicates that the levels of this GPCR in the cell surface membrane are dynamically regulated, with implications for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. GABAB Receptor Containing the BTX-binding Site—Complementary DNA fragments for the 13 amino acid BBS (WRYYESSLEPYPD;(19)) were synthesized with the nucleotide sequences: CTAGCTGGAGATACTACGAGAGCTCCCTGGAGCCCTACCCTGACG (sense) and CTAGCGTCAGGGTAGGGCTCCAGGGAGCTCTCGTAGTATCTCCAG (anti-sense). BBS fragments were annealed and phosphorylated then subcloned into a NheI site that was introduced six amino acids after the start of the mature R1a subunit (Fig. 1A). cDNAs for the R1a and R2 subunits (21.Couve A.

The α7/5HT3a chimeric receptor was provided by N. Millar (UCL). Cell Culture and Transfection—GIRK cells (22.Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol.

These cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate method (23.Wilkins M.E. Hosie A.M. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with cDNAs (1 mg/ml) mixed in the following ratios: R1 (or R1BBS)/R2/EGFP reporter, 1:5:1, or for α7/5HT3a/EGFP reporter, 1:1. Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from postnatal day 4 (P4) rat brains and plated onto poly-d-lysine-treated 22 mm glass coverslips (Assistence (5.Thomas P. Mortensen M. Hosie A.M. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). Neurons were transfected at 6–8 DIV using a calcium phosphate method (Clontech). Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Membrane currents were recorded, using whole cell patch clamp, from single GIRK cells as described previously (24.Kuramoto N. Wilkins M.E. Fairfax B.P.

Patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing (mm): 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 11 EGTA, 30 KOH, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 1 GTP, 2 ATP, 14 creatine phosphate, pH 7.0. The cells were continuously perfused with Krebs solution containing (mm): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 11 glucose, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. To increase the size of the GABAB receptor-activated K+ currents and convert them to inward currents, prior to GABA application, the Krebs concentration of KCl was increased to 25 mm and that of NaCl reduced to 120 mm. This change altered EK from approximately -90 mV to -47mV. Peak amplitude GABA-activated K+ currents, were recorded from cells 48–72 h after transfection, at -70 mV holding potential and filtered at 5 kHz (-3dB, 6th pole Bessel, 36 dB/octave) before storage on a Dell Pentium III computer for analysis with Clampex 8. Changes >10% in the membrane input conductance or series resistance resulted in the recording being discarded. To construct GABA concentration-response relationships, the current (I) was measured in the presence of each concentration of GABA applied at 3-min intervals as described previously (24.Kuramoto N.

Drugs and solutions were rapidly applied to the cells using a modified Y-tube, positioned ∼200–300 μm from the recorded cell.

The best fits to the data were determined using a Marquardt nonlinear least squares routine (Origin 6). Immunocytochemistry—Transfected GIRK cells were fixed 48 h after transfection. Briefly, cells were washed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma). BTX-Rhd was applied for different times and/or at different concentrations, in the absence or presence of unlabeled BTX. The cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min and quenched with NH4Cl (50 mm; VWR), for 10 min, prior to adhering the coverslips to slides using glycerol/gelatin (Sigma). When antibodies were added, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% v/v Triton X in 10% v/v blocking serum (see below). Cells were then incubated in 10% blocking serum (5% v/v horse (Invitrogen) and 5% v/v Donkey (Sigma) serum in PBS) for 25 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1.5% or 3% blocking serum, respectively. Antibodies against the C-terminal of the GABAB receptor R2 (guinea pig; 1:1000; Chemicon) were used in conjunction with a secondary Cy5 antibody (Donkey anti Guinea pig; Chemicon). Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 6–8DIV and fixed, as above, 6–8 days after transfection. We found that available N-terminal antibodies performed poorly in our immunoassays (see also Ref. 25.Correa S.A. Munton R. Nishimune A. Fitzjohn S. Henley J.M. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Confocal Imaging—To image the fixed cells, a Zeiss Axioskop LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope was used with a ×40/1.3 oil DIC objective and the following laser settings: FITC, 543 nm, 5% of maximum; TRITC, 633 nm, 80%; Cy5, 488 nm, 30%. The top and bottom of the cell was determined using a rapid z-stack scan, and a mid image of each cell was optimized and acquired with a mean of 8 scans, and stored for further analysis. Analysis of the confocal images was performed using Image J, where 3 regions of interest (ROI) were identified per cell (the cell surface membrane, intracellular compartment, and total cell fluorescence; see Fig. 2A, inset). Each pixel in the ROI was graded on a scale of 0 to 255 (max) and a mean fluorescence value was determined for the specific area (μm2) of interest. The background, a region where no cells were present, was subtracted from the ROI of each cell to give a normalized mean. To image live transfected neurons, PBS with 1 mm d-tubocurarine (d-TC) was applied for 2 min to block endogenous nicotinic ACh α7 subunit-containing receptors, and then with d-TC (1 mm) + BTX-Rhd (3 μg/ml) for 5 min to allow BTX-Rhd to bind to R1aBBSR2 receptors. Cells were washed (2×) with PBS, to remove any excess BTX-Rhd or d-TC, and superfused with Krebs, in a recording chamber, at either 37, 15, or at room temperature, 23 °C, by using a Peltier device. Transfected neurons were identified by the expression of GFP and images were scanned at specified time points using a Achroplan ×40/0.8 water DIC objective. Radioactive α-Bungarotoxin Binding Assay—To ascertain the apparent affinity of BTX for its binding site in the GABAB R1aBBSR2 receptor, binding studies with 125I-BTX (200Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) to cell surface receptors were performed with intact cells. Transfected GIRK cells were washed twice in PBS and re-suspended in Hanks buffered salt solution (GIBCO) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were incubated in radioligand for 60 min at room temperature, with gentle agitation, in a total volume of 150 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 1000-fold higher concentration of unlabeled BTX (Molecular Probes). Radioligand binding was assayed by filtration onto 0.5% polyethylenimine pre-soaked Whatman GF/A filters, followed by rapid washing with PBS using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were assayed in a Wallac 1261 gamma counter. Scatchard analysis with non linear regression was used to obtain Bmax and Kd values (Origin 6) with Equation 2. y=Bmax∗X(Kd+X)(Eq. 2) For comparison, the same analysis was used for GIRK cells expressing a chimeric α7/5HT3a receptor which is known to retain a high affinity BTX binding site (26.Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Engineering the BBS into the GABAB Receptor—Incorporating a high affinity binding site for BTX into ligand-gated ion channels has demonstrated its usefulness in allowing the tracking of receptor movements into and out of the cell membrane (6.Bogdanov Y. Michels G. Armstrong-Gold C. Haydon P.G. Lindstrom J. Pangalos M. Moss S.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7.Luscher B. Keller C.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 102: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To explore whether a similar strategy could be used to monitor GPCR trafficking, with their quite different transmembrane topologies, we engineered the N terminus of the R1a subunit of the GABAB receptor, to include a BBS (R1aBBS). To empirically maximize access for BTX to its binding site, the BBS was inserted just after the start of the mature protein (Fig. 1A), a position noted for GABAA receptors to be silent in terms of its impact on receptor structure and function (27.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This region of the GABAB receptor was also deemed suitable since inserting a Myc epitope, just 4 amino acids from the start of the protein (upstream of the BBS), did not affect receptor function (21.Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The R1a subunit used here contained both Myc and BBS epitopes. To determine if the R1aBBS subunit could bind α-bungarotoxin-rhodamine (BTX-Rhd) in vitro, GIRK cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding for: R1aBBS/R2/GFP; or the nicotinic/5-HT3a receptor chimera, α7/5HT3a/GFP (control for BTX binding); or GFP (negative control). The chimera was used to enhance the surface expression of bungarotoxin-binding α7 receptors, which is quite poor otherwise in HEK cells. After allowing receptor expression for 48 h, exposure to 3 μg/ml BTX-Rhd for 10 min, revealed prominent cell surface immunoreactivity for both the R1aBBSR2 and α7/5HT3a receptors. By contrast, no surface-specific BTX-Rhd immunoreactivity was observed on GFP-only transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Activation of Kir3.1 and 3.2 by GABAB R1aBBSR2 Receptors—The effect of the BBS on the GABAB receptor functional properties was studied using GIRK cells and patch clamp electrophysiology. The activation of Kir 3.1 and 3.2 channels by GABA was used to construct concentration response curves for wild-type (R1aR2) and mutant R1aBBSR2 GABAB receptors in the presence and absence of 3 μg/ml BTX-Rhd (Fig. 1C). There was no significant shift in the concentration response curves, or the potency of GABA, determined from the EC50 values for the R1aBBSR2 receptor in the presence (0.48 ± 0.06 μm) or absence (0.36 ± 0.05 μm) of BTX-Rhd, compared with the wild-type receptor (0.43 ± 0.05 μm; n = 5–11; p > 0.05; Fig. 1C). In addition, antagonism by the competitive GABAB antagonist CGP55845 at R1aBBSR2 was minimally affected by the BBS (Fig. 1D) with only a small increase in the IC50 at R1aBBSR2 (118 ± 14 nm) compared with wild type (50 ± 6 nm). The time-dependent stability of GABA-activated potassium currents was assessed by sequential applications of GABA, at 3-min intervals. By comparison with wild-type receptors, the effect of the BBS was assessed in R1aBBSR2 receptors by either using a 10-min pretreatment with BTX-Rhd or by applying BTX-Rhd for 3 min following the first two sequential GABA applications. With each protocol, the BBS appeared silent as there was no significant difference in the run-down profiles of either of the BTX-Rhd treated receptors compared with the wild-type receptors (Fig. 1E). The run-down of currents could be fitted with a single exponential providing time constants of: 2.9 ± 0.8 min (wild-type); 4.2 ± 0.7 min (R1aBBSR2 + 10 min BTX-Rhd pretreatment); and 2.3 ± 0.3 min (R1aBBSR2 + BTX-Rhd treatment after the first two sequential GABA applications). These results suggested that the incorporation of the BBS into the N terminus of the GABAB R1a subunit, when expressed with the R2 subunit, did not alter the activation or pharmacological profiles of this receptor. Similarly, the addition of BTX-Rhd, which binds to the BBS on the N terminus of the R1aBBS subunit, did not impact on the function of the receptor. Overall, this indicates that the inserted BBS has the capability to operate as a functionally silent reporter of GABAB receptor trafficking. BTX Binding to the R1aBBS Subunit—To determine the apparent affinity of BTX-Rhd for the BBS in R1a subunits, GIRK cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding for: R1aBBSR2/GFP; or α7/5HT3a/GFP; or just GFP. Cells were exposed for 10 min to increasing concentrations of BTX-Rhd before fixation with PFA. BTX-Rhd concentration cell surface fluorescence curves were constructed to deduce the apparent affinities of BTX-Rhd for these receptors, as well as for GFP (negative control; Fig. 2A). Receptors on or near the cell surface were determined by having an ROI, which incorporated just the surface fluorescence of the cell thus, providing mean fluorescence values that accounted for cell size (Fig. 2A, inset). The BTX-Rhd concentration-fluorescence curves, using mean cell surface fluorescence, were normalized to the mean maximum fluorescence obtained from the α7/5HT3a positive controls exposed to 300 nm BTX-Rhd. The EC50 for BTX on the R1aBBSR2 receptor (52 ± 18 nm) was ∼80-fold greater when compared with that for the α7/5HT3a receptor (0.8 ± 0.1 nm; n = 8–12), indicating that the affinity of BTX for the BBS in GABAB receptors was lower than that for the site in α7/5HT3a receptor. The GFP-only expressing GIRK cells did not exhibit any concentration-dependent specific cell surface binding of the BTX-Rhd (Fig. 2A). To further evaluate the affinity of BTX for the R1aBBSR2 receptor, radioligand binding studies were performed with 125I-BTX. Increasing concentrations of 125I-BTX were applied to GIRK cells, expressing either R1aBBSR2 or α7/5HT3a receptors, for 1 h at room temperature. These cells were then washed, harvested, and placed in the gamma counter. The GABAB R1aBBSR2 containing receptors clearly bound 125I-BTX in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Using a Scatchard analysis, the Kd for BTX binding was 9.8 ± 2.6 nm (n = 6) for the R1aBBSR2 receptor, which was 11-fold lower than the Kd for BTX binding to the α7/5HT3a receptor (0.86 ± 0.04 nm; n = 3). Constitutive Internalization and Membrane Insertion of GABAB Receptors—The rate at which GABAB R1aBBSR2 receptors were internalized from the cell surface membrane was examined by exposing GIRK cells expressing R1aBBSR2 to 3 μg/ml BTX-Rhd for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed free of unbound BTX-Rhd and then kept at either 37 or 18 °C, until fixed at selected time points after the initial exposure to BTX (Fig. 3A). At 18 °C, a temperature that inhibits endocytosis (28.Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Brandon N.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36565-36572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), there was little change in the mean cell surface fluorescence over a 300-min period, demonstrating the stability of BTX-Rhd binding to the BBS on the GABAB receptor. However, over a similar duration at 37 °C, the mean cell surface fluorescence was rapidly reduced, according to a single exponential process with a time constant of 39.6 ± 4 min (Fig. 3, A and B). During this period, there was little change (∼10% reduction) in intracellular fluorescence and only a slight reduction in total fluorescence over 300 min at 37 °C (data not shown). To ascertain that there was no significant dissociation of BTX-Rhd from the BSS at 37 °C, 125I-BTX was incubated with cells expressing R1aBBSR2 for 1 h at room temperature and then in the presence of excess unlabeled-BTX for up to 120 min at 37 °C. No decrease in 125I-BTX binding was observed over this period (97 ± 14% of control bound at t = 120 min; n = 6), confirming that BTX-Rhd binds with high affinity to the BBS. Taken overall, these data suggested that recombinant GABAB receptors in GIRK cells are subjected to substantive and constitutive internalization. To identify insertion of the GABAB R1aBBSR2 receptor into the plasma membrane and determine its rate, GIRK cells expressing R1aBBSR2 were exposed to unlabeled BTX (20 μg/ml), to block all the existing GABAB receptors on the cell surface, at room temperature for 5 min. After removing the excess unlabeled BTX, by washing, 3 μg/ml BTX-Rhd was applied for different times at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed prior to measuring levels of surface fluorescence. Within the first minute, there was little evidence of receptor insertion indicating that all pre-existing surface receptors were saturated and bound by unlabeled BTX. However, by 5–10 min, cell surface fluorescence appeared, indicating the membrane insertion of new R1aBBSR2 receptors, and by 20–25 min this had reached a steady state (Fig. 3, C and D). The rate for receptor insertion was best described by a single exponential process with a time constant of 7.8 ± 1.6 min (Fig. 3D). After longer incubation times (70 min), BTX-Rhd labeling appeared in intracellular compartments in accord with these newly inserted receptors being subject to internalization (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that there are GABAB receptors, forming part of an intracellular pool, which are ready for rapid insertion, and these receptors are also subject to internalization as part of a dynamic cycling/rapid turnover of receptors at the cell surface of GIRK cells. GABAB Receptor Activation and the Rate of Internalization—In accord with the process of internalization for other GPCRs, it might be expected that the state of GABAB receptor activation would be similarly influential. To investigate this, we examined whether the endocytosis of the R1aBBSR2 receptor, in GIRK cells, was influenced by receptor activation or inhibition at 37 °C. Cells expressing R"
https://openalex.org/W2055132429,"Choice of one method over another for MHC-II binding peptide prediction is typically based on published reports of their estimated performance on standard benchmark datasets. We show that several standard benchmark datasets of unique peptides used in such studies contain a substantial number of peptides that share a high degree of sequence identity with one or more other peptide sequences in the same dataset. Thus, in a standard cross-validation setup, the test set and the training set are likely to contain sequences that share a high degree of sequence identity with each other, leading to overly optimistic estimates of performance. Hence, to more rigorously assess the relative performance of different prediction methods, we explore the use of similarity-reduced datasets. We introduce three similarity-reduced MHC-II benchmark datasets derived from MHCPEP, MHCBN, and IEDB databases. The results of our comparison of the performance of three MHC-II binding peptide prediction methods estimated using datasets of unique peptides with that obtained using their similarity-reduced counterparts shows that the former can be rather optimistic relative to the performance of the same methods on similarity-reduced counterparts of the same datasets. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that conclusions regarding the superiority of one method over another drawn on the basis of performance estimates obtained using commonly used datasets of unique peptides are often contradicted by the observed performance of the methods on the similarity-reduced versions of the same datasets. These results underscore the importance of using similarity-reduced datasets in rigorously comparing the performance of alternative MHC-II peptide prediction methods."

SSH1 has the SSH family-specific, N-terminal, noncatalytic (SSH-N) domain, consisting of the A and B subdomains. SSH1 is activated by binding to actin filaments. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of SSH1 substrate recognition of phosphocofilin (P-cofilin) and SSH1 activation by F-actin. We found that P-cofilin binds to a phosphatase-inactive mutant, SSH1(CS), in which the catalytic Cys-393 is replaced by Ser. Using a series of deletion mutants, we provided evidence that both the phosphatase (P) domain and the adjacent B domain are indispensable for P-cofilin binding of SSH1(CS) and cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1. In contrast, the A domain is required for the F-actin-mediated activation of SSH1, but not for P-cofilin binding or basal cofilin-phosphatase activity. The P domain alone is sufficient for the phosphatase activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), indicating that the SSH-N domain is not essential for the basal phosphatase activity of SSH1. Addition of F-actin increased the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1 more than 1200-fold, but the pNPP-phosphatase activity only 2.2-fold, which suggests that F-actin principally affects the cofilin-specific phosphatase activity of SSH1. When expressed in cultured cells, SSH1, but not its mutant deleted of SSH-N, accumulated in the rear of the lamellipodium. Together, these findings suggest that the conserved SSH-N domain plays critical roles in P-cofilin recognition, F-actin-mediated activation, and subcellular localization of SSH1.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous types of post-translational protein modification and is essential for signaling pathways mediating diverse cellular processes. Protein phosphorylation is regulated by the balanced actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; CBB, Coomassie brilliant blue; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; deP-cofilin, dephosphorylated cofilin; DSP, dual-specificity phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FL, full-length; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LIMK1, LIM-kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; P-cofilin, Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin; P-coro1B, phosphorylated coronin 1B; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; SSH, Slingshot; SSH1(CS), a Slingshot-1 mutant with replacement of Cys-393 by Ser; VHR, vaccinia H1-related phosphatase; WT, wild-type. constitute the largest family of phosphatases. These enzymes are defined by their active-site signature motif, (H/V)CX5R(S/T), in which the nucleophilic Cys residue attacks the phosphate group of target proteins (1Kolmodin K. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Z.Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Of ∼100 phosphatase genes classified into the PTP family in the human genome, the most diverse group, in terms of the substrate specificity, is the group of dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs) (4Alonso A.

DSPs are further divided into several subgroups, each having a wide range of substrate specificities for phospho-Ser, phospho-Thr, phosphoinositide, and mRNA, in addition to phospho-Tyr (3Tonks N.K.

These phosphatases play specific roles in decreasing the phosphorylation levels of target molecules and controlling signal transduction pathways that underlie a variety of physiological processes. Cofilin is a key regulator of actin filament dynamics and functions by stimulating the depolymerization and severance of actin filaments (5Bamburg J.R. Wiggan O.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cofilin activity is regulated by its specific kinases and phosphatases.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying how SSH1 recognizes its substrate, Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin (P-cofilin), or how F-actin enhances the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are members of a DSP family that dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPKs (16Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Some MKPs, such as MKP-1 and MKP-3, selectively bind to their substrate MAPKs through their N-terminal noncatalytic domains and are activated by interactions with MAPKs (17Camps M. Nichols A.

These selective binding and activation mechanisms underlie the substrate specificity of MKPs toward their target MAPKs. SSH1 possesses the SSH family-specific, N-terminal, noncatalytic domain (termed SSH-N domain, consisting of the A and B subdomains).

The N-terminal-half of SSH1 (amino acids 1–461, consisting of the A, B, and P domains) is sufficient for both the cofilin-phosphatase activity and F-actin-mediated activation (13Nishita M. Tomizawa C. Yamamoto M. Horita Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which suggests that the N-terminal half of SSH1 plays important roles for determining the substrate specificity of SSH1 and for conferring F-actin-dependent activation of its cofilin-phosphatase activity. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity and F-actin-mediated activation of SSH1 with a particular focus on the role of the conserved N-terminal A, B, and P domains of SSH1. We provide evidence that both the B and P domains are essential for P-cofilin recognition and cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1, while the P domain alone can dephosphorylate an artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). We also show that F-actin strongly enhances the phosphatase activity of SSH1 toward P-cofilin, but only faintly toward pNPP, and that the A domain is required for this F-actin-induced enhancement of cofilin-phosphatase activity. We also provide evidence that the SSH-N domain is important for the localization of SSH1 in the rear of the lamellipodium. Our results suggest that the N-terminal conserved region of SSH1 plays critical roles in P-cofilin recognition, F-actin-mediated cofilin-phosphatase activity, and subcellular localization of SSH1, and that F-actin primarily affects the cofilin-specific phosphatase activity of SSH1.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to cofilin and P-cofilin were prepared as previously described (8Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang S. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol.

For protein expression in a baculovirus system, cDNA inserts were subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). For plasmids encoding SSH1 and its mutants that were C-terminally tagged with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or (Myc+His)-tag (consisting of a Myc epitope and six His residues), cDNA inserts were subcloned into the pECFP or pcDNA3.1/Myc+His vector (Invitrogen), respectively. Proteins—SSH1 and its mutants were expressed in Sf21 (provided by Dr. K. Nakayama, Tohoku University) or Sf9 insect cells, using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). SSH1 and its mutants fused to (Myc+His) tag were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen) as described (21Kurita S. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For GST-tagged LIM-kinase 1 (GST-LIMK1) purification, recombinant virus-infected cells were sonicated in GST lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and clarified by centrifugation. Cell lysate was added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and incubated for 1 h. After washing with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, GST-LIMK1 was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (21Kurita S. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) was used for gel filtration. For the phosphorylated coronin 1B (P-coro1B) preparation, coronin 1B-(Myc+His) was co-expressed with GST-PKCα in insect cells and purified with Ni-NTA agarose, as described (22Cai L. Holoweckyj N. Schaller M.D. Bear J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31913-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Preparation of P-cofilin, Dephosphorylated Cofilin (deP-cofilin), and Mutant Cofilin—C-terminally His6-tagged human cofilin (cofilin-His6) was expressed in insect cells and affinity-purified with Ni-NTA agarose as described (21Kurita S. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Eluted cofilin-His6 was applied to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by a DE-52 column (Whatman), also equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through fraction from the DE-52 column was collected as purified cofilin. For preparation of P-cofilin, purified cofilin was incubated with GST-LIMK1 in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) at 30 °C for 2 h, and the reaction mixture was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B to deplete GST-LIMK1. For preparation of deP-cofilin, cofilin-His6 and GST-SSH1(WT) were separately expressed in insect cells, and these cell lysates were mixed after soni cation, incubated on ice for 1 h to dephosphorylate cofilin, and purified through Ni-NTA agarose. Cofilin(S3A)-His6 and cofilin(S3E)-His6 were purified with the protocol similar to that for cofilin(WT)-His6. Purified proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Substrate Trapping Assay—Sf9 or Sf21 cells expressing GST-tagged SSH1 or its deletion mutants were sonicated in GST lysis buffer, and cell lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B to immobilize GST-fused proteins. After washing with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), the beads were incubated with 0.5 μm P-cofilin or deP-cofilin in 300 μl of wash buffer for 3 h at 4°C, washed three times, and sampled for SDS-PAGE. GST-tagged proteins and bound cofilin were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), and bound cofilin was further analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cofilin and anti-P-cofilin antibodies. Phosphatase Assays—pNPP-phosphatase assays were performed as follows: GST-tagged SSH1 and its deletion mutants immobilized on glutathione Sepharose 4B were incubated with 10 mm pNPP in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C, and the hydrolysis of pNPP was measured by following the absorbance at 405 nm (A405). To examine F-actin-mediated activation of the pNPP-phosphatase activity of SSH1, purified SSH1-(Myc+His) was incubated in 200 μl of assay buffer containing 20 mm pNPP with or without F-actin at 30 °C. The changes in A405 were recorded every 15 min on a Benchmark plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Phosphatase assays toward substrates P-cofilin or P-coro1B were performed as described previously (12Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Goto K. Chiba S. Mori R. Nishita M. Ohashi K. Kousaka K. Iwamatsu A.

Briefly, purified or immobilized SSH1 proteins were incubated in 20 μl of assay buffer containing P-cofilin or P-coro1B at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE, and P-cofilin or P-coro1B was detected with Pro-Q diamond phosphoprotein gel stain (Molecular Probes) or immunoblotting with an anti-pSerPKC antibody. F-actin Cosedimentation Assay—F-actin cosedimentation assay was performed as described previously (21Kurita S. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that, in the experiment to examine the effect of phalloidin on the F-actin binding of SSH1 and cofilin, F-actin was preincubated with phalloidin at room temperature for 30 min before use. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Microscopic Analysis—C2C12 mouse myoblast cells and N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 and 15% fetal calf serum, respectively. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding CFP- or (Myc+His)-tagged SSH1 or its mutants with or without the plasmid for RacV12. After 24 h in culture, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-P-cofilin or anti-Myc antibody. Fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (DMIRBE; Leica) equipped with a PL APO 63× or 100× oil-immersion objective lens (NA 1.3 or 1.4, respectively; Leica) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Roper Scientific) driven by MetaMorph software. P-cofilin Binds to a Phosphatase-inactive CS Mutant of SSH1—To examine the mechanism by which SSH1 recognizes its substrate P-cofilin, we first prepared dephosphorylated (deP-) and phosphorylated (P-) forms of cofilin. His6-tagged cofilin, expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, was subjected to dephosphorylation with GST-SSH1 or phosphorylation with GST-LIMK1. After purification, the purity of deP-cofilin and P-cofilin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting with anti-P-cofilin antibody and Pro-Q phosphoprotein staining revealed that the purified P-cofilin, but not deP-cofilin, was phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). We also analyzed the F-actin-binding ability of purified deP-cofilin and P-cofilin. F-actin cosedimentation assays revealed that deP-cofilin, but not P-cofilin, coprecipitated with F-actin and increased the amount of actin in the supernatant (supplemental Fig. S1), which indicates that the purified deP-cofilin, but not P-cofilin, has the activity to bind to and depolymerize actin filaments. These results further suggest that both deP- and P-cofilin were purified successfully. These purified proteins were used for the following binding experiments and cofilin phosphatase assays. PTP and DSP family phosphatases utilize the conserved Cys residues in their active sites as a nucleophile that attacks phosphorus atoms of substrates (1Kolmodin K. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Z.Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The phosphatase-inactive CS mutant, in which the catalytic Cys residue is substituted by Ser, often binds to its substrate and forms a stable complex (23Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 24Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We applied this “substrate-trapping” method to analyze how SSH1 recognizes P-cofilin. GST-tagged SSH1(WT) and its CS mutant (with a replacement of Cys-393 by Ser), expressed in insect cells, were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with purified deP- or P-cofilin. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by CBB staining and immunoblotting with anti-cofilin and anti-P-cofilin antibodies (Fig. 1B). Neither control GST nor SSH1(WT)-GST coprecipitated deP- or P-cofilin. In contrast, SSH1(CS)-GST coprecipitated P-cofilin, but not deP-cofilin. This indicates that SSH1(CS) forms a stable enzyme-substrate complex with P-cofilin, which is dependent on both the CS mutation of SSH1 and phosphorylation of cofilin. SSH1(WT) failed to coprecipitate P-cofilin or deP-cofilin, probably due to its phosphatase activity toward P-cofilin and its quick release of the reaction product (deP-cofilin) from the intermediate complex. To determine if the phosphate group at Ser-3 of cofilin is required for P-cofilin binding to SSH1(CS), we examined the binding ability of cofilin point mutants, with substitutions of Ser-3 to Ala or Glu. SSH1(CS)-GST coprecipitated P-cofilin, but not S3A- or S3E-cofilin (Fig. 1C), which indicates that the phosphate group on Ser-3 is essential for the interaction of P-cofilin with SSH1(CS), and the negative charge of Glu is insufficient for the coprecipitation. We also examined the effect of vanadate, an inhibitor of PTPs, on the binding of P-cofilin to SSH1(CS). Vanadate is known to compete with the phosphate group of the substrate for binding to the catalytic Cys residue of PTPs (26Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, vanadate inhibited P-cofilin binding to SSH1(CS). Combined, these results suggest that P-cofilin specifically binds to SSH1(CS), and that the interaction requires the Ser-3 phosphate group of P-cofilin. Both the B and the P Domains Are Required for SSH1(CS) Binding to P-cofilin—To define the region(s) of SSH1 involved in P-cofilin binding, we constructed a set of deletion mutants of GST-tagged SSH1(CS) and analyzed their ability to bind P-cofilin by GST pull-down assays (Fig. 2A). P-cofilin coprecipitated with full-length SSH1(CS)-GST, but not with the SSH-N domain-deleted mutant [ΔN(CS)-GST], indicating that the SSH-N domain is required for P-cofilin binding (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a C-terminally deleted mutant [GST-N461(CS)] coprecipitated P-cofilin (Fig. 2C), indicating that the C-terminal region (amino acids 462–1049) is dispensable for P-cofilin binding. We next examined the role of the A and B subdomains within the SSH-N domain for P-cofilin binding, using deletion mutants of GST-N461(CS). The A domain-deleted mutant [N461ΔA(CS)] coprecipitated P-cofilin, but neither the B domain-deleted mutant [N461ΔB(CS)] nor the SSH-N domain-deleted mutant [N461ΔN(CS)] coprecipitated with P-cofilin (Fig. 2C), indicating that the B domain, but not the A domain, is essential for P-cofilin binding. Similar results were obtained when we tested the P-cofilin binding ability of the deletion mutants of C-terminally GST-tagged N461(CS) [N461(CS)-GST] (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the position of the GST tag did not affect the binding ability of the N461(CS) mutants. Since the SSH-N domain alone (GST-N) failed to bind P-cofilin, as demonstrated in Fig. 2D, the phosphatase (P) domain is also required for SSH1(CS) binding to P-cofilin. It is likely that the binding of the phosphate group of P-cofilin to the active site in the catalytic P domain is essential to form the stable enzyme-substrate complex. Taken together, these results indicate that both the noncatalytic B domain and the catalytic P domain are required for SSH1 to recognize P-cofilin as a specific substrate. The SSH-N Domain Is Required for Cofilin-phosphatase Activity, but Not for pNPP-phosphatase Activity—We next examined the role of the N-terminal, noncatalytic region of SSH1 in the phosphatase activity toward P-cofilin, as well as the basal phosphatase activity toward pNPP, an artificial substrate generally used in phosphatase assays. Increasing amounts of GST-tagged N461 and N461ΔN immobilized on glutathione beads were subjected to the phosphatase assay, using P-cofilin or pNPP as substrates. Dephosphorylation of P-cofilin was measured by Pro-Q staining. GST-N461 dose-dependently dephosphorylated P-cofilin, but GST-N461ΔN was unable to dephosphorylate P-cofilin even at the highest dose (Fig. 3A), indicating that the SSH-N domain is essential for the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1. In contrast, both GST-N461 and GST-N461ΔN dephosphorylated pNPP with similar dose-dependent rates (Fig. 3B). This suggests that N461ΔN (consisting of only the catalytic P domain of SSH1) retains basal pNPP-phosphatase activity. Thus, the N domain appears to be involved in the cofilin-specific phosphatase activity of SSH1, but not for the basal pNPP-phosphatase activity. F-actin Strongly Enhances the Cofilin-phosphatase Activity of SSH1—We previously showed that the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1 was markedly enhanced by association with F-actin (12Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Goto K. Chiba S. Mori R. Nishita M. Ohashi K. Kousaka K. Iwamatsu A. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To further evaluate this finding quantitatively, we performed kinetic analyses of the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1 in the absence or presence of F-actin, using purified (Myc+His)-tagged SSH1 expressed in insect cells. Consistent with previous reports (12Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Goto K. Chiba S. Mori R. Nishita M. Ohashi K. Kousaka K. Iwamatsu A. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J.

Past studies have identified the functional domains of Lm332 and revealed the relationships between its activities and the processing of its subunits. However, there is little information available concerning the effects of N-glycosylation on Lm332 activities. In some cancer cells, an increase of β1,6-GlcNAc catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) is related to the promotion of cancer cell motility.

To examine the effects of those N-glycosylations to Lm332 on its activities, we purified Lm332s from the conditioned media of GnT-III- and GnT-V-overexpressing MKN45 cells. Lectin blotting and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that N-glycans containing the bisecting GlcNAc and β1,6-GlcNAc structures were strongly expressed on Lm332 purified from GnT-III-overexpressing (GnT-III-Lm332) and GnT-V-overexpressing (GnT-V-Lm332) cells, respectively.

In comparison with unglycosylated Lm111, which is purified from cell lysates of tunicamycin-treated cells, glycosylation of Lm111 was shown to affect cell spreading and neurite outgrowth activities but not cell adhesion activity or heterotrimer assembly (3Dean III, J.W.

Few studies have assessed the functional significance of N-glycosylation of Lm332 subunits.N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) catalyzes the addition of the β1,6-linked GlcNAc branch and defines this subset of N-glycans (17Cummings R.D.

This is supported by several reports, including GnT-V overexpression in cancer (19Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar, 20Handerson T. Pawelek J.M.

By contrast, bisecting GlcNAc catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) (Fig. 1A) suppresses further processing with branching enzymes, such as GnT-V, and elongation of N-glycans (22Gu J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, GnT-III modification of α3β1 integrin inhibits cell migration promoted by GnT-V on the Lm332 substrate (25Zhao Y. Nakagawa T. Itoh S. Inamori K. Isaji T. Kariya Y. Kondo A. Miyoshi E.

Therefore, we purified Lm332s from the conditioned media of GnT-III- and GnT-V-overexpressing MKN45 cells. The analysis of lectin blotting and mass spectrometry indicated that Lm332 could be modified by either GnT-III or GnT-V. As a result, GnT-III modification of Lm332 caused a decrease in its keratinocyte cell adhesion and migration activities. Our findings demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism of Lm332 activities brought on by N-glycosylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal regions of the human laminin α3 chain (Lsαc3) and the γ2 chain (D4B5) were a generous gift from Dr. Kaoru Miyazaki (Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan). Mouse monoclonal antibody against the laminin α3 chain (2B10) was prepared as previously described (26Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against the human laminin β3 chain (kalinin B1) and paxillin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Control mouse and rat IgG and function-blocking anti-integrin α3 (P1B5) and α6 (GoH3) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Invitrogen. Biotinylated leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L4-PHA) and biotinylated erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E4-PHA) were from Seikagaku Biobusiness Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). A monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—The human gastric cancer cell line MKN45 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque, Japan). MKN45 transfectants were described previously (27Ihara S. Miyoshi E. Ko J.H. Murata K. Nakahara S. Honke K. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16960-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The Buffalo rat liver-derived epithelial cell line BRL was a gift from Dr. Kaoru Miyazaki (Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Those media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. Keratinocytes isolated from patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa lacking Lm332 were a generous gift from Dr. M. Peter Marinkovich (Stanford University). Keratinocytes were grown in 50% defined keratinocyte medium (Invitrogen) and 50% medium 154 (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) containing penicillin and streptomycin sulfate.Preparation of Conditioned Medium and Purification of Laminin-332—For purification of Lm332, the serum-free CM from MKN45 transfectants were collected every 2 or 3 days. The collected media were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Finally its supernatant was collected and used as a source for purification of Lm332. The protein containing the supernatant was precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in and dialyzed against a gelatin column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.005% Brij 35) overnight at 4 °C. Then samples were centrifuged at 19,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the undissolved proteins. The precleared solution was passed through a gelatin column, and then its flow-through was directly applied to an α3 antibody (2B10) column. After washing with the antibody column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.005% Brij 35), followed by MilliQ water, binding proteins were eluted by 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.005% Brij 35 and 0.1% CHAPS.Preparation of Cell Lysate—For preparing cell lysate, cells were washed with cold PBS twice and then lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). After incubation for 10 min on ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and its supernatants were used in the following samples. The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Nacalai Tesque).SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Lectin Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed either on 6% gels or on 4.0–7.5% gradient gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). ImageJ software was used for densitometric analysis of protein bands. For immunoblotting analyses, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with each specific antibody or biotinylated E4-PHA and L4-PHA. Immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare) and a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories).Analysis of N-Glycan Structures by Liquid Chromatography/Multiple-stage Mass Spectrometry (LC/MSn)—Purified Lm332 was applied to SDS-PAGE using a 4–7.5% gradient gel under reducing conditions and visualized by CBB staining. The gel bands corresponding to α3, β3, and γ2 subunits were excised from the gel and then cut into pieces, respectively. The gel pieces were destained with 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 30% acetonitrile and then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. The proteins in the gel were reduced and carboxymethylated by incubation with dithiothreitol and sodium monoiodoacetate (25Zhao Y. Nakagawa T. Itoh S. Inamori K. Isaji T. Kariya Y. Kondo A. Miyoshi E. Miyazaki K. Kawasaki N. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32122-32130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). N-Glycans were released by the treatment with peptide:N-glycanase F, and extracted from the gel pieces, as reported (28Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides were reduced with sodium borohydride and desalted. LC/MSn was performed using a quadropole linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Finnigan LTQ-FT™; Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA) connected to a nanoflow LC system (NanoFrontier nLC; Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Japan). The eluents were 5 mm ammonium acetate containing 2% acetonitrile, pH 9.6 (pump A), and 5 mm ammonium acetate containing 80% acetonitrile, pH 9.6 (pump B). The borohydride-reduced N-glycans were separated on a Hypercarb column (0.075 × 150 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp.) with a linear gradient of 5–35% of pump B in 110 min. A single mass scan with Fourier transform (m/z 450–2,000) followed by data-dependent MS/MS for the most intense ions was performed in both positive and negative ion modes as previously reported (29Itoh S. Kawasaki N. Hashii N. Harazono A. Matsuishi Y. Hayakawa T. Kawanishi T. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1103: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (8Kariya Y. Tsubota Y. Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, each well of a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was coated with a substrate protein and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). 2 × 104 cells in supplement-free keratinocyte growth medium were inoculated per well of 96-well plates. After nonadherent cells were removed, adherent cells were fixed with 25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (w/v) in 20% (v/v) methanol for 10 min. The well was measured for absorbance at 590 nm using a microplate reader. For inhibition assay, the cell suspension was incubated with function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies or with the control IgG for 20 min at room temperature before inoculation.Cell Spreading Assay—For measurement of the cell-spreading area, keratinocytes on purified Lm332 substrates were incubated in keratinocyte growth medium. After 1 h, at least 100 cells were photographed, and their cell spreading areas were measured using Axio Vision software (Carl Zeiss, Germany).Cell Scattering Assay—A scattering assay was done as reported previously (10Kariya Y. Miyazaki K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of cell suspension (2 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum) were inoculated per well of 24-well plates. Test samples were directly added into the culture medium and incubated at 37 °C. After 40 h, cells were fixed with 25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (w/v) in 20% (v/v) methanol for 10 min. The scattered single cells were counted, and the degree of cell scattering was expressed as the percentage of single cells in each field. At least 300 cells were counted in each field.Cell Migration Assay—A glass bottom dish (Asahi Techno Glass, Japan) was precoated with purified Lm332 and then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C. 200 μl of Lm332-null keratinocyte cell suspension (4 × 104 cells/ml) in growth medium were inoculated into each Lm332-precoated glass bottom dish. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, cell movement was monitored using time lapse video equipment (Carl Zeiss) for 8 h.ELISA—The ELISA was as follows. The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with test proteins and then blocked with 1.2% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer) three times and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Furthermore, the wells were washed with washing buffer three times and then incubated with secondary antibody coupled with biotin for 45 min at room temperature. Similarly, the wells were washed three times and incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated with avidin D for 45 min at room temperature. After five washes with washing buffer, the bound antibodies were quantified by their absorbance at 405 nm after incubation with p-nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt in 100 mm diethanolamine (pH 9.8) containing 0.24 mm MgCl2.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—A glass bottom dish (Asahi Techno Glass) was precoated with purified Lm332 and then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C. 200 μl of the cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml) in growth medium were inoculated into each Lm332-precoated glass bottom dish. After incubation for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. For permeabilization, the cells were treated with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. The fixed cells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h before staining with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo) equipped with ×100/1.35 UPlan-Apochromat oil immersion objectives.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test, with Microsoft Excel, was used to compare the two groups.RESULTSCharacterization of GnT-III and GnT-V Transfectants—As a source for purification of Lm332 modified by GnT-III- or GnT-V-catalyzed glycosylation, we prepared GnT-III- and GnT-V-overexpressing MKN45 transfectants and also a vector-only transfectant to be used as a negative control as previously described (27Ihara S. Miyoshi E. Ko J.H. Murata K. Nakahara S. Honke K. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16960-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To check the changes in oligosaccharide structures for each transfectant, lectin blotting was performed against the cell lysates from those transfectants using E4-PHA, which preferentially binds to bisecting GlcNAc residues in N-glycans or L4-PHA, which preferentially binds to β1,6-branched GlcNAc residues (30Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blotting results showed that the GnT-III transfectant increased bisecting GlcNAc compared with the other two (Fig. 1B, E4-PHA) but decreased GnT-V products (Fig. 1B, L4-PHA), supporting the notion that GnT-III antagonizes the action of GnT-V for the modification of some target glycoproteins, such as α3β1 integrin (25Zhao Y. Nakagawa T. Itoh S. Inamori K. Isaji T. Kariya Y. Kondo A. Miyoshi E. Miyazaki K. Kawasaki N. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32122-32130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GnT-V overexpression had no effect on the GnT-III product level (Fig. 1B, E4-PHA) but led to a strong increase of β1,6-branched GlcNAc in MKN45 cells (Fig. 1B, L4-PHA). The immunoblotting using an anti-α-tubulin antibody showed that the amount of a loaded protein was almost the same among the three samples (Fig. 1B, α-tubulin).Purification and Characterization of Lm332 from MKN45 Transfectants—To examine whether Lm332 could be modified by GnT-III or GnT-V to regulate its functions, we tried to purify Lm332 from the CM of vector-, GnT-III-, and GnT-V-MKN45 transfectants using a laminin α3 chain antibody (2B10) column. Purified Lm332 was run on 4–7.5% gradient gel and 6% gel for CBB staining and immunoblotting, respectively (Fig. 2). CBB staining under nonreducing conditions revealed two major bands at ∼460 and 440 kDa, which correspond to the Lm332 forms with an unprocessed 150-kDa γ2 chain and with a processed 105-kDa γ2 chain, respectively (Fig. 2, CBB, left). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions separated the Lm subunits. All purified Lm332s contained the three major bands of 160-, 150-, and 135-kDa proteins, which correspond to the processed α3 chain, the unprocessed γ2 chain, and the β3 chain, respectively (Fig. 2, CBB, right). In addition to those bands, there are three extra bands, which were larger than the 160-kDa processed α3 chain band. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that those bands are laminin β1, γ1, and an unprocessed α3 chain (190 kDa) (data not shown). A likely explanation is that this represented laminin-311 (Lm311; laminin-6), which is composed of α3, β1, and γ1 chains. Lm332 purified from GnT-III MKN45 transfectant (GnT-III-Lm332) contained slightly increased amounts of those extra bands rather than the Lm332 from vector MKN45 (vector-Lm332) and from GnT-V MKN45 transfectants (GnT-V-Lm332), suggesting that the processing of the α3 chain, but not the β3 and γ2 chains, could be affected by the addition of bisecting GlcNAc. The quantified band intensity upon CBB staining under reducing conditions showed that the ratio of β3 chain in Lm332 to β1 chain in Lm311 was 10:1 (data not shown). Under nonreducing conditions, it was difficult to find the bands corresponding to Lm332 with an unprocessed laminin α3 chain (490 kDa) and Lm311 (600 kDa). The compositions of the Lm332 chain were also confirmed by immunoblotting using each chain-specific antibody. Consistent with the results shown in CBB staining, GnT-III-Lm332 contained slightly more unprocessed α3 chains (190-kDa) than those of vector-Lm332 and GnT-V-Lm332 (Fig. 2, I.B. α3). By contrast, there were no differences between the 135-kDa β3 chain, the unprocessed 150-kDa γ2 chain, and the processed 105-kDa γ2 chain among three Lm332s (Fig. 2, I.B. β3 and γ2). To establish whether Lm332 was modified by GnT-III or GnT-V, lectin blotting using E4-PHA and L4-PHA lectin was performed against three purified Lm332s. A comparison of bands corresponding to α3 and β3 chains among three purified Lm332s indicated that increased GnT-III and GnT-V products presented on GnT-III-Lm332 and GnT-V-Lm332, respectively (Fig. 3). Upon E4-PHA lectin blotting against GnT-III-Lm332, bisecting GlcNAc was added to β1 and γ1 chains as well as to the unprocessed α3A chain (Fig. 3, E4-PHA). To ascertain the N-glycan structures on Lm332 subunits directly, we also performed liquid chromatography/multiple-stage mass spectrometry (LC/MSn) analyses. Each subunit of Lm332 was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and N-glycans in each subunit were released by in-gel digestion with peptide:N-glycanase F. The oligosaccharides were extracted from the gel and subjected to LC/MSn as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total ion chromatograms were acquired by single mass scans (m/z 450–2,000) in positive (Fig. 4A) and negative (Fig. 4B) ion modes, respectively. Structures of N-glycans in major peaks were deduced from m/z values of protonated molecules acquired by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-MS and fragment ions in MSn spectra. Additional bisected N-glycans were confirmed based on the fragment ions at m/z 792 ([HexNAc-Hex-Hex-NAc-HexNAc-OH + H]+) and m/z 938 ([HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc-(dHex-)HexNAc-OH + H]+) in MS/MS and MS/MS/MS spectra. The extracted ion chromatograms of representative bisected N-glycans were acquired by single mass scans, and the structures in each peak were deduced (Fig. 4C). The peaks of the bisected N-glycans from all three subunits of GnT-III-Lm332 (Fig. 4, C, b, e, and h) were more intense than those from both the vec-Lm332 (Fig. 4C, a, d, and g) and GnT-V-Lm332 (Fig. 4C, c, f, and i). We also examined the β1,6-GlcNAc structures on all subunits of three Lm332s (Fig. 4D). The majority of N-glycans in all three subunits of vec-Lm332 (Fig. 4D, a, d, and g) and GnT-V-Lm332 (Fig. 4D, c, f, and i) were sialylated triantennary, whereas few triantennary forms were found in those of GnT-III-Lm332 (Fig. 4D, b, e, and h). These results, taken together, suggest that all subunits of Lm332 were modified by GnT-III and GnT-V, and they also support the notion that introduction of GnT-III inhibits GnT-V products.FIGURE 2Characterization of laminin-332 purified from conditioned media of vector-, GnT-III-, or GnT-V-MKN45 transfectants. Purified laminin-332s, vector-Lm332 (vector), GnT-III-Lm332 (GnT-III), and GnT-V-Lm332 (GnT-V), were run on 4–7.5% gradient gels and 6% gels under nonreducing (–ME) and reducing conditions (+ME), respectively. After SDS-PAGE, separated proteins were stained with CBB (A; CBB) or transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2037402358,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is an essential co-factor protein in fatty acid biosynthesis that shuttles covalently bound fatty acyl intermediates in its hydrophobic pocket to various enzyme partners. To characterize acyl chain-ACP interactions and their influence on enzyme interactions, we performed 19 molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Escherichia coli apo-, holo-, and acyl-ACPs. The simulations were started with the acyl chain in either a solvent-exposed or a buried conformation. All four short-chain (≤C10) and one long-chain (C16) unbiased acyl-ACP MD simulation show the transition of the solvent-exposed acyl chain into the hydrophobic pocket of ACP, revealing its pathway of acyl chain binding. Although the acyl chain resides inside the pocket, Thr-39 and Glu-60 at the entrance stabilize the phosphopantetheine linker through hydrogen bonding. Comparisons of the different ACP forms indicate that the loop region between helices II and III and the prosthetic linker may aid in substrate recognition by enzymes of fatty acid synthase systems. The MD simulations consistently show that the hydrophobic binding pocket of ACP is best suited to accommodate an octanoyl group and is capable of adjusting in size to accommodate chain lengths as long as decanoic acid. The simulations also reveal a second, novel binding mode of the acyl chains inside the hydrophobic binding pocket directed toward helix I. This study provides a detailed dynamic picture of acyl-ACPs that is in excellent agreement with available experimental data and, thereby, provides a new understanding of enzyme-ACP interactions.

Rock C.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). There are two main types of machineries that perform this process, known as the type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) systems found in mammals and fungi and the type II systems existing in bacteria and eukaryotic plastids (2Byers D.M.

Type I systems are composed of a single long polypeptide chain that contains all the enzymes and other proteins necessary to accomplish fatty acid synthesis. These mega-complexes fold into large machineries, yielding reaction chambers that are readily accessible to the enzymes of FA synthesis for rapid catalysis (3Leibundgut M. Jenni S. Frick C. Ban N.

In sharp contrast, type II or dissociated FAS systems express each of the enzymes necessary for fatty acid synthesis as individual proteins (6White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Given how vastly different these two systems are between humans and bacteria, there has been a conscious effort to target FA synthesis in bacteria through novel antibiotics (7Zhang Y.M. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17541-17544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A number of antibacterial agents acting on FAS components have already been discovered, demonstrating that these systems may be successfully used as a target for new types of antibiotics (8Wright H.T. Reynolds K.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Virga K.G. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

For example, the pantothenamide class of antibiotics has been shown to incapacitate the FAS system by creating inactive forms of acyl carrier protein (ACP) (9Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Virga K.G. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50969-50975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a central player in both systems, ACP shuttles the acyl chain intermediates to various enzymes of the FAS systems. In type II systems, ACPs are small, acidic proteins of about 9 kDa. The structure of ACP is well conserved in different organisms, consisting of three major helices (I, II, IV) that run largely parallel to each other, with helix III markedly shorter and almost perpendicular to the bundle (6White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The acyl chain intermediates in FA synthesis are bound covalently by means of a prosthetic linker on ACP that is derived from coenzyme A in an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by ACP synthase (ACPS) (Fig. 1). This reaction converts apo-ACP to holo-ACP, which has the phosphopantetheine arm attached to a conserved serine residue (residue 36 in Escherichia coli). The prosthetic linker contains a terminal sulfhydryl group that is utilized to covalently bind the acyl chain intermediates in a thioester linkage (Fig. 1). The hydrophobic acyl chain attached to ACP is positioned in between the four-helix bundle in a pocket that is made up of a core of hydrophobic residues (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5217-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). During substrate presentation, the acyl chain must somehow overcome stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with the interior of ACP and inject it into the active site of a partner enzyme. The highly dynamic nature of ACP is thought to be a crucial aspect of its ability to interact with a large number of enzymes as well as the plethora of acyl chains and their intermediates (2Byers D.M. Gong H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These adducts include acyl chains ranging from 3 to 18 carbons in length and their β-keto-, β-hydroxy-, as well as enoyl intermediates and unsaturated fatty acyl groups. A number of structures of apo-, holo-, and acyl-ACP are available as well as structures of ACP-enzyme complexes, highlighting important aspects to ACP function such as helix II, which is known as the recognition helix (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B.

In addition, NMR studies have provided insights into the backbone dynamics of apo- and holo-ACP (16Kim Y. Kovrigin E.L. Eletr Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a dynamic picture of acyl-ACP has been difficult to obtain and a detailed understanding of acyl-chain:ACP interactions remains elusive. It is also unclear how the enzymes of the FAS pathway recognize the appropriate acyl-ACP. Considering that ACP makes up ∼0.25% of all soluble protein in E. coli suggests that there are mechanisms for enzymes to specifically recognize what type of acyl-ACP is bound (17Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand this process, it is essential that a dynamic picture of the substrate behavior attached to ACP is obtained. Furthermore, if the pathway of substrate binding by ACP is revealed, potential drug target sites that are not apparent from static structures alone may be identified. To evaluate these questions we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of apo-, holo-, and saturated acyl-ACPs ranging from 4 to 18 carbon groups in length. The holo- and acyl-ACP simulations were conducted both with the prosthetic group in a solvent-exposed state as well as in a solvent-shielded conformation inside the protein. The simulations provide novel information on the manner of substrate protection by ACP as well as differentiating motions between the apo-, holo-, and acylated forms of the protein. Our findings are substantiated by excellent agreement with experimental data in the literature. Simulation Setup—The MD simulations on E. coli ACP were based on the high resolution (1.2 Å) crystal structure of butyryl-ACP (Protein Data Bank code 1L0I), which contains the acyl chain buried inside the hydrophobic pocket of ACP (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank file was first checked by submitting it to the Biotech Validation Suite for Protein Structures server, and consequently, the side chain of Gln-19 was flipped. Multiple protein conformations for certain atoms were removed based on the best structural agreement in comparison to another crystal structure of Escherichia coli ACP (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 1L0I also contained the mutation I62M, which was used to incorporate a selenomethionine residue into the protein to address the crystallographic phase problem (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For our studies we reversed this mutation through alignments to 1L0H in the program MOLMOL (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) and transferring of coordinates. The resulting structure was used as the starting point for all the simulations described here. The simulations conducted can be categorized into two main groups based on the initial orientation of the acyl chain in the starting structures. The first group of simulations contains ACP with its prosthetic linker in a completely solvent-exposed orientation, whereas the second group is composed of ACP with the prosthetic group in a solvent-inaccessible conformation as is seen in 1L0I. Each of these groups is composed of various ACP members, differing in the length of the prosthetic group attachment. Apo- as well as holo-ACP simulations were set up in addition to saturated acyl chain simulations ranging from butyryl-ACP (4 carbon chain) to octadecanoyl-ACP (18 carbon chain) (Table 1). For the solvent-exposed simulations, the prosthetic group was pointed vertically up from the protein, extending along the axis of helix II. This conformation was chosen as an unbiased orientation such that the prosthetic group can move in as many directions as possible. The starting structures for simulations of ACP with solvent-shielded acyl groups were derived from the butyryl-ACP crystal structure 1L0I by extending the butyryl group incrementally by two carbon groups.TABLE 1ACP MD simulations solvent shielded acyl-chain propertiesAcyl chainCarbon groupsSASAAcyl chain volumecCalculated using the program voidoo (28).Average cavity volumeAcyl chainShieldedaBased on the total surface area of the acyl chain.PhosphopantetheinebRefers to Ser-36 side chain only for apo and Ser-36 as well as the phosphopantetheine group for all others.Å2%Å2Å3Å3Apo78.525.9HoloLinker only202.186.7Butyryl42.198.8249.182140.7Hexanoyl63.698.4257.4116170.9Octanoyl83.498.8240.3149200.4Decanoyl1013.495.2258.9182231.9Dodecanoyl1220.494.6275.3214185.8Tetradecanoyl1433.492.2284.0247186.2Hexadecanoyl1663.586.6309.9280163.5Octadecanoyl1867.486.9315.1314181.2a Based on the total surface area of the acyl chain.b Refers to Ser-36 side chain only for apo and Ser-36 as well as the phosphopantetheine group for all others.c Calculated using the program voidoo (28Kleywegt G.J.

Open table in a new tab The starting structures were initially solvated with explicit simple point charge (SPC) water in a rhombic dodecahedron box. The distance between the protein and edge of the box was ∼1.5 nm, to ensure that the minimum distance between periodic images would not be too low, even with the prosthetic group in an extended conformation directed away from ACP into the solvent. All simulations were performed using the GROMACS 3.2 MD package (19Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7194) Google Scholar, 20Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) and the GROMOS96 43a2 force field containing improved alkane dihedrals parameters (21Scott W.R.P. Hunenberger P.H. Tironi I.G. Mark A.E. Billeter S.R.

Virtual sites were used for hydrogens to remove the highest frequency hydrogen vibrations, permitting the use of a 5-fs time-step (22Feenstra K.A. Hess B. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 786-798Crossref Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The neighbor search was conducted according to the grid method, updating the neighbor list every 4 steps and a neighbor list cut-off of 0.9 nm. All the MD simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions. Constant temperature (300 K, τT = 0.1ps) and pressure were maintained by coupling to a bath using the Berendsen algorithm (23Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Dinola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23462) Google Scholar). Pressure was kept at 1 bar with isotropic temperature coupling, tau τP of 1.0 ps, and compressibility of 4.5 × 10-5 bar-1. Bond lengths were restrained using the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) method (24Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11575) Google Scholar). Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated according to Fast Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) electrostatics (25Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20832) Google Scholar) with a cutoff of 0.9 nm. Van der Waal energies were collected with a twin range cutoff of 0.9/1.4 nm. The bonds and angles of the simple point charge (SPC) water molecules were constrained using the SETTLE algorithm (26Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). After equilibration of the water while restraining the protein, the overall charge of the system was neutralized with 15 sodium counterions (14 ions for apo ACP). Subsequently, the protein was gradually released by decreasing the force constant on the protein in 5 distinct steps (1000, 100, 10, 1, and 0 kJ/mol nm2) of 50 ps simulations each. The simulations of ACP with the acyl chain inside the binding pocket as well as the apo- and holo-ACP simulations were conducted for 20 ns each. The simulations starting off with the prosthetic groups in solvent-exposed conformations were conducted for 50 ns each. Analysis of the trajectories was performed using various GROMACS analysis programs as well as SURFNET (27Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) for the ACP cavity size analysis and VOIDOO (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) for acyl volume calculations. Averaged values for the solvent-shielded simulations were calculated for the last 14 ns of the trajectory, which displayed steady r.m.s.d. values. Phosphopantetheine Topology Building—The phosphopantetheine linker that is attached to ACP represents a new topology non existent in the GROMOS96 library of building blocks (Fig. 1). Most of the parameters such as bond lengths, charges, angles, dihedrals, and improper dihedrals were obtained from subcomponents that have been previously characterized in the GROMOS96 43a2 forcefield. Therefore, most parts of the prosthetic group could be modeled based on these previously established groups. The missing partial charges for the thioester group were calculated using quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanics calculations were performed using GAUSSIAN 03 (29Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13284-13292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The partial charges used were 0.13 for the sulfur atom, 0.25 for the carbonyl carbon, and -0.38 for the carbonyl oxygen. ACP Protein Dynamics—The r.m.s.d. of the backbone atoms of the trajectories remained low compared with their starting structures, stabilizing between 2 and 2.5 Å. In all the simulations ACP shows no significant degree of unfolding beyond a slight unwinding of helix IV in the extreme C-terminal part of the protein. Throughout the apo-, holo-, and acyl-ACP simulations similar regions of elevated root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) values were identified. Loop I between helices I and II shows highly flexible regions immediately after helix I and just before helix II (Fig. 2). The central region of this loop is remarkably stable, displaying backbone RMSF values around 0.6 Å, which is similar to the least flexible regions of ACP. This is because of hydrogen bonds formed between the backbone atoms of residues Asn-24, Ala-26, and Phe-28 with the backbone atoms of Gln-66, Val-65, and Thr-63, respectively, immediately preceding helix IV. Another noticeably flexible region spans residues 47 to 57, which connects helices II and III. Although the magnitude of the fluctuations in most regions of ACP is consistent between apo-, holo-, and the acyl-ACP simulations, there is a clear difference in this region. ACP displays higher RMSF values from residues 47 to 57 when harboring an acyl chain in its hydrophobic binding pocket in each of the simulations conducted. Averaged over all acyl-ACP simulations with an acyl chain occupying the binding cavity, the RMSF is 0.95 ± 0.12 Å, whereas the RMSF is only 0.79 ± 0.05 Å in apo- and holo-ACP. Side-chain fluctuations display the same pattern, with higher RMSF values in acyl-ACP compared with apo- and holo-ACP in this region. The central portions of the helices in ACP are the most rigid segments of the protein, although the ends of the helices show pronounced flexibility as well (Fig. 2). Buried Acyl-ACP Simulations—Acyl-ACP MD simulations with solvent-shielded acyl groups ranging from 4 to 18 carbons in length were performed based on the butyryl-ACP crystal structure (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All of the simulations retained the acyl chain inside the binding pocket, consistent with what has been described in acyl ACP structures from E. coli and spinach (11Roujeinikova A. Baldock C.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5217-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding pocket is located between the three major helices, with the entrance close to the N-terminal end of helix II and additionally bordered by loop I and helix III. The binding cavity is split up into two different binding pockets that are observed to house the tip of the acyl chains (Fig. 3B). The first pocket is similar to the starting structure, analogous to the conformation found in the crystal and NMR acyl-ACP structures between helices II, III, and IV. The second subpocket of the cavity is located more toward helix I, using the same entrance but now residing between helices I, II, and IV (Fig. 3B, Table 2). Whether the tip of the acyl chain binds the first or the second pocket of the binding cavity is determined through a quasi switch that is mediated by the side-chain orientation of Leu-42 and Leu-46. The χ1 angle of Leu-46 measures ∼68° in the starting conformation but switches to ∼-180° almost always when the acyl chain occupies the second sub-pocket (Fig. 3C). The switch in the dihedral angle of Leu-46 opens up a path into the alternate binding cavity of ACP. As a second requirement for the acyl chain to occupy this side of the binding pocket, the χ1 angle of Leu-42 must switch to the energy minimum around -68°. In the starting structures the χ1 angle of Leu-42 measures ∼180° but during the simulation it commonly switches to about -68°. Although this shift does not necessitate acyl chain entry into sub-pocket II, the Leu-42 χ1 angle always measures -68° when sub-pocket II is occupied (Fig. 3C). Similarly to Leu-46, the movement of Leu-42 is required to open up the pathway into the second binding cavity, such that the tip of the acyl chain may enter. Overall, the majority of the simulation time is spent with the tip of the acyl chain oriented into sub-pocket II. The decanoyl chain is the exception to this pattern, as its group resides in sub-pocket I for most of the simulation. In sub-pocket I, the decanoyl chain wraps around helix III at times rather than stick straight into the cavity. The octadecanoyl group adopts a similar conformation and at times penetrates into the solvent between helices III and IV. This behavior was not seen in any of the other simulations.TABLE 2ACP residues contacted in the acyl-chain binding pocketMD simulationsaResidues given that would yield an NOE to the acyl chain in the solvent-shielded simulations based on r−6 distance dependence.Protein Data Bank structuresCommon residuesSub-pocket 1 onlySub-pocket 2 onlyNOEs C10bResidues converted to the E. coli equivalent according to sequence alignment.,cObtained from Zornetzer et al.

Open table in a new tab Solvent-exposed Acyl-ACP Simulations—Five of the eight 50-ns acyl-ACP MD simulations with the acyl chain oriented into the solvent in the starting structure displayed a transition into the hydrophobic binding pocket. The five forms of ACP are butyryl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, decanoyl, and hexadecanoyl. The structures converged very well with the simulations of solvent-shielded acyl-ACPs, yielding very low r.m.s.d. values (supplemental Fig. 1). In the other three trajectories the acyl chain never traversed into the hydrophobic pocket, and usually the prosthetic linker was engaged in hydrogen bonding with the protein which prevented the arm from sampling a broader region of the conformational space. Notably, the longer acyl-ACP simulations did not immerse into the pocket as frequently, as only one of the four longer (>C10) acyl chains was able to find the binding pocket. In those cases additional simulations were conducted with new sets of randomly generated velocities, yet a transition into the binding pocket was not observed. Typically, the acyl chain starts off in an entirely solvent-exposed state and rapidly fluctuates due to the energetic penalty of having the extended hydrophobic acyl chain in contact with the aqueous solvent (Fig. 4A). Using the solvent-accessible surface areas of the acyl chains, the difference in solvation free energy of the acyl chain going from the entirely solvent-exposed state to the buried conformation was calculated (31Eisenberg D. Mclachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The differences measure between 7 and 25 kJ/mol, depending on the acyl chain length, with longer chains resulting in larger energy differences. The acyl chain then usua"
https://openalex.org/W2079223134,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors. BDNF has long been recognized to have potential for the treatment of a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, clinical trials with recombinant BDNF have yet to yield success, leading to the suggestion that alternative means of harnessing BDNF actions for therapeutic use may be required. Here we describe an approach to create low molecular weight peptides that, like BDNF, promote neuronal survival. The peptides were designed to mimic a cationic tripeptide sequence in loop 4 of BDNF shown in previous studies to contribute to the binding of BDNF to the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. The best of these peptides, the cyclic pentapeptide 2 (cyclo(-d-Pro-Ala-Lys-Arg-)), despite being of low molecular weight (Mr 580), was found to be an effective promoter of the survival of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons in vitro (maximal survival, 68 ± 3% of neurons supported by BDNF). Pentapeptide 2 did not affect the phosphorylation of either TrkB (the receptor tyrosine kinase for BDNF) or the downstream signaling molecule MAPK, indicating that its mechanism of neuronal survival action is independent of TrkB. NMR studies reveal that pentapeptide 2 adopts a well defined backbone conformation in solution. Furthermore, pentapeptide 2 was found to be effectively resistant to proteolysis when incubated in a solution of rat plasma in vitro. These properties of pentapeptide 2 (low molecular weight, appropriate pharmacological actions, a well defined solution conformation, and proteolytic stability) render it worthy of further investigation, either as a template for the further design of neuronal survival promoting agents or as a lead compound with therapeutic potential in its own right. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors. BDNF has long been recognized to have potential for the treatment of a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, clinical trials with recombinant BDNF have yet to yield success, leading to the suggestion that alternative means of harnessing BDNF actions for therapeutic use may be required. Here we describe an approach to create low molecular weight peptides that, like BDNF, promote neuronal survival. The peptides were designed to mimic a cationic tripeptide sequence in loop 4 of BDNF shown in previous studies to contribute to the binding of BDNF to the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. The best of these peptides, the cyclic pentapeptide 2 (cyclo(-d-Pro-Ala-Lys-Arg-)), despite being of low molecular weight (Mr 580), was found to be an effective promoter of the survival of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons in vitro (maximal survival, 68 ± 3% of neurons supported by BDNF).

BDNF 5The abbreviations used are: BDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorNGFnerve growth factorNTneurotrophinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyNTRneurotrophin receptorr.m.s.root mean squareMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. is a member of the neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors, along with nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin (NT)-3 and NT-4/5 (1Hallbook F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These proteins play a key role in shaping the vertebrate nervous system during embryonic development by regulating naturally occurring neuronal death (2Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). They have also long been touted as having potential for the treatment for human neurodegenerative diseases, due to their neurotrophic effects on specific neuronal populations that are lost in these diseases. BDNF is particularly attractive in this respect, since it has been shown to promote the survival and/or prevent the degeneration of motor neurons (involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) (3Askanas V. Adv. Neurol. 1995; 68: 241-244PubMed Google Scholar), populations of sensory neurons (sensory neuropathies) (4Lindsay R.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London. 1996; 351: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (Alzheimer disease) (5Siegel G.J. Chauhan N.B. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that BDNF probably plays a specific role in the etiology of Huntington disease, indicating an exciting potential for therapies aimed at replacing BDNF or otherwise mimicking its actions in this condition (7Alberch J. Perez-Navarro E. Canals J.M. Prog. Brain Res. 2004; 146: 195-229PubMed Google Scholar). brain-derived neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor neurotrophin high pressure liquid chromatography neurotrophin receptor root mean square mitogen-activated protein kinase. The effects of BDNF and the other neurotrophins are produced via two transmembrane receptors: members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and the glycoprotein p75NTR. The binding of a neurotrophin to the appropriate Trk member (NGF to TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 to TrkB, and NT-3 primarily to TrkC) causes stepwise homodimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to initiation of multiple signaling cascades, including those for survival (8Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). p75NTR, on the other hand, binds all of the neurotrophins with a common low affinity (KD ≈ 10-9 m) but with differing kinetics (9Rodriguez-Tebar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1990; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The precise biological function of p75NTR has yet to be fully elucidated, but there is strong evidence that it is involved in the signaling of apoptosis, as well as participating in interactions with other regulators of neuronal function, such as the Nogo receptor (10Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It is also likely that p75NTR combines with Trk members to form the high affinity binding sites (KD ≈ 10-11 m) for neurotrophins found on responsive neurons (11Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Thus, there is the opportunity for modulation and cross-talk between the signaling pathways of the Trk family members and p75NTR (12Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), with the ultimate response to a particular neurotrophin depending on the balance of signaling arising from the two receptors. Neurotrophins exist as homodimers of ∼2 × 120 residues. Numerous x-ray crystal structures (e.g. see Refs. 13McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 14Butte M.J. Hwang P.K. Mobley W.C. Fletterick R.J.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2589-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the neurotrophins adopt a common three-dimensional fold, with each monomer consisting of seven longtitudinal β-strands connected by three solvent-exposed hairpin loops (loops 1, 2, and 4) and a longer loop (loop 3). The monomers are further characterized by three fully conserved disulfide bridges arranged in a cystine knot motif, characteristic of this superfamily of growth factors. Unlike most of the other members of the superfamily, however, the neurotrophin monomers in the homodimer are held together by noncovalent interactions only and are arranged in a parallel fashion. The latter feature places the six hairpin loops together at one end of the molecule. A variety of studies of the interactions of the neurotrophins with their receptors have revealed that residues in the solvent-exposed loops play an important role in mediating contacts with Trk members and p75NTR. For example, replacement of the residues of loop 2 from NGF with the corresponding residues from loop 2 of BDNF gives a molecule able to bind to and activate TrkB (16Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In support of this, we have shown that monomeric monocyclic peptides designed to mimic a single loop 2 of BDNF act as antagonists of BDNF-mediated neuronal survival in culture (17O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the complex of NGF with one of the Ig domains of TrkA shows that residues from loop 1 of NGF make direct contact with the receptor (18Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In other site-directed mutagenesis studies, key interactions between neurotrophins and p75NTR have been demonstrated to be localized to three basic residues, distributed between loops 1 and 4 in NGF, NT-3, and NT-4/5, and as a contiguous cationic tripeptide (Lys-Lys-Arg) in loop 4 of BDNF (19Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Ryden M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite promising preclinical data in a range of relevant animal models, neurotrophic factors generally have not lived up to their promise in the clinic. For example, recombinant BDNF failed to show demonstrable benefit to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a large scale phase III trial (21The BDNF Study Group (Phase III)Neurology. 1999; 52: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that this failure is likely to have been caused, at least in part, by the poor pharmacokinetic behavior exhibited by recombinant BDNF, in particular a short plasma half-life (t½ of BDNF in rats is less than 1 min) (22Poduslo J.F. Curran G.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This outcome, along with similar results from trials with other neurotrophic factors, has led to the recognition that alternative means of harnessing the actions of BDNF and other neurotrophic factors for therapeutic use (i.e. other than using recombinant protein) will need to be found. One way to achieve this would be to develop small molecule mimetics of BDNF. We have previously described a structure-based design approach that has successfully yielded potent mimics of BDNF (23O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25738-25744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Bicyclic dimeric peptides, consisting of a pair of disulfide-constrained mimics of loop 2 of BDNF tethered by either a disulfide or amide link, act as BDNF-like partial agonists in vitro, promoting the survival of chick sensory neurons in culture. Incorporation of an additional dimerizing linkage afforded a highly conformationally constrained tricyclic dimer with potent neuronal survival actions in vitro (EC50 = 11 pm). Further examinations with disulfide-constrained cyclic peptides based on loops 1 and 4 of BDNF revealed that generally, monomeric, monocyclic peptides as well as heterodimeric bicyclic peptides are BDNF inhibitors, whereas homodimeric, bicyclic peptides are BDNF-like agonists (24Fletcher J.M. Hughes R.A. J. Pept. Sci. 2006; 12: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, although they are significantly reduced in size compared with BDNF itself, the molecular weight and complex nature of these dimeric peptides would pose considerable challenges for their development as clinically useful agents. In an effort to obtain compounds with increased potential as drug leads, as well as to further probe the role of the solvent exposed loops of BDNF in mediating its neurotrophic actions, we describe here a series of small, monomeric circular peptides aimed at mimicking the putative p75NTR-binding cationic tripeptide sequence within loop 4 of BDNF. Cyclic peptides incorporating a variety of conformational constraints were designed, and selected compounds were synthesized and examined for (i) their ability to promote the survival of cultures of embryonic chick sensory neurons, (ii) their ability to affect signaling through the receptors for BDNF, and (iii) their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation in rat plasma in vitro. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy methods were used to determine the three-dimensional structure of one of these circular peptides in solution. Peptides were designed with the aid of the molecular modeling software packages Sybyl version 6.4 and Hyperchem version 4.0. The three sequential p75NTR-binding residues in loop 4 of BDNF (Lys94-Lys95-Arg96) were isolated from a model of the three-dimensional structure of BDNF derived via homology modeling techniques (17O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25738-25744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Using visual examination, a wide range of means of constraining this tripeptide were explored, from which a selection were built by adding appropriate amino acid(s) to the tripeptide and forming a single bond between the N and C termini. These residues/constraints explored included pairings of Gly, Ala, and Pro (including d-forms), β-amino acids, and other ω-alkyl amino acids of varying lengths. Each molecule thus obtained was then optimized to a local minimum energy conformation using the AMBER molecular mechanics force field implemented in HyperChem. Cyclic peptides that yielded low energy conformations following optimization were then subjected to a more rigorous conformational search using the Conformational Search command in HyperChem, in which backbone torsion angles were varied randomly and the resultant structure was minimized as described above. Unique low energy conformations were stored, whereas high energy or duplicate structures (i.e. root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of nonhydrogen atoms <0.25 Å or backbone torsion angles within 5° of previously obtained conformations) were discarded. The similarity of the generated conformations to the native tripeptide in BDNF was determined by measuring the r.m.s. deviation of the α- and β-carbon atoms of the Lys-Lys-Arg sequence between the native and cyclic peptides. Linear peptides were assembled on chlorotrityl resin from fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids, using standard solid phase synthesis methods (25Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar) on a PS3 peptide synthesizer (Peptide Technologies, Tucson Arizona). The side chain-protected linear peptides were liberated by treating the resin-bound peptide with acetic acid/trifluoroethanol/dichloromethane (1:1:8). The crude side chain-protected peptides were cyclized by dissolving them in dichloromethane (0.5 mg/ml) and adding O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (2 eq) and diisopropyl-ethylamine (3 eq). The progress of the cyclization reaction was monitored by reverse phase HPLC. The final fully deprotected cyclic peptides (and linear peptides as appropriate) were obtained by treating the corresponding protected peptides in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol/H2O (18:1:1) for 90 min), followed by precipitation in cold ether and purification by HPLC. Peptides were purified (and cyclization reactions were monitored) by reverse phase HPLC on analytical (53 × 7 mm C18 Rocket column; Alltech) and semipreparative (250 × 10 mm C18 (Alltech); 250 × 7 mm diphenyl (Vydac)) columns as appropriate. All final peptides eluted as single peaks after purification. The identity of all linear and protected intermediates and final peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (performed either by Dr. Stuart Thomson (Victorian College of Pharmacy, Monash University) or Dr. Nicholas Williamson (ImmunoID Pty. Ltd.)). All peptides (intermediates and final products) gave molecular ions with a mass/charge ratio within 0.1% of calculated values. Peptides were examined for effects on neuronal survival in primary cultures of sensory neurons prepared from 8-day-old embryonic chicks as described previously (23O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25738-25744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Peptides (1 × 10-8 to 1 × 10-5 m) were added to wells in triplicate 30 min after plating of neurons either alone (for concentration-response studies) or in combination with mouse recombinant BDNF (4 × 10-10 m). BDNF alone was used a positive control. Negative control wells contained neither peptide nor BDNF. After a 48-h incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2), the number of surviving neurons in each well was determined by counting phase bright cells at ×200 magnification in 80 randomly chosen fields (0.25 × 0.25 mm). Data are expressed as percentage of surviving neurons compared with BDNF-only positive controls (typically 30–45% of plated sensory neurons). Cell Culture—293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (MultiCel). In preparation for signaling studies, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed in one volume of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and then serum-starved for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Generation of TrkB Stable Cell Lines—The trkB gene (a gift from Barbara Hempstead, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) was subcloned in the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) using standard molecular biology. 293 cells were transfected using the Gene-juice transfection reagent (Merck) and selected with 500 mg/ml G418 (A1720; Sigma). Surviving clones were expanded, and whole cell lysates were screened by Western blot for TrkB expression. Low expressing TrkB clones were identified and analyzed for BDNF responsiveness to identify cell lines that expressed nonconstitutively active TrkB receptors and responded to BDNF. To analyze the effect of BDNF and cyclic pentapeptide 2 on TrkB phosphorylation and signaling, two distinct stable transfectants were analyzed. Briefly, ∼4 × 105 cells were subcultured onto 6-well plates and maintained in full serum overnight. The next day, cells were starved as indicated above and then treated with serum free medium alone or serum-free medium containing BDNF (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech) or pentapeptide 2 (10-5 m). Assays were performed over (i) differing time periods (1, 5, 15, 60, and 180 min), and (ii) differing concentrations of BDNF (1 pg/ml, 10 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml). Plates were then placed on ice, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in TNE (Tris, NaCl, EDTA) buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and cleared. Total protein content was determined using the Bradford method (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein were reduced in standard Laemmli buffer and boiled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Chemicon). Membranes were blotted for the presence of native proteins with anti-pan-Trk (C-14 sc-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-TrkB (a gift from Moses Chao, New York University) (26Arevalo J.C. Waite J. Rajagopal R. Beyna M. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2006; 50: 549-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), anti-MAPK(Erk1,2) (9102; Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-phospho-MAPK(Erk1,2) (9101; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunocomplexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences) and imaged digitally (LAS-3000; Fujifilm). The p75NTR-dependent NF-κB luciferase assay was recapitulated in 293 cells, following a previously published protocol (29Rance M. Soerensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuethrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were cultured as above, plated at 2.5 × 106 cells/plate in a 100-mm plate, and transfected with an NF-κB reporter construct (catalog number 219078; Stratagene), constitutively active Renilla reporter (pRL-TK, E2241; Promega), Myc-RIP2 (a gift from Moses Chao; New York University), and p75NTR or an empty vector using the calcium phosphate method. After transfection, cells were incubated overnight and then collected and evenly distributed into a 12-well plate for 24 h. Cells were then serum-starved for 4 h and then treated with serum-free medium, serum-free medium containing 100 ng/ml NGF, and serum-free medium containing 100 ng/ml BDNF for 4 h. Cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase and Renilla activity following the manufacturer's protocols (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay, catalog number E1960; Promega), using a single tube dual injector luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold). Conditions were repeated in triplicate, and relative luciferase unit values were normalized to the constitutively active Renilla luminescence for the same sample. Data were normalized such that luciferase activity in the control condition = 1. NMR spectra of cyclic pentapeptide 2 were acquired on a Varian Inova 400-MHz NMR spectrometer. A lyophilized sample of peptide was dissolved in 550 μl of 10% D2O, and the pH was adjusted to 5.2. One-dimensional 1H spectra were obtained with a sweep width of 4000 Hz over 8192 points. Solvent suppression was achieved with selective low power saturation. Sample one-dimensional spectra were measured at a series of temperatures (30, 15, and 5 °C), and no significant temperature dependence was seen (data not shown). All subsequent spectra were recorded at 15 °C. Two-dimensional spectra were then acquired with a sweep width of 4000 Hz over 1024 points, with 800 t1 increments. TOCSY (28Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) and DQF-COSY (29Rance M. Soerensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuethrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired for use in spin system assignments, whereas ROESY (30Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar) spectra were acquired to generate distance constraints. Spectra were initially transformed using the Varian NMR software package to check for quality of the data. Subsequently, spectra were transformed using NMRpipe (B. A. Johnson; Merck) and analyzed using NMRview. Complete assignment of all nonexchangeable proton resonances relative to an internal TMS standard was made (see supplemental material). Dihedral constraints for the backbone ϕ angles were derived from 3JNH-CαH coupling constants measured from one-dimensional spectra. A total of 61 structurally important distance constraints and four backbone ϕ angles were determined. Structure calculation was carried out using the software package DYANA (31Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Cyclization of the peptide was achieved by introducing a set of special distance constraints to bring the N and C termini together and restrain the peptide bond angles to 180°. A modified version of the residue library DYANA containing a set of parameters defining a d-Pro residue was produced to allow calculations to include the d-Pro residue of peptide 2. A total of 100 structures were calculated on the basis of the NMR-derived constraint list using 10,000 steps of simulated annealing followed by 2000 steps of minimization of the DYANA target function. The 20 structures with the lowest target function were then selected as the final family representing the structure of pentapeptide 2. Peptides (circular pentapeptide 2, linear pentapeptide 1, and substance P (as a positive control); 1 mg/ml) were incubated (37 °C) in a solution of freshly prepared rat plasma (50% in phosphate-buffered saline; 200 μl) containing 4-isopropylbenzylacohol (0.05% v/v) as an internal standard ((32Bolin D.R. Swain A.L. Sarabu R. Berthel S.J. Gillespie P. Huby N.J. Makofske R. Orzechowski L. Perrotta A. Toth K. Cooper J.P. Jiang N. Falcioni F. Campbell R. Cox D. Gaizband D. Belunis C.J. Vidovic D. Ito K.

At various times, samples (10 μl) were removed, and l-lysine monohydrochloride (1000 equivalents in 10 μl) was added to displace peptide from plasma protein binding sites. Plasma proteins were then precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile (60 μl) and removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 10,000 × g), and the supernatant (60 μl) was collected and diluted with water (100 μl). The remaining peptide was determined in aliquots (50 μl) using HPLC, by comparing the area of peptide peak and internal standard peaks. Where degradation was seen, one-phase exponential decay curves were fitted (GraphPad Prism software), and the half-life of the peptide was determined. Half-lives were determined in this manner from three independent experiments, which were then averaged and expressed as mean ± S.E. In instances where no degradation was observed, at the final time point, the peptide peak was collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry (i.e. to rule out the possibility of degradation having occurred without a noticeable shift in retention time). Design and Synthesis of Circular Peptide Mimetics of the p75NTR-binding Motif of BDNF—A computer-aided molecular design approach was used to determine possible means of constraining and presenting the p75NTR-binding tripeptide motif Lys94-Lys95-Arg96 in loop 4 of BDNF as a circular peptide (see Fig. 1). A wide range of constraints was considered, comprising both natural and unnatural amino acids. Using a visually directed approach, 57 peptides were selected and built in silico, and their energy was minimized. From this, we obtained nine compounds with little steric strain, which we thus considered likely to be readily synthetically accessible. Interestingly, seven of these compounds contained a d-Pro residue attached C-terminally to the Arg residue, whereas five contained flexible alkyl ω-amino acids. When subjected to a conformational search, two of these peptides (the d-Pro-containing pentapeptide 2 and the 6-aminohexanoyl-containing tetrapeptide 4) showed considerable similarity to the native tripeptide, in that 70% of their low energy conformations identified were deemed to be similar to the conformation of the native tripeptide (r.m.s. deviation of α and β carbon atoms of tripeptide sequence <0.4 Å). The circular peptides 2 and 4 were synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols, in which their linear side chain-protected precursors were liberated from acid-labile chlorotrityl resin, cyclized in solution, and deprotected. Analogues of circular pentapeptide 2 (peptides 5 and 6, to allow the importance of the nature of the cyclizing constraint to be examined, and peptides 7 and 8, to allow the role of the Lys residues in the tripeptide motif to be probed) were prepared using a similar strategy. The linear analogues of 2 and 4 (i.e. peptides 1 and 3) were obtained by omitting the cyclization step. All peptides synthesized were purified to homogeneity by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry (Table 1). It is interesting to note, however, that the synthesis of several other peptides was attempted (e.g. the Pro-Ala analogue of peptide 2), but these could not be induced to cyclize, despite attempts with a variety of cyclization reagents and conditions. This is probably due to the high degree of conformational rigidity exhibited by these peptides, exemplified by pentapeptide 2 (see below).TABLE 1Sequence, observed and predicted mass spectral data, and maximal neuronal survival effects of peptides synthesized in this studyNumberStructurem/z ([M+H]+ predicted)Maximum survival percentage (at concentration m)1H-d-Pro-Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg-OH598.0 (598.4)NSaNS, no significant survival effect observed2Cyclo(d-Pro-Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg-)580.6 (580.4)38 ± 3 (10–6), 68 ± 3 (10–4)3H-AhxbAhx, 6-aminohexanoyl-Lys-Lys-Arg-OH"

Using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biological methods, we have undertaken a functional analysis of yeast Alg13 and Alg14 proteins to elucidate the mechanism of their interaction. Our mutational studies demonstrated that a short C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 is required for interaction with Alg14 and for enzyme activity. Electrostatic surface views of the modeled Alg13/14 complex suggest the presence of a hydrophobic cleft in Alg14 that provides a pocket for the Alg13 C-terminal α-helix. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the C-terminal three amino acids of Alg14 are required for maintaining the integrity of Alg13/Alg14 complex, and this depends on their hydrophobicity. Modeling studies place these three Alg14 residues at the entrance of the hydrophobic-binding pocket, suggesting their role in the stabilization of the interaction between the C termini of Alg13 and Alg14. Together, these results demonstrate that formation of this hetero-oligomeric complex is mediated by a short C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 in cooperation with the last three amino acids of Alg14. In addition, deletion of the N-terminal β-strand of Alg13 caused the destruction of protein, indicating the structural importance of this region in protein stability.

Protein asparagine N-glycosylation is one of the most frequent and common protein modifications that is important because it required for the structure and function of glycoproteins. The process of the N-glycosylation is initiated with the biosynthesis of a highly conserved dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) 3The abbreviations used are: LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dol, dolichol; OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; GTase, glycosyltransferases; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HA, hemagglutinin. 3The abbreviations used are: LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dol, dolichol; OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; GTase, glycosyltransferases; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HA, hemagglutinin.

In this process, formation of a 14 sugar oligosaccharide is sequentially catalyzed by conserved ER glycosyltransferases (4Weerapana E. Imperiali B. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 91R-101RCrossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation is essential for viability, and mutations that affect glycosyltransferases that synthesize early steps of LLO are lethal (5Kukuruzinska M.A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The second step of LLO synthesis produces GlcNAc2PP-Dol by transferring an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-PP-Dol. This reaction is catalyzed by an unusual eukaryotic glycosyltransferase that is comprised of two separate polypeptides, Alg13 and Alg14 (6Gao X.D. Tachikawa H. Sato T. Jigami Y. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol.

Alg14 is a membrane protein that recruits the cytosolic Alg13 protein to the ER to form a hetero-oligomeric complex that catalyzes the biosynthesis of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (6Gao X.D. Tachikawa H. Sato T. Jigami Y. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alg13 contains the catalytic domain of the UDP-GlcNAc transferase, but cytosolic Alg13 is not active unless bound to Alg14 at the ER membrane (9Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34500-34506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting the formation of the Alg13/14 complex is crucial for UDP-GlcNAc transferase activity. Formation of Alg13/14 complex has also been suggested to be a target for regulation of N-linked glycosylation. Unassembled excess cytosolic Alg13p inhibits N-linked glycosylation, and is prevented to accumulate intracellularly by proteasomal degradation (10Averbeck N. Gao X.D. Nishimura S. Dean N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing further evidence for the importance of Alg13/14 complex formation. Alg13 and Alg14 were first identified in silico by their structural homology to the bacterial MurG protein (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MurG is an UDP-GlcNAc undecaprenyl-PP-MurNAc pentapeptide: N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase that plays an essential role in peptidoglycan biosynthesis of Escherichia coli (11Mengin-Lecreulx D. Texier L. Rousseau M. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4625-4636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MurG belongs to the GT-B glycosyltransferases (GTases) superfamily (12Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and is one of the few family members whose crystal structure is solved. MurG contain two distinct domains, each of which contains several Rossmann folds that are postulated to be involved nucleotide sugar binding and transfer, as well as lipid acceptor recognition. The C-terminal domain contains the UDP-GlcNAc binding and catalytic and the enzymatic reaction occurs, while the N-terminal domain contains the putative lipid-acceptor recognition domain (13Ha S. Walker D. Shi Y. Walker S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alg13 protein is predicted to contain the conserved catalytic domain, found in the C-terminal domain of MurG, while Alg14 contains the predicted lipid acceptor (and membrane) associating domain, found in the N-terminal domain (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, a NMR structure of yeast soluble Alg13 (2jzc) has been described. Although the N-terminal half of Alg13 contains an irregular mixed α/β domain rather the predicted motif, this NMR analysis still suggests the presence of a highly conserved Rossmann fold in the C-terminal half of Alg13 (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) consistent with the predicted model (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These structural similarities between MurG and Alg13/14 complex lead to the idea that eukaryotic LLO synthesis evolved from the bacterial glycosylation process but the questions of why the Alg13/14 UDP-GlcNAc transferase split to two subunits and what regulates their interaction remain. In this study, we report that the interaction between Alg13 and Alg14 rely on remarkably short domains. Complex formation requires only the C-terminal α-helix (comprised of fifteen amino acids) of Alg13 and the last three amino acids of Alg14. Homology Modeling of the Alg13/Alg14 Complex—A refined three-dimensional homology model of the yeast Alg13/14 complex was first constructed based on the crystal structure of E. coli MurG (PDB code: 1NLM Chain A) using the Modeler 9.1 (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10548) Google Scholar, 17Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The sequence/template alignment between the MurG and Alg13/14 subunits was used for the modeling (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Divisions between the Alg13 and Alg14 sequences were described by using character “/”, and gaps were inserted. The model was constructed in the following three steps: (i) Two hundred models of the first construction were generated using the Auto-model class. The model with the best objective score was selected and advanced to next step. (ii) The geometry of its loop regions was roughly optimized using Loopmodel, and the best model in 100 candidates was selected for the next calculation. (iii) To further optimize a large loop in yeast Alg13 subunit (from 53 to 79 residues), the best model selected in the second step was again applied to Loopmodel class. The final three-dimensional model of the Alg13/14 complex was then selected from fifty candidates that had the best objective score. The DOPE scores calculated for the model (yeast Alg13/14 complex) and MurG were −38927.46 and −41430.95, respectively. To reassemble the experimental NMR structure of Alg13 (obtained from the protein data (PDB; 2jzc) the experimentally determined 2jzc structure was used to replace the modeled Alg13 structure using PyMol program code developed by DeLano Scientific LLC. To reconstruct the model of the Alg13/14 complex, orientation of last 12 amino acids (from Ser-191 to Ser-202) including the C-terminal α-helix in 2jzc was re-directed based on the structure information of MurG. The minimization for this re-orientation was conducted by using MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc.) with Amber94 force fields. The SYBYL 7.1 program package (Tripos, Inc.) was used (18Ghose A.K. Ghose V.N. Viswanadhan J. J. W. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1998; 102: 3762-3772Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar) for representing the molecular surface of Alg14 and the C-terminal region of Alg13 shown in Fig. 4. To present topological diagrams of Alg13 and Alg14 in predicted Alg13/14 complex, the experimentally determined secondary structure of 2jzc (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the secondary structure predictions of Alg14 (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A.

Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and Media—Plasmids used in this work and their important features are listed in Table 1. Standard molecular biology techniques were used for all plasmid constructions (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

To prepare detergent-solubilized extracts, spheroplasts (6–7 absorbance units) were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2) with protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (6Gao X.D. Tachikawa H. Sato T. Jigami Y. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To prepare an ER-enriched membrane fraction, 6–7 absorbance units of exponentially growing yeast cells were lysed by glass bead beating in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove the unbroken cells and wall debris. The collected post 3,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min in a TOMY MX-301 centrifuge. The pellet (P20) was re-suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer followed by the determination of its protein concentration. This P20 fraction was used as the ER membrane fraction. Equivalent amounts of protein in each fraction were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blotted with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) or a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Anti-[HA]-Peroxidase, Roche Applied Sciences) and detected by chemiluminescence (CDP-Star Detection Reagent, ROCHE or ECL, GE). Co-immunoprecipitation—Epitope-tagged proteins in 1% Triton X-100 extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA Affinity Matrix (Sigma Aldrich) as described (6Gao X.D. Tachikawa H. Sato T. Jigami Y. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36254-36262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After separating proteins by 12% SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitates were transferred to immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). To detect the FLAG-tagged proteins, the membrane was blotted with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Rockland, Inc.) followed by a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Chemicom, International). Stereo Structure Suggests the Importance of Termini for Formation of the Alg13/Alg14 Complex—Primary sequence alignment only shows a low similarity between yeast Alg13, Alg14 proteins, and E. coli MurG. But the experimentally determined Alg13 structure (2jzc) and secondary structure prediction of Alg14 indicates their structural homology to MurG (Fig. 1, C and D). To gain more information about the Alg13/14 complex, its stereo structure was modeled based on the structure of 2jzc and predicted structure of Alg14 (8Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using MurG as a guide (see “Experimental Procedures”). It should be noted that 2jzc structure does not reveal information about the interaction between Alg13 and Alg14, because this NMR structure of Alg13 was determined using soluble monomeric Alg13 (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is inactive as a glycosyltransferase (9Bickel T. Lehle L. Schwarz M. Aebi M. Jakob C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34500-34506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To reassemble “2jzc” with Alg14 and model the active complex, the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 was re-orientated based on the structure of MurG. The ribbon-represented structure and topological diagrams in Fig. 1 show the predicted Alg13/Alg14 complex (Fig. 1A) adopting a GT-B fold with a two-domain architecture that shows marked similarities to MurG (Fig. 1B) except that the N-terminal half of Alg13 fold contains an irregular mixed α/β domain rather the predicted N-terminal Rossmann motif (Fig. 1D) (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alg14 contains a classical fold with central seven-stranded parallel β-sheets (Fig. 1, A–C, drawn in yellow) flanked by α-helices (Fig. 1, A–C, drawn in red), suggesting that Alg14 can be well modeled on the N-terminal domain of MurG. Like the C-terminal domain of MurG, Alg13 possesses an extended C-terminal α-helix (Alg13C) that is predicted to closely appose Alg14 (Fig. 1A, drawn in blue). This extended α-helix of MurG is considered to be the major feature of the GT-B fold (Fig. 1B, drawn in blue). Other notable structural differences between the predicted Alg13/Alg14 complex and MurG were also found. Alg14 possesses a transmembrane domain at its N terminus that is absent in MurG (Fig. 1A, indicated by a solid arrow, real structure extends out of the panel; or 1C, shown as a white box.). Another major difference is the absence of the linker peptide that connects the two Rossman fold domains of MurG (Fig. 1B, drawn in green). According to our predicted model, a consequence of the absence of this linker is that the N terminus of Alg13 and the C terminus of Alg14 are exposed at the surface of the complex (Fig. 1A). Especially, the exposed C terminus of Alg14 positions it near the end of the extended C-terminal α-helix of Alg13, suggesting the possibility that these terminal regions of Alg13 and Alg14 mediate their interaction. To test this model, we performed a series of molecular biological experiments using a yeast cell system to examine the structural and functional importance of these terminal regions. The Predicted C-terminal α-Helix of Alg13 Is Important for Its Interaction with Alg14—To test if the C terminus of Alg13 is required for enzyme activity and/or complex formation, mutant alleles encoding Alg13 proteins deleted for three (alg13-CΔ3) or fifteen (alg13-CΔ15) C-terminal amino acids were constructed. Truncated proteins were tagged with an N-terminal triple FLAG tag. The C terminus of yeast Alg13 contains hydrophobic amino acids (-FXXLLVXXIX-) and is predicted to adopt a α-helical structure (Fig. 2A). Deletion of fifteen amino acids completely disrupts this α-helix. To test their functionality, mutant alg13 alleles were introduced into a PGAL1-ALG13 strain (XGY154) containing ALG13 under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter. This strain grows normally in galactose, but fails to grow when ALG13 gene expression is repressed by glucose. These complementation experiments demonstrated that while deletion of three amino acids had no affect on Alg13, deletion of fifteen C-terminal amino acids completely impaired Alg13 function since FLAG-alg13-CΔ15 failed to complement growth of PGAL1-ALG13 strain XGY154 cells in glucose (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the C-terminal α-helix domain of Alg13 is essential for its function. Our structural analysis suggested that the C terminus of Alg13 is involved in its interaction with Alg14. To test if this idea is correct, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Yeast strains were constructed that co-express N-terminally HA-tagged Alg14 with N-terminally FLAG-tagged Alg13-CΔ15p or wild type Alg13p as a positive control (Fig. 2C). Detergent extracts were prepared from these strains and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g to remove any nonspecific protein aggregates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Alg14 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA affinity matrix. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-FLAG rabbit antibodies to determine if the truncated alg13-CΔ15p bound to Alg14. Unlike wild-type Alg13p, we found that HA-tagged Alg14 failed to bind FLAG-tagged Alg13-CΔ15p (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). Our failure to detect any bound Alg13-CΔ15p was not caused by lowered intracellular levels of this protein because Alg13 lacking its C-terminal 15 amino acids is as stable and as abundant as wild-type Alg13 protein in detergent extracts (Fig. 2C, lane 5 or 6, lanes 4–6). These results demonstrated that the C-terminal fifteen amino acids of Alg13 is required for the interaction between Alg14 and Alg13 and suggest that the predicted α-helix mediates this interaction. The C Terminus of Alg14 Is Required for Its Interaction with Alg13—Our computational analysis on stereo structure of yeast Alg14 implied that the C-terminal region is involved in complex formation (Fig. 1). Fig. 3A shows the C-terminal amino acid sequence of yeast Alg14 protein that include the predicted β-strand. To test whether or not this conserved region of Alg14 protein is important for its interaction with Alg13, mutant alleles were constructed that encoded truncated Alg14, lacking three (HA-alg14-CΔ3) or twelve (HA-alg14-CΔ12) C-terminal amino acids. These truncated Alg14 proteins were tagged with an N-terminal triple HA. These truncated Alg14 proteins were expressed in a yeast strain containing ALG14 under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter (XGY151) and tested by complementation of loss of Alg14 function in the presence of glucose. Surprisingly, neither HA-alg14-CΔ3 nor HA-alg14-CΔ12 complemented the growth of XGY151 strain in the presence of glucose (Fig. 3B), suggesting that deletion of just three amino acids from the C terminus of Alg14 protein completely impaired Alg14 function. To study how these C-terminal residues affect Alg14 function, the stability of these truncated Alg14 proteins and their interaction with Alg13 were tested. Strains were constructed that co-express these HA-tagged truncated Alg14 proteins and FLAG-tagged Alg13 proteins. The steady state levels of these mutant proteins (HA-Alg14-CΔ3p or HA-Alg14-CΔ12p) in ER membranes, prepared by differential centrifugation, were compared quantitatively to wild-type HA-Alg14 protein by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. This experiment demonstrated that both the normal and truncated Alg14 proteins were at relatively similar levels in the ER (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). These results demonstrated that deletion of up to twelve C-terminal amino acids had no significant effect on Alg14 protein stability. To determine if these residues are required for an interaction with Alg13, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was used. To measure the relative amount of FLAG-tagged Alg13 that associated with the HA-tagged mutant or wild-type Alg14, detergent extracts were prepared, and proteins that precipitated with anti-HA antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG rabbit antibodies (Fig. 3D). Unlike wild-type Alg14p, neither HA-Alg14-CΔ12p nor HA-Alg14-CΔ3p precipitated FLAG-tagged Alg13 protein (Fig. 3D, lanes 2–4). These results demonstrated that just the last three amino acids of Alg14 protein are required for its interaction with Alg13. The Hydrophobicity of C-terminal Alg14 Amino Acids Is Implicated in Mediating Its Interaction with Alg13—A close up electrostatic surface view of the predicted yeast Alg13/14 complex from our computational analyses suggested that the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 (Fig. 4, A and B, shown in scheme) is inserted in a cleft formed in the Alg14 subunit (Fig. 4, A and B, colored with brown inside the white circle). This model suggests that the interaction between Alg13 and Alg14 takes place within a hydrophobic pocket. The back or side view of the C-terminal region of Alg13 show that its C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 4C in window and D) has its hydrophobic face surrounded by Alg14 hydrophobic residues in this binding pocket. These observations raise the possibility that the assembly of Alg13/14 complex occurs through hydrophobic interactions between these two domains. Furthermore, the molecular surface view also supports the idea that last three amino acids of Alg14 are involved in Alg13/14 complex formation. These three hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 3A) are found at the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 4, A and B, indicated by red arrow), where we hypothesize they could function as a key to lock the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 into the hydrophobic pocket. To further understand the involvement of C-terminal residues of Alg14 in complex formation, this domain of Alg14 was compared in other species (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, Alg14 proteins in most eukaryotes contain a similar C terminus that includes an invariant glycine residue (Fig. 5, marked with star). These amino acids are predicted to fold into a β-strand that is followed by a tail consisting of the last 3 amino acids (Fig. 5). The hydrophobicity of this “tail” has been conserved; Fungal Alg14 proteins contain hydrophobic amino acids at their last three positions while plants and animals contain two. This conservation suggested that hydrophobicity of this tail might be important for function. To test this idea, the last three (ILV) or two (LV) amino acids of yeast Alg14 were altered. Plasmids expressing Alg14p with last two or three residues replaced by G were constructed and introduced into the PGAL1-ALG14 strain (XGY151) to test for complementation of alg14. Replacement of ILV or LV residues to G led to severe Alg14 dysfunction because the PGAL1-ALG14 cells expressing Alg14 ILV or LV to G mutant proteins grew very slowly, even after incubation at 30 °C for 3 days on YPD medium supplemented with glucose (Fig. 6. left panel). Each of these proteins was also FLAG-tagged at the N terminus. We confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody that these mutations did not affect protein production or stability since each of these mutant proteins was produced at levels comparable to wild-type Alg14p (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of the last 3 or 2 C-terminal amino acids of Alg14 protein plays an important role in Alg13/14 function. The Predicted N-terminal β-Strand of Yeast Alg13 Is Required for Protein Stability—Our computational analyses revealed that the N terminus of Alg13 is exposed to at the surface of Alg13, but no structural evidence indicating its involvement in the interaction with Alg14 (Fig. 1A). To test whether or not this region is important for complex formation and function, two alg13 mutant alleles were constructed that encode proteins lacking six or ten N-terminal amino acids. Both Alg13-truncated proteins were also tagged at the C terminus with a triple FLAG epitope to facilitate their detection. Fig. 7A shows the sequence of these N-terminal amino acids including the position of the predicted β-strand of the Rossman fold, which starts from 8th (A) residue. Deletion of ten amino acids is predicted to destroy this 1st β-strand (Fig. 7A). Both mutant alg13 alleles were tested for function by complementation of loss of Alg13 function in the PGAL1-ALG13 strain (XGY154) grown in glucose. Deletion of the first six amino acids of Alg13 had no effect on enzyme activity because expression of alg13-NΔ6-FLAG supported the growth of the PGAL1-ALG13 strain in the presence of glucose. In contrast, alg13-NΔ10-FLAG failed to support the growth of PGAL1-ALG13 strain in the presence of glucose (Fig. 7B), suggesting that these ten amino acids are required for Alg13 protein stability or enzyme function, which includes its involvement in complex formation with Alg14. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the effect of NΔ10 on protein stability. Whole cell detergent extracts were prepared from wild-type yeast (W303a) harboring plasmids that encode triple C-terminally FLAG-tagged Alg13p or mutant Alg13 proteins (Alg13-NΔ6p or Alg13-NΔ10p, see Table 1). The steady state levels of these proteins were compared with the wild type Alg13-FLAG protein by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7C). While deletion of six amino acids from the N terminus of Alg13 had no affect on its stability, deletion of an additional four amino acids (Alg13-NΔ10p) that perturbs the predicted β-strand structure resulted in almost undetectable level of Alg13 (Fig. 7C). These results demonstrate that sequences predicted to comprise a β-strand structure in N terminus of Alg13 are required for its stability and cell viability. The assembly of the Alg13 and Alg14 subunits is critical for the activity of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase and contributes to the regulation of N-linked glycosylation in eukaryotic cells. Despite the importance of formation of Alg13/14 complex, little is known about the molecular mechanism that mediates its assembly. Using computational and molecular biological analyses, we report the functional importance of the C termini of Alg13 and Alg14 in mediating complex formation. Molecular Mechanism of the Interaction between Alg13 and Alg14—Despite the low sequence similarity, we found that Alg13 and Alg14 can be modeled on the MurG structure as a threading template. Like the most of GT-B structures, MurG has two distinct domains that are connected directly by a linker peptide (Fig. 1B, drawn in green). Although the NMR structure of Alg13 indicates its unconventional N-terminal Rossmann motif, Alg13 in modeled Alg13/14 complex still possesses structural similarity to the C-terminal domain of MurG (Fig. 1, A, B, and D) (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Comparing to the Alg13, Alg14 in modeled complex presents a classical Rossmann fold resembling the N-terminal domain of MurG (Fig. 1, A–C). An extended C-terminal α-helix of MurG (Fig. 1B, drawn in blue) has been proposed to function as a connector of the two domains, and in the formation of the two Rossmann folds architecture (21Grizot S. Salem M. Vongsouthi V. Durand L. Moreau F. Dohi H. Vincent S. Escaich S. Ducruix A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Alg13/14 complex shares much of this conserved architecture but lacks the linker peptide to connect the subunits (Fig. 1, A and B). Our computational modeling studies of the Alg13/14 complex suggested a potential conformational role of the terminal regions of both Alg13 and Alg14 in mediating their association. This structural information implicated the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 on the formation of Alg13/14 complex because it is the only structure capable of tying the Alg13 and Alg14 subunits together (Fig. 1A). Our mutational analyses of Alg13 and Alg14 proteins deleted in these domains demonstrated that these termini are essential for the viability of the cells (Figs. 2, 3, and 7), and for the physical interaction between Alg13 and Alg14 (Figs. 2 and 3). In particular, mutations that affect the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 completely blocked the interaction between Alg13 and Alg14 subunits (Fig. 2). Furthermore, replacement of just the last three amino acids of Alg14 revealed their involvement in formation of the Alg13/14 complex (Fig. 6). Using the molecular surface view of Alg13/14 complex (Fig. 4) to guide our mutational analyses, our results of the molecular requirements for the interaction between Alg13 and Alg14 can be explained as follow: (i) The C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 interacts with Alg14 at a hydrophobic binding pocket. It is reasonable to think that Alg13 and Alg14 subunits assemble through hydrophobic interaction because the role of hydrophobic residues in protein-protein recognition and the formation of multimeric protein assembly has long been recognized (22Guharoy M. Chakrabarti P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15447-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses that exchange the hydrophobic residues inside the hydrophobic pocket of Alg14 or on the surface of the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 will give clear answer on explanation of this interaction. (ii) The hydrophobic character of the last three residues (ILV) of Alg14 is important for the complex formation. From the position in the predicted model (Fig. 4, A and B, indicated by red arrow) and their mutant phenotypes (Fig. 6), we propose that these three residues of Alg14 work as a key that locks the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 into the Alg14 hydrophobic pocket to stabilize the connection. These hydrophobic interactions could provide the driving force to lock Alg13 in, while the conserved G residue found at the fourth last position of all Alg14 C-terminal domains (Fig. 5, marked by star) could conceivably provide the flexibility for the movement of the last three residues. Function of the Terminal Regions on Stability of Cytosolic, Free Alg13—Our mutational analysis reveals that the terminal regions of Alg13 protein also play important roles in its free cytosolic form. We found that deletion of the N-terminal β-strand (Alg13-NΔ10) destabilizes the Alg13 protein (Fig. 7C). Because of the undetectably low levels of Alg13-NΔ10p, it is technically not possible to test by co-immunoprecipitation if the N-terminal β-strand of Alg13 is directly involved in interaction with Alg14. But, the NMR structure of Alg13 indicates that this β-strand is intimately involved in the central of β-sheet of Alg13 (15Wang X. Weldeghiorghis T. Zhang G. Imperiali B. Prestegard J.H. Structure. 2008; 16: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that the Alg13-NΔ10p is degraded in the cytosol before it be folded correctly for interacting with Alg14. We also found that deletion of the C-terminal α-helix inversely stabilized Alg13 protein (Fig. 2C). It has been clearly demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of Alg13 (including 100 amino acids) can serves as an autonomous degradation signal required for degradation of cytosolic Alg13 (10Averbeck N. Gao X.D. Nishimura S. Dean N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current studies are consistent with this previous finding and suggest that this α-helix (11 amino acids) at Alg13 C terminus plays a central role in degradation of cytosolic, free Alg13 protein. While speculative, one idea is that the C-terminal α-helix of Alg13 functions differently depending on the status of Alg13 protein. In Alg13/14 complex, it is embedded in the hydrophobic pocket of Alg14 and functions as connecter for the complex formation. In the unassembled, cytosolic Alg13 protein, this α-helix may signal degradation by the proteasome. A more detailed investigation on the role of the C-terminal α-helix during degradation of cytosolic Alg13 will be required to confirm this idea. Our structural analysis on formation of Alg13/14 complex contributes useful information to the development of antibacterial drugs. The bacterial cell wall is an essential organelle. As a consequence of this essentiality, MurG has emerged as an attractive target for development of new antibiotics that target cell wall biosynthesis (24Zawadzke L.E. Wu P. Cook L. Fan L. Casperson M. Kishnani M. Calambur D. Hofstead S.J. Padmanabha R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Ha S. Gross B. Walker S. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It will be extremely important to unravel the mechanism of Alg13/14 complex formation since the similarity between MurG and the Alg13/14 complex, which catalyzes an essential step of N-linked glycosylation, requires the rational design of drugs that specifically inhibit the bacterial enzyme without affecting the human one."
https://openalex.org/W1995456591,"Langerhans cells (LC) represent a well characterized subset of dendritic cells located in the epidermis of skin and mucosae. In vivo, they originate from resident and blood-borne precursors in the presence of keratinocyte-derived TGFbeta. In vitro, LC can be generated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and TGFbeta. However, the signals that induce LC during an inflammatory reaction are not fully investigated. Here we report that Activin A, a TGFbeta family member induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and involved in skin morphogenesis and wound healing, induces the differentiation of human monocytes into LC in the absence of TGFbeta. Activin A-induced LC are Langerin+, Birbeck granules+, E-cadherin+, CLA+ and CCR6+ and possess typical APC functions. In human skin explants, intradermal injection of Activin A increased the number of CD1a+ and Langerin+ cells in both the epidermis and dermis by promoting the differentiation of resident precursor cells. High levels of Activin A were present in the upper epidermal layers and in the dermis of Lichen Planus biopsies in association with a marked infiltration of CD1a+ and Langerin+ cells. This study reports that Activin A induces the differentiation of circulating CD14+ cells into LC. Since Activin A is abundantly produced during inflammatory conditions which are also characterized by increased numbers of LC, we propose that this cytokine represents a new pathway, alternative to TGFbeta, responsible for LC differentiation during inflammatory/autoimmune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2062986387,"We determined the effect of the N-terminal histone tails on nucleosome traversal by yeast and human RNA polymerase II (pol II). Removal of H2A/H2B tails, H3/H4 tails, or all tails increased complete traversal of the nucleosome by human pol II, although the increase varied considerably depending on the template and on which tails were removed. Human pol II achieved >80% traversal of one nucleosomal template lacking the H2A/H2B tails, but even in those reactions, the transcript elongation rate was lower than the rate on pure DNA templates. For yeast pol II, transcription proceeded much farther into the nucleosome in the absence of tails, but complete read-through was not substantially increased by tail removal. Transcription factor IIS provided roughly the same level of read-through stimulation for transcript elongation in the presence or absence of tails. FACT also stimulated elongation on nucleosomal templates, and this effect was similar regardless of the presence of tails. For both polymerases, removal of the H2A/H2B tails reduced pausing throughout the nucleosome, suggesting that histone tails affect a common step at most points during nucleosome traversal. We conclude that histone tails provide a significant part of the nucleosomal barrier to pol II transcript elongation.

We conclude that histone tails provide a significant part of the nucleosomal barrier to pol II transcript elongation. It has long been appreciated that nucleosomes form a strong blockade to transcript elongation by pol II in vitro (1Izban M.G. Luse D.S.

The core structure of the nucleosome does not depend on the tails (3Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

However, the tails are strongly positively charged, and they could associate nonspecifically with the DNA, thereby impeding polymerase access to the template (8Hill C.S. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zheng C.Y. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24217-24224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The tails could influence traversal in other ways, e.g. by affecting the ability of the H2A/H2B dimer to exchange, which is likely to be involved in at least some traversal events (2Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails could also affect more complex unfolding transitions in the nucleosome, which would facilitate traversal (11Sivolob A. De Lucia F. Alilat M. Prunell A. J. Mol.

Higher order chromatin structure, which could affect the efficiency of transcription through chromatin, can be influenced by the N-terminal tails (13Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Covalent modifications of the tails, especially of the H3 tail of promoter-proximal nucleosomes, are well known to be correlated with transcriptional activity in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 17Fischle W.

This suggests that the ability of pol II to cross the first nucleosome it encounters after transcript initiation is a major and general control point for gene expression. In light of all of these findings, we decided to explore directly the effect of the histone tails on the ability of pol II to traverse single nucleosomes. As an initial test of the effect of the tails, we assembled nucleosomes that lack either subsets of the tails or all of the tails. We found that the nucleosomal barrier to transcript elongation by pol II is lowered but not eliminated by tail removal. Protein Purification—Yeast pol II with a hexahistidine-tagged RPB3 subunit was purified as described (2Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Full-length recombinant hexahistidine-tagged yeast transcription factor (TF) IIS was expressed and purified as described (21Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M.

For transcription studies with yeast pol II, native core histones were purified from chicken erythrocytes (22Studitsky V.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsinized chicken core histones were obtained using a very similar protocol. In brief, H1-stripped chromatin was treated with trypsin as described (23Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and trypsinized H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 tetramers were purified on a hydroxylapatite column (22Studitsky V.M.

Human pol II and TFIIH were purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, and recombinant human TATA box-binding protein, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIS were prepared as described (24Bondarenko V.A.

Plasmids expressing native and N-terminally deleted (tailless) Xenopus histones were kindly provided by Dr. Karolin Luger. Tailless histones contained only the trypsin-resistant globular domains, consisting of amino acids 13–118 for H2A, amino acids 24–122 for H2B, amino acids 27–135 for H3, and amino acids 20–102 for H4 (25Luger K.

Expression of recombinant histones and preparation of histone dimers, tetramers, and octamers were performed as described (26Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y.H. Chakravarthy S.

DNA Templates, Nucleosome Assembly, and Transcription Complex Assembly—The 603 nucleosome positioning sequence was originally identified by Lowary and Widom (28Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar); the exact sequence of the 603 segment used in these studies is given in supplemental Fig. S1. Nucleosome assembly and transcription by yeast pol II were conducted as described (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In short, mononucleosomes were reconstituted on DNA fragments bearing the 603 or 603R elements by decreasing salt dialysis using different combinations of intact or trypsinized chicken core histones. (Note that 603 and 603R are identical sequences; they were constructed to ligate to the transcription complex in opposite orientations.) Yeast pol II elongation complexes were assembled on a 50-bp DNA fragment from 9-nucleotide RNA and separate template and non-template strands. These complexes were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, washed, eluted from the beads, and ligated to nucleosomal templates or the equivalent non-nucleosomal DNA. pol II was advanced to position +45 using [α-32P]NTPs to label the RNA. Transcription was resumed from position +45 by addition of a large excess of unlabeled NTPs in the presence of KCl at the concentrations indicated in the figures and figure legends. FACT (∼0.15 μm) or yeast TFIIS (0.1 μm) was added to the +45 complexes as indicated in the figures; factor additions were made along with the chase NTPs. Transcript elongation reactions with yeast pol II were normally run for 10 min except as indicated for the reactions in Fig. 5. For studies with human pol II, 250-bp template fragments containing the adenovirus major late promoter upstream and either the 603 or 603R assembly element downstream were used (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These constructs had been cloned into pUC18, and the working templates were amplified by PCR with the upstream primer biotinylated. The 603 and 603R templates were assembled into nucleosomes by salt dialysis, bound to streptavidin beads, and then assembled into pol II preinitiation complexes with purified pol II and TFIIH and recombinant TATA box-binding protein, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF as described (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Human preinitiation complexes were advanced to position +20 using labeled NTPs, washed, and then chased for 5 min with excess NTPs as described (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A.

Some reactions were supplemented with human TFIIS at 24 μg/ml during the chase as indicated in the figures. For the kinetic experiments in Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S3, the published protocol was slightly modified. Preinitiation complexes were incubated with 0.25 mm CpA, 100 μm UTP, 0.7 μm [α-32P]CTP, and 50 μm dATP at 30 °C for only 1 min (with no addition of unlabeled CTP) and washed only once. This procedure yields complexes with 21-nucleotide RNAs as well as complexes with shorter transcripts. These complexes were chased for the times indicated in Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S3. For both yeast and human transcription reactions, labeled transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing gels and quantified using a Storm Imager and ImageQuant software. We measured the extent to which either yeast or human pol II can cross one downstream nucleosome using an approach based on our earlier study (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A.

Nucleosomes were reconstituted over sequence elements that direct nucleosome assembly to single, precise locations. Yeast pol II transcript elongation complexes were assembled using DNA/RNA hybrid scaffolds and then ligated to short DNA fragments bearing preassembled nucleosomes. Human pol II preinitiation complexes were obtained by incubating the general pol II transcript initiation factors and templates bearing a promoter and a single downstream nucleosome. In both cases, transcription was initiated with limiting, labeled NTPs, and pol II was stalled before reaching the nucleosome. The complexes were then chased with excess unlabeled NTPs.

We showed previously that the same nucleosome can present a very different barrier height depending on the transcriptional orientation (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A.

Based on our earlier observations (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), one transcriptional orientation (designated 603) was expected to be much more permissive for transcript elongation than the other (designated 603R). We began our study with the simple question: will the complete absence of some or all of the N-terminal tails have a significant effect on nucleosome traversal by pol II? We assembled nucleosomes with four different combinations of histones: all histones full-length (native H2A and H2B/native H3 and H4, abbreviated “n/n”), no H2A/H2B tails (globular H2A and H2B/native H3 and H4, abbreviated “g/n”), no H3/H4 tails (native H2A and H2B/globular H3 and H4, abbreviated “n/g”), and no tails on any of the histones (globular H2A and H2B/globular H3 and H4, abbreviated “g/g”). For experiments with human pol II, recombinant Xenopus histones were used. Histones for yeast pol II experiments were purified from H1-stripped chicken erythrocyte chromatin after treatment with trypsin, followed by purification of H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 tetramers. Preliminary tests showed that histones from either source were interchangeable. Human pol II gave identical results when transcribing nucleosomal templates assembled with recombinant tailless Xenopus histones or with trypsin-truncated chicken histones. Similarly, transcription results with yeast pol II were the same regardless of the source of tailless histones (data not shown). Transcription reactions were performed at low (40 mm), roughly physiological (150 mm), or high (300 mm) KCl concentrations; maximal traversal was obtained by removing the nucleosomes with 1% Sarkosyl (human pol II) or 1 m KCl (yeast pol II). In all cases, we normalized traversal in any given condition to traversal after nucleosome removal. As we observed in our initial study (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the majority of human pol II complexes failed to completely traverse the 603 nucleosome in 5-min reactions at low or moderate salt. Most of the paused complexes resided in the proximal half of the nucleosome (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). This pausing was only partially relieved by raising the KCl concentration to 300 mm (Fig. 1A, lane 3; quantitative results shown in Fig. 1B). Full traversal increased, but remained incomplete, when the pol II transcript elongation factor TFIIS was included in the reactions (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). Removal of some or all of the tails led to increased traversal of the 603 nucleosome at all salt concentrations (Fig. 1, A, lanes 8–10; and B). Most of the effect of tail removal on traversal of the 603 nucleosome by human pol II, particularly at higher ionic strengths, was obtained by removing only the H2A/H2B tails (Fig. 1B). Removal of either the H2A/H2B or H3/H4 tails did not cause specific changes in the pausing pattern but apparently slightly reduced the tendency of pol II to pause at most positions along nucleosomal DNA, leading to an increase in complete traversal. The effect of tail removal was similar to the effect of increasing the concentration of monovalent ions. TFIIS stimulated traversal of 603 templates assembled with partially or completely tailless histones at 40 mm KCl. TFIIS stimulation was not synergistic with tail removal, i.e. the -fold increase provided by TFIIS was not significantly different for nucleosomes with all tails present and for those that lacked some or all tails. The 603R nucleosomal template provided a much stronger and more discrete barrier to transcription by human pol II in comparison with the 603 template, as expected from our earlier work (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Most polymerases paused at a group of sites 45–55 bp within the 603R nucleosome, at the entry point into the H3/H4 tetramer, whereas the small fraction that successfully crossed this barrier proceeded to the end of the nucleosome (Fig. 1A, lanes 15–17 and 22–24). Tail removal generally increased traversal on 603R by human pol II (Fig. 1B). At low salt, pol II could advance somewhat farther into the major 603R transcriptional barrier in the absence of tails (Fig. 1A, compare the +45–55 region in lanes 15 and 22). As with the 603 template, this resembles the effect of increasing the ionic strength of the reaction. We performed comparable experiments using yeast pol II and partially or completely tailless nucleosomes. As expected (24Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), yeast pol II traversed each nucleosome less efficiently than the human enzyme. Results for the 603 (permissive) template are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). Apart from a small stimulation of the very low traversal level at 40 mm salt, tail removal did not significantly increase complete traversal of the 603 nucleosome. It is important to note, however, that pausing consistently occurred farther into 603 nucleosomes lacking some or all tails; this effect was most pronounced at 40 mm KCl (Fig. 2A, compare, for example, lanes 1 and 7). The effect of tail removal on progression of yeast pol II through the nucleosome was roughly additive and was not dominated by the H2A/H2B tails. The primary effect of tail removal was relief of pausing at the major site 15 bases within the nucleosome. As a secondary effect of tail removal, pausing shifted to more downstream locations, but novel pause sites were not generally observed. The effect of tail removal roughly mirrored the effect of adding KCl to the reactions and resulted in qualitatively similar changes in the pausing pattern upon removal of different combinations of tails; compare, for example, the 40 and 150 mm KCl lanes for the control (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) and fully tailless (lanes 7 and 8) nucleosomes. TFIIS increased traversal of partially or completely tailless 603 nucleosomes, particularly at low salt, but as with the human polymerase, the -fold increase was not significantly different in the presence or absence of histone tails. The nucleosomal 603R template provided a very strong barrier for yeast pol II at low or moderate salt (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). Most pausing on 603R occurred 45–55 bases into the nucleosome (supplemental Fig. S2), as seen with human pol II. Traversal of the 603R nucleosome by yeast pol II was very slightly increased by removing the H2A/H2B tails, whereas removal of the H3/H4 tails had no apparent effect on traversal (Fig. 2B). However, the nucleosomal pauses upstream of the +45 nucleosomal region were relieved to different degrees by removal of different combinations of tails, as seen with the 603 template. The reduction in upstream pausing upon tail removal contributed to increased pausing at position +45. (In supplemental Fig. S2, compare the relative level of +15 to +45 pausing on the n/n template with the same ratio on the three partially or completely tailless templates.) Tail removal did not reveal novel pause sites downstream of the major +45 stop on the 603R template. The effect of the loss of H2A/H2B tails for yeast pol II was made more apparent in the context of traversal stimulation by TFIIS, particularly at 150 mm KCl (Fig. 2B). The weak effect of tail removal on traversal of nonpermissive 603R nucleosomes by yeast pol II is at least partially explained by the exceptional tendency of the yeast polymerase to arrest at position +45 even on histone-free DNA templates (supplemental Fig. S2, 1 m KCl lanes). Assembly of the 603R DNA sequence into a nucleosome greatly exaggerates the arrest at position +45. The strong barrier to elongation at this location is apparently based on the unusually rapid rate of backtracking upon arrest at this site. Kireeva et al. (30Kireeva M.L. Hancock B. Cremona G.H. Walter W. Studitsky V.M. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) found that backtracking by yeast pol II after pausing at most locations within a nucleosome has a t½ of almost 1 h. In contrast, we have observed that backtracking at position +45 on 603R nucleosome is completed in <1 min (data not shown). Given this very high likelihood of backtracking, many rounds of transcript cleavage and resynthesis mediated by TFIIS would still be insufficient to allow a majority of polymerases to cross the +45 site, as we observed (supplemental Fig. S2). Strong DNA-specific arrest of human pol II was not detected at the +45 region of the 603R template (Fig. 1A, lanes 18 and 25). This suggests a slower rate of backtracking by human pol II at the +45 site in the 603R nucleosome, but it is important to note that we have not measured backtracking rates for the human enzyme. Complete traversal of the nucleosome by pol II is generally accompanied by the loss of one of the H2A/H2B dimers (2Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This suggests that the increase in traversal seen with N-terminal tail removal could be based, at least in part, on an increased tendency of H2A/H2B dimers to be lost when tails are absent. The FACT complex facilitates nucleosome traversal at normal salt concentrations and is thought to act by functioning as a chaperone for the H2A/H2B dimer (31Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility that tail removal might increase the effectiveness of FACT in mediating nucleosome traversal by yeast pol II. As shown in Fig. 3 (quantitative results in Fig. 2B), FACT strongly stimulated traversal of both the 603 and 603R nucleosomes by yeast pol II, but this effect did not depend on the histone tails. In most cases, there was no further increase in FACT-mediated traversal as a result of tail removal; the apparent increase at 40 mm KCl on the 603 template resulted from the increase in traversal of that nucleosome due to tail removal alone, in the absence of FACT. These results do not support the idea that the stimulation of traversal by tail removal results from an increased tendency of the tailless nucleosomes to lose an H2A/H2B dimer. As noted above, under some conditions, human pol II can achieve near-complete nucleosome traversal in our standard 5-min transcription reaction, particularly at 150 mm KCl in the absence of histone tails (Fig. 1B). This suggested that the rates of transcript elongation on DNA and the tailless templates could be comparable. To test this idea, transcript elongation rates were analyzed at 150 mm salt for the human enzyme on 603 DNA and on native and tailless nucleosomal 603 templates. When the 603 nucleosome was removed by Sarkosyl, some human pol II complexes generated 200-nucleotide run-off RNA in 1 min. Essentially all polymerases had run-off in 90 s (Fig. 4A). Elongation was much slower on the nucleosomal template with all tails present (Fig. 4, A and B). Significantly, in the complete absence of tails, the rate of accumulation of run-off was increased by ∼2-fold in comparison with the fully tailed templates; however, the rate on the tailless templates was still considerably slower than that on free DNA (Fig. 4B). Comparison of lanes 4–7 and 18–21 in Fig. 4A suggests that the more rapid rate of run-off accumulation was accompanied by a downstream shift in the population of paused polymerases, such that on the tailless templates, the longer paused products predominated. This is shown quantitatively through a comparison of scans of lanes 7 and 21 (Fig. 4C). Addition of TFIIS also caused an increase in the rate of full traversal and a downstream shift in the population of paused complexes (supplemental Fig. S3). The results in Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S3 suggest that tail removal and TFIIS addition increase nucleosome traversal by reducing the tendency of pol II to pause at multiple, nucleosome-induced sites. TFIIS helps to maintain pol II in a catalytically active state (32Zhang C.F. Yan H.G. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50101-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Kettenberger H. Armache K.-J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), whereas tail removal presumably reduces the lifetime of nucleosome-induced pauses. However, even under conditions that effectively minimized pausing, the rate of transcript elongation by human pol II on a nucleosomal template remained 2–3-fold lower than the rate that could be achieved on the same DNA sequence in the absence of a nucleosome (Fig. 4B). We obtained further insight into the mechanistic basis of FACT stimulation of nucleosome traversal by examining the kinetics of transcript elongation through the 603 nucleosome by yeast pol II as a function of FACT and the nucleosome tails (Fig. 5). FACT increased the rate of traversal of both tail-containing and tailless nucleosomes. This increase was ∼1.5-fold for the n/n template and 2-fold for the g/g template as judged by the 2-min time points in Fig. 5. FACT strongly reduced pausing throughout the body of the nucleosome, in contrast to tail removal, which primarily shifted pausing to downstream locations. The sum of the two effects can be seen by comparing the n/n and g/g lanes in the presence of FACT: on both tailed and tailless templates, there was relatively little pausing observed over most of the central segment of the nucleosome; but in the absence of tails, more polymerases were paused in the distal segment of the nucleosome, and fewer were paused near the entry into the nucleosome (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that FACT alters the entire nucleosomal barrier to transcript elongation, as opposed to simply reducing pausing at internal locations. This is consistent with the proposal that FACT functions to mediate removal of one of the H2A/H2B dimers as transcription proceeds (31Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). FACT allowed high levels of traversal of the 603 nucleosome in reactions of 2 min or longer, particularly in the absence of tails (Fig. 5B; see also Fig. 2B). However, as we observed with TFIIS and human pol II, the rate of transcription on the nucleosomal template for yeast pol II remained much lower than the rate on free DNA. Removal of the N-terminal histone tails resulted in facilitated transcription through a nucleosome by both yeast and human pol II, an effect most noticeable at lower ionic strength (40 mm KCl). For human pol II, tail removal reduced nucleosome-specific pausing over the entire length of the 603 nucleosome, leading to both increased traversal and the accumulation of complexes paused at more distal locations (see Fig. 4C). Removal of the H2A/H2B tails had the strongest impact for the human polymerase. In the case of yeast pol II, tail removal did not lead to a significant increase in full traversal of either nucleosomal template. However, removal of the H2A/H2B or H3/H4 tails significantly reduced the strong barrier that the yeast polymerase encounters ∼15 bases within the 603 nucleosome. The effects of removing either pair of tails on yeast pol II pausing at position +15 on the 603 template were roughly additive. Increased traversal of downstream pause sites by the yeast enzyme was similarly facilitated by removal of some or all of the histone tails. How could deletion of only one pair of tails affect pausing throughout the nucleosome? Reduction in pausing due to tail removal was most pronounced at lower ionic strength, mimicking the results seen when additional KCl was added to the reactions. This suggests that electrostatic tail-DNA interactions contribute to the inhibiting effect of tails on transcript elongation. Given the lengths of the H3 and H2B N-terminal tails in particular, removal of either the H2A/H2B or H3/H4 tails could conceivably affect progress by the polymerase through the entire nucleosome. In addition to the global effect, the tails had rather specific effects that differed for the two polymerases. The very strong tendency of yeast pol II to pause ∼15 bases into the nucleosome was responsive to removal of either pair of tails. In this context, it is useful to note two recent studies on the effect of tail removal on nucleosome structure and stability. Experiments with single nucleosomes demonstrated that removal of either set of tails facilitated the unwrapping of ∼30 bp of DNA from the ends of the nucleosome (34Brower-Toland B. Wacker D.A. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Wang M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This effect was greater for H3/H4 tail removal, perhaps because the H3 tails emerge from the nucleosome near the entry and exit points for the wrapped DNA (3Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6921) Google Scholar). In a different study, Bertin et al. (35Bertin A. Durand D. Renouard M. Livolant F. Mangenot S. Eur. Biophys. J. 2007; 36: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) concluded that unwrapping DNA from the region bound by the H2A/H2B dimers is facilitated by removal of the H2A/H2B tails. These results support the idea that, in addition to any simple “coating” of the DNA, both sets of tails can control the stability of the H2A/H2B dimer-DNA interaction. Thus, the absence of either pair of tails would be expected to reduce pausing early in nucleosome traversal, e.g. at position +15. Reducing the major +15 pause by tail removal did not cause a significant increase in complete nucleosome traversal by yeast pol II, presumably because strong pausing downstream (particularly at the +45 region) continued to capture nearly all of the yeast polymerases before traversal was complete. In contrast, TFIIS addition not only increased the ability of yeast pol II to pass the +15 barrier but also facilitated complete traversal of the 603 nucleosome. FACT also stimulated full traversal at low salt, but it did so by a different mechanism. Addition of FACT almost eliminated pausing by yeast pol II at most locations over the central segment of the 603 nucleosome (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the observations of Rhoades et al. (36Rhoades A.R. Ruone S. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3907-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who showed that FACT-nucleosome interaction increases the accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA primarily at internal locations. It is also consistent with previous observations on the effect of FACT on transcription in vitro (31Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Human pol II also recognizes the +15 pause, particularly on the 603 template, but the major pause site for the human enzyme occurs at 45–55 bases into the nucleosome on both 603 and 603R. Although this location corresponds to the point at which the polymerase enters the segment of the nucleosome organized by the H3/H4 tetramer, under most conditions, the +45 pause was more sensitive to the loss of H2A/H2B tails than to the loss of the H3/H4 tails. Nucleosome-unwinding experiments (34Brower-Toland B. Wacker D.A. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Wang M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have identified two distinct transitions as DNA is removed from the surface of the histone octamer: an initial unwrapping of the DNA segments primarily associated with the H2A/H2B dimers and a second transition in which the DNA 45–55 bp into the nucleosome disassociates from the underlying histones. Like the corresponding reduction in the transcriptional barrier, this latter transition was most strongly influenced by removal of the H2A/H2B dimer tails (34Brower-Toland B. Wacker D.A. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Wang M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Destabilization of the H3/H4-DNA interactions resulting from removal of the H2A/H2B tails could have resulted in facilitated passage through the +45 barrier by human pol II. The effects of tail removal on nucleosome traversal can be rationalized for both yeast and human pol II based on changes in nucleosome stability upon tail removal. However, the tails are clearly not the entire basis of the nucleosomal transcription barrier. Even in the complete absence of tails, transcript elongation rates on nucleosomal templates are much lower than those seen on free DNA. Widom and co-workers (37Li G. Levitus M. Bustamante C. Widom J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) have recently determined that DNA spontaneously releases from the nucleosome surface and then rapidly rebinds; rewrapping occurs in only 10–50 ms. During nucleosome traversal, pol II may spend much of its time waiting for the downstream template to be made available by this spontaneous “breathing” of DNA away from the histone octamer. If the rate at which transcription resumes after pausing is much slower than the rate at which the window of template availability closes, then overall transcript elongation rates on nucleosomal templates must be considerably slower than elongation rates on free DNA. It is worth noting that, under the conditions used in this study, elongation rates for either yeast or human pol II did not exceed 200–300 nucleotides/min, strongly suggesting that inefficiency in exploiting the temporary availability of template DNA is an important aspect of the overall slow transcript elongation rate on nucleosomal templates. This also explains why TFIIS addition and tail removal can be additive for traversal by human pol II: tail removal could slow the reassociation of DNA with the nucleosome surface, and TFIIS can increase the likelihood of bond formation; but both may still leave the effective rate of bond formation well below the average rate of reassociation of DNA with the nucleosome surface.

The formation of the GK-GKRP complex is favored by fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inhibited by fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) (10Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J.

An increase of the intracellular F1P concentration leading to the release of GK from its inhibitory complex with GKRP is most likely the reason for the stimulation of hepatic glucose metabolism by catalytic amounts of fructose or sorbitol (6Chu C.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the binding interface for GKRP lies close to the binding site of allosteric GKAs of the amino-heteroaryl-amide type (14Sagen J.V. Odili S.

Furthermore, there are conflicting reports concerning whether glucose has a direct effect on the GK-GKRP complex (15Brocklehurst K.J. Payne V.A. Davies R.A. Carroll D. Vertigan H.L. Wightman H.J.

Current knowledge of the molecular details of the GK-GKRP interaction and its regulation is limited and originates mainly from indirect or qualitative methods such as enzymatic assays or co-immunoprecipitation (16Futamura M. Hosaka H. Kadotani A. Shimazaki H. Sasaki K. Ohyama S. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. J. Biol.

However, despite the importance of biophysical methods for the validation and characterization of protein-protein interactions (19Mackay J.P. Sunde M. Lowry J.A. Crossley M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 530-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), such studies are lacking for GK and GKRP. In the present study we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments for a detailed quantitative characterization of the GK-GKRP interaction and its modulation by small molecules. Chemical Synthesis—The prototypical small-molecule glucokinase activators of the amino-heteroaryl-amide type, GKA1 (15Brocklehurst K.J. Payne V.A. Davies R.A. Carroll D. Vertigan H.L. Wightman H.J. Aiston S. Waddell I.D. Leighton B. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and RO-28–1675 (termed GKA2 in the present study) (3Grimsby J. Sarabu R. Corbett W.L. Haynes N.E. Bizzarro F.T. Coffey J.W. Guertin K.R. Hilliard D.W. Kester R.F. Mahaney P.E. Marcus L. Qi L. Spence C.L. Tengi J. Magnuson M.A. Chu C.A. Dvorozniak M.T. Matschinsky F.M. Grippo J.F. Science. 2003; 301: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) were synthesized in-house. Expression and Purification of Glucokinase—The cDNA of human liver GK was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which adds an N-terminal hexahistidyl tag to the open reading frame. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15(pRep4) (Qiagen). After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at D600 = 0.7, cells were grown for 18 h at 18 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended and lysed by lysozyme treatment and ultrasonication. GK was enriched from the filtered lysate using nickel ion affinity chromatography (0–0.5 m imidazole gradient). After desalting, the sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column and eluted with a 0.05–1 m NaCl gradient. GK was concentrated by ultrafiltration and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). After elution in 25 mm Bis-Tris propane, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm glucose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7, samples were concentrated, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Glucokinase Regulatory Protein—The cDNA of rat GKRP (kindly provided by Emile Van Schaftingen, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels) was ligated into pET21a (Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany); this appends a C-terminal hexahistidyl tag to GKRP. The GKRP mutant S183A/V187A was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and custom primers. Expression of GKRP was performed in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). After induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at D600 = 0.7, cells were grown at 18 °C for 60 h. Harvested cells were resuspended and lysed by lysozyme treatment and ultrasonication. The cleared lysate was applied to a immobilized nickel ion affinity column and eluted with a 20–500 mm imidazole gradient. After dialysis in 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, the sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column and eluted with a 0.02–1 m NaCl gradient. 20% glycerol was added to the concentrated samples, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Enzymatic Assay of Glucokinase Regulatory Protein—The effect of GKRP on GK activity was determined spectrophotometrically using the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled assay as described elsewhere (20Brocklehurst K.J. Davies R.A. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One unit of GKRP corresponds to the amount of protein that causes 50% inhibition of GK activity assayed in the presence of 5 mm glucose and 200 μm F6P (10Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were carried out on a VP-ITC ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). Protein samples were dialysed twice for several hours at 4 °C against the measuring buffer and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble matter. Unless otherwise stated, the standard buffer for the GK-GKRP titrations was 50 mm Hepes, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm F6P, pH 7.1. Protein concentration was determined from UV absorbance measurements using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 32,890 m–1 (GK) and 47,900 m–1 (GKRP). In a typical experiment, the stirred measuring cell contained 10 μm GKRP and the syringe contained 80 μm GK as titrant. In experiments, where the influence of effectors on the GK-GKRP interaction was studied, these compounds were added at equal concentrations to both cell and syringe solutions. ITC titrations and data analyses were performed as described (21Anderka O. Loenze P. Klabunde T. Dreyer M.K. Defossa E. Wendt K.U. Schmoll D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4683-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the titrations were performed at 25 °C. Proton transfer linked to GK-GKRP binding was determined by measuring the pH dependence of binding affinity (22Doyle M.L. Louie G. Dal Monte P.R. Sokoloski T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proton linkage was determined by measuring ΔH of binding in buffers with different enthalpies of ionization ΔHion (23Murphy K.P. Xie D. Garcia K.C. Amzel L.M. Freire E. Proteins. 1993; 15: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar): Values for ΔHion were obtained from the literature (24Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Thomson J.A. Ladbury J.E. Ladbury J.E. Doyle M.L. Biocalorimetry 2. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, England2004: 37-58Google Scholar). To determine ΔCp (= dΔH/dT) for the GK-GKRP interaction, ITC titrations were performed over a range of temperatures. To predict the change in accessible surface area (ΔASA) upon binding from the binding heat capacity (ΔCp) and enthalpy (ΔH) changes, the following empirical relationships were applied: ΔCp = 0.45ΔASAnp – 0.26ΔASAp; ΔH60 = –8.44ΔASAnp + 31.4ΔASAp, where ΔH60 is the extrapolated binding enthalpy change at 60 °C in kcal/mol (26Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1994; 19: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In these calculations, ΔH was corrected for the contribution of buffer ionization enthalpy. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—Experiments were performed on a Biacore S51 instrument (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). For the immobilization of rat GKRP to CM5 sensor chips, standard amine coupling was used. GKRP was diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 including 20 mm KCl and 200 μm F6P to a final concentration of 12 μg/ml. The immobilization level was aimed at 2500 RU. Series of various concentrations of GK that was previously dialysed in the running buffer were injected over the flow cell (flow rate 30 μl/min, contact time 120 s, dissociation time 180s). For steady-state equilibrium analysis, the sensorgrams were analyzed using Biacore S51 evaluation software version 1.2. As the global fitting routine of the evaluation software did not produce satisfactory results, the association and dissociation time courses were separately fitted to a single-exponential model, as described in Ref. 28Gakamsky D.M. Luescher I.F. Pecht I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9063-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The influence of glucose and GKAs on the dissociation of the preformed GK-GKRP complex was tested using the regeneration scout tool provided by Biacore S51 control software. Here, after complex formation under running buffer conditions, the “regeneration buffer” was used for the dissociation phase, which contained the desired additives. Statistical Analysis—Unpaired Student's t-tests (two-tailed p value, confidence interval 95%) were performed using Prism 4. Characterization of Recombinant GK and GKRP—Because recombinant human GKRP can be obtained only at very low yields (20Brocklehurst K.J. Davies R.A. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Veiga-da-Cunha M. Delplanque J. Gillain A. Bonthron D.T. Boutin P. Van Schaftingen E. Froguel P. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we studied the interaction between GK and GKRP derived from different species; human and rat, respectively. Human and rat liver GK share 97% sequence identity and are inhibited to the same extent by rat GKRP (20Brocklehurst K.J. Davies R.A. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Veiga-da-Cunha M. Xu L.Z. Lee Y.H. Marotta D. Pilkis S.J. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The heterologous interaction between rat GKRP and human GK is a well established model system (11Veiga-da-Cunha M.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, human GKRP has a higher affinity for F6P compared with rat GKRP and is a more potent inhibitor of GK in the absence of F6P (20Brocklehurst K.J. Davies R.A. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The preparations of GK and GKRP for the present study were ∼95% pure and homogenous, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (exemplarily shown for GKRP, Fig. 1A) and analytical gel filtration. GK was inhibited by GKRP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). From these data we determined a specific GKRP activity of ∼700 units/mg in the presence of 200 μm F6P, which compares well to previously reported activities (33Mookhtiar K.A. Kalinowski S.S. Brown K.S. Tsay Y.H. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G.W. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consistent with published data (34Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), F6P enhanced the potency of GKRP, while F1P reduced the inhibitory effect (Fig. 1C). Using ITC, we determined a Kd = 17 ± 4 μm for F6P binding to GKRP (Fig. 1D). This directly determined affinity is in good agreement with the reported Ki of 20 μm that was derived from kinetic experiments (18Van Schaftingen E. Vandercammen A. Detheux M. Davies D.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite its clear effect in the enzymatic assay, we could not calorimetrically detect binding of F1P to GKRP under a number of different experimental conditions. Possibly the binding of F1P is exclusively of entropic nature and shows a negligible heat change. Thermodynamics of the GK-GKRP Interaction and the Influence of Physiological Effectors—In the presence of 200 μm F6P, ITC titrations of GK and GKRP showed a binding signal with strongly endothermic peaks (Fig. 2A). A Kd value of 45 nm was obtained as an average result from multiple titrations (Table 1). As expected, in the absence of F6P binding became considerably weaker, with a Kd value of 984 nm (Table 1). In the presence of saturating concentrations of F1P, the affinity of GKRP for GK was decreased, with Kd = 7 μm. To our knowledge, these are the first direct determinations of affinity for the GK-GKRP interaction. Under all measurement conditions the GK-GKRP interaction was exclusively entropy driven (TΔS > 0) with a large enthalpic “penalty” (ΔH > 0) (Fig. 2B and Table 1). This is in remarkable contrast to thermodynamic profiles determined for a number of protein-protein interactions; these very often show similar contributions of both enthalpy and entropy to the binding free energy (35Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The observed large binding entropy suggests a distinctively hydrophobic binding interface (36Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 37Perozzo R. Folkers G. Scapozza L. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct.

Recently, a hydrophobic sequence motif within GKRP identified by phage display was postulated to form a binding site for GK (39Baltrusch S. Lenzen S. Okar D.A. Lange A.J. Tiedge M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43915-43923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed a GKRP variant where the consensus residues within the identified sequence were mutated to alanine (GKRP S183A/V187A) and determined its binding parameters. In the presence of F6P the affinity decreased only slightly (Kd = 99 ± 36 nmversus 45 ± 10 nm of the wild type), with no significant changes of ΔH and TΔS relative to the interaction of wild-type GKRP with GK.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of the GK-GKRP interaction obtained by isothermal titration calorimetryEffectorNaStoichiometry of the complex.KdITCΔHTΔSnmkcal/molkcal/molNone1.0 ± 0.03984 ± 19023.3 ± 1.431.4 ± 1.3100 μm F1P0.9 ± 0.006789 ± 25321.7 ± 2.528.7 ± 2.4200 μm F6P1.0 ± 0.0245 ± 1015.6 ± 0.725.7 ± 0.6200 μm F6P + 100 mm glucose1.0 ± 0.00173 ± 176.0 ± 0.815.2 ± 0.7200 μm F6P + 25 mm glucose + 1 mm AMP-PNP1.0 ± 0.01164 ± 185.9 ± 0.915.2 ± 0.9a Stoichiometry of the complex. Open table in a new tab Next, we studied the effect of glucose on the GK-GKRP interaction. The Kd values determined for the protein-protein interaction increased with rising glucose concentrations (Fig. 2C; Table 1, thermodynamic parameters determined in the presence of 100 mm glucose). The presence of neither glycerol nor sorbitol at 100 mm influenced the GK-GKRP interaction, indicating that the effect of glucose is specific and not caused by the high osmolarity of the buffer (not shown). These data clearly establish that glucose directly weakens the GK-GKRP interaction. Interestingly, the addition of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP at 1 mm enhanced the effect of glucose (Fig. 2C; Table 1, thermodynamic parameters determined in the presence of 25 mm glucose + 1 mm AMP-PNP). AMP-PNP alone did not influence the interaction of the proteins (data not shown). Effects of pH, Buffer, and Temperature on the Thermodynamic Parameters—To assess a potential role of protonable residues for GKRP-GK binding, we performed ITC measurements in the presence of F6P at different pH values. The pH dependence of the binding affinity (Fig. 3A) with a slope (–log Ka versus pH) = 1.1 pointed to a single protonation event that is important for binding. This was confirmed by the buffer dependence of the observed binding enthalpy (Fig. 3B): With the buffer dependence measured at pH 8, the slope (ΔHobservedversus ΔHBuffer ionization) = 0.9 again reflected the net uptake of one proton. On the other hand, at pH 7.1, only a minor buffer dependence of ΔH was apparent (slope = 0.2), meaning that at this pH no coupled protonation took place. These data point to a pK value of the protonated group near neutrality, which makes histidine a potential candidate residue that becomes positively charged in the course of GK-GKRP binding. The change in heat capacity upon binding (ΔCp = dΔH/dT) is sensitive for changes in the binding interface of interacting proteins (40Ladbury J.E. Williams M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the presence of 200 μm F6P, a negative ΔCp value of –354 ± 36 cal mol–1 K–1 was obtained (Fig. 3C). When glucose was added to the titration buffer, ΔCp amounted to –362 ± 33 cal mol–1 K–1. Thus, the presence of glucose had no significant effect on the heat capacity change upon binding. On the other hand, the positive ΔCp = +1389 ± 145 cal mol–1 K–1 determined in the absence of F6P was strikingly different. The ΔCp data therefore indicate that the binding interface is unaffected by glucose but strongly influenced by F6P. The heat capacity change can be tentatively used to estimate the change in accessible surface area (ΔASA) upon binding (see “Experimental Procedures”) (26Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1994; 19: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This approach predicts that in the presence of F6P about 900 Å2 of total surface area becomes buried during GK-GKRP complex formation. Binding of Small Molecule GK Activators and Their Effect on the GK-GKRP Interaction—There is controversy whether the small molecule GKAs of the amino-heteroaryl-amide type also affect the GK-GKRP complex (2Baltrusch S. Tiedge M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: S55-S64Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Grimsby J. Sarabu R. Corbett W.L. Haynes N.E. Bizzarro F.T. Coffey J.W. Guertin K.R. Hilliard D.W. Kester R.F. Mahaney P.E.

To address this question, we first applied ITC to characterize the binding of prototypical GKAs of this class to GK. The binding of GKA1 (15Brocklehurst K.J. Payne V.A. Davies R.A. Carroll D. Vertigan H.L. Wightman H.J. Aiston S. Waddell I.D. Leighton B. Coghlan M.P. Agius L.

Following binding parameters were obtained for GKA1: stoichiometry n = 1.0 ± 0.03, Kd = 0.9 ± 0.1 μm, ΔH = –3.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, TΔS = 4.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol in Hepes buffer at 25 °C. Binding of another activator of this type, termed GKA2 (3Grimsby J. Sarabu R. Corbett W.L. Haynes N.E. Bizzarro F.T. Coffey J.W. Guertin K.R. Hilliard D.W. Kester R.F. Mahaney P.E. Marcus L. Qi L.

When GKA1 was titrated to GK, which was already in a complex with GKRP, we did not observe binding of the compound (Fig. 4A). Next, GKRP was titrated to the GK-GKA1 complex formed in the presence of a saturating concentration of glucose (100 mm). Here, an interaction of GK and its regulatory protein could not be detected with the applied ITC settings (detection limit: Kd ∼10 μm) (Fig. 4B). Titrations at differ"

IQGAP1 is a multidomain protein that participates in numerous cellular functions, including Rac1/Cdc42 and Ca2+/calmodulin signaling and actin polymerization. Here we report that IQGAP1, Ca2+, and calmodulin modulate actin pedestal formation by EPEC. Infection with EPEC promotes both the interaction of IQGAP1 with calmodulin and the localization of IQGAP1 and calmodulin to actin pedestals while reducing the interaction of IQGAP1 with Rac1 and Cdc42. IQGAP1-null fibroblasts display a reduced polymerization of actin in response to EPEC. In addition, antagonism of calmodulin or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduces EPEC-dependent actin polymerization. Furthermore, IQGAP1 specifically interacts with Tir in vitro and in cells. Together these data identify IQGAP1, Ca2+, and calmodulin as a novel signaling complex regulating actin pedestal formation by EPEC.

Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). During infection, EPEC induces the formation of actin pedestals, which support the bacteria on the surface of epithelial cells (1.Goosney D.L. Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After initial adhesion to target epithelial cells mediated by the bundle forming pilus, EPEC uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject into the host cell effector proteins, which manipulate the actin cytoskeleton. Key to this process is the translocated intimin receptor (Tir). After injection into the host cell, Tir is translocated into the cell membrane where it acts as a receptor for intimin, a bacterial adhesin facilitating close adhesion of the pathogen to the target host cell (2.Hayward R.D. Leong J.M. Koronakis V. Campellone K.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding of intimin clusters Tir and induces phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue at position 474 by the tyrosine kinase c-Fyn (3.Phillips N. Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine residue recruits the adaptor protein Nck to Tir, which in turn recruits neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex (3.Phillips N. Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As a result of formation of this complex, actin polymerizes at the site of EPEC adhesion, inducing formation of actin pedestals (2.Hayward R.D. Leong J.M. Koronakis V. Campellone K.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to signaling through Tir, EPEC can also directly activate N-WASP through the bacterial protein, EspF (4.Alto N.M.

Despite this knowledge, few host pathways contributing to this process have been identified, and a detailed understanding of the host proteins that participate in EPEC infection is lacking.

Furthermore, IQGAP1 modulates the cytoskeleton indirectly through its interactions with the Rho GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac1 (15.Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 preferentially binds to active (GTP-bound) Cdc42 (5.Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7.Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Despite its name, IQGAP1 is not a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), instead inhibiting the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42 in vitro, thereby stabilizing Cdc42 in its active, GTP-bound form (5.Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As a consequence, IQGAP1 substantially increases the pool of GTP-bound Cdc42 in cells, stimulating filopodia formation (20.Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Many microbial pathogens, such as Salmonella, Yersinia, and Shigella (21.Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Cell. 2006; 124: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), manipulate the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell during infection. We recently reported that IQGAP1 is required for efficient host cell invasion by Salmonella (22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30265-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Analysis with a series of mutant IQGAP1 constructs revealed that this effect is mediated at least in part via the interaction of IQGAP1 with Rac1, Cdc42, and actin. Combined with its integral participation in cytoskeletal function, these data raise the possibility that IQGAP1 may be an important host component for infection by other microbial pathogens. In this study we examine the role of IQGAP1 in the formation of actin pedestals by EPEC. Reagents—All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The IQGAP1 polyclonal (10.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (13.Roy M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Mol. Cell.

All fluorescent secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Bacterial Strains—The following EPEC strains were kindly provided by Michael Donnenberg (University of Maryland): E2348/69 (wild type), CVD206 (intimin negative), UMD888 (bfpA, espA, and eaeA negative), UMD872 (espA negative), and UMD901 (bfpA negative). All have been previously documented (24.Cleary J. Lai L.C. Shaw R.K. Straatman-Iwanowska A. Donnenberg M.S. Frankel G. Knutton S.

GFP- or dsRed-expressing EPEC strains were created by electroporating eGFP- (Invitrogen) or dsRed-containing plasmids into the respective EPEC strains. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). IQGAP1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been previously described (14.Ren J.G. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid Construction—Tir was cloned using an EPEC aliquot as a template. Using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCTATTGGTAACCTTGGTAAT and 3′-CGGAATTCTCTAGATTAAACGAAACGTACTGGTCCC, Tir DNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into RFP (provided by Roger Tsien, University of California, San Diego), Myc pcDNA3, and pGEX4T vectors using standard techniques. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose essentially as described (10.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The GST tag was cleaved from GST-IQGAP1 using tobacco etch virus protease as described (28.Ren J.G. Li Z. Crimmins D.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34548-34557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To construct pEYFP-calmodulin, the human calmodulin sequence was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GCCTCCGGAATGGCTGACCAACTCACCGAG and 3′-CGCGGATCCTCACTTAGCCGTCATCATTTG. The PCR product was cloned into pEYFP (Clontech) using the BspE1 and BamH1 sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing and Western blotting. Bacterial Culture Quantification—Bacteria were grown for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking, then subcultured at a dilution of 1:10 (1 ml in 10 ml) in fresh Luria-Bertani broth (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until an optical density (at 600 nm) of 0.5 was reached. The culture was serially diluted, plated in triplicate onto MacConkey Agar (Remel Inc.), and incubated at 37 °C overnight for quantification. By quantifying the colony forming units, the number of EPEC present per milliliter of culture was determined, allowing the appropriate multiplicity of infection to be added to cultured cells (29.Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). EPEC Infection—Infection of HeLa cells or MEFs was performed essentially as described (30.Michgehl S. Heusipp G. Greune L. Ruter C. Schmidt M.A. Cell.

HeLa cells or MEFs grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates at ∼5 × 104 cells per well. EPEC were cultured overnight and diluted into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C for 2 h before infection. EPEC were added at a multiplicity of infection of 50 and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Free bacteria were removed by washing cells four times with PBS, and cells were processed for immunocytochemistry or immunoprecipitation as described below. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as previously described (22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected for 2 h with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed 5 times with buffer A, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with the antibodies indicated in the figures and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Densitometry of ECL signals was analyzed using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase Assays—Assays were performed essentially as described (20.Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of protein lysate were resolved by Western blotting or incubated with GST-PAK-CRIB for 3 h at 4 °C. Glutathione beads were used to pull down complexes of PAK-CRIB with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 and washed in buffer A. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for Cdc42 or Rac1 as indicated. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as previously (22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30265-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 20 min at 22 °C and blocked/permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h at 22 °C. Relevant antibodies were diluted 1:100 into 0.2% Triton, 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed with PBS, then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, for 1 h at 22 °C. For analysis of F-actin, 546- or 633-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was included with secondary antibodies. To enhance the signal of GFP-IQGAP1 and YFP-calmodulin, cells were incubated with anti-GFP antibody followed by anti-mouse 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted, and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, 100× oil objective and LSM software. Subsequent image processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop. TNT Product Production—[35S]Methionine-labeled TNT products were produced with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (28.Ren J.G. Li Z. Crimmins D.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34548-34557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of IQGAP1 plasmid was incubated with 40 μl of TNT Quick Master Mix (Promega) and 2 μCi (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 90 min. 10 μl of relevant TNT product was incubated with 40 μl of GST or GST-Tir (>90% pure) for 3 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were used to isolate GST proteins. Products were identified by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro Binding Assays—Equal amounts of purified IQGAP1 (90% pure) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of GST-Tir in 1 ml of buffer A and protease inhibitor mixture. Complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, resolved by SDS/PAGE, and processed by Western blotting. Quantification of Actin Pedestals—MEFs were treated as indicated and infected with EPEC as described above. Three hours later, cells were fixed and stained for actin. Using standard fluorescence microscopy, slides were analyzed, and the number of EPEC that promoted polymerization of actin were quantified and expressed as a percentage of total bacteria adhered to the cells (34.Unsworth K.E. Mazurkiewicz P. Senf F. Zettl M. McNiven M. Way M. Holden D.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Polymerized actin was detected using fluorescent phalloidin. Any accumulation of phalloidin staining at the site of bacterial adhesion was considered to indicate the presence of polymerized actin. Data are from at least three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. One-way analysis of variance tests were used. IQGAP1 Localizes to EPEC-induced Actin Pedestals—A large body of work has shown that several actin regulatory proteins of the host cell are required for EPEC to form actin pedestals. These include Arp2/3, N-WASP, Nck, and α-actinin (2.Hayward R.D. Leong J.M. Koronakis V. Campellone K.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21.Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), participates in EPEC pathogenesis, we first examined the localization of IQGAP1 during the formation of actin pedestals by EPEC. HeLa cells were infected with EPEC, which stably express GFP (Fig. 1A). Cells were fixed 3 h post-infection and stained for endogenous IQGAP1 (red). EPEC were identified by expression of GFP (green). Analysis by confocal microscopy reveals strong staining of IQGAP1 at the sites of EPEC adhesion (Fig. 1A). To examine the time course of IQGAP1 localization to actin pedestals, HeLa cells were infected with GFP EPEC for 1, 2, or 3 h before fixing and staining cells for actin (red) and endogenous IQGAP1 (blue) (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous work (for review, see Ref. 1.Goosney D.L. Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), EPEC induces focused polymerization of actin at sites of bacterial adhesion (Fig. 1B). The polymerization of actin in the host cell is clearly seen from 1 h and persists to 3 h. Examination of endogenous IQGAP1 shows that it co-localizes with actin and EPEC at these pedestals at all the time points examined (Fig. 1B). The interaction of IQGAP1 with Rac1 and Cdc42 has been well characterized (15.Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We previously reported that IQGAP1 is required for efficient host cell invasion by Salmonella through modulation of Rac1, Cdc42, and actin polymerization (22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30265-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible relationship of Rac1 and Cdc42 to EPEC-induced actin pedestals. HeLa cells were fixed before and after infection with GFP EPEC (3 h) and stained for IQGAP1 (blue) and either Rac1 or Cdc42 (red) (Fig. 2). As described previously (20.Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30265-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), IQGAP1 colocalizes with both Rac1 and Cdc42 around the periphery of noninfected cells (Fig. 2). Neither Rac1 nor Cdc42 localizes at sites of EPEC adhesion (Fig. 2). Similarly, we were unable to detect co-localization of Rac1/Cdc42 with IQGAP1 or actin at shorter infection intervals (data not shown). EPEC Infection Inhibits the Interaction of IQGAP1 with Rac1 and Cdc42—Our data demonstrating that IQGAP1, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, localizes to EPEC-induced actin pedestals led to the hypothesis that EPEC infection could disrupt the interaction between IQGAP1 and these GTPases. We tested this hypothesis by immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were infected with EPEC, and IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated. Compared with non-infected cells, the amount of Rac1 and Cdc42 that co-immunoprecipitates with IQGAP1 is significantly decreased by 48 and 55%, respectively, 2 h after the addition of EPEC (Fig. 3, A and B). Although there is a small and reproducible decrease in co-immunoprecipitation of both GTPases 1 h after the addition of EPEC, this change is not significant. The specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation is verified by the absence of Rac1 and Cdc42 from samples precipitated with non-immune rabbit serum (Fig. 3A). The total amount of IQGAP1, Rac1, and Cdc42 in the cell lysates is not altered by EPEC infection (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that EPEC alters the function of IQGAP1 and/or Cdc42 and Rac1 in the host cell during infection. EPEC Infection Increases Activity of Cdc42 but Not Rac1—Many pathogenic microbes, such as Salmonella and Shigella, regulate small GTPases during infection (21.Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Cell. 2006; 124: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether EPEC is also able to manipulate the activity of the Rho GTPases. Therefore, to test whether EPEC is able to alter the GTP-loading of Rac1 and Cdc42, MEFs were infected with EPEC for 0, 1, and 2 h, and lysates were prepared. GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 were isolated using GST-PAK CRIB (which recognizes only the active, GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Cdc42) as previously (20.Swart-Mataraza J.M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22.Brown M.D. Bry L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30265-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The amount of GTP-bound Rac1 remains unchanged in response to incubation with EPEC (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, although the activity of Cdc42 does not change after 1 h EPEC infection, after 2 h there is an 88% increase in the level of active Cdc42 (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggest that during infection EPEC is able to specifically activate Cdc42 but not Rac1. Infection by EPEC Promotes the Interaction between IQGAP1 and Calmodulin—The interaction of calmodulin with IQGAP1 inhibits the ability of IQGAP1 to interact with many of its other binding partners, including Rac1 and Cdc42 (7.Joyal J.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether infection by EPEC alters the association of calmodulin with IQGAP1. After HeLa cells were infected with wild type EPEC for 1, 2, and 3 h, endogenous IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated. Probing the Western blots for calmodulin reveals that EPEC promotes the interaction of calmodulin with IQGAP1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B). Compared with non-infected cells (time = 0), the amount of calmodulin that co-immunoprecipitates with IQGAP1 after 2 and 3 h of infection with EPEC is increased by 72 and 170%, respectively. Note that the association of calmodulin and IQGAP1 is not altered after 1 h of infection. The total amounts of IQGAP1 and calmodulin in the cell lysates are unaltered by EPEC infection (Fig. 4). These data suggest that EPEC might manipulate calmodulin function. To test this hypothesis, the subcellular location of calmodulin in cells infected with EPEC was examined. MEFs were transiently transfected with YFP-calmodulin and infected with dsRed EPEC. Cells were fixed and stained for actin and YFP. YFP-calmodulin displays strong colocalization with actin along the entire length of the actin pedestal (Fig. 4C, arrowhead). Similarly, endogenous calmodulin also localizes to EPEC-induced actin pedestals (data not shown). We then aimed to examine the colocalization of calmodulin with IQGAP1 during EPEC infection. Our anti-IQGAP1 antibody has a lower affinity for mouse IQGAP1 compared with the human homologue, so we utilized HeLa cells for this"

In spite of numerous attempts successful licensure of a HCMV vaccine formulation remains elusive. Here we have developed a novel chimeric vaccine strategy based on a replication-deficient adenovirus which encodes the extracellular domain of gB protein and multiple HLA class I & II-restricted CTL epitopes from HCMV as a contiguous polypeptide. Immunisation with this chimeric vaccine consistently generated strong HCMV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells which co-expressed IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, while the humoral response induced by this vaccine showed strong virus neutralizing capacity. More importantly, immunization with adenoviral chimeric vaccine also afforded protection against challenge with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HCMV antigens and this protection was associated with the induction of a pluripotent antigen-specific cellular and antibody response. Furthermore, in vitro stimulation with this adenoviral chimeric vaccine rapidly expanded multiple antigen-specific human CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells from healthy virus carriers. These studies demonstrate that the adenovirus chimeric HCMV vaccine provides an excellent platform for reconstituting protective immunity to prevent HCMV diseases in different clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2010782393,"Constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can signal even in the absence of ligand binding. Most Class I GPCRs are stabilized in the resting conformation by intramolecular interactions involving transmembrane domain (TM) 3 and TM6, particularly at loci 6.30 and 6.34 of TM6. Signaling by Gi/Go-coupled receptors such as the Neuropeptide Y1 receptor decreases already low basal metabolite levels. Thus, we examined constitutive activity using a biochemical assay mediated by a Gi/Gq chimeric protein and a more direct electrophysiological assay. Wild-type (WT-Y1) receptors express no measurable, agonist-independent activation, while μ-opioid receptors (MOR) and P2Y12 purinoceptors showed clear evidence of constitutive activation, especially in the electrophysiological assay. Neither point mutations at TM6 (T6.30A or N6.34A) nor substitution of the entire TM3 and TM6 regions from the MOR into the Y1 receptor increased basal WT-Y1 activation. By contrast, chimeric substitution of the third intracellular loop (ICL3) generated a constitutively active, Y1-ICL3-MOR chimera. Furthermore, the loss of stabilizing interactions from the native ICL3 enhanced the role of surrounding residues to permit basal receptor activation; because constitutive activity of the Y1-ICL3-MOR chimera was further increased by point mutation at locus 6.34, which did not alter WT-Y1 receptor activity. Our results indicate that the ICL3 stabilizes the Y1 receptor in the inactive state and confers structural properties critical for regulating Y receptor activation and signal transduction.

NPY and its receptors have been implicated in various biological functions and neuronal disorders, such as epilepsy, obesity, and anxiety. There are 5 confirmed subtypes of NPY receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6), which are class I G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupling to Gi/Go proteins (1Larhammar D. Regul. Pept. 1996; 65: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that an unexpectedly large number of the GPCRs demonstrate constitutive activity, so they can signal even in the absence of ligand binding (2Kenakin T.

GPCR activation is determined by the flexibility of its transmembrane (TM) segments to move relative to each other (5Farrens D.L. Altenback C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). GPCRs are stabilized in the inactive state by a network of non-covalent, intramolecular interactions that restricts TM mobility (6Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The interactions between the (D/E)RY and X1BBX2X3B motif on TM3 and TM6, respectively, are considered to be critical for GPCR activation (8Kobilka B.K. Deupi X. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Single point mutation at X 6.301 and/or X 6.343 is sufficient in some GPCRs to destabilize this covalent network, thus allowing the GPCR to adopt a conformation favorable for intracellular G-protein binding. In effect, point mutation(s) at loci 6.30 and/or 6.34 frequently induce constitutive activity in class I GPCRs (6Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

However, some GPCRs are resistant to constitutive activation in this way, suggesting the participation of alternative regions that regulate GPCR activation. Y receptors are coupled to the activation of Gi/Go proteins, hence detection of their receptor activation is complicated by the nature of Gi/Go-protein signaling that primarily inhibits adenylyl cyclase, thereby suppressing the production of readily detectable metabolites. We circumvented this by employing a biochemical assay in which a chimeric GαΔ6qi4myr protein positively coupled Y1 receptor activation to the Gq-signaling pathway, increasing inositol phosphate (IP) production (12Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Kostenis E. Degtyarev M.Y. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 242: 19107-19110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Secondly, we developed an electrophysiological assay whereby GPCR activation was measured as an increase in basal prepulse facilitation (BPF) of a co-expressed N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (14Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 280: 258-262Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 15Ikeda S.R.

The use of both approaches maximized the detection and estimation of constitutive activity in this class of Gi/Go-coupled receptors. However, the WT-Y1 receptor did not express significant constitutive activity, nor was it susceptible to constitutive activation by single point mutations at position 6.30 (T6.30A) or 6.34 (N6.34A). By chimeric substitution of functional regions, such as a complete TM or intracellular loop (ICL), into the Y1 receptor from analogous regions in the constitutively active μ-opioid receptor (MOR), we identified the structural region that stabilizes the Y1 receptor. The loss of the region that imparts the most relevant stabilizing interactions would result in the generation of a constitutively active chimeric Y1 receptor. Our findings indicate that the Y1 receptor is stabilized in the inactive state by the ICL3 region and suggest the relative importance of this atypical region for regulating the activation of other Y receptors and class I GPCRs. The subcloning of the human Y1 receptor cDNA into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) has been described previously (17Dinger M.C. Bader J.E. Kobor A.D. Kretzschmar A.K. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10562-10571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fusion to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) allowed for fluorescence detection of the heterologously expressed receptor and does not alter the function of Y receptors (17Dinger M.C.

The human (h) Y1 receptor EYFP fusion gene was additionally subcloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVitro2-mcs(hygro) (Invivo-Gen, Toulouse, France) via a BamHI and an AvrII site. Mutations were introduced with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The entire coding region was sequenced to ensure the accuracy of all constructs. In the Y1-ICL3-MOR construct, the nucleotides coding for amino acids 232–264 of the hY1 receptor were replaced by nucleotides coding for amino acids 255–283 of the hMOR. The Y1-ICL3-MOR construct was additionally mutated at position 281 (originally from the hMOR construct) by point mutation from Thr to Lys to generate the Y1-ICL3(T6.34K)-MOR chimera. In the Y1-TM3-TM6-MOR chimera, nucleotides coding for amino acids 116–139 and 255–286 of the hY1 receptor were replaced by nucleotides coding for amino acids 145–168 and 274–305 of the hMOR, respectively; this Y1-TM3-TM6-MOR also contains an additional spontaneous Lys to Arg point mutation at amino acid 252.

The Gonnet scoring matrix was selected with the penalty value for opening a gap setting at 10 and the penalty for extending a gap was set at 0.20. COS-7 Cell Transfection—African green monkey kidney COS-7 cells were maintained in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.01% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. All cell culture agents were obtained from Invitrogen. The phospholipase Cβ pathway signal, IP accumulation, was used to determine the activation of Gi/Go-GPCRs by co-transfection of the chimeric G-protein GαΔ6qi4myr (kindly provided by Dr. E. Kostenis, 7TM Pharma A/S, Hoersholm, Denmark). A Gi/Go-GPCR can couple to the Gq pathway via this chimeric protein, which has a Gαq backbone with an altered C terminus comprised of residues from Gαi and an N-terminal myristoylation consensus site (12Kostenis E.

COS-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (1.0 × 105 cells/well) and transiently transfected with cDNA plasmids to be tested (0.20 μg), plus the GαΔ6qi4myr (0.05 μg) using 0.75 μl of metafectene (Biontex, München, Germany). As a positive control, cells were transiently co-transfected with the Gi/Go-protein-coupled P2Y12 receptor (0.20 μg) and GαΔ6qi4myr (0.05 μg). As a negative control, cells were transiently co-transfected with the cDNA plasmid encoding EGFP (0.20 μg) and GαΔ6qi4myr (0.05 μg). Determination of IP Accumulation—IP formation was measured 2 days after transfection. Cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]-inositol (25.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) 16 h prior to measurement.

To estimate plasma membrane localization, a cell surface, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; 23Schoneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was performed with the WT-Y1 receptor and its mutants carrying an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The N-terminal nine amino acid residue epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was derived from the influenza virus HA protein and inserted downstream of the start codon. The entire coding region was sequenced to ensure the accuracy of all constructs. COS-7 cells were seeded into 48-well plates (35,000 cells/well) and transfected (0.20 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.60 μl of metafectene/well). Three days after transfection, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde without disrupting the cell membrane and probed with a biotin-labeled anti-HA antibody (1 μg of 12CA5 with biotin/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Bound anti-HA antibody was detected by a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate (0.29 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Following removal of excess unbound conjugate, H2O2 and o-phenylenediamine (2.5 mm each in 0.1 m phosphate-citrate buffer; pH 5) were added to serve as substrate and chromogen, respectively. After 10–30 min, the enzyme reaction was stopped by addition of 1 m HCl containing 50 mm Na2SO3. Color development was measured bichromatically at 492 nm and 620 nm using an ELISA reader (Sunrise, Tecan). Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to determine the subcellular distribution of P2Y12, MOR, WT-Y1, T6.30A-Y1 (data not shown), N6.34A-Y1 (data not shown), Y1-ICL3-MOR, Y1-TM3-TM6-MOR, and Y1-ICL3(T6.34K)-MOR receptors (Fig. 1). COS-7 cells were transferred into 24-well plates that contained sterilized glass cover slips and then transfected. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde. They were treated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (10 μg 12CA5/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and then incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-linked anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2; Heidelberg, Germany). tsA-201 Cell Transfection—Human embryonic kidney-derived tsA-201 cells were maintained in standard DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were grown and maintained as monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% O2. All cell culture agents were obtained from Invitrogen. When the tsA-201 cells reached 90% confluence, they were detached with trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin with EDTA 4 mm Na) and plated onto glass coverslips at 50% confluence 7 h prior to transfection. Using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (24Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the plated cells were always transiently transfected with cDNA constructs encoding for the N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) subunits (α1B, α2δ, and β1b; 3:2:2 ratio with a total of 7.0 μg/ml of DMEM). In most cases, proteins of interest were intrinsically tagged with a fluorescent protein that does not affect their functions; otherwise, a plasmid encoding EGFP (0.05 μg/ml) was additionally co-expressed. Where indicated, N-type VDCC subunits were co-expressed with the (1.0 μg/ml each) WT-Y1-EGFP, T6.30A-Y1-EGFP, N6.34A-Y1-EGFP, WT-MOR, T6.34K-MOR-EYFP, Y1-ICL3-MOR-EYFP, Y1-ICL3(T6.34K)-MOR-EYFP, or Y1-TM3-TM6-MOR-EYFP receptor construct. Where indicated, the chimeric Gα-protein (Gαqαo-ECFP; 0.6 μg/ml; kindly provided by Dr. N. Gautam, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was also transiently co-expressed in the tsA-201 cells as scavengers of Gβγ. The cDNA constructs were first added to a transfection mixture containing (in mm): 640 NaCl, 25 HEPES, 120 CaCl2, 0.75 Na2HPO4·H2O before being added to the cells. Following a 16-h incubation at 37 °C in the calcium phosphate/cDNA mixture, the cells were washed with fresh DMEM and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 6 h. The cells were then moved to a 30 °C incubator to prevent further cell division. Patch Clamp Recordings—A coverslip with the transfected cells attached was placed in a recording chamber, attached to a fixed stage upright microscope (Axioskop FS-2, Carl Zeiss) that was continuously perfused with external recording solution composed of (in mm): 20 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 40 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 glucose, 65 CsCl (adjusted to pH 7.20 with TEA-OH; 256–260 mOsm/liter). The microscope was equipped with epifluorescence optics (excitation 450–490 nm; emission 515 nm; Chroma, Burlington, VT), and only those cells exhibiting fluorescence were considered for patching. Patch pipettes (borosilicate glass Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were pulled using a Sutter P-97 microelectrode puller, then in some cases were fire-polished with a Micro-Forge 200 (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) to yield tip resistances of 5–7 MΩ when back-filled with internal solution composed of (in mm): 108 Cs-methanesulfonate, 4 MgCl2, 9 EGTA, 9 HEPES, 1 Na-GTP (adjusted to pH 7.20 with CsOH; 238–243 mOsm/liter). All electrophysiological recordings were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). Patch pipettes were connected to the headstage of either an Axopatch 200B or Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) used in voltage-clamp mode and linked via a Digidata 1322 interface (Axon) to a computer equipped with Clampex 8.2 software (Axon). The whole cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz (-3 dB) and the cell membrane capacitance and series resistance were manually compensated. Current traces were digitized at 10 kHz and analyzed offline. An online leak-subtraction protocol was used, where 8 pulses of opposite polarity and 1/8th amplitude were acquired immediately prior to the test protocol. The barium current (IBa) elicited by each test pulse (P1 or P2) consisted of a 105 mV, 14 ms depolarizing voltage step from a holding potential (Vh) of -90 mV. In the prepulse (PP) protocol, a 15-ms depolarizing voltage step from Vh to +105 mV (a 195-mV depolarization) was applied immediately following the first test pulse (P1); the second test pulse (P2) was then preceded by a brief (4 ms) interpulse interval at the holding potential (24Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In the absence of the prepulse, the two test pulses were separated from each other by 19 ms. The parameters of the voltage protocols used here: Vh; amplitude and duration of P1, P2, and PP; and duration of the interpulse interval, were optimized to maximize the effect of prepulse facilitation. Only cells showing peak inward IBa amplitudes between 150 pA and 2000 pA in response to P1 (IP1) were included in the data set. Drug Applications—NPY (Peptidec Technologies, Pierrefonds, QC, Canada) and [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO; Bachem, Torrance, CA) were diluted into the external recording solution from concentrated stock solutions to their final concentrations immediately prior to use. Stock solutions of 10 mm ADP, 100 μm NPY, and 100 μm DAMGO was prepared in HPLC grade water (Fisher Scientific) and stored at -20 °C. During drug application, 1 mm ADP, 50 nm NPY, or 1 μm DAMGO was perfused into the recording chamber for 3–5 min. Following drug application, the cells were washed out with bath perfusion solution for at least 8 min. In experiments involving guanosine 5′-[β-thio]diphosphate (GDP-β-S; Sigma-Aldrich), it was added directly to the internal pipette solution to a final concentration of 1 mm immediately prior to use. Current traces were analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 (Axon Instruments). Sample traces were reproduced using Axum 5.0 (MathSoft, Miami Beach, FL). Statistics and graphs were produced using GraphPad Prism v 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance for mean comparisons involving only 2 groups and 3 or more groups was determined using the unpaired Student's t test and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test, respectively, unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance for single means was compared with 0 with a one-sample Student's t test. Statistical significance for slope comparisons between lines of best-fit was determined using a comparison of Linear Regression. The differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Results were presented as means ± S.E. where appropriate. WT-Y1 Receptor Is Not Constitutively Active—Basal activation of the WT-Y1 receptor was determined in the absence of agonist, with a biochemical assay measuring IP accumulation and an electrophysiological assay measuring basal prepulse facilitation (BPF). Activation of the Gi/Go-coupled Y1 receptor typically suppresses the production of cAMP so that a direct measure of Y1 receptor activation is complex. In the IP assay, co-transfection of the chimeric GαΔ6qi4myr subunit (12Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) coupled the activation of all Gi/Go-protein-coupled receptors tested to the normally Gq-mediated stimulation of the phospholipase Cβ pathway and subsequent accumulation of IP. In this functional biochemical assay, basal activity of the highly constitutively active P2Y12 receptor (25Schulz A. Schoneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35531-35541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Ding Z. Kim S. Kunapuli S.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 338-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was readily detected, but not that of the native MOR (27Burford N.T. Wang D. Sadée W. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was a significant increase in intracellular IP accumulation following the co-expression of the constitutively active P2Y12 receptor but not of the demonstrably constitutively active MOR relative to the EGFP control (Fig. 2). The IP assay is therefore not sensitive to subtle levels of GPCR constitutive activity. Furthermore, this assay did not reveal significant basal receptor activation by the WT-Y1 receptor (Fig. 2). The electrophysiological assay measuring basal prepulse facilitation (BPF) can detect constitutive activity of Gi/Go-coupled receptors expressed in individual cells (14Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 280: 258-262Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 15Ikeda S.R.

Whole cell IBa was elicited using a double-pulse protocol, with or without an intervening depolarizing prepulse (PP) and results were reported as the ratio (IP2/P1) of the peak current elicited by the second test pulse (P2) relative to that of the first (P1; Fig. 3A). BPF refers to the percent increase in IP2/P1 elicited by the PP in the absence of an agonist (Fig. 3A). Constitutive activity of both the P2Y12 receptor and MOR were revealed by the electrophysiological BPF assay. Co-expression of either the P2Y12 receptor or the MOR resulted in a significant increase in BPF relative to control cells in which no GPCRs were co-expressed with the N-type VDCCs. In contrast, co-expression of the WT-Y1 receptor did not cause a significant increase in BPF over control, indicating that it is quiescent in the absence of an agonist (Fig. 3B). WT-Y1 receptor activation and intracellular signaling remained intact in this preparation, as 50 nm NPY produced a significant inhibition of IP1 and increased prepulse facilitation (Table 2).TABLE 2Inhibition of barium currents at the first test pulse (IP1) and increase in PF following agonist-mediated receptor activation Data are given as the mean ± S.E. and determined if significantly different from zero (one sample t test).AgonistReceptornIP1 inhibitionp valuePF increasep value%%50 nm NPYWT-Y12173.8 ± 3.6***, p < 0.0001a, p < 0.000194.7 ± 11.6***, p < 0.0001T6.30A-Y1784.5 ± 4.1***, p < 0.0001188.4 ± 65.0*, p < 0.05b, p < 0.05N6.34A-Y11282.1 ± 2.5***, p < 0.0001197.5 ± 56.0***, p < 0.0001Y1-TM3-TM6-MOR47.8 ± 9.0nscns, not significant; one-sample t testN/AN/AY1-ICL3-MOR1760.6 ± 2.8***, p < 0.000126.7 ± 9.5*, p < 0.05Y1-ICL3(T6.34K)-MOR962.4 ± 1.3***, p < 0.000111.6 ± 6.9ns1 μm DAMGOWT-MOR461.2 ± 4.2***, p < 0.000134.4 ± 5.7**, p < 0.01d, p < 0.01T6.34K-MOR436.0 ± 6.2**, p < 0.01–13.3 ± 9.8nsa*** , p < 0.0001b* , p < 0.05c ns, not significant; one-sample t testd** , p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab Even in the absence of any co-expressed GPCRs, a significant level of BPF was observed (Fig. 4A).

The spectrum of disease is wide, and responsible organisms vary according to setting. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria necessitate examination of responsible organisms and their antibiotic susceptibility.A retrospective cohort study of all HIV-positive pediatric admissions at an urban public sector hospital in Cape Town between January 2002 and June 2006 was conducted. Children between the ages of one month and nine years with laboratory confirmed HIV status, serious bacterial infection, and a hospital length of stay of 5 days or more, were eligible for inclusion. Organisms isolated from blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility were examined, and compared according to timing of isolation to distinguish nosocomial versus community-acquired. One hundred and forty-one children were identified (median age 1.2 years), 39% of whom were on antiretrovirals started before or during this hospitalization. Bacterial infections involved all organ systems, however pneumonia was most common (67%). S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were the most common gram positive and K. pneumoniae was the most common gram negative organism. K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to many first and second line antibiotics, and were all considered nosocomial. All S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, some of which were community-acquired.Bacterial infections are an important source of co-morbidity in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. Clinicians should have a low threshold to initiate antibiotics in children requiring hospitalization. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used judiciously. Clinicians caring for HIV-infected children should be cognizant of the most common organisms affecting such children, and of their local antimicrobial susceptibilities, when treating empirically for serious bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W1968051494,"We describe a novel, simple and low-cost protein microarray strategy wherein the microarrays are generated by printing expression ready plasmid DNAs onto slides that can be converted into protein arrays on-demand. The printed expression plasmids serve dual purposes as they not only direct the synthesis of the protein of interest; they also serve to capture the newly synthesized proteins through a high affinity DNA-protein interaction. To accomplish this we have exploited the high-affinity binding (∼3–7×10 −13 M) of E. coli Tus protein to Ter, a 20 bp DNA sequence involved in the regulation of E. coli DNA replication. In our system, each protein of interest is synthesized as a Tus fusion protein and each expression construct directing the protein synthesis contains embedded Ter DNA sequence. The embedded Ter sequence functions as a capture reagent for the newly synthesized Tus fusion protein. This “all DNA” microarray can be converted to a protein microarray on-demand without need for any additional capture reagent.."
https://openalex.org/W2050987518,"The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Care Act (now the Treatment Modernization Act; Ryan White Program, or RWP) is a source of federal public funding for HIV care in the United States. The Health Services and Resources Administration requires that facilities or providers who receive RWP funds ensure that HIV health services are accessible and delivered according to established HIV-related treatment guidelines. We used data from population-based samples of persons in care for HIV infection in three states to compare the quality of HIV care in facilities supported by the RWP, with facilities not supported by the RWP.Within each area (King County in Washington State; southern Louisiana; and Michigan), a probability sample of patients receiving care for HIV infection in 1998 was drawn. Based on medical records abstraction, information was collected on prescription of antiretroviral therapy according to treatment recommendations, prescription of prophylactic therapy, and provision of recommended vaccinations and screening tests. We calculated population-level estimates of the extent to which HIV care was provided according to then-current treatment guidelines in RWP-supported and non-RWP-supported facilities. For all treatment outcomes analyzed, the compliance with care guidelines was at least as good for patients who received care at RWP-supported (vs non-RWP supported) facilities. For some outcomes in some states, delivery of recommended care was significantly more common for patients receiving care in RWP-supported facilities: for example, in Louisiana, patients receiving care in RWP-supported facilities were more likely to receive indicated prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and Mycobacterium avium complex, and in all three states, women receiving care in RWP-supported facilities were more likely to have received an annual Pap smear.The quality of HIV care provided in 1998 to patients in RWP-supported facilities was of equivalent or better quality than in non-RWP supported facilities; however, there were significant opportunities for improvement in all facility types. Data from population-based clinical outcomes surveillance data can be used as part of a broader strategy to evaluate the quality of publicly-supported HIV care."

A homologous complex is present in activated human spliceosomes. In many components of the spliceosome, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) serve as versatile protein-RNA or protein-protein interaction platforms. Here, we show that in the retention and splicing complex, an atypical RRM of the Snu17p (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated protein 17) subunit acts as a scaffold that organizes the other two constituents, Bud13p (bud site selection 13) and Pml1p (pre-mRNA leakage 1). GST pull-down experiments and size exclusion chromatography revealed that Snu17p constitutes the central platform of the complex, whereas Bud13p and Pml1p do not interact with each other. Fluorimetric structure probing showed the entire Bud13p and the N-terminal third of Pml1p to be natively disordered in isolation. Mutational analysis and tryptophan fluorescence confirmed that a conserved tryptophan-containing motif in the C terminus of Bud13p binds to the core RRM of Snu17p, whereas a different interaction surface encompassing a C-terminal extension of the Snu17p RRM is required to bind an N-terminal peptide of Pml1p. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed 1:1 interaction stoichiometries, large negative binding entropies, and dissociation constants in the low nanomolar and micromolar ranges for the Snu17p-Bud13p and the Snu17p-Pml1p interactions, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the noncanonical Snu17p RRM concomitantly binds multiple ligand proteins via short, intrinsically unstructured peptide epitopes and thereby acts as a platform that displays functional modules of the ligands, such as a forkhead-associated domain of Pml1p and a conserved polylysine motif of Bud13p.

During pre-mRNA splicing, a multisubunit RNA-protein enzyme, the spliceosome, carries out two successive transesterification reactions that lead to the removal of noncoding intervening sequences (introns) and the concomitant ligation of coding regions (exons). A functional spliceosome emerges from the stepwise recruitment of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP proteins to the pre-mRNA substrate and subsequent major conformational and compositional rearrangements, which bring about a catalytically competent particle (reviewed in Refs. 1Will C.L.

Several snRNP-associated as well as non-snRNP splice factors are preorganized as multimeric functional modules. For example, the 17 S U2 snRNP encompasses the complex splice factors SF3a and SF3b (splicing factor 3a and 3b, respectively) (5Krämer A. Gruter P. Groning K. Kastner B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which harbor three and seven subunits in humans, respectively (6Will C.L. Schneider C. MacMillan A.M. Katopodis N.F.

Similarly, the non-snRNP CDC5 (cell division control protein 5)-Prp19p (pre-mRNA processing factor 19) complex comprises six core components that concomitantly join the spliceosome just prior to catalytic activation (8Ajuh P.

Recently, a novel ternary non-snRNP protein complex that proved to be important for the retention of unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus has been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since the complex additionally enhanced splicing of a subset of pre-mRNAs, it was termed pre-mRNA retention and splicing complex, RES (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The yeast RES complex consists of three proteins, Snu17p (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated protein 17), Bud13p (bud site selection 13), and Pml1p (pre-mRNA leakage 1) (12Dziembowski A.

Component analyses of isolated human A and B spliceosomal complexes showed that putative human orthologs of the three subunits are present in purified B but not in A complexes, in line with the overall dramatic compositional differences of these two spliceosomal states (13Behzadnia N. Golas M.M. Hartmuth K. Sander B. Kastner B. Deckert J. Dube P. Will C.L. Urlaub H. Stark H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1737-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Deckert J.

Consistent with its presence in B complex spliceosomes, it has been shown that the RES complex elicits effects on splicing prior to the first transesterification step in yeast (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Gottschalk A. Bartels C. Neubauer G. Lührmann R. Fabrizio P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human RES complex remains associated with the spliceosome after the first transesterification step (C complex), and the ortholog of Bud13p becomes stably incorporated into its catalytic core (16Bessonov S. Anokhina M. Will C.L. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Nature. 2008; 452: 846-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Evidently, pre-mRNA splicing critically hinges both on durable as well as on dynamic interactions among spliceosomal proteins and RNAs. One of the most widespread interaction devices in spliceosomal proteins is the RNA recognition motif (RRM). Classical RRMs are 80–90-residue domains, comprising a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet backed by two α-helices (helices A and B) on one side (17Antson A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). They serve as RNA-binding elements, often employing two conserved sequence motifs, RNP1 and RNP2, located on the central two β-strands to engage in RNA contacts (18Maris C. Dominguez C. Allain F.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of proteins have been described, in which RRMs mediate protein-protein interactions. For example, U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor) homology motifs (UHMs) comprise a family of atypical RRMs, which interact with peptide ligands termed UHM-ligand motifs (ULMs) (19Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have set out to elucidate the molecular architecture of the RES complex. We find that the complex is organized around an unconventional RRM in Snu17p that provides two separate interaction surfaces, to which Bud13p and Pml1p bind at the same time. The two interaction modes sustained by Snu17p resemble binding strategies that have previously been observed separately in RRM-protein complexes; the Snu17p-Bud13p interaction exhibits characteristics of a UHM·ULM complex, whereas the Snu17p-Pml1p interaction is reminiscent of the complex between the SF3b14a (p14) and SF3b155 (splicing factor 3b 155-kDa subunit) proteins (20Schellenberg M.J.

We suggest that by binding to short, intrinsically unstructured regions in Bud13p and Pml1p, Snu17p acts as a showcase for other conserved, functional portions of the ligand proteins. General Cloning Strategies—For cloning of the genes YIR005w, YGL174w, and YLR016c, coding for Snu17p, Bud13p, and Pml1p, respectively, chromosomal DNA was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by standard techniques. Coding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Other constructs encoding portions of Snu17p, Bud13p, and Pml1p were amplified from the respective full-length genes, cloned by similar strategies, and also verified by DNA sequencing. For GST pull-down and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, gene fragments coding for Snu17p-(1–148), Snu17p-(9–148), Snu17p-(25–148), Snu17p-(1–138), Snu17p-(9–138), Snu17p-(25–138), Snu17p-(1–125), Snu17p-(9–125), Snu17p-(25–125), Snu17p-(1–106), Snu17p-(9–106), Snu17p-(25–106), Bud13p-(1–64), Bud13p-(1–96), Bud13p-(1–127), Bud13p-(1–162), Bud13p-(1–266), Bud13p-(34–266), Bud13p-(65–266), Bud13p-(97–266), Bud13p-(128–266), Bud13p-(163–266), Bud13p-(202–266), Pml1p-(1–61), Pml1p-(1–89), Pml1p-(1–112), Pml1p-(1–136), Pml1p-(1–161), Pml1p-(1–204), Pml1p-(34–204), Pml1p-(62–204), Pml1p-(90–204), and Pml1p-(113–204) were cloned into the pETM-10 vector (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) that allows the generation of His6-tagged fusion proteins. For co-expression experiments, full-length genes coding for Snu17p, Bud13p, and Pml1p were cloned into the Duet vector series (pRSFDuet-1, pETDuet-1, pCDFDuet-1, respectively; Novagen). An N-terminal His6-tag was engineered on Snu17p. GST Pull-down Assays and Size Exclusion Chromatography—GST fusions of Snu17p, Bud13p, Pml1p, and GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen) from the respective pGEX-6P-1 plasmids and His6-tagged polypeptides of Snu17p, Bud13p, and Pml1p were expressed from pETM-10 vectors. GST and the GST fusion proteins were captured on glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and washed extensively with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). His6-tagged fragments were prepurified via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and eluted in buffer A supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. 20 μl of protein-coated glutathione-beads were used per binding reaction and incubated with an excess of the respective His6-tagged protein for 2 h on ice. After extensive washing with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), proteins were eluted by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and half of the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For analytical size exclusion chromatography, His6-tagged Snu17p, Pml1p, and Bud13p proteins were mixed in approximately equimolar ratios, applied on a Superdex-200 PC 3.2 column (GE Healthcare), and chromatographed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol using a SMART protein purification system (GE Healthcare). For a typical run, 50 μl of sample were loaded on the column at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. 40-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Mutational Analysis of the Snu17p-Bud13p Complex—A W232A point mutation was introduced into His6-tagged Bud13p-(202–266) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Wild type and mutant fragments were produced in E. coli and purified via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. A 3-fold molar excess of either His6-tagged Bud13p-(202–266) or Bud13p-(202–266) (W232A) were incubated with His6-tagged Snu17p for 3 h at 4°C. 50 μl of the protein mix was applied on a Superdex-75 PC 3.2 column and chromatographed using the SMART protein purification system (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. 40-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—His6-tagged proteins were expressed, captured on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, washed, and eluted as above. All proteins were further purified via gel filtration on a Superdex-75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C (10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). An additional ion exchange chromatographic step via CM-Sepharose was required to remove residual impurities from Pml1p-(1–204) and Bud13p-(1–266). All purified samples were dialyzed twice against the same batch of buffer C overnight. SDS-PAGE analysis suggested purities above 95% for each polypeptide. All protein concentrations were determined based on the absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients. The thermodynamics of binding of His6-tagged full-length proteins and minimal fragments of Bud13p and Pml1p (Bud13p-(1–266), Bud13p-(202–266), Bud13p-(202–266) (W232A), Pml1p-(1–204), and Pml1p-(1–61); employed as titrants) to His6-tagged full-length or minimal fragments of Snu17p (Snu17p-(1–148), Snu17p-(25–138), and Snu17p-(25–106); employed as analytes) were determined using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). A typical experiment involved 60 μm titrant in a 300-μl injection syringe and 1300 μl of analyte at 6 μm in the sample cell. ITC analyses were carried out at 20 °C with 20 injections of 15 μl at 5-min intervals. Plain buffer was injected into protein solutions as a control. The heat releases from the control experiments were subtracted from the experimental data before evaluation. Data were analyzed with Microcal Origin 7.0 to extract the enthalpies and entropies of binding (ΔHa and ΔSa, respectively), the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd), and the interaction stoichiometries (n; Table 1).TABLE 1Isothermal titration calorimetryAnalyte and titrantKdΔHΔSStoichiometrynmkcal mol-1cal K-1 mol-1nSnu17p-(1-148)Bud13p-(1-266)2.5-76-2221.1Bud13p-(202-266)2.6-61-1701.0Pml1p-(1-204)1100-15-240.9Pml1p-(1-61)900-17-290.9Snu17p-(25-138)Pml1p-(1-204)1000-16-280.9Pml1p-(1-61)600-19-370.9Snu17p-(25-106)Bud13p-(1-266)6.8-53-1431.0Bud13p-(202-266)5.3-58-1590.9Bud13p-(202-266) (W232A) NDaNot detected.a Not detected. Open table in a new tab Fluorescence-based Analysis of Thermal Protein Unfolding—His6-tagged, purified proteins Snu17p-(1–148), Pml1p-(1–204), and Bud13p-(1–266) were diluted in buffer (20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 30 μm. 40-μl reaction volumes were transferred to a 96-well plate. After applying 4 μl of the fluorophore SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) to each reaction, the change in fluorescence emission upon increasing the temperature in 1 °C steps was monitored on a DNA Engine Opticon™ (MJ Research). The starting temperature was set to 15 °C, and the final temperature was set to 95 °C. Equilibration was for 30 s after temperature ramps. Fluorescence intensities were plotted as a function of temperature and corrected for the signal of the dye in buffer. CD Spectroscopy—His6-tagged fragments Snu17p-(25–138), Pml1p-(1–61), and Bud13p-(202–266) were obtained as described above but were further purified via a Superdex-75 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). Measurements were performed on a Chirascan Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). Polypeptides were dissolved in buffer D (10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaF, pH 7.9). Measurements were performed at 20 °C with polypeptide concentrations of 25 μm. Data were corrected for the buffer signal and analyzed using the manufacturer's software. In Vitro Reconstitution of the RES Complex—Tandem affinity purification has revealed that proteins Snu17p, Bud13p, and Pml1p form the RES complex in yeast (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To test whether recombinant RES components also assemble in vitro, we cloned the genes encoding the three proteins from yeast chromosomal DNA. When co-expressed in E. coli, the recombinant proteins could be purified as a stable, ternary complex using affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 1A). Significantly, a stable complex could also be reconstituted by mixing components that were expressed and purified individually. Both the co-expressed and the in vitro reconstituted particles were stable in the presence of high salt (up to 800 mm NaCl) during gel filtration, suggesting that the interactions between the components involve hydrophobic contacts. Complexes obtained by either strategy migrated similarly in size exclusion chromatography and appeared stoichiometric on SDS gels (Fig. 2). The complexes, therefore, seem to be identical, containing one copy of each subunit. The spontaneous and specific association of the components suggests that these complexes are also identical to the original, tandem affinity purification-purified complex. The ability to reconstitute the ternary complex from isolated components enabled us to derive a detailed interaction map.FIGURE 2Interaction mapping by gel filtration.

Immobilized GST-Snu17p brought down both Bud13p and Pml1p (Fig. 1B, lanes 12 and 17), whereas GST-Bud13p and GST-Pml1p only interacted with Snu17p (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9). No interaction was observed between Bud13p and Pml1p (Fig. 1B, lanes 14 and 18). To confirm this molecular organization, we analyzed pairwise combinations of the proteins by size exclusion chromatography. Snu17p formed heterodimers with either Bud13p or Pml1p, which were stable during gel filtration even in the absence of the respective third component (Fig. 2, D and E). Consistent with the GST pull-down experiments, we were not able to isolate a stable Bud13p-Pml1p heterodimer (Fig. 2F). Domain Organization of the RES Proteins—In order to define interacting domains of the protein, we first analyzed their intrinsic structural organizations. Primary sequence analysis indicated the presence of a RRM in the center of Snu17p and of a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain in the C-terminal part of Pml1p, whereas no known folding unit was detected in the Bud13p sequence (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Instead, Bud13p appeared to belong to the group of intrinsically unstructured proteins. Consistent with this analysis, Snu17p (17.1 kDa) and Pml1p (23.7 kDa) eluted at the expected retention volumes for approximately globular proteins in analytical gel filtration runs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Bud13p (30.5 kDa) showed an abnormal migration behavior (Fig. 2C). Stable three-dimensional folds in proteins exhibit cooperative unfolding upon increase in temperature or denaturant concentration. As an experimental test for the presence of folded domains, we monitored thermal melting of the three proteins using a fluorescence-based assay (22Vedadi M. Niesen F.H. Allali-Hassani A. Fedorov O.Y. Finerty Jr., P.J. Wasney G.A. Yeung R. Arrowsmith C. Ball L.J. Berglund H. Hui R. Marsden B.D. Nordlund P. Sundstrom M. Weigelt J. Edwards A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15835-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Consistent with the fold prediction, Snu17p and Pml1p underwent cooperative unfolding (Fig. 3A, solid and dashed black lines, respectively). No such transition could be discerned with Bud13p (Fig. 3A, gray line), verifying that this protein lacked regular tertiary structure in isolation. Minimal Regions of Snu17p Required for Binding of Bud13p and Pml1p—Disorder predictions (23Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) showed that the central RRM of Snu17p (residues 25–106) is flanked by putatively unstructured regions. To delineate the minimal regions of Snu17p sufficient for binding of Bud13p and Pml1p, we generated His6-tagged N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of Snu17p (Fig. 4A). None of the deletions corrupted the predicted core RRM. We then performed GST pull-down experiments with GST-tagged Bud13p and Pml1p. N-terminal truncations of Snu17p (Snu17p-(9–148) and Snu17p-(25–148)) maintained binding to both Bud13p and Pml1p (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 8 and 11, respectively). Similarly, short truncations from the C terminus of Snu17p (Snu17p-(1–138), Snu17p-(1–125), and Snu17p-(1–106)) did not affect the binding to Bud13p (Fig. 4B, lanes 14, 23, and 32). In sharp contrast, deletion of more than 10 residues from the C terminus of Snu17p (Snu17p-(1–125) and Snu17p-(1–106)) completely abolished the binding to Pml1p (Fig. 4C, lanes 23 and 32). These data demonstrate that the core RRM of Snu17p (Snu17p-(25–106)) is sufficient to form a complex with Bud13p but that a C-terminal expansion beyond the core RRM (Snu17p-(25–138)) is required for Pml1p binding. A Conserved C-Terminal Motif of Bud13p Interacts with Snu17p—Multiple sequence alignments of Bud13p orthologs revealed two highly conserved regions (Fig. 5A) (12Dziembowski A. Ventura A.P. Rutz B. Caspary F. Faux C. Halgand F. Laprevote O. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The first, at the very N terminus of the protein, contains a high fraction of lysine residues. The second region comprises about 20 residues close to the C terminus (Fig. 5A). We asked whether either of the conserved regions in Bud13p constituted an interaction element for Snu17p. Various N- and C-terminally truncated fragments of Bud13p were generated and inspected for binding to immobilized GST-Snu17p fusion protein by in vitro pull-down experiments (Fig. 5B). N-terminal truncations of Bud13p, which removed the lysine-rich conserved element, had no influence on binding to GST-Snu17p (Fig. 5C, lanes 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, and 35). In contrast, none of the Bud13p fragments that lacked the C-terminal 65 residues could be precipitated by immobilized GST-Snu17p fusion protein (Fig. 5C, lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). The very C-terminal fragment of Bud13p alone (Bud13p-(202–266)) was sufficient to sustain binding to GST-Snu17p (Fig. 5C, lane 35). These results demonstrate that the Bud13p C terminus encompassing the second highly conserved region is involved in the interaction with Snu17p. In agreement with the fold predictions for Bud13p, equilibrium CD spectra of Bud13p-(202–266) indicated a random coil structure for this part of the protein (Fig. 3B). A Conserved Trp in the C Terminus of Bud13p Is Critical for the Interaction with Snu17p—Among the highly conserved residues at the C terminus of Bud13p, a central Trp (Trp232) stands out (Fig. 5A). Similar conserved tryptophans are found in ULMs (Fig. 6A), where they are crucial for the interaction with UHMs (19Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R.

Biol. 2006; 356: 664-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test the idea that the Bud13p-(202–266) fragment acts like a ULM, using its Trp-containing motif to associate with Snu17p, we mutated Trp232 of Bud13p to alanine and analyzed heterodimer formation in mixtures of Snu17p with either an excess of the wild type Bud13p C-terminal fragment (Bud13p-(202–266)) or the mutated fragment (Bud13p-(202–266) (W232A)) by analytical gel filtration. Whereas a stable interaction was observed between wild type Bud13p-(202–266) and Snu17p, the W232A substitution completely abrogated binding of the fragment to Snu17p (Fig. 6B). Thus, Trp232 of Bud13p represents a critical latching point for interaction with Snu17p, reminiscent of UHM-ULM interactions. Known UHMs sequester the Trp residue of the bound ULMs in a hydrophobic pocket between their two α-helices. In order to test whether Snu17p positions Trp232 of Bud13p in a similar environment, we monitored the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of a chemically synthesized Bud13p peptide encompassing residues 222–242 upon interaction with Snu17p-(25–106) (the latter protein does not contain a Trp). Unbound Bud13p-(222–242) showed an emission maximum at 355 nm, which shifted to 345 nm upon the addition of equimolar amounts of Snu17p-(25–106) (Fig. 6C). In addition to the blue shift, the fluorescence quantum yield increased upon complex formation (Fig. 6C). These spectral changes are consistent with the transfer of Bud13p Trp232 from a polar (aqueous) to a nonpolar (proteinaceous) environment, again supporting a UHM·ULM-type binding mode between Snu17p and Bud13p. The N Terminus of Pml1p Is Required for Snu17p Binding—To address the question of which part of Pml1p mediates interaction with Snu17p, we engineered various N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of Pml1p (Fig. 7A) and tested their binding to recombinant GST-Snu17p in pull-down assays.

https://openalex.org/W2087082654,"Previous studies have indicated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can modulate the Wnt pathway in virus-infected cells and this effect is mediated by EBV-encoded oncogene latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Here we have reassessed the role of LMP1 in regulating the expression of various mediators of the canonical Wnt cascade. Contradicting the previous finding, we found that the levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3ss (GSK3beta), axin and alpha-catenin were not affected by the expression of LMP1 sequences from normal B cells or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Moreover, we also show that LMP1 expression had no detectable effect on the E-cadherin and beta-catenin interaction and did not induce transcriptional activation of beta-catenin. Taken together these studies demonstrate that EBV-mediated activation of Wnt pathway is not dependent on the expression of LMP1."
https://openalex.org/W1965194519,"Background The study of P element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, “TAS”) has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. TSE can show variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as an epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin and RNA silencing pathways. Principal Findings Here, we analyze phenotypic and genetic properties of TSE. We report that TSE does not occur in the soma at the adult stage, but appears restricted to the female germline. It is detectable during development at the third instar larvae where it presents the same tissue specificity and maternal effect as in adults. Transgenes located in TAS at the telomeres of the main chromosomes can be silencers which in each case show the maternal effect. Silencers located at non-homologous telomeres functionally interact since they stimulate each other via the maternally-transmitted component. All germinally-expressed euchromatic transgenes tested, located on all major chromosomes, were found to be repressed by a telomeric silencer: thus we detected no TSE escaper. The presence of the euchromatic target transgene is not necessary to establish the maternal inheritance of TSE, responsible for its epigenetic behavior. A single telomeric silencer locus can simultaneously repress two P-lacZ targets located on different chromosomal arms. Conclusions and Significance Therefore TSE appears to be a widespread phenomenon which can involve different telomeres and work across the genome. It can explain the P cytotype establishment by telomeric P elements in natural Drosophila populations."
https://openalex.org/W2131305647,"One of the new expanding areas in functional genomics is metabolomics: measuring the metabolome of an organism. Data being generated in metabolomics studies are very diverse in nature depending on the design underlying the experiment. Traditionally, variation in measurements is conceptually broken down in systematic variation and noise where the latter contains, e.g. technical variation. There is increasing evidence that this distinction does not hold (or is too simple) for metabolomics data. A more useful distinction is in terms of informative and non-informative variation where informative relates to the problem being studied. In most common methods for analyzing metabolomics (or any other high-dimensional x-omics) data this distinction is ignored thereby severely hampering the results of the analysis. This leads to poorly interpretable models and may even obscure the relevant biological information. We developed a framework from first data analysis principles by explicitly formulating the problem of analyzing metabolomics data in terms of informative and non-informative parts. This framework allows for flexible interactions with the biologists involved in formulating prior knowledge of underlying structures. The basic idea is that the informative parts of the complex metabolomics data are approximated by simple components with a biological meaning, e.g. in terms of metabolic pathways or their regulation. Hence, we termed the framework 'simplivariate models' which constitutes a new way of looking at metabolomics data. The framework is given in its full generality and exemplified with two methods, IDR analysis and plaid modeling, that fit into the framework. Using this strategy of 'divide and conquer', we show that meaningful simplivariate models can be obtained using a real-life microbial metabolomics data set. For instance, one of the simple components contained all the measured intermediates of the Krebs cycle of E. coli. Moreover, these simplivariate models were able to uncover regulatory mechanisms present in the phenylalanine biosynthesis route of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2054799076,"Conditional gene targeting using the Cre-loxp system is a well established technique in numerous in vitro and in vivo systems. Ligand regulated forms of Cre have been increasingly used in these applications in order to gain temporal and spatial control over conditional targeting. The tamoxifen-regulated Cre variant mer-Cre-mer (mCrem) is widely utilized because of its reputation for tight regulation in the absence of its tamoxifen ligand. In the DT40 chicken B cell line, we generated an mCrem-based reversible switch for conditional regulation of a transgene, and in contrast with previous work, observed significant constitutive activity of mCrem. This prompted us to use our system for analysis of the parameters governing tamoxifen-regulated mCrem recombination of a genomic target. We find that robust mCrem expression correlates with a high level of tamoxifen-independent Cre activity, while clones expressing mCrem at the limit of western blot detection exhibit extremely tight regulation. We also observe time and dose-dependent effects on mCrem activity which suggest limitations on the use of conditional targeting approaches for applications which require tight temporal coordination of Cre action within a cell population."
