https://openalex.org/W1583133549,"Abstract Treatment of skeletal muscle microsomes with phospholipase C inhibits the adenosine triphosphatase activity and calcium transport, parallel with the selective hydrolysis of membrane lecithin. The ATPase activity of phospholipase C-treated microsomes is reactivated by synthetic lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidic acid, and nonionic and anionic detergents. The reactivation of the calcium transport of phospholipase C-treated microsomes requires lecithin, lysolecithin, or phosphatidic acid. Detergents are ineffective. The activating effect of phospholipids on the ATPase activity and calcium transport is accompanied by tight binding of phospholipids to the microsomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1513079043,"Abstract A 32Pi-ATP exchange was found to take place under conditions previously reported to induce a Mg++-dependent ATPase in chloroplasts. With tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, light and dithiothreitol were required for the induction of both ATPase and 32Pi-ATP exchange. With tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine buffer, however, dithiothreitol caused a marked activation of both reactions in the complete absence of light, although both light and pyocyanine further enhanced the activation of ATPase. These results are interpreted as an acceleration by light of the process that dithiothreitol can accomplish in the dark. In resolved subchloroplast particles coupling factor was required for maximal light- and dithiothreitol-induced Mg++-dependent ATPase. Dithiothreitol induced a Ca++-dependent ATPase in the soluble coupling factor, but not in chloroplasts. However, an active Ca++-dependent ATPase could be extracted with ethylenediaminetetraacetate from chloroplasts that were treated with dithiothreitol. The active ATPase thus extracted was inhibited when added to chloroplasts deficient in coupling factor. These results show that dithiothreitol modifies the coupling factor in situ, and this is likely to be in part responsible for the activation of Mg++-dependent ATPase and of 32Pi-ATP exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1572315545,Abstract A soluble adenosine triphosphatase was obtained from skeletal muscle microsomes by extraction with deoxycholate. The Mg++-moderated soluble microsomal ATPase is activated 10- to 20-fold by 10-5 m Ca++ and inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)tetraacetate. Spontaneous formation of microsomal vesicles from solubilized microsomes occurs on removal of deoxycholate by dilution with water or Sephadex chromatography. The soluble ATPase preparations contain phospholipids in amounts comparable to the intact microsomes and treatment with phospholipase C causes an inhibition of the ATPase activity. The inhibition of ATPase activity and Ca++ transport of regenerated microsomes by phospholipase C can be reversed with the addition of synthetic lecithin and lysolecithin. Electrophoretic separation of solubilized microsomal components causes reversible inactivation of ATPase. Trypsin treatment causes the rapid release of proteins from microsomes accompanied by decreased turbidity and an activation of ATPase activity.
https://openalex.org/W1510897113,"Abstract Treatment of fragmented preparations of sarcoplasmic reticulum with diethyl ether decreases the calcium uptake capacity of reticulum, while the ATP-binding capacity as well as the ATP-splitting activity of reticulum were increased. Diethyl ether-treated reticulum preparations retained both the and the splitting activities of Hasselbach and Makinose, although the latter activity was uncoupled from the calcium uptake activity. Taking advantage of the fact that calcium-dependent ATP splitting, namely, the extra splitting of ether-treated reticulum, is not confined in a short period of calcium uptake process, the following kinetic characteristics at 25° were obtained. In the presence of an optimal concentration of calcium, the half-maximal activation of the extra splitting by magnesium was obtained with 0.1 mm added MgCl2. Overoptimal concentrations of calcium exerted a competitive inhibition. The plot of the extra splitting activity as a function of ATP concentration showed two discrete steps, which suggest two different calcium-dependent activities; their Michaelis-Menten constants are 10 µm and g1 mm, and their maximal activities are 1.7 and g0.6 µmoles of phosphate liberated per min per mg of reticulum protein. The ATP splitting by ether-treated preparations of reticulum in the presence of 1,2-bis-(2-dicarboxy methylaminoethoxy)ethane with no added calcium, namely, the basal splitting, occurred at ATP concentrations about the same as those for the second step in the extra splitting, but its activity was too small to account for the activity in the second step. On the other hand, the calcium uptake by nontreated preparations of reticulum also showed two steps as the ATP concentration increased; the first step occurred at ATP concentrations about one-tenth of those for the ATP-splitting activity mentioned above, but the second step occurred at about the same concentrations as those for the ATP splitting."
https://openalex.org/W1555106244,"Abstract Heparitin sulfate isolated from human aorta is a polysaccharide of molecular weight 24,000 to 29,000, which is bound to protein by way of serine. The presence of serine, xylose, and galactose in a molar ratio of 1:1:2 suggests that the linkage region of this mucopolysaccharide is similar to that in chondroitin 4-sulfate and in heparin. Structural studies with nitrous acid indicate that the heparitin sulfate molecule contains a relatively large segment of N-acetylglucosamine-uronic acid repeating units in the region of protein binding. Heparitin sulfate isolated from the livers and urine of patients with the Hurler's syndrome is heterogenous and contains materials ranging in molecular weight from 2,700 to 5,500. Two distinct fractions were isolated, which differed in chemical analyses, amino acid composition, and structural characteristics. It is suggested that these may represent segments of a single parent molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1579595056,"Abstract Difference spectra induced by ATP and its analogues of the ultraviolet absorption of heavy meromyosin around 280 mµ were measured by the double cell method. The difference spectrum induced by ATP showed two peaks, at 281 and 289 mµ, and a shoulder near 300 mµ. The maximum value of the difference molar extinction coefficient, ΔE, at 289 mµ, was 5000 ± 300 m-1 cm-1. The difference spectrum caused by ATP near 290 mµ decreased with time after its addition and reached the same value as that induced by ADP. The difference spectrum attributable to ADP showed two peaks at 280 and 288 mµ, but the shoulder near 300 mµ was scarcely observable. The maximum value of ΔE at 288 mµ was 2700 ± 600 m-1 cm-1. AMP, adenosine, adenine, and d-ribose induced slight but detectable difference spectra of heavy meromyosin. Pyrophosphate and sodium triphosphate induced difference spectra similar in shape to that of ADP, but the values of ΔE at 287 mµ were only about 1500 m-1 cm-1. The difference optical density at 288 mµ was measured as a function of ADP concentration in the presence of 0.06 m KCl and 8.3 mm MgCl2. The unit weight of heavy meromyosin was calculated to be 3.65 x 105, after determining the minimum ADP concentration needed to give a maximum spectral change. The decay of change in difference optical density, ΔO.D., induced by ATP was measured as a function of time at a fixed wave length. The initial velocity of steady state ATPase of heavy meromyosin was measured by the pH-stat method, and the rate constant of the step from the enzyme-substrate complex to the products, k2, was evaluated. The decay of ΔO.D. was found to agree well with that expected for the enzyme-substrate complex over a wide range of concentrations of KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2."

Most other birds do not retain seeds as long. There is evidence that seeds of many species can remain viable in the intestinal tract of some shorebirds long enough to be transported several thousand miles."
https://openalex.org/W1590801050,"Abstract The presence of d-glucuronic acid in dermatan sulfate preparations has previously been reported from several laboratories. It has not been clear whether the d-glucuronic acid represents a contamination with another polymer or whether it is actually part of the dermatan sulfate molecule. The present studies were undertaken in order to evaluate this problem more definitively. It is demonstrated that highly purified dermatan sulfate is partially degraded by testicular hyaluronidase yielding polysaccharide fragments with d-glucuronic acid in the newly formed nonreducing termini. The conclusion is therefore reached that d-glucuronic acid is an integral part of the dermatan sulfate molecule. As a result of the presence of hyaluronidase-susceptible linkages to d-glucuronic acid residues in the close vicinity of the polysaccharide-bound peptide, a large proportion of the polysaccharide fragments reisolated after enzyme treatment are devoid of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1970940480,"Investigations using housefly mitochondria revealed several salicylanilide derivatives as the most effective uncoupling agents of oxidative phosphorylation reported so far. Even greater inhibition of the associated P(i)-adenosine triphosphate exchange was shown with these compounds in both housefly and rat-liver mitochondria, and close similarity was observed between the two types of organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1547943167,"Abstract The activation of human plasminogen in a 25% glycerol medium was carried out with low molar ratios of urokinase, streptokinase, trypsin, and pig heart activator. Starch gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea at pH 3.2 showed that each of the four plasmins possessed the same electrophoretic mobility. Upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol in 8 m urea, each plasmin was found to contain two major, electrophoretically unique components. Determination of the aminoterminal and the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of these plasmins indicated, in accordance with our previous studies, that the activation of human plasminogen proceeds primarily through the cleavage of a single arginyl-valine bond. Each of the plasmins contains two polypeptide chains connected by a disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1516389760,"1. Steroid induction of porphyrin synthesis in liver cell culture is, in its time of onset and course of development, in all respects similar to the induction process evoked by certain foreign chemicals and drugs. Steroids and foreign chemicals have additive-inducing effects when added to cultures in suboptimal amounts; however, when added in individually optimal amounts, the intensity of induction is not enhanced nor is its latent period shortened. These results suggest that natural steroids and porphyria-inducing drugs act at the same intracellular site or sites. 2. Actinomycin D, mitomycin C, puromycin, acetoxycyclo-heximide, and other agents which inhibit nucleic acid and protein synthesis block the porphyrin-inducing effect of natural steroids. These results are consistent with the view that steroids, like porphyria-inducing drugs, stimulate porphyrinogenesis by inducing the formation de novo of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis. 3. Certain metalloporphyrins, including iron-protoporphyrin orч eme, inhibit the steroid-induction process. The ability of heme to block steroid induction supports the idea that heme and natural steroids may compete for a binding site on a hypothetical repressor protein which ultimately regulates the activity of the structural gene which codes for δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. 4. Uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid also blocks porphyrin induction by steroids. The blocking effect of UDP-glucuronic acid is considered to reflect the enhanced conversion of free steroid inducers to the glucuronidated or inactive derivatives. It is postulated that the ability of large amounts of glucose to inhibit the porphyric process in vivo reflects, in part or in whole, conversion of this sugar to UDP-glucuronic acid, resulting in enhanced glucuronidation and inactivation of inducing substances. 5. The clinical implications of this steroid action on the liver are discussed, and a working hypothesis on the mechanism of steroid control of porphyrin and heme synthesis is proposed. It is considered likely that endogenously derived inducing steroids are the physiological agents which account for the periodic, spontaneous, i.e. not drug related, exacerbations of hepatic porphyria in certain patients carrying the genetic lesion of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1542948093,"Abstract Electrophorus microsomal (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is inhibited by arsenite. The arsenite concentration which produces 50% inhibition is reduced from 6 mm to 0.1 mm by the addition of equimolar 2,3-dimercaptopropanol. An excess of this dithiol reverses the inhibition. Neither 2-mercaptoethanol nor dithiothreitol potentiate arsenite inhibition to a comparable extent. The microsomes are phosphorylated by AT32P: the extent of phosphorylation is Na+-dependent and reduced by K+. In the presence of equimolar arsenite and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, the concentration of Na+ which produces half-maximal phosphorylation is decreased from 4 mm to 0.8 mm. K+ does not decrease the phosphorylation of the inhibited enzyme. The effects of British anti-Lewisite-arsenite on phosphorylation are accompanied by activation of Na+-dependent ATP-ADP transphosphorylation similar to that previously observed to attend the inhibition of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by N-ethylmaleimide. These observations can be interpreted in terms of the existence of two states of the enzyme with different ligand affinities."

https://openalex.org/W1571937234,"Abstract The structure of the carbohydrate moiety of old human rib cartilage keratosulfate (KS II) was investigated by methylation of the mucopolysaccharide and its desulfated analogue. The methods used were identical with those used previously for cornea keratosulfate. The methyl ethers were characterized either as crystalline derivatives or by paper, thin layer, or gas-liquid chromatography. The data are interpreted as a repeating unit of N-acetyllactosamine polymerized via 1 → 3-linkages to the galactose. Position 6 of N-acetylglucosamine or d-galactose, or both, is esterified with sulfate. The polysaccharide appears to be more highly branched than that from cornea. Furthermore, d-mannose was isolated from KS II and characterized. Mannose was also found in corneal and other keratosulfates. Catalytic desulfation in methanol yielded two high molecular weight desulfated products, one insoluble in aqueous solvents but soluble in formamide, and the other soluble in water. In addition to sialic acid and l-fucose, some d-galactose was released by methanolysis during the desulfation."
https://openalex.org/W2068266460,Epidemiologic studies of blood lead levels in general and occupational groups show a logarithmic regression on estimated atmospheric exposure. Experimental results at the same and higher levels show a dose-response relationship which fits the same regression. The data imply that long-term increases in atmospheric lead will result in predictably higher blood lead levels in the exposed populations.
https://openalex.org/W1575646741,"Abstract The products obtained after digestion of dermatan sulfate with testicular hyaluronidase have been investigated. Stepwise precipitation with ethanol (18, 25, 40, and 50%) and gel filtration of the material soluble in 50% ethanol yielded a number of polysaccharide and oligosaccharide fractions, ranging in molecular weight from 500 (disaccharide) to 16,000. Analysis of a tetrasaccharide fraction which contained both d-glucuronic and l-iduronic acid demonstrated that it was a mixture of chondroitin 4-sulfate tetrasaccharide and a hybrid tetrasaccharide of the following structure: [see PDF for equation] An analogous, unsulfated tetrasaccharide was found in an acid hydrolysate of dermatan sulfate. Besides its oligosaccharide components, the hyaluronidase digest also contained glycopeptides, presumably derived from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region."

https://openalex.org/W1592447847,"Abstract The S-carboxymethyl β chain derivative from both moderately reduced urokinase-activated plasmin and extensively reduced streptokinase-activated plasmin was separated in a highly purified form by gel filtration through Sephadex G-200. Electrophoresis in urea-starch gel systems at pH 3.2 showed that the faster moving β electrophoretic component was the light chain derivative. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, of this derivative was found to be 1.4 S. The apparent molecular weight was found by sedimentation equilibrium analysis with absorption optics to be 25,700. The apparent molecular weight of the S-carboxymethyl heavy chain derivative was found to be approximately 57,200. Carboxyl-terminal amino acid analysis with carboxypeptidases A and B showed that asparagine was the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the light chain and indicated that arginine must be the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the heavy chain. Incorporation of 1.18 ± 0.08 moles of DFP-32P per mole of human plasmin indicated a single proteolytic site. Starch gel electrophoresis and Sephadex gel filtration experiments both showed that the proteolytic active site of human plasmin is located on the light chain. The amino acid compositions of the S-carboxymethyl light chain derivatives of both urokinase-activated plasmin and streptokinase-activated plasmin were found to be almost identical, confirming the specificity of the activation of human plasminogen to plasmin by both urokinase and streptokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1538840751,"Abstract The inhibitory effects of the antibiotics ossamycin, peliomycin, and venturicidin on oxidative phosphorylation and on related reactions in rat liver mitochondria have been studied and have been compared to inhibitory properties of rutamycin, a member of the oligomycin family. Peliomycin, ossamycin, and rutamycin are qualitatively alike in their inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and the ATPase reactions induced by various agents. On a weight basis, peliomycin and rutamycin are equally effective, but two to four times as much ossamycin is required for equivalent inhibition. Venturicidin was found to have inhibitory properties principally similar to rutamycin, but differed in that it failed, even at high concentrations, to inhibit completely the coupled phosphorylation in mitochondria. At low concentrations, venturicidin was less effective than rutamycin in inhibiting the ATPase reactions induced by dinitrophenol, valinomycin, or tricyanoaminopropene, but at higher concentrations it inhibited these ATPases as completely as rutamycin. The effects of partially inhibitory amounts of rutamycin and venturicidin were found to be at least additive, and it is concluded that these two antibiotics act at the same site."

The purified enzyme retains all the allosteric features observed for partially purified preparations of yeast phosphofructokinase. In contrast to mammalian phosphofructokinase, the yeast enzyme sediments as a single boundary with an s020,w of 17.8 S. The molecular weight was determined to be 5.84 ± 0.21 x 105 from sedimentation equilibrium measurements. The Michaelis constants of the substrates, the pH optima for catalysis, and the ultraviolet absorbance and electrophoretic properties of the purified enzyme are reported."

https://openalex.org/W1523726619,"A microsomal preparation from heparin-synthesizing mouse mast cell tumors was previously shown to catalyze incorporation of sulfate-35S into endogenous material identified as heparin, and to catalyze the formation of an N-acetylated glycosaminoglycan related to heparin. This same preparation has now been shown to catalyze the incorporation of sulfate-35S into the newly formed glycosaminoglycan. The over-all degree of sulfation of this glycosaminoglycan is greater than 1 sulfate for each disaccharide repeating unit. Some of the glycosaminoglycan appears by its anionic nature to have a sulfate content similar to heparin, while some remains relatively nonsulfated. The incorporation of sulfate into the glycosaminoglycan can take place to the same degree both during polymerization or subsequent to the formation of the complete polysaccharide chain. Glycosaminoglycan polymerization thus appears to take place in close proximity to sulfation. The resulting sulfated glycosaminoglycan remains bound to the same particulate preparation that catalyzes the glycosaminoglycan formation."
https://openalex.org/W1595926874,"Abstract Deacetylation of an N-acetylated glycosaminoglycan related to heparin is described in the presence of a microsomal preparation from mouse mast cell tumors. This N-deacetylation occurs when 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate is present during active glycosaminoglycan polymerization or when 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate is added subsequent to glycosaminoglycan polymerization. Loss of N-acetyl corresponds to 30 to 50% of the original N-acetylglucosamine moieties, and the product appears to be N-sulfated to the same degree as it is N-deacetylated. Thus the N-acetylated glycosaminoglycan previously described is shown to be a precursor for N-sulfated glycosaminoglycan indistinguishable from heparin. The reaction takes place in the presence of the same microsomal preparation that has previously been shown to catalyze glycosaminoglycan polymerization and sulfate incorporation, indicating a probable proximity of these reactions within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1537712640,"Abstract Control properties of the glycolytic system in the perfused rat heart have been investigated with the aid of metabolic inhibitors. Iodoacetamide was used to study the deviations from equilibrium of reactions prior to the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase step. Fructose-1,6-di-P and triose phosphate levels in hearts perfused with glucose and insulin increased 3-fold after 15 min of exposure to iodoacetamide, but thereafter accumulated at a 50-fold greater rate. After 30 min, the mass action ratio of the phosphofructokinase reaction increased 350-fold, but remained two orders of magnitude displaced from the calculated equilibrium constant. As glycolytic flux decreased, the ratio of glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P decreased from 4.9 in control hearts to 3.9 in iodoacetamide-poisoned hearts, and the ratio of dihydroxyacetone-P to glyceraldehyde-3-P increased from 5.5 to 8.5, compared with equilibrium constants of 3.3 and 25 for phosphoglucose isomerase and triose-P isomerase. Fluoroacetate, added to rats in vivo or to perfused hearts in vitro, was used to investigate the effect of elevated tissue citrate levels on phosphofructokinase activity. Intraperitoneal injection of fluoroacetate to rats increased cardiac citrate 60-fold to 33 µmoles per g, dry wt, after 30 min. Phosphofructokinase activity was depressed in hearts from fluoroacetate-poisoned rats perfused with glucose and insulin, as evidenced by a rise of hexose monophosphates and a fall of fructose-1,6-di-P. Addition of fluoroacetate (0.2 to 1 mm) to the perfusion medium of hearts from normal rats, however, produced an activation of phosphofructokinase, despite a 17-fold rise of citrate. Creatine phosphate levels fell rapidly in these hearts, and increases of inorganic phosphate, ADP, and AMP overcame the inhibitory effect of citrate at the phosphofructokinase site. The high citrate levels induced by fluoroacetate prevented full activation of glycolysis during anoxia, and heart contractions ceased rapidly. These experiments provide evidence that, although citrate is an effective modulator of phosphofructokinase activity in the intact heart, its inhibitory effect is antagonized by inorganic phosphate. Pyruvate had a beneficial effect on cardiac contractility in the presence of fluoroacetate under aerobic conditions. Changes in the intermediates of the citric acid cycle indicated that this effect was caused by enhanced production of oxalacetate and malate, thereby allowing citrate to accumulate so that it could compete effectively with fluorocitrate at the aconitase site. It is suggested that the species and organ difference noted in the effects of fluoroacetate are due to an interplay between citrate inhibition of phosphofructokinase, which curtails the supply of dicarboxylic acids to the Krebs cycle, and inhibition of the cycle itself by the relative concentrations of citrate and fluorocitrate at the aconitase site."

https://openalex.org/W2047596276,"Administration of estradiol to ovariectomized rats induced new synthesis of uterine hexokinase which was prevented by actinomycin D, 5-fluorouracil, cycloheximide, or ethionine. The estradiol-induced increase in uterine hexokinase activity was detectable as early as 4 hours. The increase in enzyme activity was dependent upon the dose of the hormone. The evidence indicates that the increased hexokinase activity induced by 17beta-estradiol may entail an acceleration of the synthesis of certain RNA species."

https://openalex.org/W1571572841,Abstract Bovine plasminogen activator preparations were isolated at 0° and 25° from a mixture of streptokinase and human plasminogen. The degree of incorporation and inhibition with radioactive 32P-labeled diisopropyl phosphofluoridate (DFP) demonstrated a definite difference between these two preparations. Incorporation of approximately 1 mole of DFP-32P per mole of bovine plasminogen activator prepared at 25° and per mole of human plasmin indicated that bovine plasminogen activator and human plasmin each contains a single active site which may be identical. Incorporation of 0.50 mole of DFP-32P per mole of bovine plasminogen activator prepared at 0° and its retention of partial activity indicated that this activator preparation was partly a human plasminogen-streptokinase complex. Acid treatment of this preparation and inhibition studies with e-aminocaproic acid also indicated that this preparation contains a plasminogen-streptokinase complex. Complex formation also occurred when streptokinase was allowed to react with DFP-32P-treated human plasminogen and plasmin. Starch gel electrophoretic analyses indicated that all the complexes formed under these conditions possessed the same mobility. Dissociation of the 25° activator complex inhibited with DFP-32P after its isolation revealed that the radioactivity was located in the plasmin moiety of the activator complex.
https://openalex.org/W1515285740,"Abstract The sulfate acceptor present in boiled, dialyzed preparations of the 105,000 x g supernatant obtained from chick embryo cartilage was purified and characterized. Pretreatment of this supernatant with Pronase or alkali resulted in increased sulfate incorporation, while hyaluronidase treatment abolished or markedly reduced sulfate incorporation. The acceptor was purified by protamine chloride precipitation, Pronase digestion, and fractionation on Ecteola cellulose and Sephadex G-50. Ecteola fractionation and electrophoresis showed the most active acceptor fractions to be slightly deficient in sulfate, whereas Sephadex fractionation showed acceptor ability to be relatively independent of molecular size. This acceptor thus appears to be a molecule of the chondroitin sulfate type, the ability of which to accept sulfate is strongly influenced by its charge properties, but not by molecular size. A mechanism of sulfation was proposed, which is in agreement with the data and which involves sulfation occurring concurrently with polysaccharide elongation. Acid hydrolysis of the 35SO4=-labeled acceptor indicated that the primary site of sulfation was an axial hydroxyl group, which in this case would be at position 4 of the N-acetylgalactosamine moiety. However, pretreatment of acceptor with Pronase or alkali resulted in sulfation predominantly of an equatorial hydroxyl. Thus, it is possible that in the native proteinpolysaccharide complex the conformation might be such that the 4-positions of the acetylgalactosamine residues are most readily available to the sulfotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1523892357,"Abstract A detailed kinetic analysis of the changes of the glycolytic intermediates has been made in the main electric organ of Electrophorus electricus during periods of electrical discharge and recovery. Discharge of the organ was elicited by electrical stimulation and was associated with a transient increase in the levels of the glycolytic intermediates and the utilization of endogenous ATP and creatine phosphate. The high energy reserves were partially replenished during recovery by increased glycolytic activity. Principal sites of control in the glycolytic pathway were identified at phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase. Glycogen utilization was induced by a prompt increase in the active form of phosphorylase b kinase. Increases of phosphorylase a and glucose-1-P followed in turn after a brief delay. The increased rate of input of hexose phosphates to the glycolytic pathway was accommodated by concurrent activation of phosphofructokinase, and the levels of glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P either remained approximately constant or diminished while fructose-1,6-di-P levels increased greatly. The activated glycolytic flux was subsequently switched off by inhibition of phosphofructokinase, as evidenced by increases in the levels of glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P and a decrease in the level of fructose-1,6-di-P. Glycogenolysis was curtailed by the reconversion of phosphorylase a to phosphorylase b. The kinetics of the metabolic changes during different times of discharge indicate that phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase are regulated by separate mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1977214621,"The relationship between the (Na(+) and K(+))-activated adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system implicated in sodium-transport by cell membranes and the calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase, which is generally associated with calcium uptake, was examined in microsomes from skeletal muscle. Whereas sodium and potassium did not modify the relatively low adenosine triphosphatase activity seen in the absence of calcium, a pattern similar to that of the sodium-transport enzyme system was seen afer the addition of CaCl(2). The calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase was stimulated equally by sodium or potassium alone, but both the rate and extent of calcium uptake were enhanced more by potassium than by sodium at concentrations below 0.12 mole per liter. In the absence of either of these ions addition of calcium failed to activate adenosine triphosphatase although significant amounts of calcium were taken up by the microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1516519872,"Abstract Data are presented on some further characteristics of the chloroplast ATP hydrolysis induced by a combination of sulfhydryl compounds and a transition from acid to base. These studies include questions of substrate specificity and stoichiometry of the hydrolysis, Mg++ and dithiothreitol concentration requirements, the effect of uncouplers, and the need for a distinct pH difference between the two stages. The evidence is consistent with a close similarity between the acid-base-induced ATPase and the light-requiring counterpart, and in turn suggests that a proton gradient formed in the light may be the basis for the light-induced ATPase activation. It was found that the acid to base transition induced a 32Pi-ATP exchange reaction as well as ATP hydrolysis. This exchange is not activated by sulfhydryl compounds, and its rate is only a small fraction of that of ATP hydrolysis. The significance of this finding for a postulated sequence for ATP hydrolysis is discussed."
