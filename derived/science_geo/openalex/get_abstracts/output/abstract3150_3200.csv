https://openalex.org/W1531031204,"Temperature-dependent techniques (differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing microscopy, and x-ray scattering and diffraction techniques) were used to compare the properties of human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) with its extracted lipid classes. Three types of thermal transitions were characterized: (a) a reversible transition in intact LDL near body temperature associated with a liquid crystalline order-disorder phase change of cholesterol esters within the particles; (b) an irreversible high temperature transition (approximately 70-90 degrees) associated with LDL denaturation and release of cholesterol esters from the disrupted particles; and (c) low temperature transitions related to liquid crystalline and crystalline phase changes in these released esters. The temperature of the reversible transition in intact LDL varies among individual donors. Correlation analysis shows that the temperature of this transition negatively correlates with the amount of triglyceride relative to cholesterol ester in LDL. Studies on mixtures of cholesterol esters and triglycerides isolated from LDL show a similar effect, increasing amounts of triglycerides decreasing the temperature of the liquid leads to smectic liquid crystalline transition of the isolated esters. Thus, the amount of triglyceride in LDL influences the fluidity of the cholesterol esters in LDL. The enthalpy of the reversible transition in intact LDL is 0.69 cal/g of LDL cholesterol ester. This compares with 0.89 cal/g for the liquid leads to liquid crystalline transition of the cholesterol esters released from denatured LDL and 1.01 cal/g for the same transition in the extracted esters. Unlike the cholesterol esters released from denatured LDL, or isolated LDL esters, cholesterol ester in the intact LDL particle does not crystallize. These findings suggest that the behavior of cholesterol esters in intact LDL is constrained relative to their behavior when freed from the restrictions of the particle. These results together with experiments on partitioning of the individual lipid classes of LDL allow us to define the distribution and interaction of lipids in the intact LDL particle."

The crystals, space group P43, have 2 independent cytochrome molecules in the asymmetric repeating unit. No significant difference is seen between these 2 molecules, aside from conformations of a few surface side chains. The molecular folding observed is essentially that reported for tuna ferrocytochrome c. In particular, the ring of phenylalanine 83 lies against the heme group and closes the heme crevice, and is not swung out into the surroundings as had been believed from the 2.8 A horse ferricytochrome c structure."
https://openalex.org/W1574171361,"Ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli consists of two nonidentical subunits, proteins B1 and B2. The active site of the enzyme is made up from both subunits. Protein B2 contributes inter alia an organic free radical which gives a characteristic EPR signal. This radical was now located by isotope substitution experiments to the beta position of a tyrosine residue. The EPR spectrum of protein B2 from bacteria grown in a completely deuterated medium was drastically changed. The change was reversed by the addition of other protonated amino acids. The involvement in radical formation of the beta position of tyrosine was demonstrated from EPR spectra of protein B2 from bacteria grown in the presence of specifically deuterated tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1548978317,"In liver cells isolated from fed female rats, glucagon (290nM) increased adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) content and decreased cyclic AMP binding 30 s after addition of hormones. Both returned to control values after 10 min. Glucagon also stimulated cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity at 30 s and decreased protein kinase activity assayed in the presence of 2 muM cyclic AMP at 1 min. Glucagon increased the levels of glycogen phosphorylase a, but there was no change in total glycogen phosphorylase activity. Glucagon increased glycogen phosphorylase a at concentrations considerably less than those required to affect cyclic AMP and protein kinase. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, potentiated the action of glucagon on all variables, but did not increase the maximuM activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Epinephrine (1muM) decreased cyclic AMP binding and increased glycogen phosphorylase a after a 1-min incubation with cells. Although 0.1 muM epinephrine stimulated phosphorylase a, a concentration of 10 muM was required to increase protein kinase activity. 1-Methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine (0.1 mM) potentiated the action of epinephrine on cyclic AMP and protein kinase. (-)-Propranolol (10muM) completely abolished the changes in cyclic AMP binding and protein kinase due to epinephrine (1muM) in the presence of 0.1mM 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, yet inhibited the increase in phosphorylase a by only 14 per cent. Phenylephrine (0.1muM) increased glycogen phosphorylase a, although concentrations as great as 10 muM failed to affect cyclic AMP binding or protein kinase in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Isoproterenol (0.1muM) stimulated phosphorylase and decreased cyclic AMP binding, but only a concentration of 10muM increased protein kinase. 1-Methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine potentiated the action of isoproterenol on cyclic AMP binding and protein kinase, and propranolol reduced the augmentation of glucose release and glycogen phosphorylase activity due to isoproterenol. These data indicate that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents are capable of stimulating glycogenolysis and glycogen phosphorylase a in isolated rat liver cells. Low concentrations of glucagon and beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate glycogen phosphorylase without any detectable increase in cyclic AMP or protein kinase activity. The effects of alpha-adrenergic agents appear to be completely independent of changes in cyclic AMP protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1973412254,"CURRENT research reveals the existence of endogenous peptides in brain1,2 and pituitary tissue3,4, which are presumably derived from lipotropin (LPH) and which have opiate like effects and affinity for opiate receptors (enkephalin1, endorphins5, C-Fragment6). N-terminal peptides of ACTH also have measurable, although much lower, affinity for rat brain receptors in vitro7,8, ACTH and congeners are known to play a crucial role in the acquisition and maintenance of a variety of behaviours in animals and man9,10. Intraventricular but not systematic administration of these peptides elicits a stretching and yawning syndrome11,12. In rats this syndrome is preceded by a display of excessive grooming13,14 and this grooming response can be suppressed by peripheral administration of specific opiate antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone)15. Morphine also induces grooming15 and this observation prompted us to study the effect of LPH fragments on excessive grooming in the rat in the absence and presence of an opiate antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1587842580,"The administration of N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline to fasted-refed rats produces an 8-fold stimulation of the relative rate of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in 90 min, as measured by isotopic immunochemical techniques in vivo. The mechanism of this induction was studied first by using a homologous, noninitiating cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from the liver of fasted-refed, cyclic AMP-treated rats. In such a system, a 5-fold increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthseis is observed at 20 min post-treatment and a 9-fold stimulation at 75 min, indicating a rapid increase in the number of ribosomes engaged in the translation of the enzyme mRNA after exposure to cyclic AMP. The level of functional mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was then assayed in a wheat germ protein-synthesizing system capable of using rat liver mRNA as template. The template activity for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis is greatly increased in the poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from cyclic AMP-induced animals. Both the increase in the capacity of the liver extract for in vitro phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis and the emergence of enzyme mRNA detected in the wheat germ assay are completely prevented by a pretreatment with cordycepin at doses which inhibit the appearance in the cytoplasm of newly synthesized poly(A)-containing RNA. These data demonstrate that the induction of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by cyclic AMP is characterized by the rapid build-up of newly synthesized, actively translated mRNA coding for the enzyme. The messenger accumulation could be due to an increase in the rate of its production or a decrease in the rate of its degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1531461271,"Exercise induces an increase in cytochrome c concentration in skeletal muscle. This adaptation provides an approach to studying the turnover of cytochrome c that avoids the problem of reutilization encountered with isotopic tracers. The half-life of cytochrome c was estimated from the time course of the increase in its concentration to a new, higher, steady state level in response to exercise training, and from the decrease in cytochrome c after cessation of exercise. The half-time of the increase in cytochrome c concentration was approximately 6 days, while the half-time of the decrease was 7 to 8 days in the fast red and slow red types of muscle. The finding that the half-times of the increase and of the decrease in cytochrome c concentration are similar provides evidence that the exercise-induced increase in cytochrome c is due to an increase in its rate of synthesis. These half-times are much shorter than those obtained with isotopic tracers. It had been thought that the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinate is not reutilized. However, the half-time of the decrease in radioactivity of cytochrome c labeled with delta-aminol[14C]levulinate was 45 days, and increased to 60 days in response to exercise, in fast red muscle. The half-time of the decrease in radioactivity of cytochrome c labeled with [(3H)]leucine in gastrocnemius muscle was shorter than with delta-amino[14C]levulinate (18 days compared to 38 days). These results indicate that when delta-amino(14C)levulinate is used to label heme, reutilization is a serious problem in skeletal muscle."

The electrically induced activation of the opiate receptor was produced by a prolonged simulation at 10 hertz and provides the first evidence that an endogenous opiate receptor ligand is released by nerve stimulation. The specificity of the phenomenon was demonstrated by the reversal obtained with the narcotic antagonists naloxone, naltrexone, and GPA 1843; GPA 1847, the (+)-isomer of 1843, did not cause reversal. The model system described should be useful for the study of the storage, synthesis, and release of endorphins."

https://openalex.org/W1482522551,"A cyclic AMP-adenosine binding protein from mouse liver has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and by analytical ultracentrifugation. The binding protein had a Stokes radium of 48 A based on gel chromatography. Both the purified binding protein and the binding activity in fresh cytosol sedimented as 9 S on sucrose gradient centrifugation. The homogeneous protein had a sedimentation coefficient (S20, w) of 8.8 x 10-13 s, as calculated from sedimentation velocity experiments. By use of the Stokes radius and S20, w', the molecular weight was calculated to be 180,000. The protein was composed of polypeptides having the same molecular weight of 45,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and thus appeared to consist of four subunits of equal size. The isoelectric point, pI = 5.7. The binding capacity for cyclic AMP increased by preincubating the receptor protein in the presence of Mg2+ ATP. This process, tentatively termed activation, was studied in some detail and was shown not be be be accompanied by dissociation, aggregation, or phosphorylation of the binding protein. Cyclic AMP was bound to the protein with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.5 x 10-7 M. The binding of cyclic AMP was competitively inhibited by adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP whose inhibition constants were 8 x 10-7 M, 1.2X 10-6 M, 1.5 X 10-6 M, and higher than 5 x 10-6 M respectively. A hyperbolic Scatchard plot was obtained for the binding of adenosine to the activated binding protein, indicating more than one site for adenosine. The binding of adenosine to the site with the highest affinity (Kd=2 x 10-7 M) for this nucleoside was not suppressed by excess cyclic AMP and was thus different from the aforementioned cyclic AMP binding site. Cyclic GMP, GMP, guanosine, cyclic IMP, IMP, and inosine did not inhibit the binding of either cyclic AMP or adenosine. The binding protein had no cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, adenosine deaminase, phosphofructokinase, or protein kinase activities, nor does it inhibit the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1537213106,"Steroidogenesis by Y-1 adrenal tumor cells in culture is stimulated by ATP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (App(NH)), adenosine 5'(beta, alpha-methylene)triphosphate (App(CH2)p), ADP, AMP, NAD, FAD, and adenosine but not by adenine or other nucleoside triphosphates. ATP, App(NH)p, App(CH2)p, and adenosine are active in the micromolar range. Like adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the onset of stimulation is immediate and occurs to the same extent. Also active are 2'- and 5'-deoxyadenosine and 2-chloroadenosine whereas adenine xyloside, L-riboside, or arabinoside have very low activity. Stimulation is accompanied by rounding of the cells. Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine transport, increased the response to low concentrations of adenosine, suggesting that adenosine acts externally. Stimulation of steroidogenesis by adenosine or phosphorylated adenosine compounds fails to occur in the presence of crystalline adenosine deaminase, and the effect of the enzyme on adenosine, ATP, or NAD stimulation is reversed by the competitive inhibitor erythro-9-[3-(nonane-2-ol)]adenine. This suggests that the enzyme acts specifically on adenosine and a requirement for the conversion of the above compounds to adenosine seems probable. The inhibition of cAMP effects by adenosine deaminase suggests that some of its effects are also mediated by conversion to adenosine. Similar stimulation is seen in I-10 Leydig tumor cells, but an ACTH-resistant mutant of Y-1 cells, called OS-3, is relatively resistant to adenosine. Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine stimulate adenylate cyclase in membranes from Y-1 and I-10 cells at concentrations slightly greater than are effective for steroidogenesis. Other nucleosides are ineffective. Like the NH2-terminal 24 residues of adrenocorticotropic hormone (1-24 ACTH), the adenosine effect in Y-1 membranes is rapid and is on the Vmax intercept (versus ATP) and not on the Km. In contrast to steroidogenesis, adenosine is only a partial agonist for adenylate cyclase. It effect occurs in the presence of ITP, GTP, or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). Theophylline inhibits adenosine-stimulated steroidogenesis. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase occurs in the same concentration range but is of the mixed type."

A purification procedure based primarily on the significantly different affinity of the two forms of the enzyme for DEAE-cellulose was developed for the purification of the enzyme from bovine heart. The procedure involves ammonium sulfate fractionation, three chromatographic steps on DEAE-cellulose, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 with a 5000-fold purification over the crude extract. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 120 mumol of cAMP/mg/min, can be activated 5-fold by Ca2+, but is only 80% pure as judged by analytical disc gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme is unstable but can be stabilized by addition of Ca2+ and the protein modulator; this is in contrast to the less pure preparations of Ca2+-activatable phosphodiesterase which are destabilized by the protein modulator in the presence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1537666544,"Studies of phosphorylation in membranes of intact human erythrocytes were performed by incubating erythrocytes in inorganic [32P]phosphate. Analysis of membrane proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a pattern of phosphorylation similar to that observed when ghost membranes were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. Membrane lipid phosphorylation was also similar in intact cells and ghosts. The most heavily phosphorylated lipid, polyphosphoinositide, was closely associated with glycophorin A, the major erythrocyte membrane sialoglycoprotein obtained when the sialoglycoprotein fraction was isolated by the lithium diiodosalicylate-phenol partition procedure. Only 1 molecule of glycophorin A out of every 100 was found to be phosphorylated, and the phosphate exchange occurred specifically in the COOH-terminal intracellular portion of glycophorin A. These studies show that the human erythrocyte can be used as a model for membrane phosphorylation in an intact cell system."

https://openalex.org/W1485747497,"Abstract Previous reports from this laboratory and others have established that both the rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes contain multiple protein kinase and phosphate acceptor activities. We now report that these membranes also contain phosphoryl acceptor sites for the soluble cyclic AMP-dependent and -independent protein kinases from rabbit erythrocytes. The rabbit erythrocyte membrane, which does not contain a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, has at least four polypeptides (Bands 2.1, 2.3, 4.5, and 4.8) which are phosphorylated in the presence of the soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases I, IIa, and IIb isolated from rabbit erythrocyte lysates. The resulting phosphoprotein profile is very similar to that obtained for the cyclic AMP-mediated autophosphorylation of human erythrocyte membranes. The activities of the soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases toward the membranes have been studied at several pH values. Although the substrate specificity of the three kinases is similar, polypeptide 2.3 appears to be phosphorylated to a greater extent by kinase IIa than by I or IIb. This occurs at all pH values studied. Also apparent is that the pH profile for membrane phosphorylation is different from that of histone phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of membrane proteins can also be catalyzed by the soluble erythrocyte casein kinases. These enzymes are not regulated by cyclic nucleotides and can use either ATP or GTP as their phosphoryl donor. Polypeptides 2.1, 2.9, 4.1, 4.5, 4.8, and 5 of both human and rabbit erythrocyte membranes are phosphorylated in the presence of GTP and the casein kinases. This reaction is optimal at pH 7.5. Experiments were performed to determine whether the phosphorylation of the membranes by the soluble and membrane-bound kinases is additive or exclusive. Our results indicate that after maximal autophosphorylation of the erythrocyte membranes, phosphoryl acceptor sites are available to the soluble cyclic AMP-dependent and -independent protein kinases. Furthermore, after maximal phosphorylation of the membranes with one type of soluble kinase, further 32P incorporation can occur as a result of exposure to the other type of soluble kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1530646624,"The complete amino acid sequence of a major apoprotein from white Leghorn hen plasma very low density lipoproteins has been determined. The apoprotein, designated apoVLDL-II, contains two identical polypeptide chains of 82 amino acid residues each which are linked by a single disulfide bond at residue 76. In nonlaying hens or in cockerels, the administration of estrogen dramatically increases the level of plasma triglycer- ides (1, 2). Luskey et al.

https://openalex.org/W1548285607,"Abstract In order to understand the mechanism by which cyclic 3':5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates insulin secretion, cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation was studied in a transplantable hamster islet cell tumor. Single cell suspensions prepared by enzymatic digestion of the tumors released insulin into the incubation media. Glucagon (3 nM to 3 muM) stimulated cellular cAMP accumulation and insulin release in a dose-dependent manner and these effects were enhanced by 1 mM theophylline. 8-Bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8Br-cAMP) (1 mM) increased insulin release. Somatostatin (10 mug/ml) inhibited basal and glucagon or 8Br-cAMP-stimulated insulin release without significantly lowering cellular cAMP in glucagon-stimulated cells. For analysis of phosphoproteins, cells were incubated with carrier-free 32Pi following which lysates were prepared and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of the numerous 32P-labeled protein bands found, only one (P1, Mr = 28,000) displayed a significant increase in 32P incorporation when cells were incubated under conditions that raise the concentration of cellular cAMP. Somatostatin did not affect 32P incorporation into P1 or any other protein band. When cells were incubated with glucagon, an increase in cellular cAMP was evident after 1 min, enhanced 32P incorporation into P1 after 1 to 5 min, and stimulation of insulin release after 5 to 10 min. Analysis of subcellular fractions led to the designation of P1 as a 40 S ribosomal protein. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of 32P-labeled basic ribosomal proteins showed two labeled proteins, P1 and P2, both of which were localized to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Only phosphorylation of P1 was stimulated by cAMP. The cAMP-dependent ribosomal phosphoprotein, P1, may be identical with a ribosomal phosphoprotein demonstrated in a variety of tissues and species. Its physiological role remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1525808193,"Phosphorylase kinase was found to be activated and phosphorylated at 10mM Mg2+ by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed reaction ot much higher levels than observed previously when reactions were carried out in 1 to 2 mM Mg2+ (Cohen, P. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 34, 1; Hayakawa, T., Perkin, J.P., and Krebs, E.G. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 574). That the reaction at 10 mM Mg2+ is protein kinase-catalyzed is supported by several observations: (a) the reaction is facilitated by the addition of protein kinase; (b) the reaction depends on cAMP when protein kinase holoenzyme is uded; (c) the reaction is not inhibited by 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetate which is known to inhibit autoactivation and autophosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase; and (d) the protein inhibitor of protein kinase inhibits this reaction. The phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase seem to occur in two phases. At low Mg2+ only the first phase is manifested and involves the incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate, 1 mol into each of Subunits A and B. At high Mg2+ additional sites are phosphorylated almost exclusively on Subunit A, with phosphate incorporation approaching the final level of 7 to 9 mol. Enzyme activity at high Mg2+ is 2 to 3 times higher than that observed when activation is studied at low Mg2+. The observation that both casein and type II histone are phosphorylated to the same extent at 1 mM and 10 mM Mg2+ suggested that high Mg2+ may be altering the conformation of phosphorylase kinase thus rendering more phosphorylation sites accessible to protein kinase. Since the phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase by either the protein kinase-catalyzed or autocatalytic reaction can result in the incorporation of 7 to 9 mol of phosphate, the finding that only about seven sites become phosphorylated by both mechanisms acting together suggest that activation by these two mechanisms may involve common phosphorylation sites."

Spectra from samples at various degrees of saturation showed that the two subunits bound NO at equal rates. Identical results were observed in 0.1 M phosphate at pH 6.5 and 0.1 M 2,2'-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2''-nitrilotriethanol, 0.1 M NaCl at pH 7.0, both in the presence and absence of inositol hexaphosphate at either buffer condition. At subsaturating levels of NO (less than 60%), or at all levels of saturation in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, it was found that the EPR spectrum of nitrosylhemoglobin varied with the length of time before freezing. This change was characterized by the development of a hyperfine structure at g = 2.01 which appeared with a half-time of approximately 0.4 s. Maxwell and Caughey (Maxwell, J. C., and Caughey, W. S. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 388-395) have attributed this three-line EPR hyperfine structure to the formation of a pentacoordinate ferroheme-NO complex. Corresponding slow changes were observed in the visible absorption spectrum following the binding of low levels of NO to deoxyhemoglobin or inositol hexaphosphate to fully saturated nitrosylhemoglobin. Thus it appears that NO binding to the alpha and beta subunits of deoxyhemoglobin takes place at equal rates and, under conditions favoring the T quaternary state (low saturation, presence of inositol hexaphosphate), a further slow structural change takes place, resulting in the cleavage of the iron--proximal histidine bond."

Oxygen equilibria of the isolated subunit chains were examined over a wide range of temperature using Imai's polarographic method (Imai, K., Morimoto, H., Kotani, M., Watari, H., and Kuroda, M. (1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 200, 189-196). Kinetic properties of their reversible oxygenation were investigated by the temperature jump relaxation method at 16 degrees. Electron paramagnetic resonance characteristics of the molecules in both deoxy and oxy states were studies at 77K. The oxygen affinity of the individual regenerated chains was higher than that of the tetrameric cobalt hemoglobin and was independent of pH. The enthalpy changes of the oxygenation have been determined as -13.8 kcal/mol and -16.8 kcal/mol for the alpha and beta chains, respectively. The rates of oxygenation were similar to those reported for iron hemoglobin chains, whereas those of deoxygenation were about 10(2) times larger. The effects of metal substitution on oxygenation properties of the isolated chains were correlated with the results obtained previously on cobalt hemoglobin and cobalt myoglobin. The EPR spectrum of the oxy alpha chain showed a distinctly narrowed hyperfine structure in comparison with that of the oxy beta chain, indicating that the environment around the paramagnetic center (the bound oxygen) is different between these chains. In the deoxy form, EPR spectra of alpha and beta chains were indistinguishable. These observations suggest that one of the inequivalences between alpha and beta chains might exist near the distal histidine group."

https://openalex.org/W1579166817,"Spin-labeled hydroxyamphetamine, a competitive reversible inhibitor of brain monoamine oxidase, has been shown to be useful as an electron spin resonance (ESR) probe of the microenvironment of the active sites of the possible monoamine oxidase multiple forms. The ESR spectrum of spin-labeled hydroxyamphetamine was strongly quenched upon binding to the enzyme. The conformation of the active site of rat brain monoamine oxidase existing in various physical states, i.e. monoamine oxidase in situ (intact brain mitochondria), crude solubilized monoamine oxidase (MAOS) and isolated monoamine oxidase fractions (MAOa and MAOb) were critically and systematically examined. Nonlinear least squares regression analyses have been used to fit the binding data (obtained at room temperature with varying spin-labeled hydroxyamphetamine concentrations) to three groups of independent noninteracting ligand-binding models. A Gibbs-Helmholtz relationship was applied to the interpretation of the measured apparent association constant K as a function of temperature ranging from 4-50 degrees with increments of 2 degreesmfrom the extracted intensive parameters, k (intrinsic association constant) and deltaF (intrinsic free energy), as well as the apparent heat, deltaH, it was clear that the microenvironment of the binding sites existing in the more purified enzyme fractions MAOa and MAOb were similar to those found in the crude solubilized enzyme. More importantly, they correlated well with the conformation of the sites characterized in situ. The data suggested that the microenvironment of this multienzyme system was unperturbed in spite of the treatment due to the isolation process. In terms of the composition of binding sites, MAOa appeared to be heterogeneous while MAOb appeared to be more homogeneous. Since the isolated fractions MAOa and MAOb possessed marked different substrate specificities, these observations directly implied that monoamine oxidase multiple forms do exist in situ. The extracted extensive parameters, n (specific binding activity, nanomoles/mg of protein), as well as the measured characteristic transition temperatures, indicated that the relative abundance of the sites which directly affected substrate specificities was indeed altered. The consistency of the characteristic transition temperatures of 21 degrees and 38 degrees for the case of intact membrane preparations was particularly significant. A tenable hypothesis is that the manipulation in the composition of the monoamine oxidase binding forms through intimate lipid-protein interactions, which has been amply demonstrated in many biomembrane systems to be functionally important might be the underlying regulatory mechanism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2026385558,"The large cholinergic interneuron L10 in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both chemical and electrical synaptic transmission. The amplitudes of postsynaptic potentials produced by different branches of L10 are differentially affected when the electrically coupled neuron L20 is depolarized or hyperpolarized. Polarizations applied to L20 are transmitted to L10 branches by the ""presynaptic"" electrical synapse. Depolarization increases the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential, while hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. The differential effects occur because current supplied through the electrical synapse undergoes more electrotonic decrement for the distant branches than for branches closer to the electrical synapse. These findings indicate that the presynaptic electrically coupled neuron may have an integrative role in the modulation of chemical synaptic efficacy mediated by L10."
https://openalex.org/W1551833234,"The effects of various modifications on the beta subunit of lutropin have been studied using the binding characteristics of the reconstituted hormone in the rat testicular radioligand assay. Conditions for iodinating lutropin and lutropin derivatives were determined which resulted in 15 per cent specific binding when tested immediately and retention of 6 to 7 per cent specific binding even after storage for 6 months. Acetimidinyl, acetyl, and carbamyl derivatives of the beta subunit were prepared and combined with unmodified alpha subunit to form reconstituted lutropin. Modification of the beta subunit was shown to have no effect on the time course of binding to testicular receptors or, with one exception, on the extent of receptor saturation. Very high concentrations of lutropin reconstituted with acetylated beta subunit showed an anomalous binding behavior. Scatchard plots of the binding data support the view that the native hormone has a unique receptor affinity which is irreversibly disrupted by separation of subunits and that derivatization of the beta subunit does not alter this parameter further. These data also suggest that there are no significant differences in the amino groups modified on the beta subunit. Competition and preincubation tests for receptor sites that reacted only with modified lutropin and not with the native hormone were negative."
https://openalex.org/W1576201515,"The dye-induced separation between closed and open duplex DNAs in buoyant CsCl is determined primarily by the superhelix density of the closed DNA, provided that all other experimental variables (such as the solution density and dye concentration) are held constant. The extent of the buoyant separation may be used to estimate the superhelix density of an uncharacterized closed DNA, by comparison with the corresponding separation with native SV40 DNAs under identical conditions. We present here an extension of these quantitative relationships to permit the use of an arbitrarily selected closed duplex DNA of known superhelix density, with the accompanying open form, as a reference. The general result is that the ratio of buoyant separations for any two closed/open DNA pairs remains a linear function of the difference in superhelix densities between the closed DNAs. The value of the proportionality constant depends, however, upon the magnitude of the superhelix density of the closed DNA selected as reference."
