https://openalex.org/W2015174638,"The macrolide rapamycin blocks cell cycle progression in yeast and various animal cells by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that rapamycin blocks the phosphorylation and activation of the 70 kd S6 protein kinases (pp70S6K) in a variety of animal cells. The structurally related drug FK506 had no effect on pp70S6K activation but at high concentrations reversed the rapamycin-induced block, confirming the requirement for the rapamycin and FK506 receptor, FKBP. Rapamycin also interfered with signaling by these S6 kinases, blocking serum-stimulated S6 phosphorylation and delaying entry of Swiss 3T3 cells into S phase. Neither rapamycin nor FK506 blocked activation of a distinct family of S6 kinases (RSKs) or the MAP kinases. These studies identify a rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway, argue for a ubiquitous role for FKBPs in signal transduction, indicate that FK506-FKBP-calcineurin complexes do not interfere with pp70S6K signaling, and show that in fibroblasts pp70S6K, not RSK, is the physiological S6 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2092338483,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important messenger both systemically and in the CNS. In digital Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp experiments, clinically available nitroso compounds that generate NO are shown to inhibit responses mediated by the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor on rat cortical neurons in vitro. A mechanism of action for this effect was investigated by using the specific NO-generating agent S-nitrosocysteine. We propose that free sulfhydryl groups on the NMDA receptor-channel complex react to form one or more S-nitrosothiols in the presence of NO. If vicinal thiol groups react in this manner, they can form a disulfide bond(s), which is thought to constitute the redox modulatory site of the receptor, resulting in a relatively persistent blockade of NMDA responses. These reactions with NO can afford protection from NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Our results demonstrate a new pathway for NO regulation of physiological function that is not via cGMP, but instead involves reactions with membrane-bound thiol groups on the NMDA receptor-channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2075939418,"The adhesive interaction between circulating lymphocytes and the high endothelial venules (HEV) of lymph nodes (LN) is mediated by lymphocyte L-selectin, a member of the selectin family of cell adhesion proteins. Previous work has identified a sulfated 50 kd glycoprotein (Sgp50) as an HEV ligand for L-selectin. We now report the purification of this glycoprotein and the utilization of the derived N-terminal amino acid sequence to clone a cDNA. The predicted sequence reveals a novel, mucin-like molecule containing two serine/threonine-rich domains. The mRNA encoding this glycoprotein is preferentially expressed in LN. Antibodies against predicted peptides immunoprecipitate Sgp50 and stain the apical surface of LN HEV. These results thus define a tissue-specific mucin-like endothelial glycoprotein that appears to function as a scaffold that presents carbohydrates to the L-selectin lectin domain."

https://openalex.org/W1982274138,"Mammalian myogenesis is biphasic: primary myoblasts fuse to form primary myotubes, then secondary myoblasts align along the primary myotubes and form secondary myotubes, which comprise most of adult muscle. We provide evidence that an integrin (VLA-4) and its counter receptor (VCAM-1) have a role in secondary myogenesis. Both receptors are synthesized by cultured muscle cells: VLA-4 is induced as myotubes form, whereas VCAM-1 is present on myoblasts and myotubes. In vivo, both molecules are expressed at sites of secondary myogenesis, VLA-4 on primary and secondary myotubes, and VCAM-1 on secondary myoblasts and on regions of secondary myotubes apposed to primary myotubes. These patterns suggest that VLA-4-VCAM-1 interactions influence alignment of secondary myoblasts along primary myotubes and/or the fusion of secondary myoblasts. In support of the latter possibility, antibodies to VLA-4 or VCAM-1 inhibit myotube formation in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1497015848,"Regulation of epithelial chloride flux, which is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis, may be mediated by phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). Part of the R-domain of CFTR (termed CF-2) was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. CF-2 was phosphorylated on seryl residues by PKA, PKC, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I). Direct amino acid sequencing and peptide mapping of CF-2 revealed that serines 660, 700, 737, and 813 as well as serine 768, serine 795, or both were phosphorylated by PKA and PKG, and serines 686 and 790 were phosphorylated by PKC. CFTR was phosphorylated in vitro by PKA, PKC, or PKG on the same sites that were phosphorylated in CF-2. Kinetic analysis of phosphorylation of CF-2 and of synthetic peptides confirmed that these sites were excellent substrates for PKA, PKC, or PKG. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from T84 cells labeled with 32Pi. Its phosphorylation was stimulated in response to agents that activated either PKA or PKC. Peptide mapping confirmed that CFTR was phosphorylated at several sites identified in vitro. Thus, regulation of CFTR is likely to occur through direct phosphorylation of the R-domain by protein kinases stimulated by different second messenger pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1605635614,"Human fibroblasts secrete insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that can modify insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I action. We have determined the molecular identities of three forms of IGFBPs that are secreted by human fibroblasts in vitro. Ligand blot analysis of fibroblast conditioned media revealed that the M(r) 43,000 and 39,000 forms were the most abundant, but that M(r) 31,000 and 24,000 forms were also present. An antiserum that was specific for IGFBP-5 reacted with the M(r) 31,000 form, and an IGFBP-4-specific antiserum recognized only the M(r) 24,000 form. The M(r) 39,000 and 43,000 forms were detected by IGFBP-3 antiserum. Further proof that fibroblasts synthesized these forms of IGFBPs was obtained by Northern blotting. A cDNA probe for IGFBP-3 hybridized with a 2.4-kilobase (kb) transcript, whereas a cDNA probe for IGFBP-5 recognized a single 6.0-kb transcript, and an IGFBP-4 cDNA probe recognized 2.2- and 2.0-kb transcripts. IGF-I and -II caused a minimal (less than 43%) increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance and had no effect on IGFBP-4 mRNA abundance. IGF-I and -II (100 ng/ml) stimulated 6-8-fold increases in IGFBP-5 levels, whereas IGFBP-4 was inhibited. Insulin failed to elicit any change in IGFBP-5, suggesting that binding of the IGFs to IGFBPs was required to detect the increase. Immunoblotting for IGFBP-5 revealed an M(r) 23,000 (non-IGF-I-binding) fragment. To determine if the IGFs were influencing proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-5, pure IGFBP-5 was added to fibroblast cultures and incubated for 4 h at 37 degrees C. The amount of fragment formation was attenuated by the presence of IGF-I and -II, but not insulin, suggesting that this is a mechanism by which the IGFs act to modulate IGFBP-5 concentration. In contrast to the IGFs, forskolin, which increased IGFBP-4 and -5 mRNA abundance and secretion, had no effect on fragment formation. The results show that human fibroblasts synthesize and secrete IGFBP-3, -4, and -5 and that changes in intracellular cAMP regulate synthesis, whereas the IGFs regulate IGFBP-4 and -5 levels by post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1601900247,"The Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel of human red cells was inhibited with high affinity by several imidazole antimycotics which are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P-450. IC50 values were (in microM): clotrimazole, 0.05; tioconazole, 0.3; miconazole, 1.5; econazole, 1.8. Inhibition of the channel was also found with other drugs with known cytochrome P-450 inhibitory effect. However, no inhibition was obtained with carbon monoxide (CO). This suggests that, given the high selectivity of the above inhibitors for the heme moiety, a different but closely related to cytochrome P-450 kind of hemoprotein may be involved in the regulation of the red cell Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel. Clotrimazole also inhibited two other charybdotoxin-sensitive Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, those of rat thymocytes (IC50 = 0.1-0.2 microM) and of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (IC50 = 0.5 microM). Imidazole antimycotics inhibit also receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (Montero, M., Alvarez, J. and Garcia-Sancho, J. (1991) Biochem. J. 277, 73-79). This suggests that both Ca2+ and Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels might have a similar regulatory mechanism involving a cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1823777871,"Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has been widely used in the culture of cumulus-oocyte complexes, since it is believed that FBS stabilizes the expanding cumulus extracellular matrix. In this study, we have identified a factor in FBS that is responsible for this effect. FBS was first fractionated by stepwise precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a gel filtration column. Active fractions, as determined by their ability to stabilize the cumulus extracellular matrix in a bioassay system, were further purified by HPLC on DEAE ion-exchange and gel filtration columns. The purified factor was exhibited as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr 150,000 and a single peak on a C-8 reverse-phase HPLC. The sequence of the first 14 NH2-terminal amino acids was determined by Edman degradation, revealing significant sequence identity of the bovine serum factor with the light chain shared by members of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family. Western blot analysis using anti-human I alpha I IgG shows that the antibody reacts positively with the purified factor, and immunodepletion of FBS with anti-I alpha I antibody agarose eliminated its ability to stabilize the extracellular matrix. This factor is found in mouse follicular fluid collected 6 h following human chorionic gonadotropin injection to stimulate ovulation, but not in unstimulated mice. Anti-I alpha I-positive epitopes were also localized within the cumulus extracellular matrix of mouse preovulatory follicles in immunocytochemical preparations using anti-human I alpha I IgG, supporting the possibility that this molecule or molecules may diffuse into follicular fluid after an ovulatory stimulus to act as structural linkers that ensure normal cumulus expansion, through stabilization of the cumulus extracellular matrix thus supporting the process of ovulation."

https://openalex.org/W2154049094,"The insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family comprises six structurally distinct, but highly homologous proteins. They have been identified in serum and other biological fluids, tissue extracts, and cell culture media. We have recently cloned cDNAs encoding human IGFBP-4, -5, and -6 and have now expressed these BPs in yeast as ubiquitin (Ub)-IGFBP fusion proteins. Western ligand blotting with 125I-IGF II under nonreducing conditions of recombinant human (rh) IGFBP-containing yeast lysates revealed specific binding bands for IGFBP-4, -5, and -6 at apparent molecular masses of 24-26, 30-32, and 24-26 kDa, respectively, indicating processing of the fusion proteins. High-performance liquid chromatography-purified rhIGFBPs had virually the same amino acid composition, amino acid number, and NH2-terminal sequences as the native BPs. Except for the affinity of rhIGFBP-6 for IGF I (Ka = 8.5 x 10(8) M-1), the affinity constants of the three IGFBPs for IGF I and II lie between 1.7 and 3.3 x 10(10) M-1, i.e. 25-100 times higher than the IGF I and II affinities of the type I IGF receptor. When present in excess, rhIGFBP-4, -5, and -6 inhibited IGF I- and II-stimulated DNA and glycogen synthesis in human osteoblastic cells, but rhIGFBP-6 had only a weak inhibitory effect on IGF I in agreement with its relatively lower IGF I affinity constant. The results of this study show that the primary effect of the three rhIGFBPs is the attenuation of IGF activity and suggest that IGFBPs contribute to the control of IGF-mediated cell growth and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1566216360,"A cDNA for branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase was cloned from a rat heart cDNA library. The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a protein of 382 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 43,280. The clone codes for the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase based on the following: 1) the deduced amino acid sequence contained the partial sequence of the kinase determined by direct sequencing; 2) expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in synthesis of a 43,000-Da protein that was recognized specifically by kinase antibodies; and 3) enzyme activity that phosphorylated and inactivated the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex was found in extracts of E. coli expressing the protein. Northern blot analysis indicated the mRNA for the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase was more abundant in rat heart than in rat liver, as expected from the relative amounts of kinase activity expressed in these tissues. The deduced sequence of the kinase aligned with a high degree of similarity within subdomains characteristic of procaryotic histidine protein kinases. This first mitochondrial protein kinase to be cloned appears more closely related in sequence to procaryotic histidine protein kinases than to eucaryotic serine/threonine protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1968736929,"The interaction of the T cell glycoprotein CD2 with one ligand, CD58, contributes to T cell function. We have identified CD59, a glycoprotein with complement-inhibitory function, as a second physiological ligand for CD2. Antibodies to CD59 inhibit CD2-dependent T cell activation in murine T cell hybridomas expressing human CD2. In an in vitro binding assay with purified CD58 and CD59, CD2+ cells bind not only immobilized CD58 but also CD59. With two complementary approaches, it was demonstrated that the binding sites on CD2 for CD58 and CD59 are overlapping but nonidentical. These observations suggest that direct interactions between CD2 and both CD58 and CD59 contribute to T cell activation and adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1590202185,"Abstract Vitronectin (VN) has been implicated as a major matrix-associated regulator component of plasminogen activation by serving as a potent stabilizing cofactor of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The direct binding of heparin, plasminogen as well as PAI-1 in its latent and active form to immobilized VN was studied in the absence or presence of competitors. Monoclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal portion of VN inhibited both PAI-1 and plasminogen binding, whereas heparin, heparan sulfate with a high degree of sulfation, or dextran sulfate interfered with PAI-1 binding (KD = 20 nM) only. Utilizing synthetic peptides encompassing overlapping sequences of the heparin-binding domain of VN, adjacent heparin and PAI-1-binding sites were localized within the sequence 348-370 of VN. Although a number of other serine protease inhibitors which do not form binary complexes with VN contain a reactive-site Ser at their P1'-position, a reactive-site P1' mutant of PAI-1 (Met----Ser) showed comparable if not increased binding to VN. Binding of Lys-plasminogen and active-site-blocked plasmin was at least 10-fold higher in affinity (KD = 85-100 nM) compared to Glu-plasminogen (KD approximately 1 microM) and could be inhibited by lysine analogs but not by glycosaminoglycans or PAI-1, indicating that heteropolar plasmin(ogen) binding of VN occurs to an adjacent segment upstream to the heparin and PAI-1-binding sites. This contention was further supported in binding studies with plasmin-modified VN which lost both heparin and PAI-1 binding but exhibited 2-3-fold higher capacity to bind plasminogen. The essential plasmin(ogen)-binding site was mapped by ligand blot analysis to the carboxyl-terminal portion of proteolytically trimmed VN (M(r) = 61,000). Moreover, treatment of the extracellular matrix of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with plasmin resulted in partial degradation of matrix-associated VN and concomitant release of PAI-1, but increased the ability of the matrix by about 2-fold to bind plasminogen. These results are indicative of differential interactions of VN with components of the plasminogen activation system, whereby plasmin itself may provoke the switch of VN from an anti-fibrinolytic into a pro-fibrinolytic cofactor. This process reflects a novel role for the adhesive protein and its degradation product(s) in the possible feedback regulation of localized plasmin formation at extracellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W1494017401,"Carbohydrate recognition by the human endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule, E-selectin, has been investigated by binding studies using 3H-labeled Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing different levels of the transfected full-length adhesion molecule and a series of structurally defined oligosaccharides linked to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoate (neoglycolipids) and synthetic glycolipids chromatographed on silica gel plates or immobilized on plastic wells. Evidence is presented for density-dependent binding of the membrane-associated E-selectin not only to 3'-sialyl-lacto-N-fucopentaose II (3'-S-LNFP-II) and 3'-sialyl-lacto-N-fucopentaose III (3'-S-LNFP-III) which express the sialyl Le(a) and sialyl Le(x) antigens, respectively, but also to the nonsialylated analogue LNFP-II; there is a threshold density of E-selectin required for binding to these sialylated sequences, and binding to the nonsialylated analogue is a property only of cells with the highest density of E-selectin expression. The presence of fucose linked to subterminal rather than to an internal N-acetylglucosamine is shown to be a requirement for E-selectin binding, and although the presence of sialic acid 3-linked to the terminal galactose of the LNFP-II or LNFP-III sequences substantially enhances E-selectin binding, the presence of 6-linked sialic acid abolishes binding. E-selectin binding is unaffected in the presence of the blood group H fucose (alpha 1-2 linked to galactose to form the Le(b) antigen). However, the binding is abolished when in addition alpha 1-3-linked N-acetylgalactosamine to the galactose (blood group A antigen) is present. These results indicate that some E-selectin-mediated adhesive events may be influenced by blood group status."

Inhibition of HIV-1 RT by TSAO-T was reversible and noncompetitive with respect to dGTP as the substrate and poly(C).oligo(dG) as the template/primer. In contrast with the nonnucleoside derivatives tetrahydroimidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]- benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (TIBO) (R-82150), nevirapine (BI-RG-587) and the HEPT derivative I-HEPU-SdM, TSAO-T was not inhibitory to HIV-1 RT in the presence of other homopolymeric template/primers. It did not interfere with the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase function of HIV-1 RT, HIV-2 RT, herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase, or Taq polymerase. However, TSAO-T proved inhibitory to the HIV-1 RT reaction primed by Escherichia coli 16S/23S rRNA, irrespective of the nature of the radiolabeled 2'-deoxynucleotide 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) used. TSAO-T does not act as a DNA chain terminator. It interacts with HIV-1 RT at a nonsubstrate (dNTP)-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1567522204,"This study has investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) activation in IgG-mediated phagocytosis by human monocytes. Incubation of monocytes with IgG-opsonized targets increased membrane-associated PKC approximately 2-fold. Kinetic studies showed that the translocation of PKC to membrane occurred before significant ingestion took place. The pharmacologic PKC inhibitor H7 inhibited IgG-dependent ingestion with ID50 of 20 microM, while the structurally related isoquinoline sulfonamide HA1004 had no effect at this concentration. Staurosporine and calphostin C, PKC inhibitors which have different mechanisms of actions than H7, also inhibited ingestion. Depletion of PKC by prolonged incubation with phorbol esters also inhibited phagocytosis, and dose-response curves showed a strong correlation between the extent of PKC depletion and the extent of inhibition of ingestion. Finally, phagosomes were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation of cells disrupted 5 min after the initiation of phagocytosis. Measurement of PKC activity and immunoreactivity in the phagosomes showed that PKC was concentrated in the phagosome membrane approximately 5-fold compared to the uninvolved plasma membrane. Together, these data suggest that PKC activation is an early, essential step in the efficient ingestion of IgG-opsonized targets by monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1493738841,"While hormonal stimuli and mechanical stretch can induced cardiac-specific gene expression and in some cases cellular hypertrophy, the relationship between myocyte contraction frequency, gene expression, and myocyte growth has not been well characterized. In this study a new model system was developed in which cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to long term pacing of contractions with pulsatile electrical stimulation. Myocytes submitted to electrical stimulation for 3 days displayed dramatic increases in cellular size and myofibrillar organization, and a 5-10-fold increase in the expression of the cardiac genes atrial natriuretic factor and myosin light chain-2. Atrial natriuretic factor expression induced by electrical stimulation of contractions was inhibited by nifedipine or W7, indicating a dependence on calcium influx and calmodulin activity. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cAMP formation were not affected by electrical stimulation suggesting that gene induction occurred independently of the activation of protein kinases C or A above basal levels. These findings show that the cellular events associated with contraction, such as changes in cytoplasmic free calcium levels and/or cellular stretch, may serve as important determinants of myocyte growth and cardiac gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1529108748,"The erythrocyte membrane inhibitor of the human terminal complement proteins, surface antigen CD59, has previously been shown to enter into a detergent-resistant complex with either the membrane-bound complex of C5b-8 or C5b-9 (Meri, S., Morgan, B. P., Davies, A., Daniels, R. H., Olavesen, M. G., Waldmann, H. and Lachmann, P. J. (1990) Immunology 71, 1-9; Rollins, S. A., Zhao, J., Ninomiya, H., and Sims, P. J. (1991) J. Immunol, 146, 2345-2351). In order to further define the interactions that underlie the complement-inhibitory function of CD59, we have examined the binding interactions between 125I-CD59 and the isolated components of human complement membrane attack complex, C5b6, C7, C8, and C9. By density gradient analysis, we were unable to detect interaction of 125I-CD59 with any of these isolated complement components in solution. Specific binding of 125I-CD59 to C8 and C9 was detected when these human complement proteins were adsorbed to either plastic or to nitrocellulose, suggesting that a conformational change that accompanies surface adsorption exposes a CD59-binding site that is normally buried in these serum proteins. The binding of 125I-CD59 to plastic-adsorbed C8 and C9 was saturable and competed by excess unlabeled CD59, with half-maximal binding observed at 125I-CD59 concentrations of 80 and 36 nM, respectively. No specific binding of 125I-CD59 was detected for surface-adsorbed human C5b6 or C7 nor was such binding observed for C8 or C9 isolated from rabbit serum. Binding of CD59 to human C8 and C9 was not mediated by the phospholipid moiety of CD59, implying association by protein-protein interaction. In order to further define the binding sites for CD59, ligand blotting with 125I-CD59 was performed after separation of C8 into its noncovalently associated subunits (C8 alpha-gamma and C8 beta) and after alpha-thrombin digestion of C9. These experiments revealed specific and saturable binding of 125I-CD59 to C8 alpha-gamma subunit (half-maximal binding at 75 nM), but not to C8 beta, and specific and saturable binding to the 37-kDa fragment (C9b) of thrombin-cleaved C9 (half-maximal binding at 35 nM), but not to the 25-kDa C9a fragment. Partial reduction of C8 alpha-gamma revealed that only C8 alpha polypeptide exhibited affinity for CD59, and no specific binding to the C8 gamma chain was detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1505531110,"We obtained 20 mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors, using transfected cells expressing high levels of receptors (IGF-1R/3T3 cells) as immunogen. The antibodies immunoprecipitated receptor.125I-IGF-I complexes and biosynthetically labeled receptors from IGF-1R/3T3 cells but did not react with human insulin receptors or rat type I IGF receptors. Several antibodies stimulated DNA synthesis in IGF-1R/3T3 cells, but the maximum stimulation was only 25% of that produced by IGF-I. The antibodies fell into seven groups recognizing distinct epitopes and with different effects on receptor function. All the antibodies reacted with the extracellular portion of the receptor, and epitopes were localized to specific domains by investigating their reaction with a series of chimeric IGF/insulin receptor constructs. Binding of IGF-I was inhibited up to 90% by antibody 24-60 reacting in the region 184-283, and by antibody 24-57 reacting in the region 440-586. IGF-I binding was stimulated up to 2.5-fold by antibodies 4-52 and 16-13 reacting in the region 62-184, and by antibody 26-3 reacting downstream of 283. The latter two groups of antibodies also dramatically stimulated insulin binding to intact IGF-1R/3T3 cells (by up to 50-fold), and potentiated insulin stimulation of DNA synthesis. Scatchard analysis indicated that in the presence of these antibodies, the affinity of the type I IGF receptor for insulin was comparable with that of the insulin receptor. These data indicate that regions both within and outside the cysteine-rich domain of the receptor alpha-subunit are important in determining the affinity and specificity of ligand binding. These antibodies promise to be valuable tools in resolving issues of IGF-I receptor heterogeneity and in studying the structure and function of classical type I receptors and insulin/IGF receptor hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W1501507904,"Mevalonic aciduria is the first proposed inherited disorder of the cholesterol/isoprene biosynthetic pathway in humans, and it is presumed to be caused by a mutation in the gene coding for mevalonate kinase. To elucidate the molecular basis of this inherited disorder, a 2.0-kilobase human mevalonate kinase cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. The 1188-base pair open reading frame coded for a 396-amino acid polypeptide with a deduced M(r) of 42,450. The predicted protein sequence displayed similarity to those of galactokinase and the yeast RAR1 protein, indicating that they may belong to a common gene family. Southern hybridization studies demonstrated that the mevalonate kinase gene is located on human chromosome 12 and is a single copy gene. No major rearrangements were detected in the mevalonic aciduria subject. The relative size (2 kilobases) and amounts of human mevalonate kinase mRNA were not changed in mevalonic aciduria fibroblasts. Approximately half of the mevalonic aciduria cDNA clones encoding mevalonate kinase contained a single base substitution (A to C) in the coding region at nucleotide 902 that changed an asparagine residue to a threonine residue. The presence of this missense mutation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and allele-specific hybridization of the genomic DNAs from the proband and the proband's father and brother. Similar analysis failed to detect this mutation in the proband's mother, seven normal subjects, or four additional mevalonic aciduria subjects, indicating that the mutation does not represent a common gene polymorphism. Functional analysis of the defect by transient expression confirmed that the mutation produced an enzyme with diminished activity. Our data suggest that the index case is a compound heterozygote for a mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1568792804,"The interactions of the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-containing proteins in basal and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with src homology 2 (SH2) domains from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and phospholipase C gamma have been examined. The Tyr(P) forms of the insulin receptor and its 160-kDa substrate protein (pp160) associated with fusion proteins containing either or both the SH2 domains of PI3K, but not with fusion proteins containing the two SH2 domains of GAP or phospholipase C gamma. These results demonstrate a specificity for the association of the Tyr(P) form of the insulin receptor and pp160 with SH2 domains that parallels the reported effects of insulin on PI3K, GAP, and phospholipase C gamma in vivo. Immunoprecipitates of pp160 from the cytosol of insulin-treated, but not basal, 3T3-L1 adipocytes contained PI3K activity. Moreover, the Tyr(P) form of pp160 with associated PI3K activity migrated at 10 S on a sucrose velocity gradient, whereas the Tyr(P) form without associated activity migrated at 6 S. These findings indicate that the Tyr(P) form of pp160 associates directly with PI3K in vivo."

The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature polypeptide was confirmed by sequencing cathepsin S purified from human spleen. The cDNA detects a 1.9-kilobase transcript in poly(A)+ RNA from human fibroblasts. Expression of human cathepsin S in transfected baby hamster kidney cells resulted in up to more than 300-fold cathepsin S activity as compared to untransfected controls. In the expressing baby hamster kidney cells, human cathepsin S is transported to the lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway as shown by density gradient centrifugation, immunofluorescence, and detection of the 37-kDa cathepsin S precursor in the medium in the presence of NH4Cl. The deduced amino acid sequence of human cathepsin S exhibits a substantial degree of similarity with other human cysteine proteinases and papain indicating that they have a common ancestral gene and are members of a gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1544975530,"The effect of extracellular matrix composition on the location, amount, and activity of cell-associated urokinase-type plasminogen activator was tested using HT-1080 cells adherent to either fibronectin or vitronectin. Specific immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized urokinase indicated that cells adherent to fibronectin synthesized 2-3-fold more urokinase than cells adherent to vitronectin. Complexes of urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were detected in cell layers of vitronectin-adherent but not fibronectin-adherent cells. Inhibition of PAI-1 using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody resulted in a 3-fold increase in urokinase enzymatic activity on vitronectin adherent cells. Urokinase activity on fibronectin adherent cells was only slightly increased following PAI-1 neutralization. Examination of both HT-1080 and normal human fibroblast cells by immunofluorescent microscopy localized urokinase-type plasminogen activator to discrete, focal areas underneath cells adherent to vitronectin. Urokinase was not detectable by immunofluorescence on cells adherent to fibronectin. The addition of exogenous prourokinase to locate urokinase receptors on adherent HT-1080 cells indicated that the focal localization of cell-surface urokinase resulted from the clustering of urokinase receptors following adhesion to vitronectin but not fibronectin-coated substrates. These results suggest that vitronectin can contribute to the control of cell-surface plasmin activity by regulating the synthesis of urokinase and directing the localization of urokinase receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1497288183,"We report evidence that a monoclonal antibody raised by immunization with a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-carrier protein conjugate selectively hydrolyzes VIP and a fluorescence quenched decapeptide (FQ14-22D), representing the region of VIP most susceptible to autoantibody-mediated cleavage (residues 14-22). A high affinity of the antibody for VIP and a lower affinity for FQ14-22D were revealed by kinetic studies and further substantiated by potent inhibition of FQ14-22D cleaving activity by full-length VIP. Sequencing of FQ14-22D hydrolysis products indicated selective cleavage at one peptide bond. These observations suggest that antibodies induced against naturally occurring polypeptide antigens can express peptidolytic activity targeted for specific sequences in the recognition epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2138924995,"The platelet fibrinogen (Fg) receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) is an integrin which plays a critical role in hemostasis by recognizing at least the four adhesive ligands: Fg, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and von Willebrand factor (vWf). We reported that residues 309-312 of GPIIb alpha appear to comprise at least part of a Fg binding site on the Fg receptor (Gartner, T. K., and Taylor, D. B. (1990) Thromb. Res. 60, 291-309). Here we report that the peptide GPIIb alpha 300-312 (G13) inhibits platelet aggregation and binds Fg and Vn. Significantly, this peptide inhibits the adhesion of stimulated platelets to Fg, Fn, Vn, and vWf, but not the adhesion of resting platelets to Fn. Thus, GPIIb 300-312 may constitute a specific but common recognition site on GPIIb/IIIa for both LGGAKQAGDV- and RGD-containing ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1584531078,"The Na,K-stimulated ATPase is inhibited by extracellular cardiac glycosides, which bind to the enzyme's alpha subunit. We used a monoclonal antibody, VG4, as a probe of the extracellular surface. The antibody was specific for Na,K-ATPase and bound to intact cells. The epitope was mapped to the first extracellular loop (H1-H2) of alpha, using a combination of techniques including trypsinolysis, N-terminal sequence of a fragment containing the determinant, and analysis of the effects of species-specific sequence differences. The antibody inhibited Na,K-ATPase activity under certain circumstances, indicating that the H1-H2 loop participates in conformational changes that are transmitted to the active site. Mutations in the H1-H2 loop have been shown by others to affect ouabain affinity. Ouabain and the antibody acted synergistically to inhibit the enzyme, which seemingly supported the hypothesis that the H1-H2 loop is an essential part of the cardiac glycoside binding site. Direct measurements of the binding of [3H]ouabain, however, indicated that VG4 enhanced rather than inhibited binding, presumably by promoting favorable conformation changes. The data suggest the possibility that the cardiac glycoside binding site may be intramembrane rather than extracellular."
https://openalex.org/W1604190386,"Diphtheria toxin B fragment is capable of forming cation-selective channels in the plasma membrane. Such channels may be involved in the translocation of the toxin A fragment to the cytosol. Seven negatively charged amino acids in the B fragment were replaced one by one by lysines, followed by studies of cytotoxicity and channel-forming ability of the different mutants. The mutant D392K showed a strong reduction in binding to cell surface receptors. Of the six mutants that showed wild-type binding affinity, the two mutants D295K and D318K were very inefficient in forming channels. These two mutants had the lowest ability to mediate A fragment translocation. The mutant E362K was able both to induce cation channel formation and to mediate A fragment translocation at a higher pH value than the wild-type B fragment. The results support the notion that formation of cation channels is of importance for the translocation of the A fragment across the plasma membrane, and they indicate that the pH requirement for translocation of the A fragment to the cytosol is partly determined by the B fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1580027256,"The structure of the kidney microvillar membrane metallopeptidase meprin (EC 3.4.24.18) from rats has been examined. Previously reported to be a homotetramer, we demonstrate that the enzyme is composed of two similar but distinct subunits through tryptic peptide mapping and the sequencing of peptides of the papain solubilized form of the enzyme. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that the native rat meprin tetramer is dissociated by detergent into disulfide-linked heterodimers. A full-length cDNA clone encoding one of the meprin subunits has been isolated and sequenced. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 668 amino acids, coding for a polypeptide of molecular weight 75,054. The enzyme contains the zinc binding sequence HEFLH and a potential membrane-spanning region near its amino terminus. Comparison of this clone with peptide sequences from mouse meprins A and B shows that the clone is a B type or beta subunit. Northern blot analysis is consistent with the existence of two distinct subunits and further indicates that rat meprin subunits may be differentially expressed in various rat tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1569602138,"We have constructed a chimeric mitochondrial precursor protein consisting of a mutant bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor coupled to the C terminus of a purified artificial precursor protein. This construct fails to complete its import into isolated mitochondria and becomes stuck across sites of close contact between the two mitochondrial membranes. When the mitochondria are then depleted of ATP and the intramolecular disulfide bridges of the trypsin inhibitor are cleaved by dithiothreitol, the trypsin inhibitor moiety is transported across the outer membrane into the intermembrane space. This translocation intermediate can be chased across the inner membrane by restoring the ATP levels in the matrix. These results show that translocation of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor across a biological membrane is prevented by its intramolecular disulfide bridges, that import into the matrix involves two distinct translocation system operating in tandem, and that ATP is required for protein translocation across the inner but not the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1565773781,"We have characterized the biosynthesis and processing of a 91 amino acid hydrophobic integral membrane protein encoded by human group C adenoviruses which down-regulates the EGF receptor (Carlin, C. R., Tollefson, A. E., Brady, H. A., Hoffman, B. L., and Wold, W. S. M. (1989) Cell 57, 135-144). Previous studies have shown that two immunologically related proteins are produced in vivo, a 13.7-kDa protein encoded by E3 message f and a 11.3-kDa protein derived from 13.7 kDa by proteolysis (Hoffman, B. L., Ullrich, A., Wold, W. S. M., and Carlin, C. R. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 5521-5524; Tollefson, A. E., Krajcsi, P., Yei, S., Carlin, C. R., and Wold, W. S. M. (1990) J. Virol. 64, 794-801). We report here that the 13.7- and 11.3-kDa proteins form intermolecular disulfide bonds cotranslationally at Cys-31 and tend to migrate as high molecular weight aggregates under nonreducing conditions. Both proteins are also present at the cell surface, as evidenced by specific immunoprecipitation from intact monolayers enzymatically labeled with 125I. Moreover, an antiserum specific for a putative extracellular epitope recognizes the same viral proteins as antibodies directed against a C-terminal synthetic 15-mer. The 13.7- and 11.3-kDa proteins are detected at early time points during pulse-chase radiolabeling of infected cells, do not undergo any further changes in molecular weight, and focus at their predicted isoelectric points (7.4 and 7.2, respectively). Identical results are obtained in stable transfectants constitutively expressing only 13.7 and 11.3 kDa, suggesting that biosynthesis and processing is not dependent on other viral proteins. These results have been incorporated into a computer-based model to predict the orientation of 13.7 and 11.3 kDa in the lipid bilayer. This model provides a basis for testing predictions regarding the topology of the viral proteins, as well as putative interactions with heterologous proteins in the microenvironment of the plasma membrane that cause down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1509992106,"Studies of normal cellular function as well as the understanding of cellular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and other diseases of the large intestine have been limited, particularly due to the lack of long-term culture of normal human large intestinal epithelial cells (NHLIEC). Using the epithelia from surgically resected human colon, we have dissociated a sufficient number of viable NHLIEC and maintained them in in vitro culture for up to 5 months. Normal-appearing human large intestinal mucosal fragments (1 mm2) were treated with 0.01 mg/ml trypsin, 0.2 mg/ml collagenase + 0.1 mM EGTA or 0.1 mg/ml trypsin + 0.1 mM EGTA in a Stomacher laboratory blender to isolate the cells. Compared with other methods, the use of the Stomacher blender combined with low concentrations of proteolytic enzymes yielded greater numbers of cells per gram of tissue, with up to 84% viable cells. Primary and serially passaged NHLIEC were cultured in CMRL-1066, MEM with 5% serum, and serum-free KGM. These media were all supplemented with insulin, hydrocortisone, epithelial growth factor, and bovine pituitary extract. CMRL-1066 was found to be the best medium for NHLIEC. Contaminating fibroblasts were selectively removed by briefly allowing the cells to adhere to the culture vessel and adding 25 U/ml collagenase to the culture media at the first subculture treatment. The epithelial nature and secretory function of the established cells were confirmed by morphological criteria (light microscopy, phase contrast microscopy and electron microscopy), immunoreactivity to cytokeratin, and positive mucin cytochemistry. We propose that using this methodology for the culture and maintenance of NHLIEC for an extended period of time would serve as a valuable model for a variety of investigations.— Baten, A., Sakamoto, K.; Shamsuddin, A.

https://openalex.org/W1563637738,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of the 16.7-kb human gene that encodes the peptide core (serglycin) of a secretory granule proteoglycan was determined, thus representing the first proteoglycan peptide core gene to be sequenced in its entirety. The exons, intron 1, and intron 2 comprised 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively. Nineteen Alu-repetitive DNA sequences were interspersed in the gene, accounting for 28% of the total nucleotides in intron 1 and 40% of the nucleotides in intron 2. The nucleotide sequence was then used in an examination of the methylation pattern of the human serglycin gene in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that contain serglycin mRNA and in T-lymphoblast Molt-4 cells that do not. With polymerase chain reaction methodology, 13 DNA probes of 250-880 base pairs in length were generated that corresponded to unique, non-Alu sequences spaced throughout the entire human serglycin gene. When blots containing genomic DNA digested with HpaII or MspI were examined with these genomic probes, it was discovered that the 5'-flanking region and intron 1 of the serglycin gene in HL-60 cells were both substantially less methylated than intron 2. In contrast, the entire serglycin gene in Molt-4 cells was highly methylated. Because hypomethylated genes generally are transcribed more efficiently than hypermethylated genes, the high level of serglycin mRNA in HL-60 cells probably is a consequence of the low level of methylation of intron 1 and the 5'-flanking region of the serglycin gene in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1586219219,"Three main pathways have been implicated in desensitization of receptors that stimulate adenylylcyclase (AC): cAMP-mediated phosphorylation; cAMP-independent phosphorylation, and receptor internalization. Cell lines derived from the murine Ltk- cell were found useful in exploring the contribution of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation in V2 vasopressin receptor desensitization. The HTB-2 cell expresses the human V2 vasopressin receptor, introduced by transfection of human genomic DNA, and the prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) receptor, endogenous to the Ltk- cell. The A7 cell expresses the hamster beta 2-adrenoceptor, which undergoes the above-mentioned desensitization processes. Treatment of HTB-2 cells with arginine-vasopressin (AVP) had no effect on AC responsiveness to PGE1, but promoted desensitization of the AVP response. This was seen as a 5-6-fold right shift in the dose-response curves for AVP action (cAMP accumulation in intact cells and AC stimulation in homogenates and isolated membranes) and in a decrease in the maximum effect of AVP on these parameters. AVP treatment caused a decrease in cell surface receptors to approximately 75% of control without changes in KD, as determined by Scatchard analysis. When cAMP was increased by treatment with 10 microM PGE1 and isobutylmethylxanthine, desensitization of the PGE1 receptor was observed but not of the AVP receptor. In A7 cells the same treatment caused, as expected, a 3-fold right shift in the dose-response curve for AC stimulation by isoproterenol, indicating that L cells can mediate heterologous desensitization. These data demonstrate that the V2 vasopressin and the PGE1 receptors undergo homologous desensitization in the absence of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and that this component is not required for vasopressin receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1602995462,"Thyrotropin (TSH) is an important regulator of thyroid follicular cells. While its role in the maintenance of differentiated functions is undisputed, its role as a mitogen is less clear. TSH induces DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in some cells, while in others, TSH is mitogenic only in the presence of additional growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1. TSH causes elevations in intracellular cAMP and is thought to utilize this second messenger system in its mitogenic action. We studied TSH as a mitogen in Wistar rat thyroid cells (WRT) (Brandi, M. L., Rotella, C. M., Mavilia, C., Franceschelli, F., Tanini, A., and Toccafondi, R. (1987) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 54, 91-103) and examined the role of the guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gs, in its mitogenic action. WRT cells synthesized DNA in response to TSH and elevations in cAMP. In addition, TSH caused a rapid stimulation of an indicator gene whose expression is regulated by cAMP response elements. Following microinjection of an inhibitory polyclonal antibody raised against the Gs protein, both TSH-induced changes in gene expression and DNA synthesis were significantly reduced. These results demonstrate that virtually all of the mitogenic action of TSH is transduced through the Gs protein in WRT cells, presumably through the regulation of adenylate cyclase. Whether all or only part of TSH action is mediated by cAMP and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1487493292,"Abstract The mechanism by which the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-binding protein, alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), modulates PDGF bioactivity is unknown, but could involve reversible PDGF-alpha 2M binding. Herein we report that greater than 70% of 125I-PDGF-BB or -AB complexed to alpha 2M was dissociated by SDS-denaturation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, i.e. most of the binding was noncovalent. Reduction of the PDGF.alpha 2M complex following denaturation dissociated the cytokine from alpha 2M by greater than 90%, suggesting covalent disulfide bond formation. Approximately 50% of the growth factor was dissociated by lowering the pH from 7.5 to 4.0. 125I-PDGF-BB bound alpha 2M in a time-dependent manner (t1/2 = approximately 1 h), reaching equilibrium after 4 h. The 125I-PDGF.BB/alpha 2M complex dissociated more slowly (t1/2 = approximately 2.5 h). Slow and alpha 2M bound nearly equal amounts of PDGF-AB or -BB. Trypsin treatment converted PDGF-BB/alpha 2M complex to the fast conformation but did not release bound 125I-PDGF-BB. All PDGF-isoforms (AA, -AB, and -BB) competed for binding with 125I-PDGF-BB binding to slow alpha 2M and fast alpha 2M-methylamine by 65-80%. Other cytokines that bind alpha 2M (transforming growth factor-beta 1 and -beta 2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin -1 beta, and -6) did not compete for 125I-PDGF-BB binding slow alpha 2M, but transforming growth factor-beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor inhibited 125I-PDGF-BB binding alpha 2M-methylamine by 30-50%. The reversible nature of the PDGF.alpha 2M complex could allow for targeted PDGF release near mesenchymal cells which possess PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1489462130,"The c-kit gene, mapped to the dominant white spotting (W) locus of the mouse (Chabot, B., Stephenson, D. A., Chapman, V. M., Besmer, P., and Bernstein, A. (1988) Nature 335, 88-89; Geissler, E. N., Ryan, M. A., and Housman, D. E. (1988) Cell 55, 185-192), encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, p145c-kit. Germline mutations at the W locus lead to loss of function alterations in p145c-kit, and result in mice with developmental defects of varying severity in the melanocytic, hematopoietic stem cell, and primordial germ cell lineages. To investigate in more detail the effect of W mutations on p145c-kit signaling, three mutations, W42, Wv, and W41, that confer severe, intermediate, and mild phenotypic characteristics, respectively, were introduced into the human p145c-kit tyrosine kinase domain. These mutations attenuated the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor to different degrees. In addition, they had differential effects on the interaction of the p145c-kit substrates, phospholipase C gamma, GTPase-activating protein, and the receptor-binding subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, p85. Notably, the Wv mutation, while retaining significant receptor tyrosine kinase activity, was unable to bind phospholipase C gamma and GTPase-activating protein, but could still associate with p85. These results suggest that the location of W mutations may be an important determinant of the specificity of substrate association and phosphorylation, and may explain, at least in part, the cell type-specific defects associated with certain W alleles."

Incubation of unstripped everted membrane vesicles with anti-b antibodies resulted in a partial loss of F1, and the remaining membrane-bound ATP-hydrolyzing activity is uncoupled from proton translocation. Similar results were obtained when F(ab')2 or Fab fragments were used. The immunoblot analysis of truncated b' subunits different in length showed that the antigenic determinants are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1522981661,"Recently, tetrahydroimidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) and 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) compounds have been shown to be potent, selective, and specific inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro. They interact with the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 in a way different from that of previously studied reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. We established an endogenous RT assay, starting from intact HIV-1 virions. This assay mimics the reverse transcription process in the HIV-infected cell more closely than RT assays with artificial templates. We investigated the inhibition of endogenous HIV-1 reverse transcription by the TIBO derivative (+)-(S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo [4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (R-82150) in comparison with the HEPT derivative 5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(phenylthio)uracil (E-EPU) and 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate. The kinetics and characteristics of RT inhibition by TIBO in the endogenous RT assay were similar to those found previously for the exogenous RT assay (following addition of exogenous template/primer); thus, RT inhibition by TIBO was specific for HIV-1 and the extent of RT inhibition was dependent on which of the four substrates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP) was present in limited concentrations. Of the three enzymatic activities, RNA-dependent DNA polymerization was preferentially inhibited, and inhibition was not competitive with respect to the natural substrates. HIV-1 RT behaved as an allosteric enzyme, which means that positive cooperativity for binding of the substrate was observed. TIBO behaved as an allosteric inhibitor by causing a concentration-dependent decrease in this cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1569835412,"We have studied the binding of 125I-labeled high density lipoproteins (HDL3) to liver plasma membranes, which are thought to contain specific HDL receptor sites, using anti-peptide antibodies directed against two sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of human apoA-I. Two distinct antibody populations raised to peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 205-220 and 230-243, respectively, recognized regions of apoA-I that are exposed in the lipid environment of HDL3. However, anti-AI[230-243] IgG, but not anti-AI[205-220] IgG, recognized HDL2, suggesting that residues 205-220 of apoA-I are expressed differently in the two HDL populations. In addition, anti-AI[230-243] IgG showed strong cross-reactivity toward apoA-II. Epitope mapping studies showed that anti-AI[230-243] binds to an epitope located in the carboxyl-terminus of apoA-II, demonstrating significant structural homology between the carboxyl-terminal of apoA-II, demonstrating significant structural homology between the carboxyl-terminal regions of apoA-I and A-II, two candidate proteins for mediating the specific cellular interaction of HDL3. Fab fragments from anti-AI[205-220] and anti-AI[230-243] inhibited the binding of 125I-HDL3 to liver plasma membranes by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively. These findings are in agreement with our recent work using isolated CNBr fragments of apoA-I (Morrison, J., Fidge, N. H., and Tozuka, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18780-18785), which suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of apoA-I contains a binding domain which mediates the specific interaction of HDL3 with liver plasma membranes, possibly through the involvement of specific HDL receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1566862745,"The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) is one of the two transmembrane proteins involved in transport of lysosomal enzymes. We have cloned the mouse CD-MPR gene and also a very unusual processed-type CD-MPR pseudogene. They are both present at one copy per haploid genome and map to chromosomes 6 and 3, respectively. Comparison of the complete 10-kilobase (kb) sequence of the functional gene with the cDNA indicates that it contains seven exons. Exon 1 encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA, the others (exons 2-7) encode the luminal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of the CD-MPR. Exon 7 also contains a 1.2-kb-long 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA. A unique transcription-initiation site was determined by primer extension of mouse liver mRNA. The promoter elements in the 5' upstream region of this site resemble those contained in genes constitutively transcribed. However, Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the CD-MPR is variably expressed in adult mouse tissues and during mouse development. The pseudogene, which is flanked by direct repeats, is almost colinear with the cDNA indicating that it presumably arose by reverse transcription of an mRNA. However, the pseudogene differs from the cDNA. It contains at its 5' end, an additional 340-nucleotide (nt) sequence homologous to the promoter region of the functional gene. This sequence exhibits some promoter activity in vitro. Furthermore, a 24-nt insertion interrupts the region homologous to the 5'-noncoding region of the cDNA. In the functional gene, this 24-nt sequence occurs between exon 1 and 2, where it is flanked by typical consensus sequences of exon/intron boundaries. Therefore, it may represent an additional exon of the functional gene. These two features of the pseudogene suggest that expression of the CD-MPR gene may be regulated by use of different promoters and/or alternative splicing."

The aim of this study was to characterize the basophil PG-binding sites by means of radioreceptor assays using 3H-labeled PGs. Scatchard analysis for pure (greater than 95%) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) basophils revealed two classes of PGE1-binding sites differing in their affinity for the natural ligand (Bmax1 = 217 +/- 65 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd1 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM; Bmax2 = 2462 +/- 381 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd2 = 47 +/- 20 nM; IC50 = PGE1 less than PGI2 less than PGD2 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha) as well as two classes of PGI2 (iloprost)-binding sites (Bmax1 = 324 +/- 145 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd1 = 0.5 +/- 0.3 nM; Bmax2 = 2541 +/- 381; Kd2 = 27 +/- 6 nM; IC50 = PGI2 less than PGE1 less than PGD2 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha. In addition, CML basophils exhibited a single class of PGD2-binding sites (Bmax = 378 +/- 98 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd = 13 +/- 4 nM; IC50: PGD2 less than PGI2 less than PGE1 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha). In contrast, we were unable to detect specific saturable PGE2-binding sites. Primary and immortalized (KU812) CML basophils revealed an identical pattern of PG receptor expression. Basophils (KU812) expressed significantly (p less than 0.001) lower number of PGE1 (PGI2)-binding sites (Bmax1: 9% (20%) of control; Bmax2: 36% (50%) of control) when cultured with recombinant interleukin 3 (rhIL-3), a basophil-activating cytokine, whereas rhIL-2 had no effect on PG receptor expression. Functional significance of binding of PGs to basophils was provided by the demonstration of a dose-dependent increase in cellular cAMP upon agonist activation, with PGE1 (ED50 = 1.7 +/- 1.1 nM) and PGI2 (ED50 = 2.8 +/- 2.3 nM) being the most potent compounds. These findings suggest that human basophils express specific receptors for PGE1, PGI2 as well as for PGD2."
https://openalex.org/W1545488325,"Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 contains an active site arginine believed to function in substrate binding. This arginine is thought to form an ionic interaction with the COOH-terminal carboxylate of NEP substrates. The functionality of arginine 102 has been investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis to produce mutants in which this residue was converted to a lysine, glycine, glutamine, or glutamate. All of the mutants exhibited essentially full activity as determined with a synthetic peptide amide, glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide. In contrast, activity was detected only with the wild-type enzyme and the lysine mutant using a synthetic substrate containing a free COOH-terminal carboxylate, dansyl-Gly-Trp-Gly. Inhibition studies with the physiologically active peptide substrates substance P, endothelin, and angiotensin I, as well as substance P free acid, [D-Ala2,Leu5]enkephalin, and [D-Ala2,Leu5]enkephalinamide indicated a lack of importance of arginine 102 in substrate binding. With [D-Ala2,Met5]enkephalin and the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, a significant decrease in affinity is observed with the arginine 102 mutants. These results suggest that the contribution of arginine 102 to substrate binding is dependent upon the strength of other subsite interactions. Examination of dipeptides as inhibitors indicates that the nature and orientation of the P'2 residue is important in determining the strength of the interaction of arginine 102 with its substrates."

In H. marismortui, the alpha-operon was found to be located immediately upstream from the S9 gene cluster. The gene order in the halobacterial alpha-operon, given according to the gene products, is tRNA(Ser), HmaS13, HmaS4, HmaS11, and HmaRp alpha. Compared to the corresponding operon from E. coli, the halobacterial gene organization differs in (i) the presence of a gene for tRNA(Ser) (GCU), (ii) the reversed order of the genes for the ribosomal proteins HmaS11 and HmaS4, and (iii) the absence of the gene coding for the ribosomal protein L17. The primary structure of HmaRp alpha shows high similarity to a subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (YeaRpB3, HsaRpB33), whereas the similarity to the eubacterial alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase is only weak."
