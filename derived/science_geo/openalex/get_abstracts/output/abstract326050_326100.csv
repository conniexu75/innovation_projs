https://openalex.org/W2136036783,"Data from the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's operational series of meteorological satellites were used to classify land cover and monitor vegetation dynamics for Africa over a 19-month period. There was a correspondence between seasonal variations in the density and extent of green-leaf vegetation and the patterns of rainfall associated with the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Regional variations, such as the 1983 drought in the Sahel of westem Africa, were observed. Integration of the weekly satellite data with respect to time for a 12-month period produced a remotely sensed estimate of primary production based upon the density and duration of green-leaf biomass. Eight of the 21-day composited data sets covering an 11-month period were used to produce a general land-cover classification that corresponded well with those of existing maps."
https://openalex.org/W2129198565,"Blood revenge is one of the most commonly cited causes of violence and warfare in tribal societies, yet it is largely ignored in recent anthropological theories of primitive warfare. A theory of tribal violence is presented showing how homicide, revenge, kinship obligations, and warfare are linked and why reproductive variables must be included in explanations of tribal violence and warfare. Studies of the Yanomamö Indians of Amazonas during the past 23 years show that 44 percent of males estimated to be 25 or older have participated in the killing of someone, that approximately 30 percent of adult male dealths are due to violence, and that nearly 70 percent of all adults over an estimated 40 years of age have lost a close genetic relative due to violence. Demographic data indicate that men who have killed have more wives and offspring than men who have not killed."

Single crystal x-ray diffraction data were used to determine a pseudo-tetragonal structure based on an A-centered orthorhombic subcell with a = 5.399 Å, b = 5.414 Å, and c = 30.904 Å. The structure contains copper-oxygen sheets as in La2CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O7, but the copper-oxygen chains present in YBa2Cu3O7 do not occur in Bi2Sr3-xCaxCu2O8+y. The structure is made up of alternating double copper-oxygen sheets and double bismuth-oxygen sheets. There are Ca2+ and Sr2+ cations between the adjacent Cu-O sheets; Sr2+ cations are also found between the Cu-O and Bi-O sheets. Electron microscopy studies show an incommensurate superstructure along the a axis that can be approximated by an increase of a factor of 5 over the subcell dimension. This superstructure is also observed by x-ray diffraction on single crystals, but twinning can make it appear that the superstructure is along both a and b axes. Flux exclusion begins in our samples at about 116 K and is very strong by 95 K. Electrical measurements on a single crystal of Bi2Sr3-xCaxCu2O8+y show a resistivity drop at about 116 K and apparent zero resistivity at 91 K."
https://openalex.org/W1984056659,"Experiments to investigate the quantum behavior of a macroscopic degree of freedom, namely the phase difference across a Josephson tunnel junction, are described. The experiments involve measurements of the escape rate of the junction from its zero voltage state. Low temperature measurements of the escape rate for junctions that are either nearly undamped or moderately damped agree very closely with predictions for macroscopic quantum tunneling, with no adjustable parameters. Microwave spectroscopy reveals quantized energy levels in the potential well of the junction in excellent agreement with quantum-mechanical calculations. The system can be regarded as a ""macroscopic nucleus with wires."""

https://openalex.org/W4233514000,"Attendance at the AAAS annual meeting in Boston was at a record high for recent years, with 8700 people braving the half-finished Hynes Convention Center as well as wet snow and gale-force winds that closed Logan Airport on the first full day of the conference. Some hardy participants arrived by train. Others, including some of the speakers, were required to stay in Boston longer than they had planned. But perhaps the Soviets, of which there were 13 in a high-ranking delegation, were made to feel at home. The sessions on Soviet science were a major drawing card; but many other symposia, ranging from the science of protein folding to arms control, attracted large audiences. Some highlights follow."
