https://openalex.org/W2057048269,"Allotropes of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium have been observed at elevated pressures with an x-ray diffraction camera which incorporates a diamondanvil, high-pressure cell. In each case a high-pressure modification was observed which has a face-centered cubic structure. At room temperature the unit cell dimensions (a0) for the high-pressure face-centered cubic structures and approximate pressures at which they were determined are as follows: La, 5.17 Å (23 kb); Ce, 4.82 Å (15 kb); Pr, 4.88 Å (40 kb); and Nd, 4.80 Å (50 kb). The unit cell dimensions for the high-pressure forms of La, Pr, and Nd apparently have never been reported."

During this period the osmotic pressure of the serum is greater than that found in animals adapted to fresh water or sea water. The urine collected from fish adapted to sea water is usually isotonkc to the blood. route, presumably the gills."

Some species having thin, fragile shells were absent from the sediments but present in the deep water off Bermuda. The subarctic species was present only in the sediments, which indicates that the subarctic current probably invaded the Bermuda region some time ago."

It is readily synthesized, however, at pressures from 18 to 45 kb and temperatures from 1150 degrees to 1400 degrees C. Its refractive indices approach those predicted for ferrosilite and it melts incongruently to an Fe, SiO(4)-rich liquid plus quartz."

Tetrahymena pyriformis, suspended in 10 percent dimethylsulfoxide, survived when frozen in two steps, first to -20 degrees C, then transferring immediately to a temperature of -196 degrees C. Motility and ability to reproduce were recovered after freezing by this method and subsequent storage for 3 months in a liquid nitrogen refrigerator."

They are short prismatic, showing {1120}, {3030}, {1011}, {0221}, with c/a 0.4521, measured with a goniometer, and distinct {1120} cleavage. With an unusual combination of cell dimensions, high density, high refractive indices, and extreme birefringence, this tourmaline falls outside the known elbaite-schorl and schorl-dravite series. A chemical analysis, recalculated on the basis of cell volume and density, gives close to the theoretical 150 atoms per cell, whether the iron is ferrous or ferric, but the physical properties indicate a ferric tourmaline."
