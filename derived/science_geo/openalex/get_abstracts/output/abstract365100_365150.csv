https://openalex.org/W2090191602,"Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution of wildfire, a complex abiotic process that responds to a variety of spatial and environmental gradients. How future climate change may alter global wildfire activity, however, is still largely unknown. As a first step to quantifying potential change in global wildfire, we present a multivariate quantification of environmental drivers for the observed, current distribution of vegetation fires using statistical models of the relationship between fire activity and resources to burn, climate conditions, human influence, and lightning flash rates at a coarse spatiotemporal resolution (100 km, over one decade). We then demonstrate how these statistical models can be used to project future changes in global fire patterns, highlighting regional hotspots of change in fire probabilities under future climate conditions as simulated by a global climate model. Based on current conditions, our results illustrate how the availability of resources to burn and climate conditions conducive to combustion jointly determine why some parts of the world are fire-prone and others are fire-free. In contrast to any expectation that global warming should necessarily result in more fire, we find that regional increases in fire probabilities may be counter-balanced by decreases at other locations, due to the interplay of temperature and precipitation variables. Despite this net balance, our models predict substantial invasion and retreat of fire across large portions of the globe. These changes could have important effects on terrestrial ecosystems since alteration in fire activity may occur quite rapidly, generating ever more complex environmental challenges for species dispersing and adjusting to new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the potential for widespread impacts of climate change on wildfire, suggesting severely altered fire regimes and the need for more explicit inclusion of fire in research on global vegetation-climate change dynamics and conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W1979704965,"Background Tumor associated fibroblasts (TAF), are essential for tumor progression providing both a functional and structural supportive environment. TAF, known as activated fibroblasts, have an established biological impact on tumorigenesis as matrix synthesizing or matrix degrading cells, contractile cells, and even blood vessel associated cells. The production of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, matrix-degrading enzymes, and immunomodulatory mechanisms by these cells augment tumor progression by providing a suitable environment. There are several suggested origins of the TAF including tissue-resident, circulating, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transitioned cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We provide evidence that TAF are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that acquire a TAF phenotype following exposure to or systemic recruitment into adenocarcinoma xenograft models including breast, pancreatic, and ovarian. We define the MSC derived TAF in a xenograft ovarian carcinoma model by the immunohistochemical presence of 1) fibroblast specific protein and fibroblast activated protein; 2) markers phenotypically associated with aggressiveness, including tenascin-c, thrombospondin-1, and stromelysin-1; 3) production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-6; and 4) factors indicative of vascularization, including alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and vascular endothelial growth factor. We demonstrate that under long-term tumor conditioning in vitro, MSC express TAF–like proteins. Additionally, human MSC but not murine MSC stimulated tumor growth primarily through the paracrine production of secreted IL6. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest the dependence of in vitro Skov-3 tumor cell proliferation is due to the presence of tumor-stimulated MSC secreted IL6. The subsequent TAF phenotype arises from the MSC which ultimately promotes tumor growth through the contribution of microvascularization, stromal networks, and the production of tumor-stimulating paracrine factors."

https://openalex.org/W1976747060,"Developmental, physiological and tissue engineering studies critical to the development of successful myocardial regeneration therapies require new ways to effectively visualize and isolate large numbers of fluorescently labeled, functional cardiomyocytes.Here we describe methods for the clonal expansion of engineered hESCs and make available a suite of lentiviral vectors for that combine Blasticidin, Neomycin and Puromycin resistance based drug selection of pure populations of stem cells and cardiomyocytes with ubiquitous or lineage-specific promoters that direct expression of fluorescent proteins to visualize and track cardiomyocytes and their progenitors. The phospho-glycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to ubiquitously direct expression of histone-2B fused eGFP and mCherry proteins to the nucleus to monitor DNA content and enable tracking of cell migration and lineage. Vectors with T/Brachyury and alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoters targeted fluorescent or drug-resistance proteins to early mesoderm and cardiomyocytes. The drug selection protocol yielded 96% pure cardiomyocytes that could be cultured for over 4 months. Puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes exhibited a gene expression profile similar to that of adult human cardiomyocytes and generated force and action potentials consistent with normal fetal cardiomyocytes, documenting these parameters in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes and validating that the selected cells retained normal differentiation and function.The protocols, vectors and gene expression data comprise tools to enhance cardiomyocyte production for large-scale applications."
https://openalex.org/W2171323155,"Background Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a debilitating disease of cattle. Ethiopia has one of the largest cattle populations in the world, with an economy highly dependent on its livestock. Furthermore, Ethiopia has one of the highest incidence rates of human extrapulmonary TB in the world, a clinical presentation that is often associated with transmission of M. bovis from cattle to humans. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present a comprehensive investigation of the prevalence of bTB in Ethiopia based on cases identified at slaughterhouses. Out of approximately 32,800 inspected cattle, ∼4.7% showed suspect tuberculous lesions. Culture of suspect lesions yielded acid-fast bacilli in ∼11% of cases, with M. bovis accounting for 58 of 171 acid-fast cultures, while 53 isolates were non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Strikingly, M. tuberculosis was isolated from eight cattle, an unusual finding that suggests human to animal transmission. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis has revealed that bTB is widely spread throughout Ethiopia, albeit at a low prevalence, and provides underpinning evidence for public health policy formulation."
https://openalex.org/W2035999846,"Background Reserves are the principal means to conserve forests and biodiversity, but the question of whether reserves work is still debated. In the Amazon, fires are closely linked to deforestation, and thus can be used as a proxy for reserve effectiveness in protecting forest cover. We ask whether reserves in the Brazilian Amazon provide effective protection against deforestation and consequently fires, whether that protection is because of their location or their legal status, and whether some reserve types are more effective than others. Methodology/Principal Findings Previous work has shown that most Amazonian fires occur close to roads and are more frequent in El Niño years. We quantified these relationships for reserves and unprotected areas by examining satellite-detected hot pixels regressed against road distance across the entire Brazilian Amazon and for a decade with 2 El Niño-related droughts. Deforestation fires, as measured by hot pixels, declined exponentially with increasing distance from roads in all areas. Fewer deforestation fires occurred within protected areas than outside and the difference between protected and unprotected areas was greatest near roads. Thus, reserves were especially effective at preventing these fires where they are known to be most likely to burn; but they did not provide absolute protection. Even within reserves, at a given distance from roads, there were more deforestation fires in regions with high human impact than in those with low impact. The effect of El Niño on deforestation fires was greatest outside of reserves and near roads. Indigenous reserves, limited-use reserves, and fully protected reserves all had fewer fires than outside areas and did not appear to differ in their effectiveness. Conclusions/Significance Taking time, regional factors, and climate into account, our results show that reserves are an effective tool for curbing destructive burning in the Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W1976471430,"In mammalian cells, the DNA damage-related histone H2A variant H2A.X is characterized by a C-terminal tyrosyl residue, Tyr-142, which is phosphorylated by an atypical kinase, WSTF. The phosphorylation status of Tyr-142 in H2A.X has been shown to be an important regulator of the DNA damage response by controlling the formation of gammaH2A.X foci, which are platforms for recruiting molecules involved in DNA damage repair and signaling. In this work, we present evidence to support the identification of the Eyes Absent (EYA) phosphatases, protein-tyrosine phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, as being responsible for dephosphorylating the C-terminal tyrosyl residue of histone H2A.X. We demonstrate that EYA2 and EYA3 displayed specificity for Tyr-142 of H2A.X in assays in vitro. Suppression of eya3 by RNA interference resulted in elevated basal phosphorylation and inhibited DNA damage-induced dephosphorylation of Tyr-142 of H2A.X in vivo. This study provides the first indication of a physiological substrate for the EYA phosphatases and suggests a novel role for these enzymes in regulation of the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2033200170,"Background Peroxisomal metabolic machinery requires a continuous flow of organic and inorganic solutes across peroxisomal membrane. Concerning small solutes, the molecular nature of their traffic has remained an enigma. Methods/Principal Findings In this study, we show that disruption in mice of the Pxmp2 gene encoding Pxmp2, which belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins with unknown function, leads to partial restriction of peroxisomal membrane permeability to solutes in vitro and in vivo. Multiple-channel recording of liver peroxisomal preparations reveals that the channel-forming components with a conductance of 1.3 nS in 1.0 M KCl were lost in Pxmp2−/− mice. The channel-forming properties of Pxmp2 were confirmed with recombinant protein expressed in insect cells and with native Pxmp2 purified from mouse liver. The Pxmp2 channel, with an estimated diameter of 1.4 nm, shows weak cation selectivity and no voltage dependence. The long-lasting open states of the channel indicate its functional role as a protein forming a general diffusion pore in the membrane. Conclusions/Significance Pxmp2 is the first peroxisomal channel identified, and its existence leads to prediction that the mammalian peroxisomal membrane is permeable to small solutes while transfer of “bulky” metabolites, e.g., cofactors (NAD/H, NADP/H, and CoA) and ATP, requires specific transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2062537820,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis is an opportunistic infection considered to be a harbinger of AIDS. The etiologic agent Candida albicans is a fungal species commonly colonizing human mucosal surfaces. However, under conditions of immune dysfunction, colonizing C. albicans can become an opportunistic pathogen causing superficial or even life-threatening infections. The reasons behind this transition, however, are not clear. In the oral cavity, salivary antimicrobial peptides are considered to be an important part of the host innate defense system in the prevention of microbial colonization. Histatin-5 specifically has exhibited potent activity against C. albicans. Our previous studies have shown histatin-5 levels to be significantly reduced in the saliva of HIV+ individuals, indicating an important role for histatin-5 in keeping C. albicans in its commensal stage. The versatility in the pathogenic potential of C. albicans is the result of its ability to adapt through the regulation of virulence determinants, most notably of which are proteolytic enzymes (Saps), involved in tissue degradation. In this study, we show that C. albicans cells efficiently and rapidly degrade histatin-5, resulting in loss of its anti-candidal potency. In addition, we demonstrate that this cellular activity is due to proteolysis by a member of the secreted aspartic proteases (Sap) family involved in C. albicans pathogenesis. Specifically, the proteolysis was attributed to Sap9, in turn identifying histatin-5 as the first host-specific substrate for that isoenzyme. These findings demonstrate for the first time the ability of a specific C. albicans enzyme to degrade and deactivate a host antimicrobial peptide involved in the protection of the oral mucosa against C. albicans, thereby providing new insights into the factors directing the transition of C. albicans from commensal to pathogen, with important clinical implications for alternative therapy. This report characterizes the first defined mechanism behind the enhanced susceptibility of HIV+ individuals to oral candidiasis since the emergence of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2100694891,"Background Recent clinical trials of VEGF inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of recurrent glioblastomas (GBM). However, the survival benefit is usually short-lived as tumors escape anti-VEGF therapies. Here we tested the hypothesis that Platelet Derived Growth Factor-C (PDGF-C), an isoform of the PDGF family, affects GBM progression independent of VEGF pathway and hinders anti-VEGF therapy. Principal Findings We first showed that PDGF-C is present in human GBMs. Then, we overexpressed or downregulated PDGF-C in a human GBM cell line, U87MG, and grew them in cranial windows in nude mice to assess vessel structure and function using intravital microscopy. PDGF-C overexpressing tumors had smaller vessel diameters and lower vascular permeability compared to the parental or siRNA-transfected tumors. Furthermore, vessels in PDGF-C overexpressing tumors had more extensive coverage with NG2 positive perivascular cells and a thicker collagen IV basement membrane than the controls. Treatment with DC101, an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, induced decreases in vessel density in the parental tumors, but had no effect on the PDGF-C overexpressing tumors. Conclusion These results suggest that PDGF-C plays an important role in glioma vessel maturation and stabilization, and that it can attenuate the response to anti-VEGF therapy, potentially contributing to escape from vascular normalization."
https://openalex.org/W2159418655,"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a compelling endophenotype (biological markers) for mental disorders including schizophrenia. In a previous study, we identified Fabp7, a fatty acid binding protein 7 as one of the genes controlling PPI in mice and showed that this gene was associated with schizophrenia. We also demonstrated that disrupting Fabp7 dampened hippocampal neurogenesis. In this study, we examined a link between neurogenesis and PPI using different animal models and exploring the possibility of postnatal manipulation of neurogenesis affecting PPI, since gene-deficient mice show biological disturbances from prenatal stages. In parallel, we tested the potential for dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), arachidonic acid (ARA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), to promote neurogenesis and improve PPI. PUFAs are ligands for Fabp members and are abundantly expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells in the hippocampus. Our results are: (1) an independent model animal, Pax6 (+/−) rats, exhibited PPI deficits along with impaired postnatal neurogenesis; (2) methylazoxymethanol acetate (an anti-proliferative drug) elicited decreased neurogenesis even in postnatal period, and PPI defects in young adult rats (10 weeks) when the drug was given at the juvenile stage (4–5 weeks); (3) administering ARA for 4 weeks after birth promoted neurogenesis in wild type rats; (4) raising Pax6 (+/−) pups on an ARA-containing diet enhanced neurogenesis and partially improved PPI in adult animals. These results suggest the potential benefit of ARA in ameliorating PPI deficits relevant to psychiatric disorders and suggest that the effect may be correlated with augmented postnatal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2025718559,"Mechanisms by which attainment of specific body sizes trigger developmental transitions to adulthood (e.g. puberty or metamorphosis) are incompletely understood. In Drosophila, metamorphosis is triggered by ecdysone synthesis from the prothoracic gland (PG), whereas growth rate is increased by insulin/insulin growth factor signalling (IIS). Transgene-induced activation of PI3K, the major effector of IIS, within the PG advances the onset of metamorphosis via precocious ecdysone synthesis, raising the possibility that IIS triggers metamorphosis via PI3K activation in the PG. Here we show that blocking the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in the insulin producing cells (IPCs) increases IIS. This increased IIS increases larval growth rate and also advances the onset of metamorphosis, which is accompanied by precocious ecdysone synthesis and increased transcription of at least one ecdysone biosynthetic gene. Our observations suggest that IIS is regulated by PKA pathway activity in the IPCs. In addition, taken together with previous findings, our observations are consistent with the possibility that, in Drosophila, attainment of a specific body size triggers metamorphosis via the IIS-mediated activation of PI3K and hence ecdysone synthesis in the PG."
https://openalex.org/W2100793847,"Background Recent evidence suggests that co-clustering of Fas/CD95 death receptor and lipid rafts plays a major role in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings By a combination of genetic, biochemical, and ultrastructural approaches, we provide here compelling evidence for the involvement of lipid raft aggregates containing recruited Fas/CD95 death receptor, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), and procaspase-8 in the induction of apoptosis in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells by the antitumor drug edelfosine, the prototype compound of a promising family of synthetic antitumor lipids named as synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that edelfosine induced the generation of the so-called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), made up of Fas/CD95, FADD, and procaspase-8, in lipid rafts. Electron microscopy analyses allowed to visualize the formation of raft clusters and their co-localization with DISC components Fas/CD95, FADD, and procaspase-8 following edelfosine treatment of Jurkat cells. Silencing of Fas/CD95 by RNA interference, transfection with a FADD dominant-negative mutant that blocks Fas/CD95 signaling, and specific inhibition of caspase-8 prevented the apoptotic response triggered by edelfosine, hence demonstrating the functional role of DISC in drug-induced apoptosis. By using radioactive labeled edelfosine and a fluorescent analogue, we found that edelfosine accumulated in lipid rafts, forming edelfosine-rich membrane raft clusters in Jurkat leukemic T-cells. Disruption of these membrane raft domains abrogated drug uptake and drug-induced DISC assembly and apoptosis. Thus, edelfosine uptake into lipid rafts was critical for the onset of both co-aggregation of DISC in membrane rafts and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Conclusions/Significance This work shows the involvement of DISC clusters in lipid raft aggregates as a supramolecular and physical entity responsible for the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells by the antitumor drug edelfosine. Our data set a novel framework and paradigm in leukemia therapy, as well as in death receptor-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966991766,"Background Whale sharks are a declining species for which little biological data is available. While these animals are protected in many parts of their range, they are fished legally and illegally in some countries. Baseline biological and ecological data are needed to allow the formulation of an effective conservation plan for whale sharks. It is not known, for example, whether the whale shark is represented by a single worldwide panmictic population or by numerous, reproductively isolated populations. Genetic analysis of population structure is one essential component of the baseline data required for whale shark conservation. Methodology/Principal Findings We have identified 8 polymorphic microsatellites in the whale shark and used these markers to assess genetic variation and population structure in a panel of whale sharks covering a broad geographic region. This is the first record of microsatellite loci in the whale shark, which displayed an average of 9 alleles per locus and mean Ho = 0.66 and He = 0.69. All but one of the eight loci meet the expectations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Analysis of these loci in whale sharks representing three major portions of their range, the Pacific (P), Caribbean (C), and Indian (I) Oceans, determined that there is little population differentiation between animals sampled in different geographic regions, indicating historical gene flow between populations. FST values for inter-ocean comparisons were low (P×C = 0.0387, C×I = 0.0296 and P×I = −0.0022), and only C×I approached statistical significance (p = 0.0495). Conclusions/Significance We have shown only low levels of genetic differentiation between geographically distinct whale shark populations. Existing satellite tracking data have revealed both regional and long-range migration of whale sharks throughout their range, which supports the finding of gene flow between populations. Whale sharks traverse geographic and political boundaries during their life history and interbreed with animals from distant populations; conservation efforts must therefore target international protection for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2075692785,"Damage of presynaptic mitochondria could result in release of proapoptotic factors that threaten the integrity of the entire neuron. We discovered that α-synuclein (Syn) forms a triple complex with anionic lipids (such as cardiolipin) and cytochrome c, which exerts a peroxidase activity. The latter catalyzes covalent hetero-oligomerization of Syn with cytochrome c into high molecular weight aggregates. Syn is a preferred substrate of this reaction and is oxidized more readily than cardiolipin, dopamine, and other phenolic substrates. Co-localization of Syn with cytochrome c was detected in aggregates formed upon proapoptotic stimulation of SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells and in dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons of rotenone-treated rats. Syn-cardiolipin exerted protection against cytochrome c-induced caspase-3 activation in a cell-free system, particularly in the presence of H2O2. Direct delivery of Syn into mouse embryonic cells conferred resistance to proapoptotic caspase-3 activation. Conversely, small interfering RNA depletion of Syn in HeLa cells made them more sensitive to dopamine-induced apoptosis. In human Parkinson disease substantia nigra neurons, two-thirds of co-localized Syn-cytochrome c complexes occurred in Lewy neurites. Taken together, these results indicate that Syn may prevent execution of apoptosis in neurons through covalent hetero-oligomerization of cytochrome c. This immediate protective function of Syn is associated with the formation of the peroxidase complex representing a source of oxidative stress and postponed damage.

In nigrostriatal dopaminergic synaptic terminals, mitochondria, harboring a host of death-initiating factors, are in peril of damage by reactive oxygen species generated by disrupted electron transport and/or oxidative metabolism of dopamine (DA). Because cytochrome c (cyt c)-dependent formation of apoptosomes and activation of caspases designates a point of no return in the apoptotic program, release of proapoptotic factors from synaptic mitochondria could threaten the integrity of the entire neuron. How neurons protect themselves against inadvertent release of death signals from damaged synaptic mitochondria is not known. The N-terminal fragment of Syn contains six variants of an 11-amino acid consensus motif that include an apolipoprotein-like class A2 helix participating in binding of different lipids, particularly anionic phospholipids (5.Shults C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This domain is believed to be important for Syn functions in regulation of neuronal lipid metabolism, particularly turnover of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL) (6.Ellis C.E. Murphy E.J. Mitchell D.C. Golovko M.Y. Scaglia F. Barcelo-Coblijn G.C. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10190-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of the Syn lipid binding capacity in regulating neuronal injury (apoptotic) responses has not been established. It is believed that oxidative stress participates in the accumulation of LB and Lewy neurites (LN) through yet to be identified pathways (7.Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Reportedly, Syn is co-localized with cyt c in LBs (8.Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Hsu L.J. Takenouchi T. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), indicating a potential interaction between the two proteins. Because cyt c is a redox-active hemeprotein (9.Burkitt M. Jones C. Lawrence A. Wardman P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2004; 71: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10.Qian S.Y. Chen Y.R. Deterding L.J. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 281-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its presence in the LBs in conjunction with Syn may also provide a mechanistic link of LBs with oxidative stress. We have recently reported that cyt c interacts with CL in mitochondria early in apoptosis and with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the plasma membrane after its release into the cytosol (11.Jiang J. Kini V. Belikova N. Serinkan B.F. Borisenko G.G. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Kagan V.E. Lipids. 2004; 39: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12.Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J.

Biol. 2005; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In both cases, this results in redox activation of cyt c and the production of complexes with high peroxidase activity that effectively catalyze peroxidation of the respective phospholipids (13.Bayır H. Fadeel B. Palladino M. Witasp E. Kurnikov I. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Amoscato A. Jiang J. Kochanek P.M. DeKosky S. Greenberger J. Shvedova A.A. Kagan V.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, we hypothesize and provide experimental evidence that Syn acts as a sacrificial scavenger of cytosolic cyt c inadvertently released from synaptic mitochondria to prevent its migration into the soma, i.e. spread of the proapoptotic signal and cell death. This vital function is realized through the emergence of a peroxidase activity of the cyt c-Syn-phospholipid complex that cross-links its components and yields covalently conjugated protein-lipid hetero-oligomers. The latter maintain lingering peroxidase activity. Thus protection against acute apoptotic cell death comes with a penalty of Syn-cyt c aggregation into a peroxidase complex capable of inducing protracted oxidative stress. Our results present a novel biochemical mechanism likely involved in Lewy body formation and explain a known paradox of a dual protective and deleterious role that Syn plays in neuronal cells. HeLa, HL-60, and SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimum essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.05 mm nonessential amino acids. For apoptosis induction, HeLa cells were incubated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) (400 μm) or ActD (200 ng/ml) for 16 h; SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with t-BuOOH (10 μm for 16 h) or ActD (10 μg/ml for 18 h). At the end of incubation, the attached cells were harvested by trypsinization and pooled with the detached cells from supernatant for PS externalization analysis and immunostaining. Cyt c-deficient HeLa cells were generated using siRNA-expressing plasmid (pSEC hygro vector, Ambion) as described previously (12.Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A.

Biol. 2005; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 25 mm HEPES, 50 mg/liter uridine, 110 mg/liter pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.05 mm 2′-mercaptoethanol. Syn knockdown HeLa cells were generated using siRNA-expressing plasmid (pSEC hygro vector, Ambion). Target sequence (AAGAGGGTGTTCTCTATGTAG) was cloned into pSEC hygro vector, and the resultant plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells. Positive clones were selected by hygromycin. Mouse embryonic cells (MECs) (courtesy of X. Wang, University of Texas, Dallas) were derived from 8- to 9-day-old mouse embryos by Li et al. (14.Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). MECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 25 mm HEPES, 50 mg/liter uridine, 110 mg /liter pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.05 mm 2′-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 × 106 units/liter mouse leukemia inhibitory factor. Syn protein was delivered into cells using Chariot (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 0.03 × 106/well in a 24-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Chariot-Syn complex (2 μl, 0.5 μg) was incubated with cells for 3 h for integration. After that, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml ActD for 18 h. At the end of incubation, attached cells were harvested by trypsinization and pooled with detached cells from supernatant. Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using a caspase-3/7 Glo kit (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA). Liposomes containing dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and tetraoleoyl-CL (TOCL) (or other anionic lipids) (lipid/DOPC ratio 1:1), were prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, by sonication under N2 and used immediately after preparation. To prevent redox cycling with free metals, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (100 μm) was added to all solutions used. Fibrillated (aged) Syn was prepared by incubation of wild-type Syn and its mutants (200 μm) in 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm DTPA, pH 7.4, with shaking at 200 rpm for 6 days at 37 °C. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (12.Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova I.I. Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested cells were resuspended in isolation buffer containing 300 mm mannitol, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) homogenized on ice with a glass homogenizer, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was collected as the mitochondrial fraction. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad assay. Recombinant Syn was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Synuclein was diluted in water (to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml), divided into aliquots, and stored at −20 °C until use. In all model experiments in Fig. 1, b–d, and Fig. 2a, the following conditions were utilized: Syn (1.5 μm) was incubated with 0.5 μm cyt c and TOCL/DOPC liposomes (TOCL/Syn ratio 25:1) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 60 min at 37 °C. Incubation volume was 50 μl. 50 μm H2O2 was added to the incubation mixture every 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of catalase (0.1 mg/ml).FIGURE 2Formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes and covalent cross-linked aggregates of cyt c/TOCL with wild-type Syn (intact and aged) and its mutants A53T and A30P. a, native PAGE of Syn-cyt c-TOCL hetero-oligomeric complexes (staining with SilverSNAP stain kit, ThermoFisher) (left panel). Syn (8 μm) was incubated with TOCL/DOPC liposomes (TOCL/Syn ratio 20:1) and cyt c (8 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Assessment of Syn binding to CL/cyt c using NBD-CL fluorescence (right panel) is shown. Inset, typical fluorescence spectra obtained from the following: CL/NBD-CL liposomes (uppermost curve), CL/NBD-CL-cyt c complexes (lowest curve), and CL/NBD-CL/cyt c after titration with wild-type (Wt) Syn (1) and mutant forms of Syn A53T (2) and A30P (3) (1.75 μm). b, SDS-PAGE (12%) with subsequent Western blot analysis (using anti-Syn antibody) of cross-links formed after incubation of wild-type (wt) Syn, A53T Syn, and A30P Syn with cyt c/TOCL in the presence of H2O2. Wild-type Syn, A30P, and A53T mutants underwent hetero-oligomeric covalent cross-linking with cyt c in a similar way. c, SDS-PAGE (7.5%) with subsequent Western blot analysis (using anti-Syn antibody) of Syn-cyt c-CL covalent cross-links formed by incubation of nonfibrillated and fibrillated (aged) Syn with cyt c/TOCL in the presence of H2O2. Comparable covalent cross-linking of nonfibrillated and fibrillated Syn was observed in the presence of cyt c, TOCL, and H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE run in Mini-Protean 3 system (Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine buffer. 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis was run in horizontal gel system “Mupid-21” (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.) in nondenaturing buffer (43 mm imidazole, 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). In experiments with the HeLa cells, proteins were extracted with 1% SDS after cells were washed with PBS. The separated proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 (PBS-T, 0.05%) or Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (anti-synuclein, anti-cyt c, anti-dityrosine, or anti-5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) antibodies) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed 3–4 times followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) for horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody or Lumi-Phos Western blot (Pierce) for alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody as described by the manufacturer. The density of bands was determined by scanning with Epi Chemi II Darkroom (UVP BioImaging Systems, Upland, CA). Peroxidase activity of cyt c was determined by methods utilizing fluorescence, gel electrophoresis, and EPR spectroscopy as follows. (i) Fluorescence of resorufin, an oxidation product of Amplex Red (λex 570 nm, λem 585 nm) was measured using Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). For determination of peroxidase activity, different amounts of Syn were incubated with 0.5 μm cyt c, liposomes (TOCL/DOPC ratio 1:1; TOCL/cyt c ratio 25:1), 50 μm Amplex Red, 50 mm H2O2. (ii) Peroxidase activity in gel was determined after native electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose. Gels were incubated in solution containing SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce), and chemiluminescence was determined by scanning with Epi Chemi II Darkroom (UVP BioImaging Systems, Upland, CA). (iii) EPR spectroscopy of etoposide phenoxyl radicals produced by oxidation of etoposide was performed at 25 °C under the following conditions: 3,350 G center field; 50 G sweep width, 0.5 G field modulation; 10 milliwatt microwave power; 0.1-s time constant; 2,000 receiver gain; and 4-min time scan. Different amounts of Syn were incubated with 5 μm cyt c, liposomes (TOCL/DOPC ratio 1:1; TOCL/cyt c ratio 25:1), 100 μm etoposide, and 100 μm H2O2. Cyt c (80 μm) was incubated with DOPC/TOCL liposomes (DOPC/TOCL = 1:1; 4 mm total lipid) and Syn for 5 min at room temperature in 25 mm HEPES-Na buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm DTPA (N2-conditions); then H2O2 (800 μm) was added. The reaction was stopped after 5 s by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K under the following conditions: 3230 G, centered field; 100 G, sweep width; 5 G, field modulation; 5 milliwatts, microwave power; 0.1 s, time constant; and 2-min time scan. Dependence of relative magnitude (percentage of the maximal magnitude) of EPR signals of tyrosyl radicals on square root from microwave power (in milliwatts) was presented as saturation curves. The spin-lattice relaxation time was determined by fitting the experimental curve of radical signal saturation to the theoretical one as described previously (15.Castner T.G.J. Phys. Rev. 1959; 115: 1506-1515Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Samples were digested with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C overnight. Digested samples were precipitated with cold perchloric acid (final concentration 0.53 n). Samples were allowed to stand 10 min on an ice bath and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 × g. After neutralization with 2 n KOH, the precipitate of potassium perchlorate crystals was discarded by centrifugation (15 min at 3,000 × g). Supernatants were diluted with 0.2 m HEPES, pH 9.0, and fluorescence was measured (λex 315, λem 420 nm). CL/cyt c complexes were formed by incubation of DOPC/CL liposomes (5 μm total lipids, including 1 μm CL and 0.05 μm 1,1′,2-trioleoyl-2′-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-cardiolipin (NBD-CL, custom-synthesized by Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and cyt c (0.05 μm) for 2 min. NBD-CL fluorescence spectra were recorded in the range of 500–650 nm (excitation wavelength of 480 nm, slits 10 and 10 nm) using a Shimadzu F5301-PC spectrofluorometer. NBD fluorescence was monitored 2 min after addition of Syn aliquots (0.25 μm each). After SDS-gel electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining, and bands corresponding to high molecular weight Syn-cyt c complexes were excised. Destaining was achieved by several washes with 25 mm NH4CO3, 50% CH3CN. Gel pieces were reduced in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were washed, dehydrated, and dried. The complexes were subjected first to overnight in-gel digestion with trypsin (25 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8) followed by overnight digestion with endoproteinase-Glu-C (25 ng/μl in the same buffer). Peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and evaporated to near dryness. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Ultraflex mass spectrometer in positive reflector mode (20 kV) with a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). At least 500 laser shots were averaged to get each spectrum. Masses were calibrated to known peptide standards (purchased from Applied Biosystems) on the same day of analysis. 30-μl aliquots of each of the digests were acidified with 1.5 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), and then taken up into a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) that had been prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions. The bound peptides were desalted with two 15-μl washes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted with 2 μl of aqueous, acidic acetonitrile (67% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The eluant was mixed with 1 μl of freshly prepared cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid stock solution (20 mg/ml cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in aqueous acetonitrile as above), and 1-μl portions of this mixture were spotted onto a MALDI sample plate for air-drying. Potential cross-linked candidates identified by the MALDI run were subjected to sequence analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). LC-ESI-MS was performed on a Micromass triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). A microcapillary column (10-cm × 75-μm inner diameter) was packed in-house using 5-μm C18 particles (PerSeptive Biosystems). Flow rates were generated with a Rainin high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with an LC-Packings microflow processor and maintained at 180 nl/min. The Syn-cyt c tryptic/Glu-C digest fragments were loaded onto the microcapillary column, washed in 0.1% acetic acid in water (buffer A), and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid (buffer B) over 30 min. Fragmentation of potential cross-linked species identified by LC-ESI-MS was performed using a collision energy ramp and argon as the collision gas. DOPC/CL liposomes (5 nmol of total lipids, 1:1) were incubated with Syn (100 pmol) for 15 min. The mixture was then incubated in the presence of acridine 10-nonyl bromide (NAO, 2–10 nmol) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Samples (10 μl) were applied to 7.5% PAGE, and electrophoresis was performed (1 h at 120 V). Unbound Syn was stained with SilverSNAP stain kit from Pierce and quantified by optical density. CL/ Syn binding constants were calculated using Equation 1, {NAO}α-synucleinfree=KLipid-α-synucleinKLipid-NAO(Eq. 1) where Klipid-NAO = 2 × 106 m−1 for CL (16.Petit J.M. Maftah A. Ratinaud M.H. Julien R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). TLCL and its oxidized species were extracted from the incubation medium by Folch procedure (17.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and evaporated under N2. DOPC/TLCL liposomes (250 μm at a ratio of 1:1) were incubated with cyt c (5 μm) and H2O2 (100 μm were added every 15 min during incubation) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4 + 100 μm DTPA) in the absence and presence of Syn (15 μm). TLCL hydroperoxides were determined by fluorescence HPLC of products formed in microperoxidase 11-catalyzed reaction with a fluorogenic substrate, Amplex Red, N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (12.Kagan V.E.

For ESI-MS analysis, TLCL and its oxidation products were resuspended in chloroform/methanol 1:2 v/v (20 pmol/μl) and analyzed by direct infusion (flow rate of 5 μl/min) into a quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer LXQ (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) The electrospray probe was operated at a voltage differential of 5 kV in the negative ion mode. Source temperature was maintained at 150 °C. Human HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cytosol extracts (S-100) were obtained as described previously (19.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, the cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% digitonin, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 2 min at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 4 °C for 50 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was collected as S-100 and kept at −80 °C until further use. For caspase-3 activation, S-100 (5 μg/μl) was incubated with 1 mm dATP and 1 μm cyt c for 90 min at 37 °C, and caspase-3 activity was normalized as 100%. Syn (13 μm) was added alone or in complex with TOCL (at a ratio of 3:1). The caspase-3 activity was evaluated as described in the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen, Enzchek caspase-3 assay kit). All animal use was in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and was approved by the Pittsburgh University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Surgeries were performed as described previously (20.Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2078820067,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy associated with mutations in complement proteins, most frequently in the main plasma alternative pathway regulator factor H (FH). The hotspot for the FH mutations is in domains 19–20 (FH19–20) that are indispensable for FH activity on C3b bound covalently to host cells. In aHUS, down-regulation of cell-bound C3b by FH is impaired, but it is not clear whether this is due to an altered FH binding to surface-bound C3b or to cell surface structures. To explore the molecular pathogenesis of aHUS we tested binding of 14 FH19–20 point mutants to C3b and its C3d fragment, mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGEnC-1), and heparin. The cell binding correlated well, but not fully, with heparin binding and the cell binding site was overlapping but distinct from the C3b/C3d binding site that was shown to extend to domain 19. Our results show that aHUS-associated FH19–20 mutants have different combinations of three primary defects: impaired binding to C3b/C3d, impaired binding to the mGEnC-1 cells/heparin, and, as a novel observation, an enhanced mGEnC-1 cell or heparin binding. We propose a model of the molecular pathogenesis of aHUS where all three mechanisms lead eventually to impaired control of C3b on the endothelial cell surfaces. Based on the results with the aHUS patient mutants and the overlap in FH19–20 binding sites for mGEnC-1/heparin and C3b/C3d we conclude that binding of FH19–20 to C3b/C3d is essential for target discrimination by the alternative pathway.

In aHUS cases point mutations have been found in complement components C3, factor B, CD46, factor I, and factor H (FH), all of which play a role in the activation or control of the alternative pathway (3.Fremeaux-Bacchi V.

More than half of the mutations have been found to originate in the HF1 gene that encodes FH and FH-like protein 1.The alternative pathway is initiated spontaneously by hydrolysis of C3 to C3H2O that forms the C3-convertase C3H2OBb (9.Lesavre P.H.

This enzyme complex converts numerous C3 molecules to C3b that are covalently bound onto practically any nearby surface (11.Law S.K. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On a so-called activator surface, such as a microbe, the surface-bound C3b molecules are not efficiently eliminated and therefore new C3bBb complexes are formed leading to more C3b depositions and eventually effective opsonization or damage of the target cell. On non-activator surfaces, such as viable self (host) cells, factor I cleaves C3b to inactive C3b (iC3b) in the presence of one of the cofactors (CD46, CD35, FH, and FHL-1) (12.Harrison R.A.

This 150-kDa glycoprotein consists of 20 tandemly arranged short consensus repeat domains that are composed of ∼60 amino acids. Domains 1–4 are essential for the cofactor and decay accelerating activity (20.Gordon D.L. Kaufman R.M. Blackmore T.K. Kwong J. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). In the middle region of FH (domains 5–15) there are two binding sites for C-reactive protein (21.Jarva H. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J.

The C terminus of FH is crucial in self-cell protection as demonstrated by the severity of the aHUS cases and also in a recent mouse model of aHUS where domains 16–20 had been deleted (30.Ferreira V.P.

Binding of mouse or human FH to glomerular endothelial cells has not been characterized despite the fact that in aHUS damage occurs mainly in the small vessels, especially in the glomeruli.The molecular pathogenesis leading to the clinical aHUS in patients with FH mutations remains elusive. The suggested molecular mechanisms for some aHUS-associated mutations include defective binding of the mutated FH to GAGs, endothelial cells, or C3b/C3d (28.Herbert A.P. Uhrín D. Lyon M.

The aim of this study was to define the effects of nine aHUS-associated FH mutations and five other structurally closely located mutations on binding of FH19–20 to C3b, C3d, mouse glomerular endothelial cells, and heparin. We identified three primary defects of the mutants: impaired C3b/C3d binding, enhanced mGEnC-1/heparin binding, and impaired mGEnC-1/heparin binding that could lead via three mechanisms to incapability of FH to eliminate C3b on plasma-exposed self-cells. The results clarify the mechanism of target discrimination of the alternative pathway by the C terminus of FH.DISCUSSIONAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare but severe disease that typically affects children and adolescents. Mutations in several complement proteins have been reported from the patients but more than half of these are accounted for by mutations in the HF1 gene that codes FH. Molecular mechanisms underlying the association of mutations in FH with aHUS have, however, largely remained elusive. In this study we have characterized the effects of nine aHUS-associated and five non-associated mutations on binding of FH19–20 to C3b, C3d, mouse glomerular endothelial cells, and heparin. The results show that the aHUS-associated FH mutations cause different combinations of three primary defects. We also show, for the first time, the binding site for mouse glomerular endothelial cells in FH domain 20 and demonstrate that the binding site for C3b/C3d is likely to extend from domain 20 to domain 19. Finally, the results indicate that FH19–20 needs to bind to C3b/C3d to enable full activity of FH.Three primary defects were identified in our set of nine aHUS mutations: impaired binding to C3b/C3d, enhanced binding to mouse glomerular endothelial cells, and impaired binding to glomerular endothelial cells (Table 1). Five of the aHUS-associated mutants had impaired binding to C3b (W1157LaHUS, R1182AaHUS, W1183LaHUS, T1184RaHUS, and R1210AaHUS) and two of these did not have either of the other primary defects. This indicates that defects in C3b binding of FH19–20 alone can lead to aHUS and that binding of FH19–20 to C3b/C3d is essential for full activity of FH (Fig. 7, aHUS mechanism i). A role of impaired C3b/C3d binding in aHUS has also been previously suggested and so far a total of 10 mutations have been described with this defect (W1157RaHUS, R1182AaHUS, W1183LaHUS, W1183RaHUS, V1197AaHUS, E1198AaHUS, R1210CaHUS, R1215GaHUS, P1226SaHUS, and S1191L/V1197A) (29.Jokiranta T.S.

Therefore all the available data indicates that the loss of C3b/C3d binding is typical in aHUS and may lead to the disease in the absence of other functional defects.In this study we describe a novel defect of FH in aHUS, where three aHUS-associated mutants (T1184RaHUS, L1189RaHUS, and E1198AaHUS) have enhanced binding to mouse glomerular endothelial cells and heparin with normal C3b or C3d binding (Table 1). This gain-of-function does not lead to sequestration of FH to inappropriate compartments of the body because the patients with these mutations have at least normal plasma levels of FH (41.Pérez-Caballero D.

Therefore the findings with these mutants suggest novel concepts for both the target discrimination between the activator/nonactivator surfaces by FH and the pathogenesis of aHUS in these patients. In target discrimination the typical model is that on nonactivator surfaces the C terminus of FH binds to the cell surface molecules such as heparan sulfate leading to enhanced elimination of the surface-bound C3b molecules by the N-terminal effector functions of FH. The model clearly contains the right players but it fails to consider that the C terminus of FH might eventually need to bind to the C3d part of C3b for effective elimination of the surface-bound C3b molecules. On the basis of our data it can be suggested that in a physiological situation heparin forms a temporary encounter complex with FH19–20 and subsequently there is transfer of FH19–20 to the C3d portion of C3b, because of the higher affinity of the protein-protein interaction relative to that of the protein/GAG interaction (Fig. 7).The suggested model of the alternative pathway discrimination is supported by the results that binding of the C terminus of FH to heparin and C3b is competitive (44.Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Friese M.A. Wolk T.U. Kampen E. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6935-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) making a ternary complex between FH19–20, heparin (or other GAGs), and C3b unlikely. The key question is if it matters for function of full FH whether its C terminus is bound to heparin or the C3d portion of C3b on a surface. Our results with the mutant W1183L, found from an aHUS patient, indicate that it matters. This mutant shows normal heparin binding and decreased C3b/C3d binding indicating that normal heparin binding cannot compensate for loss of the C3b/C3d binding because the patient suffered from clinical aHUS. Therefore it is clear that a heparin-bound FH is not itself functionally fully active if it is unable to bind to the C3d part of C3b. This means that C3b/C3d binding is essentially needed for the physiological function of FH19–20 on cell-bound C3b. With this clarified model the explanation of the molecular pathogenesis of mutants T1184R, L1189R, and E1198A is logical. Because the heparin and C3b binding sites on FH19–20 are overlapping the enhanced heparin binding can lead to decreased C3b/C3d binding. Because normal C3b/C3d binding is needed for the fully functional molecule the elimination of cell-bound C3b is impaired leading to clinical aHUS. In this way the gain-of-function in heparin or cell binding eventually leads to loss-of-function in elimination of C3b (Fig. 7, mechanism ii).The third primary defect was described only by one mutant, R1215QaHUS, that had wild-type-like binding to C3b/C3d and impaired binding to heparin and possibly also to mGEnC-1 (Figs. 4D and 5D). Although the result for the mGEnC-1 binding was not statistically significant in our experiments, the role of Arg-1215 in cell binding is likely because a different mutation of the same residue, R1215GaHUS, has previously been shown to impair binding of FH8–20 to C3b, heparin, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (34.Manuelian T. Hellwage J. Meri S. Caprioli J. Noris M. Heinen S. Jozsi M. Neumann H.P. Remuzzi G. Zipfel P.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus it may be that impaired binding of heparin/cells alone without loss of C3b/C3d binding can also lead to aHUS, as has been suggested before (Fig. 7, mechanism iii) (34.Manuelian T. Hellwage J. Meri S. Caprioli J. Noris M. Heinen S. Jozsi M. Neumann H.P. Remuzzi G. Zipfel P.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 45.Jokiranta T.S. Cheng Z.Z.

Path. 2005; 167: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This mutant, R1215QaHUS, however, is the only mutant published to date where a heparin binding defect has been observed in the absence of defect in C3b/C3d binding.We detected at least one functional defect with eight of the nine aHUS-associated mutants (Table 1). The only mutant that appeared functionally normal in our analyses was the mutant D1119GaHUS. The mutation has been described from one individual whose sibling was also affected but his/her sequence analysis has not been published (42.Richards A. Buddles M.R. Donne R.L. Kaplan B.S. Kirk E. Venning M.C. Tielemans C.L. Goodship J.A. Goodship T.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 485-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). At the time of the publication it was not known that in aHUS there are mutations also in other complement proteins and therefore, it is possible that the disease was not caused by the D1119GaHUS mutation because other known aHUS-associated mutations have not been excluded.The results of this study indicate that the C3b/C3d binding site is located in FH domains 19 and 20, and glomerular endothelial cell, and heparin binding sites in domain 20 (Fig. 6). Due to the similarity of the used mouse glomerular endothelial cells to human glomerular endothelial cells (39.Rops A.L. van den Hoven M.J. Baselmans M.M. Lensen J.F. Wijnhoven T.J. van den Heuvel L.P. van Kuppevelt T.H. Berden J.H. van der Vlag J. Kidney Int. 2008; 73: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) it is likely that the observed FH binding site is the same for human cells. The binding site for C3b/C3d in domain 20 has been analyzed previously, but on domain 19 the only amino acid studied so far has been Trp-1157 (33.Józsi M. Heinen S. Hartmann A. Ostrowicz C.W. Hälbich S. Richter H. Kunert A. Licht C. Saunders R.E. Perkins S.J. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In that study, mutation W1157RaHUS decreased C3b binding but introduction of a charged arginine in place of the partially buried hydrophobic tryptophan may cause more distant changes in the overall structure without being part of the interacting surface. We now show that in addition to the W1157LaHUS mutation, the Q1139A mutation causes impairment in C3b/C3d binding (Figs. 2C and 3C). The Gln-1139 residue is surface exposed and therefore it is not likely to cause any global changes to the structure. Thereby the current results, showing that mutations D1119G/Q1139A, Q1139A, and W1157LaHUS in domain 19 lead to impaired C3b/C3d binding, suggests that the C3b/C3d binding site extends from domain 20 to domain 19. This observation would also explain the six different missense mutations in domain 19 found in aHUS patients.A heparin binding site on FH19–20 has previously been characterized in a nuclear magnetic resonance study of FH19–20, where heparin tetrasaccharide perturbed NMR spectral peaks of eight residues in domain 20 (Arg-1182, Lys-1186, Lys-1188, Lys-1202, Arg-1203, Arg-1215, Lys-1230, and Arg-1231), whereas no perturbations were observed in domain 19 (28.Herbert A.P. Uhrín D. Lyon M. Pangburn M.K. Barlow P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16512-16520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our study corroborates these results as we show that mutations of positively charged residues R1182AaHUS, K1186A, K1188A, R1206A, R1210AaHUS, and R1215QaHUS in domain 20 decrease heparin binding, whereas mutations in domain 19 do not have an effect on heparin binding. Interestingly, aHUS-associated mutations that enhanced heparin binding (Fig. 5D) introduce positive (T1184RaHUS, L1189RaHUS) or remove negative charge (E1198AaHUS) in the proximity of the heparin binding cluster in the structure of FH19–20. Thus T1184RaHUS, and L1189RaHUS seem to extend the binding site for heparin in domain 20 and E1198AaHUS removes repulsive charge from the edge of the cluster.Based on the identified binding sites we conclude that the glomerular endothelial cell binding site on FH19–20 is on domain 20 where it overlaps with the C3b/C3d binding site, and that the cell binding site is nearly identical with the heparin binding site (Fig. 6 and Table 1). This data fits well with the previous suggestion that the C3d and heparin binding sites on the FH15–20 background were found to be distinct but overlapping (44.Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Friese M.A. Wolk T.U. Kampen E. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6935-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results on the glomerular endothelial cell binding site on domain 20 (Fig. 6B) are concordant with the previously published studies on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, where mutations in domain 20 on FH8–20 and FH15–20 backgrounds decreased binding to cells (33.Józsi M. Heinen S. Hartmann A. Ostrowicz C.W. Hälbich S. Richter H. Kunert A. Licht C. Saunders R.E. Perkins S.J. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34.Manuelian T. Hellwage J. Meri S. Caprioli J. Noris M. Heinen S. Jozsi M. Neumann H.P. Remuzzi G. Zipfel P.F. J. Clin.

Zipfel P.F. Am. J. Path. 2005; 167: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The binding of the mutants to cells thus correlates well with their binding to heparin indicating that the binding site for cells and heparin is located in domain 20 only. The only exception was mutant K1186A, which had increased binding to mGEnC-1 and impaired binding to heparin (Table 1). This indicates two things. First, FH19–20 binding to heparin that has been used as a model for cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans seems to be a relatively good model for endothelial cell binding. Second, the use of porcine heparin preparations may not reflect in all cases the actual binding of FH to sulfated GAGs on cells. Currently, we are further exploring the exact role of GAGs at the glomerular endothelial surface in binding FH.The data in this study shows that all aHUS-associated FH19–20 mutations do not cause the same primary functional defect but one or two of the three observed abnormalities in C3b/C3d or glomerular endothelial cell/heparin binding. It is likely that all three primary functional defects caused by the FH mutations in aHUS lead eventually to the same process of inefficient clearance of surface-bound C3b via three mechanisms (Fig. 7). In this study we have demonstrated a novel defect of enhanced binding of aHUS-associated mutants to glomerular endothelial cells or heparin that adds to the previously suggested two defects of impaired C3b/C3d binding and impaired cell/heparin binding. In addition, we have also mapped the binding site of FH19–20 for the glomerular endothelial cells to domain 20 and show that cell binding correlates well, but not fully, with heparin binding. This site is distinct from the C3b/C3d binding site that, for the first time, is shown to extend to domain 19. Finally, we have proposed a model to explain how the target discrimination by the alternative pathway essentially needs binding of FH C terminus to the C3d part of C3b.

Their complex structure is derived from 5'-(beta-O-aminoribosyl)-glycyluridine and comprises a unique N-methyldiazepanone ring. The biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified, cloned, and sequenced, representing the first gene cluster of a translocase I inhibitor. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 23 open reading frames putatively involved in export, resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the caprazamycins. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 led to the production of non-glycosylated bioactive caprazamycin derivatives. A set of gene deletions validated the boundaries of the cluster and inactivation of cpz21 resulted in the accumulation of novel simplified liponucleoside antibiotics that lack the 3-methylglutaryl moiety. Therefore, Cpz21 is assigned to act as an acyltransferase in caprazamycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in silico analysis of the caprazamycin biosynthetic gene cluster allows a first proposal of the biosynthetic pathway and provides insights into the biosynthesis of related uridyl-antibiotics."

In 2007, Dong et al reported that the addition of trace amounts of protease to crystallization trials--in situ proteolysis--significantly increased the number of proteins in a given set that produce diffraction quality crystals. 69 proteins that had previously resisted structure determination were subjected to crystallization with in situ proteolysis and ten crystallized in a form that led to structure determination (14.5% success rate). Here we apply in situ proteolysis to over 270 new soluble proteins that had failed in the past to produce crystals suitable for structure determination. These proteins had produced no crystals, crystals that diffracted poorly, or produced twinned and/or unmanageable diffraction data. The new set includes yeast and prokaryotic proteins, enzymes essential to protozoan parasites, and human proteins such as GTPases, chromatin remodeling proteins, and tyrosine kinases. 34 proteins yielded deposited crystal structures of 2.8 A resolution or better, for an overall 12.6% success rate, and at least ten more yielded well-diffracting crystals presently in refinement. The success rate among proteins that had previously crystallized was double that of those that had never before yielded crystals. The overall success rate is similar to that observed in the smaller study, and appears to be higher than any other method reported to rescue stalled protein crystallography projects."

However, the effect of age and gender on gamma-secretase has not been fully investigated. Here, using normal wild-type mice, we show mouse brain gamma-secretase exhibits gender- and age-dependent activity. Both male and female mice exhibit increased Abeta42ratioAbeta40 ratios in aged brain, which mimics the effect of familial mutations of Presenilin-1, Presenlin-2, and the amyloid precursor protein on Abeta production. Additionally, female mice exhibit much higher gamma-secretase activity in aged brain compared to male mice. Furthermore, both male and female mice exhibit a steady decline in Notch1 gamma-secretase activity with aging. Using a small molecule affinity probe we demonstrate that male mice have less active gamma-secretase complexes than female mice, which may account for the gender-associated differences in activity in aged brain. These findings demonstrate that aging can affect gamma-secretase activity and specificity, suggesting a role for gamma-secretase in sporadic AD. Furthermore, the increased APP gamma-secretase activity seen in aged females may contribute to the increased incidence of sporadic AD in women and the aggressive Abeta plaque pathology seen in female mouse models of AD. In addition, deceased Notch gamma-secretase activity may also contribute to neurodegeneration. Therefore, this study implicates altered gamma-secretase activity and specificity as a possible mechanism of sporadic AD during aging."

Deleterious effects of 7-ketocholesterol can be prevented by vitamin E, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, unlike γ-tocopherol, the α-tocopherol vitamin E form was found to prevent 7-ketocholesterol-mediated apoptosis of A7R5 smooth muscle cells. To be operative, α-tocopherol needed to be added to the cells before 7-ketocholesterol, and its anti-apoptotic effect was reduced and even suppressed when added together or after 7-ketocholesterol, respectively. Both pre- and co-treatment of the cells with α-tocopherol resulted in the redistribution of 7-ketocholesterol out of the sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched (lipid raft) domains. In turn, fewer amounts of α-tocopherol associated with lipid rafts on 7-ketocholesterol-pretreated cells compared with untreated cells, with no prevention of cell death in this case. In further support of the implication of lipid raft domains, the dephosphorylation/inactivation of Akt-PKB was involved in the 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis. Akt-PKB dephosphorylation was prevented by α-tocopherol, but not γ-tocopherol pretreatment.

Akt-PKB dephosphorylation was prevented by α-tocopherol, but not γ-tocopherol pretreatment. It has been suggested that cholesterol oxide-induced apoptosis is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis lesions (1.Lizard G. Monier S. Cordelet C. Gesquière L. Deckert V.

Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the initial step of the disease, cholesterol oxides in modified low density lipoproteins were found to promote the death of endothelial cells lining the intravascular lumen (1.Lizard G. Monier S.

In more advanced stages and as the atherosclerotic lesion progresses, cholesterol oxides could also contribute to the destruction of foam cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, to the formation of the lipid core, to the reduction of cell proliferation, and eventually to plaque destabilization (1.Lizard G.

Among cholesterol oxides that are mainly synthesized during oxidation of low density lipoproteins, 7-ketocholesterol is one of the most abundant in plasma and atherosclerotic lesions (3.Jessup W. Brown A.J. Rejuvenation Res. 2005; 8: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a number of cell models, it has been established that 7-ketocholesterol is one of the cholesterol oxide derivatives with the highest pro-apoptotic potential (4.Terasaka N. Wang N.

The 7-ketocholesterol derivative associates preferentially with membrane lipid raft domains (6.Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Monier S. Athias A. Bessède G. Pais de Barros J.P. Laubriet A. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which are characterized by the lateral packing of glycosphingolipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. Because of their insolubility in cold non-ionic detergents, rafts are also called detergent-resistant membranes (7.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). These structures are thought to be involved in cellular signaling mechanisms (8.Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar, 9.Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). It is worthy of note that 7-ketocholesterol has been shown to induce cell death through inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (10.Vejux A. Guyot S. Montange T. Riedinger J.M. Kahn E. Lizard G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2009; 20: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which is known to be highly specific to lipid raft domains (9.Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Vitamin E is composed of closely related molecules, i.e. tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are each composed of four α, β, γ, and δ analogues. Although vitamin E was widely studied for its ability to prevent cellular damage by reactive oxygen species, it has recently been the subject of intense research for its putative, non-antioxidant functions (11.Ricciarelli R. Tasinato A. Clément S. Ozer N.K. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.Azzi A. Stocker A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 231-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Among the various forms of vitamin E, α-tocopherol is most abundant in the body as it is specifically recognized by the liver α-tocopherol transfer protein. Although several studies have shown that vitamin E has the ability to counteract the pro-apoptotic effect of 7-ketocholesterol in cultured cells (10.Vejux A. Guyot S. Montange T. Riedinger J.M. Kahn E. Lizard G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2009; 20: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13.Uemura M. Manabe H. Yoshida N. Fujita N. Ochiai J. Matsumoto N. Takagi T. Naito Y. Yoshikawa T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 456: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In the present study the molecular mechanism involved in the vitamin E-mediated protection against apoptosis induced by 7-ketocholesterol was investigated on the well known A7R5 aortic smooth muscle cell model. It is reported here that α-tocopherol, but not γ-tocopherol, effectively protects the cells against 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis when applied as a pretreatment before the addition of 7-ketocholesterol. Unlike γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol was able to activate the Akt-PKB anti-apoptotic signaling pathway in the lipid raft domains (14.Lasserre R. Guo X.J. Conchonaud F. Hamon Y. Hawchar O. Bernard A.M. Soudja S.M. Lenne P.F. Rigneault H. Olive D. Bismuth G. Nunès J.A. Payrastre B. Marguet D. He H.T. Nat. Chem.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the protective effect of α-tocopherol is shown to operate through its prior incorporation into the lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane, which leads to the subsequent exclusion and, thus, inactivation of 7-ketocholesterol. The A7R5 aortic smooth muscle cell line was purchased from the American Tissue and Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 3,3′-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DIOC6(3)) 3The abbreviations used are:DIOC6(3)3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodidePIpropidium iodideMES2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPKBprotein kinase B. was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

The α- and γ-tocopherol were purchased from SUPELCO (Sigma). The protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Complete Mini were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The anti-Bad polyclonal antibody, the anti-Bad phospho-Ser-136 polyclonal antibody, the anti-Akt/PKB polyclonal antibody, the anti-Akt/PKB phospho-Thr-308 polyclonal antibody, and the anti-Akt/PKB phospho-Ser-473 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Hitchin, UK).

A7R5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. α- or γ-tocopherol (Sigma, Supelco) were used at a final concentration of 100 μm. 7-Ketocholesterol was used at 20 μg/ml. 7-ketocholesterol was introduced into the culture medium 1 h before, together with or 1 h after the tocopherols. Cycloheximide and staurosporine were introduced into the culture medium 1 h after tocopherols and used at a concentration of 50 and 0.5 μm, respectively. Cell permeability was determined with PI (λExmax, 540 nm; λEmmax, 625 nm), which only stains dead cells (16.Yeh C.J. Hsi B.L. Faulk W.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 43: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), after 24 h of treatment. The red fluorescence was immediately measured on a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 585/42 nm, respectively. For each sample, 10,000 cells were acquired, and the data were analyzed with Flomax software (Partec). Variations in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) were measured with DIOC6(3) (λExmax, 484 nm; λEmmax, 501 nm) used at a final concentration of 40 nmol/liter (17.Miguet C. Monier S.

The flow cytometric analyses were performed on a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec), and the green fluorescence was collected through a 524/44-nm band pass filter. Fluorescent signals were measured on a logarithmic scale of four decades of log. For each sample, 10,000 cells were acquired, and the data were analyzed with Flomax software (Partec). Nuclear morphology of control and treated cells was studied by fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33342 (λExmax, 346 nm; λEmmax, 420 nm) used at 10 μg/ml after 24 h of treatment. The morphological aspect of cell deposits, applied to glass slides by cytocentrifugation with a cytospin 4 centrifuge (Shandon, Cheshire, UK), was observed with an Axioskop light microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) by using UV light excitation. Three hundred cells were examined for each experiment. Cellular hydroperoxide levels were evaluated by measuring the oxidation rate of the oxidant-sensitive dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate to the fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein. A7R5 cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin at a cell density of 1 × 104 cells per well. After 6 h of treatment, adherent cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the medium was replaced with 10 μg/ml 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture media without phenol red. The formation of dichlorofluorescein was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/538 nm over 30 min using a VICTOR 1420 multilabel counter. After 6 h of treatment, A7R5 cells were detached by trypsinization and washed 2 times at room temperature in Ca2+ flux assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated with Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes; 6 μmol/liter; λExmax, 506 nm; λEmmax, 526 nm) for 30 min at 30 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, with Pluronic F-127 (Sigma; 0.02%). After loading, the cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, supplemented with probenecid (Sigma; 5 mmol/liter) to prevent leakage of the dye (18.Princen K. Hatse S. Vermeire K. De Clercq E. Schols D. Cytometry A. 2003; 51: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry with a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec) using a 524/44-nm band pass filter. For each sample, events were acquired for 60 s, and the data were analyzed with Flomax software (Partec). The phosphorylation of Bad and Akt-PKB was investigated by Western blot analysis of A7R5 cells incubated for 24 h with 7-ketocholesterol alone or in association with α- or γ-tocopherol. The cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) according to the method of Smith et al. (19.Smith A.J. Cawston T.E. Hazleman B.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 84: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein were incubated in loading buffer (125 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking nonspecific binding sites for 2 h at room temperature in TPBS (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in TPBS. After three 15-min washes with TPBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times in TPBS for 15 min. Autoradiography of the immunoblots was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated three times with identical results. Sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched, lipid raft domains were isolated as previously described (20.Grazide S. Maestre N. Veldman R.J. Bezombes C. Maddens S. Levade T. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 6 h of treatment, 1 × 106 A7R5 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of 1 ml of 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were further homogenized on ice using a Dounce glass homogenizer. The lysates were then mixed with ice-cold MES buffer (1 ml) and 2 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MES buffer and layered at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes. Samples were then overlaid with 5 ml of 30% and 3 ml of 5% sucrose in MES buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C using a Beckman swinging bucket rotor (SW41). 1.2-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom, vortexed, and stored at −20 °C before analysis. The cholesterol and sphingomyelin composition of the fractions were used as markers of rafts. Cholesterol, oxysterol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylcholine were assayed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry as previously described (21.Becart J.

Each subcellular fraction (200 μl) was vortexed-mixed with 200 μl of water, 400 μl of internal standard (100 ng/ml tocol (Spiral, Dijon, France) in ethanol), and 1 ml of hexane in 2 ml glass amber vials for 1 min. Extracts were centrifuged at 550 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper layers (800 μl) were transferred into new vials and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The dried extracts were resuspended with 100 μl of HPLC grade methanol, and 27 μl were further analyzed with a linear 100% methanol gradient on a Beckman GOLD high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a 508 autosampler. Fluorescence was detected at λExmax 292 nm and λEmmax 325 nm with a Shimadzu fluorescence detector. Concentrations of α- and γ-tocopherol were determined from the ratio of the peak area corresponding to one given molecule to the peak area corresponding to the internal standard. Levels were determined by comparison of this ratio with a standard curve of known amounts of α- or γ-tocopherol. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined with Statview software (Cary, NC) using two-way analysis of variance. Treatment of A7R5 cells with 7-ketocholesterol (20 μg/ml) was cytotoxic, as shown by a significant increase in cell permeability to propidium iodide, with 26% of positive cells after 24 h of treatment versus 7% in control cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). Concomitantly, treatment with 7-ketocholesterol produced a significant decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. As measured with the cationic lipophilic dye DIOC6(3), up to 27% of the A7R5 cells were depolarized after 24 h of treatment with 20 μg/ml 7-ketocholesterol versus 10% in control cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2D, 35% of the 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells showed abnormalities in nuclear morphology, which was characterized by fragmented nuclei (known to occur during apoptosis), revealed by staining with Hoechst 33342 versus 6% in control cells (p < 0.001).FIGURE 2α-Tocopherol inhibits 7-ketocholesterol-induced A7R5 apoptosis. A7R5 cells were untreated (Control), incubated for 24 h with 7-ketocholesterol (7-keto, 20 μg/ml) alone, or incubated for 24 h with 7-ketocholesterol in combination with α- or γ-tocopherol or both (100 μm each). 7-Ketocholesterol was added either 1 h after, at the same time, or 1 h before treatment with tocopherols.

The effect of α-tocopherol was strongly dependent on whether α-tocopherol was added before or after the cholesterol oxide. It was most effective when added 1 h before 7-ketocholesterol, of intermediate magnitude when added together with 7-ketocholesterol, and ineffective when added 1 h after 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 1, middle panels). Concordant conclusions were drawn when cell death was assessed by measuring the proportion of either PI-positive cells, depolarized cells, or cells with fragmented nuclei (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). γ-Tocopherol is known to display antioxidant properties similar to those of α-tocopherol (24.Wang X. Quinn P.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 309-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast to α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol did not prevent the 7-ketocholesterol-mediated changes in the relative proportions of PI-positive cells, depolarized cells, or fragmented nucleus-containing cells. In this respect, γ-tocopherol was consistently ineffective even when added as a pretreatment, 1 h before 7-ketocholesterol (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). γ-Tocopherol was mainly neutral as it did not modify the antiapoptotic property of α-tocopherol when both isomers were added together before 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 2D). The difference between the α- and γ-tocopherol isomers appeared to be restricted to the 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis. Both α- and γ-tocopherol significantly reduced the impact of cycloheximide on apoptosis in terms of fragmented nuclei but with no difference between the two isomers (Fig. 3). In addition, when apoptosis was induced by staurosporine, neither α- nor γ-tocopherol modified cell death (Fig. 3). In the present study the 7-ketocholesterol-induced rise in intracellular oxidative stress (as assessed by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein oxidation rate) was brought back to control/untreated values when either α- or γ-tocopherol was added before 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 4A). As previously reported, 7-ketocholesterol induced a significant increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, which is known to produce calcineurine activation and dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad (6.Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Monier S. Athias A. Bessède G. Pais de Barros J.P. Laubriet A. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Neither α- nor γ-tocopherol could normalize the free intracellular Ca2+ pool in A7R5 cells (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Effects of α- and γ-tocopherol on reactive oxygen species production and free Ca2+ content of cytosol in the presence of 7-ketocholesterol. A, reactive oxygen species production was measured in A7R5 cells which were either untreated (Control) or incubated with 7-ketocholesterol (7-keto, 20 μg/ml) for 6 h alone or after 1 h of treatment with α- or γ-tocopherol (100 μm).

AU, arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these observations indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of α-tocopherol is not shared by γ-tocopherol. The two “isomers” modify the oxidative stress in 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells in similar ways and have no significant effects on calcium fluxes. Tocopherols and cholesterol oxides are known to incorporate into plasma membranes. In the present study the sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched, lipid raft domains corresponded constantly to fractions 2–4, with no changes in their distribution whether 7-ketocholesterol and/or tocopherols were added or not (Fig. 5). Phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylcholine localized into the non-raft, detergent-soluble membranes (fractions 5–10). Again, no changes in the distribution of non-raft fractions were observed whether 7-ketocholesterol and/or tocopherols were added or not (Fig. 5). In agreement with previous studies in human pro-monocytic THP-1 cells (6.Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Monier S. Athias A. Bessède G. Pais de Barros J.P. Laubriet A. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), 7-ketocholesterol was found to incorporate mainly into lipid rafts (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, however, when α-tocopherol was added 1 h before the cholesterol oxide, it was able to produce a marked redistribution of 7-ketocholesterol outside the lipid rafts (Fig. 6, B and D). In contrast, α-tocopherol produced no effect when added after 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 6, B and D). Under the same experimental conditions, the cholesterol oxide remained consistently associated with the lipid rafts in the absence or in the presence of γ-tocopherol whether γ-tocopherol was added before, with, or after 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 6, C and E).FIGURE 6α-Tocopherol but not γ-tocopherol alters 7-ketocholesterol incorporation into plasma membrane. A7R5 cells were treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7-keto, 20 μg/ml) for 6 h alone or in combination with α- or γ-tocopherol (α-toco and γ-toco, 100 μm). 7-Ketocholesterol was added either 1 h before, together with, or 1 h after tocopherols. A7R5 cells were lysed in cold Triton X-100 and fractionated on a sucrose density gradient. Equal volume aliquots of the fractions were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy for 7-ketocholesterol content in treated cells (A, B, and C). Percentages of 7-ketocholesterol in raft fractions were determined (D and E). Values are the means ± S.D.

In cells with no 7-ketocholesterol treatment, the amounts of α-tocopherol in the lipid rafts were higher than those of γ-tocopherol, which tended to localize preferentially in the non-lipid raft fractions (Fig. 7B). The relative proportion of α-tocopherol in the raft fractions decreased from 25% to ∼15% when cells were pre- or co-treated with 7-ketocholesterol (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7, C and E), whereas 7-ketocholesterol produced no detectable effect when added after α-tocopherol. These results indicate that a small, but significant fraction of α-tocopherol (approximating 10% of the total in cell membranes) can localize preferentially within the lipid rafts. As compared with 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells, no incremental association of γ-tocopherol with the lipid rafts was observed in control/untreated cells (Fig. 7, D and F), although γ-tocopherol and α-tocopherol incorporated in similar amounts to the cell membranes. Indeed, total amounts of either vitamin E isomer (as calculated by the cumulative addition of membrane fractions 1–10) were identical (α-tocopherol, 606 ± 115 ng per 106 cells; γ-tocopherol, 663 ± 274 ng per 106 cells; not significant). The selective association of α-tocopherol with lipid rafts was fully prevented by the incorporation of 7-ketocholesterol. In this case, lower/similar proportions (between 15 and 20%) of the amounts of either vitamin E isomer were found in the lipid rafts of 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells. In all cases, α- and γ-tocopherol were associated with membrane-derived structures as assessed by the lack of leakage of tocopherols from one fraction to another after a second ultracentrifugation step (Fig. 8, A and B). However, when the former ultracentrifugation fractions were replenished with Triton before the second ultracentrifugation step, most of the tocopherol material was recovered in the non-raft fractions (Fig. 8, C and D). It indicates that tocopherols are loosely bound to the membranes and can easily leak out of the rafts, with distribution profiles similar to these observed with tocopherols alone (Fig. 8, E and F).FIGURE 8Cell-associated α- and γ-tocopherols are loosely bound to membrane fractions. After treatment with α- or γ-tocopherol (α-toco, γ-toco, 100 μm) for 6 h, A7R5 cells were recovered, lysed in cold Triton X-100, and fractionated on a sucrose density gradient. Equal volumes of fractions 1–10 were collected, and fractions 3 and 8 were immediately subjected to a second sucrose density gradient, which was replenished (C and D) or not (A and B) with 1% Triton (α-tocopherol, A and C; γ-tocopherol, B and D). In parallel experiments, tocopherols alone were subjected to the same gradient in the presence of 1% Triton (E and F). Tocopherol profiles were determined by HPLC analysis. Values are the means of two distinct experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Akt-PKB is a kinase that is phosphorylated and then activated by PDK1 after interacting with phosphoinositides of the plasma membrane (25.Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Once activated, Akt-PkB is able to phosphorylate Bad on Ser-136 leading to its inactivation (26.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). In A7R5 cells treated with 7-ketocholesterol alone, Akt-PKB phosphorylation was decreased both on threonine 308 and serine 473 (Fig. 9A). Whereas γ-tocopherol did not modify the phosphorylation profile of Akt-PKB in 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells, α-tocopherol treatment was accompanied by Akt-PKB activation as demonstrated by sustained phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473. α-Tocopherol, but not γ-tocopherol, was, thus, able to restore the control-like phosphorylation profile of Akt-PKB in 7-ketocholesterol-treated cells (Fig. 9). Accordingly, the 7-ketocholesterol-mediated decrease in Bad phosphorylation on serine 136 was fully reversed by α-tocopherol and even turned to an almost 4-fold increase as compared with the level observed in cells treated with 7-ketocholesterol alone (Fig. 10, A and B). Only a moderate, 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of serine 136 of Bad was produced in the presence of γ-tocopherol (Fig. 10B).FIGURE 10Involvement of Bad in α-tocopherol-induced protection against 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis. A7R5 cells were either untreated (Control) or incubated with α- or γ-tocopherol alone (α and γ, 100 μm) or in association with 7-ketocholesterol (7k, 7-keto, 20 μg/ml added 1 h after tocopherol) for 24 h.

Packer L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 62: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A7R5 aortic smooth muscle cells are commonly used as a cell model to study the metabolism of vitamin E/tocopherols in relation with vascular biology. As far as cell death is concerned, it is demonstrated here that only α-tocopherol, and not γ-tocopherol, is able to block 7-ketocholesterol-mediated apoptosis. Concordant observations were made by measuring cell permeability to propidium iodide, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and abnormalities in nuclear morphology. In addition, it is shown here that α-tocopherol, unlike γ-tocopherol, has the ability to impair the preferential incorporation of the cholesterol oxide into the sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched, lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane. As in earlier studies (28.Chatelain E. Boscoboinik D.O. Bartoli G.M. Kagan V.E. Gey F.K. Packer L. Azzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), incubating A7R5 cells with the same amounts of either α- or γ-tocopherol resulted in similar cellular concentrations of either molecule. Overall, the present data come in new support of a specific property of α-tocopherol that is not shared by γ-tocopherol. Earlier studies reported that α-tocopherol is more effective than γ-tocopherol in modulating apoptotic signaling in oxidized low density lipoprotein-treated human coronary smooth muscle cells (29.de Nigris F. Franconi F. Maida I. Palumbo G. Anania V. Napoli C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, γ-tocopherol and α-tocopherol acetate, both of which share well recognized antioxidant properties with α-tocopherol, were mostly found to be ineffective in inhibiting cholesterol oxide-induced apoptosis in various cell models (29.de Nigris F. Franconi F. Maida I. Palumbo G. Anania V. Napoli C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1477-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30.Lyons N.M. Woods J.A. O'Brien N.M. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study the difference between α- and γ-tocopherol appeared to be restricted to the 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the proportion of cycloheximide-induced cell death was reduced to the same extent by either isomer, and neither α-tocopherol nor γ-tocopherol could counteract the apoptotic potential of staurosporine (Fig. 3). It is known that α-tocopherol displays structure-specific properties that are not shared by other related isomers and which could then extend beyond its intrinsic antioxidative activity (12.Azzi A. Stocker A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 231-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13.Uemura M. Manabe H. Yoshida N. Fujita N. Ochiai J. Matsumoto N. Takagi T. Naito Y. Yoshikawa T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 456: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30.Lyons N.M. Woods J.A. O'Brien N.M. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31.Munteanu A. Zingg J.M. Azzi A. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although normalization of the level of hydroxyperoxides in 7-ketocholesterol-treated A7R5 cells (Fig. 4A) by either α- or γ-tocopherol seems to support the above hypothesis, the implication of the antioxidative properties of α-tocopherol in its anti-apoptotic effect cannot be fully excluded. Thus, the present study sheds new light on the molecular characteristics that might account for the clear difference between α-tocopherol and the other vitamin E forms; unlike γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol displayed a specific distribution pattern in the plasma membrane, with a propensity to associate with the lipid raft domains. Because cholesterol oxides preferentially associate with the sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched raft domains (Ref. 6.Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Monier S. Athias A. Bessède G. Pais de Barros J.P. Laubriet A. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and this study), it is quite conceivable that the lipid raft-associated fraction of tocopherols would be the main, if not the only fraction that could exert a beneficial effect. It remains that α-tocopherol could have played a specific antioxidative function locally, within the A7R5 lipid raft domains to which γ-tocopherol poorly associates. Tocopherols and cholesterol derivatives are known to incorporate into the plasma membrane, and 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis is known to involve membrane signaling pathways leading to activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad through dephosphorylation of its serine 112 and/or 136 residues (6.Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Monier S. Athias A. Bessède G. Pais de Barros J.P. Laubriet A. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As expected, α-tocopherol-mediated protection appeared in the present study mainly related to the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, which exhibited a high level of phosphorylation on serine 136, even greater than that found in non-treated cells. This increased phosphorylation appeared to be related to sustained Akt-PKB activity as demonstrated by the phosphorylation state of Akt-PKB at serine 473 and threonine 308. A direct relationship to the observed alterations in lipid raft domains is sustained by recent studies of Lasserre et al. (14.Lasserre R. Guo X.J. Conchonaud F. Hamon Y. Hawchar O. Bernard A.M. Soudja S.M. Lenne P.F. Rigneault H. Olive D. Bismuth G. Nunès J.A. Payrastre B. Marguet D. He H.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) who reported that Akt-PKB is recruited and activated in these specialized microdomains. Unlike α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol was unable to restore the phosphorylation profile of Akt-PKB in 7-ketocholesterol-treated A7R5 cells. Again, these observations come in support of marked differences in the effects of related forms of vitamin E on cell signaling. Alterations in the incorporation of 7-ketocholesterol and related events occurred solely when α-tocopherol was preincorporated into lipid raft domains, before 7-ketocholesterol, and with no competitive effect of γ-tocopherol. Indeed, α-tocopherol was unable to reverse the deleterious effect of the cholesterol oxide already present in the lipid rafts. Through its early action when used as a pretreatment, α-tocopherol would then be able to prevent the damage caused by cholesterol derivatives involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. To some extent, it might provide a clue to the controversial results from epidemiological studies dealing with the cardio-protective action of vitamin E supplementation. As suggested by Munteanu and Zingg (32.Munteanu A. Zingg J.M. Mol. Aspects Med. 2007; 28: 538-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), vitamin E supplementation would, thus, not be an effective therapy against existing cardiovascular disease but would rather play a preventive role. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that α-tocopherol can prevent the incorporation of 7-ketocholesterol into lipid raft domains where it can produce its anti-apoptotic effect. These observations give support to the recent hypothesis that if the localization/partition of α-tocopherol differs from that of non-α-tocopherol forms, then it should translate into specific biological actions (33.Traber M.G. Atkinson J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the effect of α-tocopherol, although not shared by γ-tocopherol in the present study, might still be due to the antioxidative protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids at specific sites.

The goal of this study was to examine this hypothesis in a group study.In the present study, we tested thirteen grapheme-color synesthetes and we compared their performance on a visual search task and a memory test to an age-, handedness-, education-, and gender-matched control group. The results showed no significant group differences (all relevant ps>.50). For the visual search task effect sizes indicated a small advantage for synesthetes (Cohen's d between .19 and .32). No such advantage was found for episodic memory (Cohen's d<.05).The results indicate that synesthesia per se does not seem to lead to a strong performance advantage. Rather, the superior performance of synesthetes observed in some case-report studies may be due to individual differences, to a selection bias or to a strategic use of synesthesia as a mnemonic. In order to establish universal effects of synesthesia on cognition single-case studies must be complemented by group studies."
https://openalex.org/W2031670850,"Since 1999 the World Health Organization issues annually an additional influenza vaccine composition recommendation. This initiative aimed to extend to the Southern Hemisphere (SH) the benefits—previously enjoyed only by the Northern Hemisphere (NH)—of a vaccine recommendation issued as close as possible to the moment just before the onset of the influenza epidemic season. A short time between the issue of the recommendation and vaccine delivery is needed to maximize the chances of correct matching between putative circulating strains and one of the three strains present in the vaccine composition. Here we compare the effectiveness of the SH influenza vaccination adopted in Brazil with hypothetical alternative scenarios defined by different timings of vaccine delivery and/or composition. Scores were based on the temporal overlap between vaccine-induced protection and circulating strains. Viral data were obtained between 1999 and 2007 from constant surveillance and strain characterization in two Brazilian cities: Belém, located at the Equatorial region, and São Paulo, at the limit between the tropical and subtropical regions. Our results show that, among currently feasible options, the best strategy for Brazil would be to adopt the NH composition and timing, as in such case protection would increase from 30% to 65% (p<.01) if past data can be used as a prediction of the future. The influenza season starts in Brazil (and in the equator virtually ends) well before the SH winter, making the current delivery of the SH vaccination in April too late to be effective. Since Brazil encompasses a large area of the Southern Hemisphere, our results point to the possibility of these conclusions being similarly valid for other tropical regions."

https://openalex.org/W1989210730,"The neonatal period in humans and in most mammals is characterized by intense mother-young interactions favoring pair bonding and the adaptation of neonates to their new environment. However, in many post-delivery procedures, human babies commonly experience combined maternal separation and intense handling for about one hour post-birth. Currently, the effects of such disturbances on later attachment and on the development of newborns are still debated: clearly, further investigations are required. As animals present good models for controlled experimentation, we chose domestic horses to investigate this issue. Horses, like humans, are characterized by single births, long lactating periods and selective mother-infant bonds. Routine postnatal procedures for foals, as for human babies, also involve intense handling and maternal separation. In the present study, we monitored the behavior of foals from early stages of development to “adolescence”, in a normal ecological context (social groups with adults and peers). Experimental foals, separated from their mothers and handled for only 1 hour post-birth, were compared to control foals, left undisturbed after birth. Our results revealed short- and long-term effects of this unique neonatal experience on attachment and subsequent social competences. Thus, experimental foals presented patterns of insecure attachment to their mothers (strong dependence on their mothers, little play) and impaired social competences (social withdrawal, aggressiveness) at all ages. We discuss these results in terms of mother-young interactions, timing of interactions and relationships between bonding and subsequent social competences. Our results indicate that this ungulate species could become an interesting animal model. To our knowledge, this is the first clear demonstration that intervention just after birth affects bonding and subsequent social competences (at least until “adolescence”). It opens new research directions for studies on both humans and other animals."

Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar).The PS II complex turns over dynamically, although it is quite an integrated complex; our current understanding is that the PS II complex that is damaged by high light is disintegrated into a monomeric form and is further dissociated to replace a degraded D1 protein with a de novo synthesized D1 (reviewed in Refs. 11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and 12.Nixon P.J. Barker M. Boehm M. de Vries R. Komenda J. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). After the replacement, the PS II complex is integrated into a functional form as a dimer. It is supposed that PS II subunit proteins such as PsbI (13.Dobáková M. Tichy M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or PsbTc (14.Iwai M. Katoh H. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) participate in the formation of the PS II dimer.Crystallographic models of PS II have enabled the determination of the accurate molecular architecture of PS II complexes, all of which are in a dimeric form. The most recent crystallographic model of the PS II dimer at 3.0-Å resolution revealed the presence of six detergent molecules located at the interface of the two monomers (5.Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Small structural fluctuations during the purification process might allow the invasion of those detergent molecules. However, it is also probable that the PS II complexes exist in the form of a monomer in vivo and the two distinct monomers become a dimer during the purification step incorporating detergents between their interfaces. This idea led us to investigate the actual form of PS II in vivo. Contrary to the above well known dimeric model of a functional PS II core complex, here we show that the PS II core complex functions and exists in a monomeric form in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we showed that PS II functions mostly in a monomeric form in vivo, contrary to the widely accepted concept that the functional form of PS II complexes is the dimer. This conventional concept is consistent with and stands on the crystallographic models of PS II reported so far (2.Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar, 3.Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 5.Loll B.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). However, it is natural that the crystallographic models of PS II are dimers, because all of the PS II crystals were made using purified PS II dimers. One prerequisite for obtaining crystals of membrane protein complexes is to remove lipids (26.Kashino Y. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 797: 191-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As we have shown in this work (), the extensive removal of lipids, on purpose or unintentionally, during the purification steps for the crystallization work could result in the high yield of PS II dimer. The side surface opposing the interface between the two monomers in dimeric PS II might be specific to the formation of dimer, because the loss of PsbTc that locates at such an interface results in a decrease in the ratio of dimeric PS II (14.Iwai M. Katoh H. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M.

The model of the PS II dimer is primarily based on freeze-fracture electron microscopic studies and crystallographic models. The freeze-fracture studies revealed the presence of pairs of 10 nm particles associated with phycobilisomes, which were suggested to be the dimeric forms of PS II (55.Giddings T.H. Wasmann C. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 409-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Giddings Jr., T.H. Staehelin L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 57.Mörschel E. Schatz G.H. Planta. 1987; 172: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PS II monomers could associate together to form a dimer in some physiological statuses. Actually, Wollman reported that 10 nm particles observed on the exoplasmic fracture face are attributable to PS II and are apparently able to aggregate once the phycobilisomes are detached in Cyanidium caldarium (58.Wollman F.A. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freeze fracture is very useful to address the configuration of biological membranes. However, the definite identification of 10 nm particles remains to be determined because of the limited resolution. In higher plants, two conflicting results on the oligomerization status of PS II are reported using image analyses of two-dimensional crystals (45.Holzenburg A. Bewley M.C. Wilson F.H. Nicholson W.V. Ford R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 470-472Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 46.Lyon M.K. Marr K.M. Furcinitti P.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 110: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which were also obtained by use of detergents. There are also many reports that show the PS II dimer on BN-PAGE (e.g. Refs. 11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 59.Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpio S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In some reports, higher or comparable amounts of monomer relative to dimer were found, although the authors concluded that the monomer is a transient status of PS II biogenesis (11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M.

The use of detergents to solubilize membrane protein complexes could affect the appearance of the dimer on BN-PAGE, because the concentration of DDM seemed to affect the amount of lipids associated with PS II complexes (Fig. 5). Solubilization at a lower concentration of DDM resulted in diffuse bands, both of PS II and PS I, and some parts of them did not migrate into the resolving gel, although there was no appearance of dimeric PS II (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S3). A more heterogeneous amount of lipids associated with individual PS II complexes solubilized with lower concentrations of DDM could result in the defused band shape. Therefore, aiming to obtain distinct bands of membrane protein complexes, higher concentrations of detergents are used in many reports for BN-PAGE analyses.To exclude the effects of detergents described above when assessing the form of PS II complexes in vivo, we measured photochemical reactions in the absence of detergents using thylakoids and cells of not only of primitive red alga, but also from cyanobacteria and a diatom. Differing from purified PS II complexes, PS I complexes are present and phycobilisomes are attached to PS II complexes in cells and thylakoids in red algae and cyanobacteria. In general, the fluorescence yield of PS I is quite low at room temperature (61.Murata N. Satoh K. Govindjee Amesz J. Fork D.C. Light Emission by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 137-159Crossref Google Scholar), and the variable fluorescence can be attributed to PS II only. Presence of phycobilisomes can increase the antenna size of PS II, which increases the rate of QA reduction, but cannot change the fluorescence induction pattern unless the PS II core complexes are connected through the large linker protein of the phycobilisome. The presence of phycobilisomes also contributes to the increase of Fo level. In our measurements, energy transfer between PS II units, which can be determined by the sigmoidal fluorescence increase as observed in dimeric PS II, was barely detected in vivo (Fig. 6). This result strongly indicates that most of the population of PS II functions in a monomeric form in vivo. Differing from the materials above, energy transfer between the PS II units was observed in spinach thylakoids and PS II preparations (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the previous reports (44.Joliot A. Joliot P. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 47.Melis A. Homann P.H. Photochem.

In this sense, the relationship between individual PS II reaction center units in non-green plants is quite different from that in green plants, whose PS II complexes are assembled in the grana region and are connected directly or via surrounding LHCII.The remaining problem opposing our conclusion is that the oxygen-evolving activity in the PS II monomer is generally lower than in the dimer (e.g. Ref. 39.Sakurai I. Mizusawa N. Wada H. Sato N. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and Table 2). However, based on our present investigation, this can be explained by higher amounts of lipids in the monomer, which affect the accessibility of artificial electron acceptors to the secondary electron acceptor QB site (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The artificial electron acceptor, 2,5-DCBQ, is known to support a high rate of oxygen evolution by accepting electrons via both the first and the second intrinsic electron acceptor, QA and QB (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and is commonly used at ∼0.5 mm to assess oxygen-evolving activity. At lower concentrations, it accepts electrons via QB plastoquinone, but at higher concentrations, it replaces QB plastoquinone and accepts electrons directly from QA, resulting in a lower activity (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Another artificial electron acceptor, duroquinone, was shown to accept electrons only via the secondary intrinsic electron acceptor QB, not directly from QA (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity of quinones can be evaluated by the values of CLogP, the calculated logarithm of the partition coefficient; the more hydrophobic a compound is, the greater its CLogP. The CLogP values of 2,5-DCBQ and duroquinone are 1.25 and 2.63, respectively (63.Siraki A.G. Chan T.S. O'Brien P.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 81: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The difference of Vmax can be interpreted as the difference of the abundance of lipids resulting in the different turnover rates of the artificial electron acceptors at the QB sites. Abundant lipids in the PS II monomer might become a physical barrier for the less hydrophobic 2,5-DCBQ to access to the QB site resulting in a lower Vmax. Inversely, the abundant lipids might assist the accessibility to the QB site for more hydrophobic duroquinone that accept electrons through QB. Therefore, the rate of oxygen evolution can be determined by the accessibility and mobility of 2,5-DCBQ and duroquinone to the QB site and in the lipids around the QB site.PS II complexes are embedded in the lipid layer (thylakoid membrane), therefore our results indicate that most of the population of PS II functions and exists in a monomeric form in vivo. The stoichiometry of ∼1 between isolated PS II and the bound light-harvesting phycobilisome suggested in T. elongatus (64.Kura-Hotta M. Satoh K. Katoh S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (formerly Synechococcus sp.) agrees with the monomeric existence of PS II in vivo, although other stoichiometry is also reported in cyanobacterial and red algal cells/thylakoids (65.Cunningham F.X. Dennenberg R.J. Mustardy L. Jursinic P.A. Gantt E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 66.Kursar T.A. Alberte R.S.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1219-1226Google Scholar). Our conclusion is important, because it will call for a novel hypotheses for the function of some PS II subunit proteins, the association of antenna pigment-protein complexes, and the processes of assembly and repair of PS II, due to the fact that the current hypotheses stand on the premise that the functional PS II in vivo is a dimer. Furthermore, the oligomerization status of many crystallographic models of membrane protein complexes may need to be re-evaluated, because the protein complexes were purified using processes similar to the purification of PS II complexes.

The PS II complex turns over dynamically, although it is quite an integrated complex; our current understanding is that the PS II complex that is damaged by high light is disintegrated into a monomeric form and is further dissociated to replace a degraded D1 protein with a de novo synthesized D1 (reviewed in Refs. 11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and 12.Nixon P.J. Barker M. Boehm M. de Vries R. Komenda J. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). After the replacement, the PS II complex is integrated into a functional form as a dimer. It is supposed that PS II subunit proteins such as PsbI (13.Dobáková M. Tichy M. Komenda J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or PsbTc (14.Iwai M. Katoh H. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) participate in the formation of the PS II dimer. Crystallographic models of PS II have enabled the determination of the accurate molecular architecture of PS II complexes, all of which are in a dimeric form. The most recent crystallographic model of the PS II dimer at 3.0-Å resolution revealed the presence of six detergent molecules located at the interface of the two monomers (5.Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Small structural fluctuations during the purification process might allow the invasion of those detergent molecules. However, it is also probable that the PS II complexes exist in the form of a monomer in vivo and the two distinct monomers become a dimer during the purification step incorporating detergents between their interfaces. This idea led us to investigate the actual form of PS II in vivo. Contrary to the above well known dimeric model of a functional PS II core complex, here we show that the PS II core complex functions and exists in a monomeric form in vivo. DISCUSSIONIn this work, we showed that PS II functions mostly in a monomeric form in vivo, contrary to the widely accepted concept that the functional form of PS II complexes is the dimer. This conventional concept is consistent with and stands on the crystallographic models of PS II reported so far (2.Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar, 3.Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 5.Loll B.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). However, it is natural that the crystallographic models of PS II are dimers, because all of the PS II crystals were made using purified PS II dimers. One prerequisite for obtaining crystals of membrane protein complexes is to remove lipids (26.Kashino Y. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 797: 191-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As we have shown in this work (), the extensive removal of lipids, on purpose or unintentionally, during the purification steps for the crystallization work could result in the high yield of PS II dimer. The side surface opposing the interface between the two monomers in dimeric PS II might be specific to the formation of dimer, because the loss of PsbTc that locates at such an interface results in a decrease in the ratio of dimeric PS II (14.Iwai M. Katoh H. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, no direct evidence on the in vivo form of PS II complexes has been reported.

However, the definite identification of 10 nm particles remains to be determined because of the limited resolution.

Dennenberg R.J. Mustardy L. Jursinic P.A. Gantt E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 66.Kursar T.A. Alberte R.S.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1219-1226Google Scholar). Our conclusion is important, because it will call for a novel hypotheses for the function of some PS II subunit proteins, the association of antenna pigment-protein complexes, and the processes of assembly and repair of PS II, due to the fact that the current hypotheses stand on the premise that the functional PS II in vivo is a dimer. Furthermore, the oligomerization status of many crystallographic models of membrane protein complexes may need to be re-evaluated, because the protein complexes were purified using processes similar to the purification of PS II complexes. In this work, we showed that PS II functions mostly in a monomeric form in vivo, contrary to the widely accepted concept that the functional form of PS II complexes is the dimer. This conventional concept is consistent with and stands on the crystallographic models of PS II reported so far (2.Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). However, it is natural that the crystallographic models of PS II are dimers, because all of the PS II crystals were made using purified PS II dimers. One prerequisite for obtaining crystals of membrane protein complexes is to remove lipids (26.Kashino Y. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 797: 191-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As we have shown in this work (), the extensive removal of lipids, on purpose or unintentionally, during the purification steps for the crystallization work could result in the high yield of PS II dimer. The side surface opposing the interface between the two monomers in dimeric PS II might be specific to the formation of dimer, because the loss of PsbTc that locates at such an interface results in a decrease in the ratio of dimeric PS II (14.Iwai M. Katoh H. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no direct evidence on the in vivo form of PS II complexes has been reported. The model of the PS II dimer is primarily based on freeze-fracture electron microscopic studies and crystallographic models. The freeze-fracture studies revealed the presence of pairs of 10 nm particles associated with phycobilisomes, which were suggested to be the dimeric forms of PS II (55.Giddings T.H. Wasmann C. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 409-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Giddings Jr., T.H. Staehelin L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 57.Mörschel E. Schatz G.H. Planta. 1987; 172: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PS II monomers could associate together to form a dimer in some physiological statuses. Actually, Wollman reported that 10 nm particles observed on the exoplasmic fracture face are attributable to PS II and are apparently able to aggregate once the phycobilisomes are detached in Cyanidium caldarium (58.Wollman F.A. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freeze fracture is very useful to address the configuration of biological membranes. However, the definite identification of 10 nm particles remains to be determined because of the limited resolution. In higher plants, two conflicting results on the oligomerization status of PS II are reported using image analyses of two-dimensional crystals (45.Holzenburg A. Bewley M.C. Wilson F.H. Nicholson W.V. Ford R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 470-472Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 46.Lyon M.K. Marr K.M. Furcinitti P.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 110: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which were also obtained by use of detergents. There are also many reports that show the PS II dimer on BN-PAGE (e.g. Refs. 11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 59.Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpio S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 60.Komenda J. Reisinger V. Muller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In some reports, higher or comparable amounts of monomer relative to dimer were found, although the authors concluded that the monomer is a transient status of PS II biogenesis (11.Aro E.M. Suorsa M. Rokka A. Allahverdiyeva Y. Paakkarinen V. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Rintamaki E. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 60.Komenda J. Reisinger V. Muller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The use of detergents to solubilize membrane protein complexes could affect the appearance of the dimer on BN-PAGE, because the concentration of DDM seemed to affect the amount of lipids associated with PS II complexes (Fig. 5). Solubilization at a lower concentration of DDM resulted in diffuse bands, both of PS II and PS I, and some parts of them did not migrate into the resolving gel, although there was no appearance of dimeric PS II (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S3). A more heterogeneous amount of lipids associated with individual PS II complexes solubilized with lower concentrations of DDM could result in the defused band shape. Therefore, aiming to obtain distinct bands of membrane protein complexes, higher concentrations of detergents are used in many reports for BN-PAGE analyses. To exclude the effects of detergents described above when assessing the form of PS II complexes in vivo, we measured photochemical reactions in the absence of detergents using thylakoids and cells of not only of primitive red alga, but also from cyanobacteria and a diatom. Differing from purified PS II complexes, PS I complexes are present and phycobilisomes are attached to PS II complexes in cells and thylakoids in red algae and cyanobacteria. In general, the fluorescence yield of PS I is quite low at room temperature (61.Murata N. Satoh K. Govindjee Amesz J. Fork D.C. Light Emission by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 137-159Crossref Google Scholar), and the variable fluorescence can be attributed to PS II only. Presence of phycobilisomes can increase the antenna size of PS II, which increases the rate of QA reduction, but cannot change the fluorescence induction pattern unless the PS II core complexes are connected through the large linker protein of the phycobilisome. The presence of phycobilisomes also contributes to the increase of Fo level. In our measurements, energy transfer between PS II units, which can be determined by the sigmoidal fluorescence increase as observed in dimeric PS II, was barely detected in vivo (Fig. 6). This result strongly indicates that most of the population of PS II functions in a monomeric form in vivo. Differing from the materials above, energy transfer between the PS II units was observed in spinach thylakoids and PS II preparations (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the previous reports (44.Joliot A. Joliot P. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 47.Melis A. Homann P.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1976; 23: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 62.Melis A. Duysens L.N.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 29: 373-382Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this sense, the relationship between individual PS II reaction center units in non-green plants is quite different from that in green plants, whose PS II complexes are assembled in the grana region and are connected directly or via surrounding LHCII. The remaining problem opposing our conclusion is that the oxygen-evolving activity in the PS II monomer is generally lower than in the dimer (e.g. Ref. 39.Sakurai I. Mizusawa N. Wada H. Sato N. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and Table 2). However, based on our present investigation, this can be explained by higher amounts of lipids in the monomer, which affect the accessibility of artificial electron acceptors to the secondary electron acceptor QB site (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The artificial electron acceptor, 2,5-DCBQ, is known to support a high rate of oxygen evolution by accepting electrons via both the first and the second intrinsic electron acceptor, QA and QB (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and is commonly used at ∼0.5 mm to assess oxygen-evolving activity. At lower concentrations, it accepts electrons via QB plastoquinone, but at higher concentrations, it replaces QB plastoquinone and accepts electrons directly from QA, resulting in a lower activity (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Another artificial electron acceptor, duroquinone, was shown to accept electrons only via the secondary intrinsic electron acceptor QB, not directly from QA (23.Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity of quinones can be evaluated by the values of CLogP, the calculated logarithm of the partition coefficient; the more hydrophobic a compound is, the greater its CLogP. The CLogP values of 2,5-DCBQ and duroquinone are 1.25 and 2.63, respectively (63.Siraki A.G. Chan T.S. O'Brien P.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 81: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The difference of Vmax can be interpreted as the difference of the abundance of lipids resulting in the different turnover rates of the artificial electron acceptors at the QB sites. Abundant lipids in the PS II monomer might become a physical barrier for the less hydrophobic 2,5-DCBQ to access to the QB site resulting in a lower Vmax. Inversely, the abundant lipids might assist the accessibility to the QB site for more hydrophobic duroquinone that accept electrons through QB. Therefore, the rate of oxygen evolution can be determined by the accessibility and mobility of 2,5-DCBQ and duroquinone to the QB site and in the lipids around the QB site. PS II complexes are embedded in the lipid layer (thylakoid membrane), therefore our results indicate that most of the population of PS II functions and exists in a monomeric form in vivo. The stoichiometry of ∼1 between isolated PS II and the bound light-harvesting phycobilisome suggested in T. elongatus (64.Kura-Hotta M. Satoh K. Katoh S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (formerly Synechococcus sp.) agrees with the monomeric existence of PS II in vivo, although other stoichiometry is also reported in cyanobacterial and red algal cells/thylakoids (65.Cunningham F.X.

https://openalex.org/W2056072007,"Background In developed countries, tuberculosis is considered a disease with little loss of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Tuberculosis treatment is predominantly ambulatory and death from tuberculosis is rare. Research has shown that there are chronic pulmonary sequelae in a majority of patients who have completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This and other health effects of tuberculosis have not been considered in QALY calculations. Consequently both the burden of tuberculosis on the individual and the value of tuberculosis prevention to society are underestimated. We estimated QALYs lost to pulmonary TB patients from all known sources, and estimated health loss to prevalent TB disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We calculated values for health during illness and treatment, pulmonary impairment after tuberculosis (PIAT), death rates, years-of-life-lost to death, and normal population health. We then compared the lifetime expected QALYs for a cohort of tuberculosis patients with that expected for comparison populations with latent tuberculosis infection and without tuberculosis infection. Persons with culture-confirmed tuberculosis accrued fewer lifetime QALYs than those without tuberculosis. Acute tuberculosis morbidity cost 0.046 QALYs (4% of total) per individual. Chronic morbidity accounted for an average of 0.96 QALYs (78% of total). Mortality accounted for 0.22 QALYs lost (18% of total). The net benefit to society of averting one case of PTB was about 1.4 QALYs. Conclusions/Significance Tuberculosis, a preventable disease, results in QALYs lost owing to illness, impairment, and death. The majority of QALYs lost from tuberculosis resulted from impairment after microbiologic cure. Successful TB prevention efforts yield more health quality than previously thought and should be given high priority by health policy makers. (Refer to Abstracto S1 for Spanish language abstract)"

Drugs have greater risks in pregnancy and determining the safety and efficacy of drugs in pregnancy is therefore a priority. This study set out to determine the efficacy and safety of several antimalarial drugs and combinations in pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria. Methods Pregnant women with non-severe, slide proven, falciparum malaria were randomised to one of 4 regimes: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [SP]; chlorproguanil-dapsone [CD]; SP+amodiaquine [SP+AQ] or amodiaquine+artesunate [AQ+AS]. Randomisation was on a 1∶2∶2∶2 ratio. Women were admitted for treatment, and followed at days 7, 14, 21, 28 after the start of treatment, at delivery and 6 weeks after delivery to determine adverse events, clinical and parasitological outcomes. Primary outcome was parasitological failure by day 28. Results 1433 pregnant women were screened, of whom 272 met entry criteria and were randomised; 28 to SP, 81 to CD, 80 to SP+AQ and 83 to AQ+AS. Follow-up to day 28 post treatment was 251/272 (92%), and to 6 weeks following delivery 91%. By day 28 parasitological failure rates were 4/26 (15%, 95%CI 4–35) in the SP, 18/77 (23%, 95%CI 14–34) in the CD, 1/73 (1% 95%CI 7–0.001) in the SP+AQ and 7/75 (9% 95%CI 4–18) in the AQ+AS arms respectively. After correction by molecular markers for reinfection the parasitological failure rates at day 28 were 18% for CD, 1% for SP+AQ and 4.5% for AQ+AS. There were two maternal deaths during the trial. There was no apparent excess of stillbirths or adverse birth outcomes in any arm. Parasitological responses were strikingly better in pregnant women than in children treated with the same drugs at this site. Conclusions Failure rates with monotherapy were unacceptably high. The two combinations tested were efficacious and appeared safe. It should not be assumed that efficacy in pregnancy is the same as in children. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00146731"
https://openalex.org/W1991441634,"Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has long been considered an attractive hypothesis to explain the selective dysfunction and death of neurons in polyglutamine disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD). The fact that inclusion bodies in HD mouse models and patient brains are rich in ubiquitin and proteasome components suggests that the UPS may be hindered directly or indirectly by inclusion bodies or their misfolded monomeric or oligomeric precursors. However, studies into UPS function in various polyglutamine disease models have yielded conflicting results, suggesting mutant polyglutamine tracts may exert different effects on the UPS depending on protein context, expression level, subcellular localisation and cell-type. To investigate UPS function in a well-characterised mouse model of HD, we have crossed R6/2 HD mice with transgenic UPS reporter mice expressing the GFPu construct. The GFPu construct comprises GFP fused to a constitutive degradation signal (CL-1) that promotes its rapid degradation under conditions of a healthy UPS. Using a combination of immunoblot analysis, fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy studies, we found that steady-state GFPu levels were not detectably different between R6/2 and non-R6/2 brain. We observed no correlation between inclusion body formation and GFPu accumulation, suggesting no direct relationship between protein aggregation and global UPS inhibition in R6/2 mice. These findings suggest that while certain branches of the UPS can be impaired by mutant polyglutamine proteins, such proteins do not necessarily cause total blockade of UPS-dependent degradation. It is therefore likely that the relationship between mutant polyglutamine proteins and the UPS is more complex than originally anticipated."

The actions of BDNF are dictated by two classes of cell surface receptors, the TrkB receptor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor. BDNF binding to TrkB receptors activates several signaling cascades, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, that mediate growth and survival responses to BDNF (1Chao M.V.

It has been established that upon binding neurotrophins, Trk receptors are rapidly endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner (6Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The degradative pathway to lysosomes is characterized by down-regulation of the total number of receptors at the cell surface and a decreased response to ligand. Conversely, recycling of receptors back to the plasma membrane can lead to functional resensitization and prolongation of cell surface-specific signaling events. A recent study has shown that recycled and re-secreted BDNF plays an important role in mediating the maintenance of long term potentiation in hippocampal slices, which suggests a potential role of TrkB recycling in long term potentiation regulation (14Santi S.

The physiological function of the TrkB.T1 receptor remains unclear, but it may serve as dominant-negative regulator of full-length TrkB receptors (23Eide F.F. Vining E.R. Eide B.L. Zang K. Wang X.Y.

Makrides V. Hinkle B. Hoang R. Medina-Selby A. Coit D. Valenzuela P. Feinstein S.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2683-2690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 are localized to both somatodendritic and axonal compartments in neurons (31Kryl D. Yacoubian T. Haapasalo A. Castren E. Lo D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5823-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, little is known about TrkB.T1 endocytic trafficking fate upon BDNF treatment. In this study we conducted an analysis of the postendocytic fates (degradation and recycling) of TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors in PC12 cells and neurons. We have determined that, unlike TrkB-FL, TrkB.T1 receptors recycle more efficiently in a default pathway to plasma surface after internalization, which is independent of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs). Conversely, Hrs could bind with TrkB-FL in a kinase activity-dependent manner and regulate TrkB-FL receptors postendocytic recycling. Hrs was identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells stimulated with growth factors and cytokines (32Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hrs is expressed in the cytoplasm of all cells and is predominantly localized to endosomes (33Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hrs has also been proposed to play a role in regulating cell surface receptor postendocytic trafficking (34Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These observations provide evidence for differential postendocytic sorting to alternate intracellular pathways between TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors after internalization. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant BDNF was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-TrkB antibody from Millipore; mouse anti-Hrs from Alexis Biochemicals, Switzerland; mouse anti-FLAG (M1, M2) and rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-tubulin antibodies from Sigma; Alexa Fluor® 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor® 594-labeled-human transferrin from Invitrogen; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG from Calbiochem. The restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Hanover, MD). Sulfo-NHS-biotin, Sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin, and chemiluminescence were from Pierce. Vectashield mounting medium was obtained from Vector Laboratories(Burlingame, CA). The other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasmid Constructs and siRNA Oligos—Rat TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 cDNAs were subcloned into pCDNA3.1Neo expression vector (Invitrogen) by using EcoRI and EcoRV sites. The amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag was added after the signal peptide of TrkB by PCR. TrkB kinase dead mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis. All the TrkB deletion constructs and TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 chimeric constructs were generated by means of two-step PCR. HA-tagged Hrs and its mutants (ΔUIM, ΔVHS, VHS-FYVE) were subcloned into pCDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence to exclude potential PCR-introduced mutations. The detailed information of all the constructs used in the study was described in supplemental Table 1. To knockdown the expression of Hrs, 19 nucleotides of Hrs sequence (GACGTGTGGGTTCTTGTCG for human (35Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12513-12521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and CGACAAGAACCCACACGTC for rat) were targeted with small interfering RNA using pSuper mammalian RNA expression vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting Hrs siRNA and the control siRNA constructs were transfected into HEK293 or PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and the levels of Hrs were determined by Western blotting with anti-Hrs antibodies. Hippocampal Neuron Cultures and Transfection—Cultured hippocampal neurons from timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as previously described (36Chen Z.Y. Patel P.D. Sant G. Meng C.X. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Lee F.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4401-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In brief, hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 18 rats, dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 37 °C for 15 min, triturated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12, 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, the neurons were seeded onto coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine in 6-well plates at a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Neurons were grown in Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. Cultures were grown for 8–12 days before being used for experiments, and the media were changed every 3 days. Neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, experiments were performed. Surface Biotinylation and Receptor Degradation Assay—For biotinylation experiments, the cultured neurons were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cell surface receptor biotinylation and degradation assays were performed as previously described (12Chen Z.Y. Ieraci A. Tanowitz M. Lee F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5761-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, serum-starved neurons were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 300 μg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 45 min at 4 °C to biotinylate surface proteins. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed with Tris-buffered saline. Biotinylated cells were then transferred to prewarmed medium containing BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 1 h, and cells were immediately chilled on ice and lysed in extraction buffer (1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min), and then biotinylated proteins were isolated from cell extracts by precipitation with streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads (Pierce). Washed beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For densitometric analyses, immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantitated using NIH Image J (Scion, Frederick, MD). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Cleavable Surface Biotinylation Assay—Cell surface receptor cleavable biotinylation, internalization, and recycling assays were performed as previously described (11Saxena S. Howe C.L. Cosgaya J.M. Steiner P. Hirling H. Chan J.R. Weis J. Krüttgen A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Neurons were preincubated with 100 μg/ml leupeptin for 90 min before biotinylation with sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin. Leupeptin was included in all subsequent steps to inhibit lysosomal proteolysis. For the internalization assay neurons were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in media alone (lanes 1 and 3) or in media containing BDNF to allow for internalization of cell-surface receptors. The remaining cell surface biotin was cleaved by glutathione (for all samples except lane 1, which represents total biotinylated TrkB receptors). Lane 2 shows a control for the efficiency of the stripping procedure, in which cells were kept at 4 °C after treatment with biotin and then subjected to biotin cleavage. Neurons were subsequently lysed, biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin beads, and complexes were immunoblotted with anti-TrkB antibodies. For the recycling assay, after biotinylation with sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin, neurons were incubated with 50 ng/ml BDNF for 30 min to drive internalization of biotinylated receptors. Afterward, the cells were cooled on ice, and the surface-exposed biotinylated proteins were stripped of their biotin tag by treatment with the reducing agent glutathione. Internalized biotinylated receptors were protected from biotin-stripping. Subsequently, prewarmed medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to allow recycling of internalized receptors. This incubation was followed by glutathione treatment on ice to remove biotin from the surface-exposed biotinylated receptors that had recycled back to the cell surface during the previous re-warming period. Un-recycled receptors were detected by streptavidin pulldown followed by anti-TrkB immunoblotting. For densitometric analysis, immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantitated using NIH Image J (Scion, Frederick, MD). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Surface TrkB Internalization Measurement—Neurons transfected with FLAG-TrkB-FL or FLAG-TrkB.T1 constructs were grown on glass coverslips. After serum starvation, cells were incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody for 30 min at 4 °C to selectively label FLAG-tagged receptors on the plasma membrane at the beginning of the experiment. Cells were then incubated (at 37 °C for 15 min) in the presence of BDNF to drive receptor internalization. At the end of this incubation, cells were quickly washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 3 mm EDTA to dissociate fluorescent M1 antibody from residual cell surface receptors. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, with the intracellular fluorescence representing the internalized receptors. In each experiment, two parallel control coverslips were included, one in which cells were fixed after a 300-min incubation in the absence of ligand and without EDTA stripping step (100% surface receptor control), and one in which cells were stripped immediately after the feeding step (0% Internalization control). Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy by using appropriate filter sets to selectively detect Alexa-488, and staining intensities of each fluor in individual cells were integrated using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each experimental condition was repeated at least three times. In each experiment more than 30 cells were examined at random. Analysis of TrkB Receptor Recycling by Using Fluorescence Ratio Microscopy—To quantify the extent of recycling observed after ligand removal in individual cells, a receptor recycling method was used as described previously (12Chen Z.Y. Ieraci A. Tanowitz M. Lee F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5761-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, cells transiently transfected with TrkB receptors were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody after serum starvation. Cells were then incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of BDNF (50 ng/ml) to drive internalization. At the end of this incubation, cells were quickly washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS/EDTA to dissociate FLAG antibody bound to residual surface receptors remaining in the plasma membrane, thereby leaving fluorescent antibody bound only to the internalized pool of receptors. EDTA-stripped cells were then incubated (at 37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of Alexa-594-anti-mouse IgG to label all receptors that returned back to the cell surface, and then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. In each experiment and for each receptor construct examined, two parallel control coverslips were included, one in which cells were fixed after a 30-min incubation in the absence of ligand and without EDTA stripping step (100% surface receptor control) and one in which cells were fixed immediately after the EDTA-mediated stripping step (0% recycled control). Cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy by using appropriate filter sets to selectively detect Alexa-488 or Alexa-594, and staining intensities of each fluor in individual cells were integrated using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). This analysis indicated that the efficiency of the EDTA strip (reduction of Alexa-594 staining intensity in the 0% recycled control relative to the 100% surface receptor control) was >95%. The percentage of receptors recycled in individual cells after ligand washout was then calculated from the red/green ratios determined from the control conditions according to the following formula (E - Z)/(C - Z) × 100, where E is the mean ratio for the experimental coverslip, Z is the mean ratio for the zero surface control, and C is the mean ratio for the 100% surface control. More than 30 cells/construct/condition were analyzed at random in this manner for each experiment. Establishment of HEK293 Stable Cell Line—HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-TrkB-FL construct using Lipofectamine 2000. To obtain stable transfectants, cells were treated with 800 μg/ml G418. After 15–20 days of G418 selection, resistant clones were subjected to Western blot analysis using FLAG antibodies to detect TrkB protein expression. Positive clones were maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. HEK293 cells have been widely used in studying Hrs-regulated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) endocytic trafficking (37Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3095-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we chose a HEK293 TrkB-FL stable cell line to evaluate the TrkB degradation rate under different conditions due to the high transfection efficiency with HEK293 cells. Immunocytochemical Staining and Fluorescence Microscopy—Hippocampal neurons were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and transfected with FLAG tagged TrkB-FL or TrkB.T1 constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, internalized FLAG receptors were visualized by Alexa-488-M1 antibody feeding (1:1000) followed by BDNF treatment. Cells were then fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS and permeabilized by brief treatment with cold methanol (5 min) followed by Hrs immunostaining with primary and secondary antibodies. Transferrin receptors were labeled with Alexa-594-transferrin (Invitrogen). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on hippocampal neuron specimens using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. Quantitative analysis was carried out with MetaMorph software. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 Receptors Have Different Degradation Kinetics upon BDNF Treatment—As it has been reported that both TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors could be endocytosed by BDNF (39Alderson R.F. Curtis R. Alterman A.L. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Brain Res. 2000; 871: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether there were differences in the trafficking fate of the two receptors after endocytosis. To examine whether these two receptors were differentially degraded, we directly compared the rates of BDNF-dependent degradation of the TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were serum-starved followed by cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) pretreatment to inhibit new protein synthesis, and BDNF (50 ng/ml) was added to the culture media for various times periods. Cell lysates were then collected at different time point to detect TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 protein levels by Western blot. We found that TrkB-FL was degraded at a significantly quicker rate (<1 h for more than one-half of the receptors to be degraded) than TrkB.T1 receptors (Fig. 1A). To confirm this result, surface biotinylation assays were performed on hippocampal neurons to monitor surface receptor degradation. After 1 h of BDNF incubation, more than half of the surface TrkB-FL receptors were degraded; however, no obvious change in TrkB.T1 receptor levels was found (Fig. 1B). Both TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 Receptors Are Efficiently Internalized after BDNF Treatment—We hypothesized that the differences in degradation rates may be due to alterations in TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptor trafficking at certain steps after ligand addition, namely 1) at the initial internalization step and/or 2) at a postendocytic step in which Trk receptors can be sorted to either degradative or recycling pathways. To address these questions related to the TrkB endocytic pathways, we measured TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptor internalization by a cleavable surface biotinylation assay. After 15 min of BDNF treatment, about 56 ± 2% TrkB-FL and 50 ± 2% TrkB.T1 receptor were internalized, respectively, in hippocampal neurons, with no significant difference between each other (Fig. 2A). To confirm the cleavable biotinylation result, quantitative fluorescence assay was employed to measure TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptor internalization. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors. Respectively, and fed with Alexa488-conjugated FLAG antibodies. We took advantage of a novel feature of the amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged versions of Trk receptors, in which calcium-sensitive fluorescent anti-FLAG antibodies can be rapidly dissociated with PBS/EDTA (12Chen Z.Y. Ieraci A. Tanowitz M. Lee F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5761-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After ligand-induced surface receptor internalization, PBS/EDTA was used to strip the cell surface fluorescent antibodies. Any remaining intracellular fluorescence, therefore, represented the internalized receptors. We found both TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors were rapidly internalized in the presence of BDNF, and no significant differences were observed in their levels of internalization (Fig. 2B). TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 Receptors Behave Differently in Their Postendocytic Recycling—Because TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptors have similar internalization levels but significantly different degradation kinetics, we sought to measure the degree of their postendocytic recycling. First, a cleavable biotinylation assay was used to detect receptor recycling after internalization in hippocampal neurons. We found a higher percentage of the remaining internalized TrkB-FL receptor after the re-warming process as compared with TrkB.T1 receptor (Fig. 3A), which suggested that more internalized TrkB.T1 receptor has been recycled back to the cell surface to be cleaved. A live cell ratiometric fluorescence-based recycling assay, which has been used in our previous study (12Chen Z.Y. Ieraci A. Tanowitz M. Lee F.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5761-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was also employed to measure the TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 receptor recycling (Fig. 3B). Quantification of these results by ratiometric analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed that TrkB.T1 recycled in a BDNF-dependent manner significantly (90 ± 1%), whereas TrkB-FL recycled to a lesser degree (39 ± 1%) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this finding is that compared with TrkB-FL, internalized TrkB.T1 receptor was colocalized significantly more with the transferrin receptor, a default recycling receptor, as determined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C). Together, these results suggest that TrkB.T1 receptor is predominantly sorted to the recycling pathway, which is consistent with its minimal BDNF-dependent degradation (Fig. 1A), whereas TrkB-FL receptor recycles to a lesser extent after BDNF treatment. Kinase Domain Is the Key Motif Responsible for the Differential TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 Endocytic Recycling—To define the potential region in TrkB-FL receptor that is responsible for the differences in TrkB-FL and TrkB.T1 recycling levels, various domains (juxtamembrane"

The factors that regulate these interactions are, at the present time, incompletely understood. Recent studies showing preferences in binding between synthetic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in vitro have suggested that the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, restrain proapoptotic Bak from inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Here we show that Bak protein has a much higher affinity than the 26-amino acid Bak Bcl-2 homology domain 3 for Bcl-2, that some naturally occurring Bcl-2 allelic variants have an affinity for full-length Bak that is only 3-fold lower than that of Mcl-1, and that endogenous levels of these Bcl-2 variants (which are as much as 40-fold more abundant than Mcl-1) restrain part of the Bak in intact lymphoid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Bcl-2 variants can, depending on their affinity for Bak, substitute for Mcl-1 in protecting cells. Thus, the ability of Bcl-2 to protect cells from activated Bak depends on two important contextual variables, the identity of the Bcl-2 present and the amount expressed.

Much of the information about the interactions between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members has been derived from the study of synthetic peptides corresponding to BH3 domains.

Recent studies using these same peptides have suggested that interactions of the BH3 domains of Bax, Bak, and the BH3-only proteins with the “BH3 receptors” of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members are not all equivalent. Surface plasmon resonance, a technique that is widely used to examine the interactions of biomolecules under cell-free conditions (24.Stevenson R. Am. Biotechnol. Lab. 1991; 9: 36PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Jason-Moller L. Murphy M. Bruno J. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci.2006Google Scholar, 26.Berggård T. Linse S. James P. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), has demonstrated that synthetic BH3 peptides of some BH3-only family members show striking preferences, with the Bad BH3 peptide binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1, and the Noxa BH3 peptide binding to Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (27.Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Bak BH3 peptide exhibits selectivity, with high affinity for Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 (12.Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The latter results have led to a model in which Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 restrain Bak and inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 does not (10.Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Because the Bak protein contains multiple recognizable domains in addition to its BH3 motif (28.Chittenden T. Harrington E.A.

Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that Bcl-2 binds Bak protein with much higher affinity than the Bak 26-mer BH3 peptide. Further experiments demonstrated that the KD for Bak differs among naturally occurring Bcl-2 sequence variants but is only 3-fold higher than that of Mcl-1 in some cases.

Results of these experiments demonstrated that Bcl-2 expression varies among different lymphoid cell lines but is up to 40-fold more abundant than Mcl-1. In lymphoid cell lines with abundant Bcl-2, Bak is detected in Bcl-2 as well as Mcl-1 immunoprecipitates; and Bak-dependent apoptosis induced by Mcl-1 down-regulation can be prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression. Collectively, these observations shed new light on the role of Bcl-2 in binding and neutralizing Bak. Reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPhe from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, MA); polysorbate 20 from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden); CM5 biosensor chips from GE Healthcare; glutathione and dimethyl pimelimidate from Sigma; and APC-conjugated annexin V from Pharmingen.

Antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Hsp90 were kind gifts from Guy Poirier (Laval University, Ste.-Foy, Quebec) and David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), respectively. cDNAs encoding Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bax lacking the transmembrane domain were cloned in-frame with GST in pGEX-4T-1. cDNA encoding Mcl-1 lacking the transmembrane domain was cloned into pET29b(+) to yield an S peptide-tagged construct. Plasmid encoding BakΔTM in pET29b(+) (22.Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Qian Liu and Kalle Gehring (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Plasmid encoding Bak N85A/I86AΔTM was generated from BakΔTM using site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were subjected to automated sequencing to verify the described alteration and confirm that no additional mutations were present. Plasmids were transformed into Rosetta cells (BaxΔTM, Bcl-2ΔTM, Bcl-xLΔTM, and Mcl-1ΔTM) or BL21 (BakΔTM and Bak N85AI86AΔTM) by heat shock. After cells were grown to an optical density of 0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 24 h at 16 °C (Bcl-2ΔTM) or 4 h at 37 °C (Bcl-xLΔTM, Mcl-1ΔTM, BaxΔTM, BakΔTM, and Bak N85AI86AΔTM). Bacteria were then washed and sonicated intermittently on ice in calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm PMSF (GST-tagged proteins and S peptide-Mcl-1ΔTM) or TS buffer (150 mm NaCl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm PMSF, His6-tagged BakΔTM, and Bak N85AI86AΔTM). All further steps were performed at 4 °C. After His6-tagged proteins were applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen, La Jolla, CA), columns were washed with 20 volumes of TS buffer followed by 10 volumes of TS buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and then eluted with TS buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. His6-BakΔTM and Bak N85AI86AΔTM were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex S200 size exclusion column and concentrated by ultrafiltration. S peptide-tagged Mcl-1ΔTM was incubated with S protein-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. After beads were washed twice with 10 volumes of PBS containing 1 mm PMSF, bound polypeptide was eluted with PBS containing 3 m MgCl2. After GST-tagged proteins were incubated with GSH-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C, GSH-agarose resin was washed twice with 20–25 volumes of PBS and eluted with PBS containing 20 mm reduced glutathione for 30 min at 4 °C. All eluted polypeptides were concentrated using Centricon YM-10 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) and dialyzed against Biacore running buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA and 0.005% (w/v) Polysorbate 20. Polypeptides were stored at 4 °C for <48 h before use. Measurements were performed at 25 °C on a Biacore 3000 biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). BakΔTM, Bak BH3 peptide, or GST-Bcl-2 was immobilized onto a CM5 sensorchip as instructed by the supplier. After washing with Biacore running buffer, Mcl-1ΔTM, GST/Bcl-2ΔTM, GST/Bcl-xLΔTM, or GST was injected at 30 μl/min for 1 min. Bound polypeptide was allowed to dissociate by injection of protein-free Biacore running buffer at 30 μl/min for 15 min. Residual bound proteins were desorbed with 150 mm NaCl containing 10 mm glycine (pH 2.0). Binding kinetics were derived from sensorgrams using BIAevaluation software (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The binding of BakΔTM or Bak N85AI86AΔTM to immobilized GST-Bcl-2 was analyzed in the same fashion. Cell lines were obtained from the following sources: Jurkat (T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia) from Paul Leibson (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN); RL (B cell lymphoma) from Thomas Witzig (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN); Molt3 and CCFR-CEM (both T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia) from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); and Daudi (Burkitt B cell lymphoma) from Adele Fielding (Mayo Clinic). All lines were maintained at densities below 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Log phase cells were washed with PBS, lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 nm microcystin. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to sediment insoluble material, lysates were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A/G-agarose beads followed by sedimentation. Aliquots containing 200 μg of precleared extract were incubated for 1 h with anti-Bcl-2, anti-Mcl-1, or anti-Bcl-xL that was precoupled to protein A/G-agarose using dimethyl pimelimidate (39.Harlow E.

After sedimentation at 8000 × g for 2 min, beads were rapidly washed four times with wash buffer consisting of 1% CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Polypeptides bound to the beads were released by heating for 20 min at 65 °C in SDS sample buffer consisting of 4 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated Bcl-2 family members and serial dilutions of precleared cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to Bak, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL as indicated in the figure legends. Films from three independent experiments were scanned on a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 4C scanner and quantified using ImageJ software (//rsb.info.nih.gov). Short oligonucleotides targeting Bax (nucleotides 271–289, GenBankTM accession number NM_138761), Bak (nucleotides 913–931, GenBankTM accession number NM_001188), Bim (nucleotides 325–343, GenBankTM accession number NM_138621), and Puma (nucleotides 1222–1240, GenBankTM accession number NM_001127242) were from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO).

After collection of 40,000 events, APC-annexin V binding was determined on cells that were positive for both EGFP and EBFP. Plasmid encoding S peptide-tagged Bcl-2 was constructed by inserting cDNA containing nucleotides 4–720 of the human Bcl-2 open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number X06487) into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pSPN (43.Hackbarth J.S.

Plasmids encoding different Bcl-2 variants were made by putting full-length Bcl-2 (variant 1, 2, or 3) behind the cytomegalovirus promoter of pCMS5A. Plasmid pCMS5C was derived from pCMS5A by site-directed mutagenesis. Two amino acid substitutions (Y66H and Y145F) were inserted to convert EGFP to EBFP. Once again, all plasmids were sequenced to verify the integrity of inserted shRNA and rescue constructs. Log phase cells growing in antibiotic-free medium were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid using a BTX 830 square wave electroporator delivering a single pulse at 280 mV for 10 ms.

https://openalex.org/W2046007877,"The prototype baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, an insect pathogen, holds great potential as a gene therapy vector. To develop transductional targeting and gene delivery by baculovirus, we focused on characterizing the nature and regulation of its uptake in human cancer cells. Baculovirus entered the cells along fluid-phase markers from the raft areas into smooth-surfaced vesicles devoid of clathrin. Notably, regulators associated with macropinocytosis, namely EIPA, Pak1, Rab34, and Rac1, had no significant effect on viral transduction, and the virus did not induce fluid-phase uptake. The internalization and nuclear uptake was, however, affected by mutants of RhoA, and of Arf6, a regulator of clathrin-independent entry. Furthermore, the entry of baculovirus induced ruffle formation and triggered the uptake of fluorescent E. coli bioparticles. To conclude, baculovirus enters human cells via a clathrin-independent pathway, which is able to trigger bacterial uptake. This study increases our understanding of virus entry strategies and gives new insight into baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in human cells."

The homology structure reveals an IL-3:IL-3 interaction interface in a higher-order complex modeled after the dodecamer of the GM-CSF:receptor complex wherein an analogous GM-CSF:GM-CSF interface is also identified. This interface is mediated by a proline-rich hydrophobic motif (PPLPLL) of the AA′ loop that is highly exposed in the structure of isolated IL-3. Various experimental data suggest that this motif is required for IL-3 function through receptor-binding independent mechanisms. These observations are consistent with structure-function studies of the GM-CSF:receptor complex showing that formation of the higher-order cytokine:receptor complex is required for signaling. However, a key question not answered from previous studies is how cytokine binding facilitates the assembly of the higher-order complex. Our studies here reveal a potential cytokine–cytokine interaction that participates in the assembly of the dodecamer complex, thus linking cytokine binding to receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2129300601,"Background A dominance of Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses is significantly associated with a lower viral load in individuals with chronic, untreated clade C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This association has not been investigated in terms of Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses, nor have clade C HIV-1–specific CD4+ T cell epitopes, likely a vital component of an effective global HIV-1 vaccine, been identified. Methodology/Principal Findings Intracellular cytokine staining was conducted on 373 subjects with chronic, untreated clade C infection to assess interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses by CD4+ T cells to pooled Gag peptides and to determine their association with viral load and CD4 count. Gag-specific IFN-γ–producing CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 261/373 (70%) subjects, with the Gag responders having a significantly lower viral load and higher CD4 count than those with no detectable Gag response (p<0.0001 for both parameters). To identify individual peptides targeted by HIV-1–specific CD4+ T cells, separate ELISPOT screening was conducted on CD8-depleted PBMCs from 32 chronically infected untreated subjects, using pools of overlapping peptides that spanned the entire HIV-1 clade C consensus sequence, and reconfirmed by flow cytometry to be CD4+ mediated. The ELISPOT screening identified 33 CD4+ peptides targeted by 18/32 patients (56%), with 27 of the 33 peptides located in the Gag region. Although the breadth of the CD4+ responses correlated inversely with viral load (p = 0.015), the magnitude of the response was not significantly associated with viral load. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that in chronic untreated clade C HIV-1 infection, IFN-γ–secreting Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses are immunodominant, directed at multiple distinct epitopes, and associated with viral control."
https://openalex.org/W2155643740,"Sister chromatid cohesion mediated by cohesin is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Classical studies suggest that heterochromatin promotes cohesion, but whether this happens through regulation of cohesin remains to be determined. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a major component of heterochromatin. In fission yeast, the HP1 homologue Swi6 interacts with cohesin and is required for proper targeting and/or stabilization of cohesin at the centromeric region. To test whether this pathway is conserved in human cells, we have examined the behavior of cohesin in cells in which the levels of HP1 alpha, beta or gamma (the three HP1 proteins present in mammalian organisms) have been reduced by siRNA. We have also studied the consequences of treating human cells with drugs that change the histone modification profile of heterochromatin and thereby affect HP1 localization. Our results show no evidence for a requirement of HP1 proteins for either loading of bulk cohesin onto chromatin in interphase or retention of cohesin at pericentric heterochromatin in mitosis. However, depletion of HP1gamma leads to defects in mitotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2157032647,"Neisseria meningitidis requires iron, and in the absence of iron alters its gene expression to increase iron acquisition and to make the best use of the iron it has. During different stages of colonization and infection available iron sources differ, particularly the host iron-binding proteins haemoglobin, transferrin, and lactoferrin. This study compared the transcriptional responses of N. meningitidis, when grown in the presence of these iron donors and ferric iron, using microarrays.Specific transcriptional responses to the different iron sources were observed, including genes that are not part of the response to iron restriction. Comparisons between growth on haemoglobin and either transferrin or lactoferrin identified changes in 124 and 114 genes, respectively, and 33 genes differed between growth on transferrin or lactoferrin. Comparison of gene expression from growth on haemoglobin or ferric iron showed that transcription is also affected by the entry of either haem or ferric iron into the cytoplasm. This is consistent with a model in which N. meningitidis uses the relative availability of host iron donor proteins as niche indicators.Growth in the presence of haemoglobin is associated with a response likely to be adaptive to survival within the bloodstream, which is supported by serum killing assays that indicate growth on haemoglobin significantly increases survival, and the response to lactoferrin is associated with increased expression of epithelial cell adhesins and oxidative stress response molecules. The transferrin receptor is the most highly transcribed receptor and has the fewest genes specifically induced in its presence, suggesting this is the favoured iron source for the bacterium. Most strikingly, the responses to haemoglobin, which is associated with unrestricted growth, indicates a low iron transcriptional profile, associated with an aggressive phenotype that may be adaptive to access host iron sources but which may also underlie the lethal features of meningococcal septicaemia, when haemoglobin may become a major source of iron."
https://openalex.org/W2015963483,"Background Hemoglobin (Hb) is the iron-containing oxygen transport protein present in the red blood cells of vertebrates. Ancient DNA and forensic scientists are particularly interested in Hb reactions in the dry state because both regularly encounter aged, dried bloodstains. The DNA in such stains may be oxidatively damaged and, in theory, may be deteriorated by the presence of Hb. To understand the nature of the oxidative systems potentially available to degrade DNA in the presence of dried Hb, we need to determine what molecular species Hb forms over time. These species will determine what type of iron (i.e. Fe2+/Fe3+/Fe4+) is available to participate in further chemical reactions. The availability of “free” iron will affect the ability of the system to undergo Fenton-type reactions which generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•). The OH• can directly damage DNA. Methodology/Principal Findings Oxygenated Hb (oxyHb) converts over time to oxidized Hb (metHb), but this happens more quickly in the dry state than in the hydrated state, as shown by monitoring stabilized oxyHb. In addition, dry state oxyHb converts into at least one other unknown species other than metHb. Although “free” iron was detectable as both Fe2+ and Fe3+ in dry and hydrated oxyHb and metHb, the amount of ions detected did not increase over time. There was no evidence that Hb becomes more prone to generating OH• as it ages in either the hydrated or dry states. Conclusions The Hb molecule in the dried state undergoes oxidative changes and releases reactive Fe(II) cations. These changes, however, do not appear to increase the ability of Hb to act as a more aggressive Fenton reagent over time. Nevertheless, the presence of Hb in the vicinity of DNA in dried bloodstains creates the opportunity for OH•-induced oxidative damage to the deoxyribose sugar and the DNA nucleobases."
https://openalex.org/W2001364008,"Background Before furin can act on protein substrates, it must go through an ordered process of activation. Similar to many other proteinases, furin is synthesized as a zymogen (profurin) which becomes active only after the autocatalytic removal of its auto-inhibitory prodomain. We hypothesized that to activate profurin its prodomain had to be removed and, in addition, the emerging enzyme's N-terminus had to be ejected from the catalytic cleft. Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed and analyzed the profurin mutants in which the egress of the emerging enzyme's N-terminus from the catalytic cleft was restricted. Mutants were autocatalytically processed at only the primary cleavage site Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg107↓Asp108, but not at both the primary and the secondary (Arg-Gly-Val-Thr-Lys-Arg75↓Ser76) cleavage sites, yielding, as a result, the full-length prodomain and mature furins commencing from the N-terminal Asp108. These correctly processed furin mutants, however, remained self-inhibited by the constrained N-terminal sequence which continuously occupied the S′ sub-sites of the catalytic cleft and interfered with the functional activity. Further, using the in vitro cleavage of the purified prodomain and the analyses of colon carcinoma LoVo cells with the reconstituted expression of the wild-type and mutant furins, we demonstrated that a three-step autocatalytic processing including the cleavage of the prodomain at the previously unidentified Arg-Leu-Gln-Arg89↓Glu90 site, is required for the efficient activation of furin. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, our results show the restrictive role of the enzyme's N-terminal region in the autocatalytic activation mechanisms. In a conceptual form, our data apply not only to profurin alone but also to a range of self-activated proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1965317948,"Background An impressive number of studies have investigated bird vocal displays, and many of them have tried to explain the widespread phenomenon of the so-called dawn and dusk chorus, the sunrise and sunset peaks in bird song output. As many as twelve non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why twilight peaks in vocal display might be advantageous; but, even after more than two decades of study, the basis underlying the dusk and dawn chorus is still unclear. Moreover, to date, the majority of studies on this topic have focused on songbirds. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigate here a novel hypothesis on why nocturnal birds with patches of white feathers call at twilight. We propose that white plumage patches and the timing of visual signaling have co-evolved to maximize the effectiveness of social communication such as the dusk chorus. This hypothesis centers on the recent discovery that eagle owls can adopt specific forms of visual signaling and is supported by the observation that adult eagle owls possess a white throat badge that is only visible during vocal displays. By monitoring the calling of eagle owls at dusk, a peak time for bird call output, we found that white throat badges contrasted most with the surrounding background during the owls' twilight chorusing. Conclusions/Significance Crepuscular and nocturnal species appear to have evolved white patches that, shown in association with vocal displays, allow them to communicate in dark surroundings. The evolution of a white badge that operates jointly with call displays at dawn and dusk may be relevant to the eagle owls' social dynamics. Our explanation for the dusk chorus may possibly represent an overlooked but common pattern of signaling among crepuscular and nocturnal birds that combine patches of white feathers with twilight displays. Furthermore, our findings could be relevant to songbirds that breed in dark forest habitats and have contrasting white badges, as well as birds living in open habitats and showing contrasting bars."
https://openalex.org/W2132621604,"HP1 is a major component of chromatin and regulates gene expression through its binding to methylated histone H3. Most eukaryotes express at least three isoforms of HP1 with similar domain architecture. However, despite the common specificity for methylated histone H3, the three HP1 isoforms bind to different regions of the genome. Most of the studies so far focused on the HP1a isoform and its role in transcriptional regulation. As HP1a requires additional factors to bind methylated chromatin in vitro, we wondered whether another isoform might also require additional targeting factors. Indeed, we found that HP1c interacts with the DNA binding factors Woc and Row and requires Woc to become targeted to chromatin in vivo. Moreover, we show that the interaction between HP1c and Woc constitutes a transcriptional feedback loop that operates to balance the concentration of HP1c within the cell. This regulation may prevent HP1c from binding to methylated heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2008052738,"Protein structural domains are necessary for understanding evolution and protein folding, and may vary widely from functional and sequence based domains. Although, various structural domain databases exist, defining domains for some proteins is non-trivial, and definitions of their domain boundaries are not available. Here, we present a novel database of manually defined structural domains for a representative set of proteins from the SCOP “multi-domain proteins” class. (http://prodata.swmed.edu/multidom/). We consider our domains as mobile evolutionary units, which may rearrange during protein evolution. Additionally, they may be visualized as structurally compact and possibly independently folding units. We also found that representing domains as evolutionary and folding units do not always lead to a unique domain definition. However, unlike existing databases, we retain and refine these “alternate” domain definitions after careful inspection of structural similarity, functional sites and automated domain definition methods. We provide domain definitions, including actual residue boundaries, for proteins that well known databases like SCOP and CATH do not attempt to split. Our alternate domain definitions are suitable for sequence and structure searches by automated methods. Additionally, the database can be used for training and testing domain delineation algorithms. Since our domains represent structurally compact evolutionary units, the database may be useful for studying domain properties and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2040294369,"The midbody is a transient complex structure containing proteins involved in cytokinesis. Up to now, it has been described only in Metazoa. Other eukaryotes present a variety of structures implied in the last steps of cell division, such as the septum in fungi or the phragmoplast in plants. However, it is unclear whether these structures are homologous (derive from a common ancestral structure) or analogous (have distinct evolutionary origins). Recently, the proteome of the hamster midbody has been characterized and 160 proteins identified.Using phylogenomic approaches, we show here that nearly all of these 160 proteins (95%) are conserved across metazoan lineages. More surprisingly, we show that a large part of the mammalian midbody components (91 proteins) were already present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes (LECA) and were most likely involved in the construction of a complex multi-protein assemblage acting in cell division.Our results indicate that the midbodies of non-mammalian metazoa are likely very similar to the mammalian one and that the ancestor of Metazoa possessed a nearly modern midbody. Moreover, our analyses support the hypothesis that the midbody and the structures involved in cytokinesis in other eukaryotes derive from a large and complex structure present in LECA, likely involved in cytokinesis. This is an additional argument in favour of the idea of a complex ancestor for all contemporary eukaryotes."

Herpesviruses have been found in animal species ranging from molluscs to man. According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the order of Herpesvirales consists of three families as follows: Alloherpesviridae, Herpesviridae, and Malacoherpesviridae (1Davison A.J. Eberle R. Ehlers B. Hayward G.S. McGeoch D.J. Minson A.C. Pellett P.E. Roizman B. Studdert M.J. Thiry E. Arch. Virol. 2009; 154: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae, and Gammaherpesvirinae are found within the family of Herpesviridae. The events leading to establishment of a new virus species are poorly understood, but in the case of herpesviruses it is commonly assumed that viruses co-evolve with their hosts (2Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2479-2499Google Scholar). Herpesviruses have thus become well adapted to their hosts and may reside in a latent state in the host for a lifetime with little or no overt signs of infection. Upon reactivation, the infectious virus will be released. The viruses remain faithful to their hosts, and infections across species borders are rare but may under specific circumstances give rise to fatal disease.

Studies with deletion mutants have demonstrated that important sequences are found close to the C terminus of OBP, but amino acids directly participating in the high affinity interaction have not been identified. The interaction is biologically significant, because deletion of the extreme C terminus enhances the helicase activity of OBP but reduces origin-dependent DNA synthesis (26Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-1 oriS contains three copies of the binding site for OBP; two binding sites, box I and box II, are high affinity sites, and the third binding site, box III, has a very low affinity for OBP (14Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Box III and box I are arranged in a palindrome, which becomes rearranged upon activation to form an alternative conformation, most likely a hairpin (4Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol.

To learn more about the mechanism of virus evolution, we have examined the evolutionary history of some functionally significant features of the HSV-1 replicon and related them to a sequence-based evolutionary tree. The results indicate that replicon divergence, characterized by the stepwise appearance of the DNA-binding RVKNL motif, the WPXXXGAXXFXXL ICP8-binding motif, and the boxIII–boxI palindrome, may have played important roles in establishing major branches of the alphaherpesvirus tree.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATTGGGACGAAGTGCGAACGCTTCGCA-3′ were annealed to make a box I high affinity binding site for HSV-1 OBP (Fig. 1). The oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTGCGAAGCGTCCGCACTTCGTCCCAATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATTGGGACGAAGTGCGGACGCTTCGCA-3′ were annealed to make box I high affinity binding sites for CHV1 OBP (monkey B virus). The plasmid pORI(boxImut) contains a mutated version of oriS with only one high affinity binding site, box I, for OBP. A restriction fragment containing oriS was isolated and radiolabeled as described previously (29Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PCR was used to generate DNA fragments containing a tentative minimal DNA binding domain consisting of amino acids 717–814 of HSV-1 OBP/UL9. The primers were as follows: F1, 5′-CATATGAGCGGCTGTCCCCCGCGCGGGTCC-3′, and R1, 5′-GGATCCTTAGCGCAAACAGCGCCCCCACGCGGG-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned in a pTOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. It was then transferred as NdeI/BamHI fragments to the pET14B (Novagen). The resulting protein product had the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMPPRGSVSETDHAVALFKIIWGELFGVQMTKSTQTFPGAGRVKNLTKQTIVGLLDAHHIDHSACRTHRQLYALLMAHKREFAGARFKLRVPAWGRCLRT. Using the same strategy, PCR fragments containing amino acids 536–813, 553–813, 556–813, 558–813, and 567–813 of HSV-1 OBP/UL9 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A plasmid encoding CHV1 UL9 protein was provided by Dr. Richard Eberle. A PCR fragment encoding the C-terminal DNA binding domain was used to replace HSV-1ΔOBP and make pET3aHisΔCHV1UL9. The forward primer pair was 5′-GGATCCGACACCAACGTGTCGCTGCAGGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCTAAGGTGCGGTGCCGCCGGGCCGCCTAT-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned in a pTOPO vector and verified by DNA sequencing. It was then transferred as BamHI/Bsu36I fragment to the pET14B. To investigate the interaction between OBP and ICP8, a cassette mutagenesis strategy was devised. pET3aHisΔOBP was modified to contain an SnaBI site, and duplex oligonucleotides were inserted into SnaBI and SacII cleaved vector to create HisΔOBP with altered C termini. The resulting constructs are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2C-terminal sequences in HSV-1 HisΔOBP created by cassette mutagenesisΗisΔOBP variantC-terminal sequenceICP8 bindingWild type (HSV-1)EAWPMMQGAVNFSTL+A (VZV)GSWPRINGAVNFESL+BEAAPMMQGAVNFSTL−CEAWAMMQGAVNFSTL+DEAWPMMQAAVNFSTL+EEAWPMMQGAVNASTL−FEA− Open table in a new tab HisΔOBP with mutations in the DNA binding domain designated F751A, P752A/G753A, R756A, V757A, K758A/N759A, N759A, N759A/L760A, and L768A/L769A were all made using QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and verified by DNA sequencing. The His-tagged C-terminal domain of HSV-1 OBP, here named HisΔOBP, was produced as described previously (16Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of CHV1 OBP was also isolated as a His-tagged fusion protein following the same protocol. HisΔOBP with altered C termini, the various truncated versions of HisΔOBP, and the alanine substitution mutants were also isolated by the same procedure. Mass spectrometry was used for protein identification. ICP8, UL29 protein, was purified using recombinant baculovirus as described previously (27Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To evaluate sequence-specific DNA binding by HSV-1 HisΔOBP and CHV1 HisΔOBP, a polyacrylamide gel mobility shift assay was used (16Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Samples, 20 μl, containing 1 nm radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotides and indicated amounts of protein were incubated on ice before gel electrophoresis. The dried gels were analyzed by a phosphorimager. To evaluate the specificity of the OBP-ICP8 interaction, we employed a previously described gel electrophoresis assay in which a ternary complex between double-stranded oriS, HisΔOBP, and ICP8 could be detected (29Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sonicated calf thymus DNA, 1 μg/ml, was included to suppress interactions between ICP8 and DNA. In control experiments we made sure that the ternary complex was disrupted following addition of a 65-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate T65 to leave the binary complex oriS-HisΔOBP as demonstrated in Ref. 29Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar (results not shown). Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing sequences from oriS supporting formation of the putative box III–box I hairpin were analyzed by NMR. The palindrome oligonucleotides 5′-GAAGTGAGAACGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTC-3′, including a central loop of three nucleotides and a mismatch at position 7, and 5′-AAGTGCGAACATGTAGTGTTCGCACTT-3′, with a five nucleotide loop and no mismatch, represent HSV-1 and EHV4, respectively. For all spectra, 0.5–1 mm samples of oligonucleotide in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, were used. Before recording, the sample was heated to a temperature where the imino signals were not visible and then cooled down to the temperature used, i.e. 15 or 25 °C. All NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Inova 500 or 600 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance probes. A set of DQF-COSY total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy in D2O was recorded for assignment purposes (31Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2007Google Scholar). Typically, 64 transients with each 1024 complex points in t2 and 256 increments in t1 were acquired. Two different mixing times were used in total correlation spectroscopy experiments (50 and 100 ms) as well as in nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (100 and 250 ms). The sweep width was set to 5000 and 6000 Hz for spectra recorded at 500 and 600 MHz, respectively. A weak presaturation pulse was used for water suppression. nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were also recorded in a mixture of 90% 1H2O, 10% D2O using the watergate sequence for water suppression (32Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) but otherwise the same parameters as above. A 1H-31P spectrum (144 transients; 256 complex points in t1; 1024 complex points in t2; 1000 Hz sweep width in phosphor dimension; 5000 Hz sweep width for protons) was recorded at 500 MHz using a triple resonance probe. All spectra were processed with nmrPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). The time-domain data sets were typically zero-filled once in each dimension and Fourier-transformed. A polynomial base-line correction was used. For the spectral analysis, resonance assignments, peak integration, and measurement of J couplings with the program XEASY (34Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) was used. Structure calculations were performed with the program DYANA following standard procedures (35Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides representing putative box III–box I hairpins from a selected set of alphaherpesviruses were as follows: BHV1, 5′-GTGAGAACGCTGGCAGAATGCCAGCGTTCGCAC-3′ (14 bp/1 mismatch/3 nucleotides in the loop); HSV-1, 5′-AAGTGCGAACATGTAGTGTTCGCACTT-3′ (12/1/3); EHV1, 5′-AAGTCCGAACACGTAGTGTTCGCACTT-3′ (11/1/3); EHV4, 5′-AAGTGCGAACATGTAGTGTTCGCACTT-3′ (11/0/5); GHV2, 5′-GCAGTGCGAACGCGTCAGCGTTCGCACTGC-3′ (13/0/4); and GHV, 5′-GCGGGGCGAACGCGTCAGCGTTCGCACCGC-3′ (12/1/4). A Cary 4B spectrophotometer equipped with a programmable multicell temperature block was used for the Tm measurements. Changes in the absorbance were measured at the maximum of the DNA absorption band (260 nm). The concentration of the six different hairpin-forming DNA strands was chosen so that the absorbance at 15 °C was between 0.69 and 0.72. The buffer used was 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na+, pH 7.5. The temperature of the samples was continuously changed at a rate of 0.5 °C per min from 15 to 92 °C and back to 15 °C. To make it easier to compare the melting temperatures of the hairpins, the minute differences in absorption at 15 °C were ignored (i.e. all start absorptions are set equal). Tm values were determined from the temperature at peak height maximum of the derivative of the melting curves. The varying slopes of the melting curves were reflected in the thermodynamic parameters ΔH0 and ΔS0 in Table 1, estimated according to the van't Hoff equation for a two-state melting transition (36Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1,ΔH0=4RTm2(dαdT)maxΔS0=ΔH0/Tm(Eq. 1) where α is the fraction of DNA molecules present as hairpins. Recently published genome sequences from alphaherpesviruses such as the infectious laryngotracheitis virus or GHV1, the psittacid herpesvirus, PsHV1, and the fibropapillomatosis virus from sea turtles, CFPHV, have shown that GHV1 and PsHV1 retain a putative replication origin containing the sequence TTCGCAC (Table 1) (25Thureen D.R. Keeler Jr., C.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7863-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Herbst L. Ene A. Su M. Desalle R. Lenz J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R697-R699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The origins of replication in CFPHV have not been sequenced. Sequence comparisons, including the evolutionary distant alphaherpesviruses, reveal a highly conserved region in the C terminus of OBP between amino acids Leu-731 and Leu-812 in HSV-1 OBP (supplemental Fig. 1). Acting on the assumption that conserved amino acids would be responsible for binding to a conserved DNA sequence, we examined more closely an RVKNL motif found in OBPs from all alphaherpesviruses (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1) as well as conserved amino acids surrounding this motif. First, R756A and K758A/N759A mutants were made, and their DNA binding properties were examined under optimized binding conditions. The R756A mutant had a greatly reduced affinity for the TTCGCAC sequence (Fig. 2). At the highest concentration the complex of lower mobility indicated binding of multiple copies of HisΔOBP (16Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The K758A/N759A mutant did not bind DNA at all. A previous study of a K758A mutation arrived at a similar conclusion (18Stow N.D. Brown G. Cross A.M. Abbotts A.P. Virology. 1998; 240: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the evolutionarily RVKNL motif was intimately involved in sequence-specific binding of OBP to DNA. We next examined an additional set of mutant proteins (Fig. 3). Evolutionarily conserved amino acids were changed to alanines giving rise to the following mutants: F751A, P752A/G753A, V757A, N759A, N759A/L760A, and L768A/L769A. Binding experiments show that neither the NL/AA mutant nor the F/A mutant bound DNA. The LL/AA mutant had a severely reduced affinity for DNA, but the PG/AA, V/A, and N/A mutants revealed a more modest reduction of DNA binding (Fig. 3A). A more detailed study was then performed with the latter mutant proteins using the wild type for comparison (Fig. 3, B–D). We note that the N/A mutant is very similar to the wild type, and it also supports formation of a higher order complex. The V/A mutant has reduced affinity for DNA and does not support formation of a higher order complex. The PG/AA mutant has intermediate affinity and does not readily form higher order complexes.FIGURE 3Mutations of conserved amino acids in the DNA binding domain affect DNA binding.

Note that the amount of complex formed by LL/AA is the sum of both complexes seen in the 9th lane in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The conserved RVKNL motif is unique to alphaherpesviruses using TTCGCAC as the recognition sequence, and it is therefore most likely involved in sequence-specific recognition of DNA. The arginine and lysine residues are probably interacting with the phosphate residues previously identified by ethylation interference studies (16Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other conserved residues common to alphaherpesviruses and roseoloviruses may be needed for proper folding of the DNA binding domain. Conserved residues specific for alphaherpesviruses are candidates for specific base recognition. Further insight into these matters may be gained once structural information can be combined with a mutagenesis study. We have also attempted to express a minimal version of the DNA binding domain, which would still retain the ability to bind DNA. The borders of the domain were chosen taking previously published suggestions and the results referred to above as well as recently published OBP sequences into account (18Stow N.D. Brown G. Cross A.M. Abbotts A.P. Virology. 1998; 240: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2077442319,"Background Caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins are two independent mechanisms for the regulation of protein stability and cellular function. We previously reported BAG3 overexpression protected ubiquitinated clients, such as AKT, from proteasomal degradation and conferred cytoprotection against heat shock. We hypothesized that the BAG3 protein is regulated by proteolysis. Methodology/Principal Findings Staurosporine (STS) was used as a tool to test for caspase involvement in BAG3 degradation. MDA435 and HeLa human cancer cell lines exposed to STS underwent apoptosis with a concomitant time and dose-dependent loss of BAG3, suggesting the survival role of BAG3 was subject to STS regulation. zVAD-fmk or caspase 3 and 9 inhibitors provided a strong but incomplete protection of both cells and BAG3 protein. Two putative caspase cleavage sites were tested: KEVD (BAG3E345A/D347A) within the proline-rich center of BAG3 (PXXP) and the C-terminal LEAD site (BAG3E516A/D518A). PXXP deletion mutant and BAG3E345A/D347A, or BAG3E516A/D518A respectively slowed or stalled STS-mediated BAG3 loss. BAG3, ubiquitinated under basal growth conditions, underwent augmented ubiquitination upon STS treatment, while there was no increase in ubiquitination of the BAG3E516A/D518A caspase-resistant mutant. Caspase and proteasome inhibition resulted in partial and independent protection of BAG3 whereas inhibitors of both blocked BAG3 degradation. STS-induced apoptosis was increased when BAG3 was silenced, and retention of BAG3 was associated with cytoprotection. Conclusions/Significance BAG3 is tightly controlled by selective degradation during STS exposure. Loss of BAG3 under STS injury required sequential caspase cleavage followed by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The need for dual regulation of BAG3 in apoptosis suggests a key role for BAG3 in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis."

Significantly enhanced CIA was observed in female CR1/2-deficient mice compared with WT female mice, while male mutant and WT mice showed similar arthritis development. The enhanced CIA was accompanied with higher complement levels and a prolonged IgM anti-collagen type II response. When investigating whether estrogen contributed to the different arthritis susceptibility, we found that ovariectomy rendered WT females more sensitive to low-dose CIA and to the same extent as CR1/2-deficient females, while CR1/2-deficient mice were unaffected by ovariectomy. Notably, the ovariectomized WT mice displayed reduced CR1(+) B220(+) B-cell numbers and CR1 expression compared with sham-operated WT mice, suggesting a stimulatory effect of estrogen on CR1. In accordance, a significant correlation was observed between reduced CR1 expression in B cells and increased age in healthy female blood donors but not in male donors. Our findings demonstrate an important role of CR1/2 in suppressing CIA in female mice under low-antigen conditions. The data suggest that estrogen promote CR1 expression in B cells. These findings provide insight to the increased frequency of rheumatoid arthritis in postmenopausal women."

Central to tRNA maturation, the 3′ end trailer can be endonucleolytically removed by tRNase Z.

Deleting the FA hand causes an almost 100-fold increase in Km with little change in kcat, establishing its contribution to substrate recognition/binding. Remarkably, a 40-residue Ala scan through the FA hand reveals a conserved leucine at the ascending stalk/hand boundary that causes practically the same increase in Km as the hand deletion, thus nearly eliminating its ability to bind substrate.

The 3′ end trailer can be endonucleolytically removed by tRNase Z, which cleaves following the unpaired nucleotide just beyond the 3′ side of the acceptor stem (the discriminator) leaving a 3′-OH ready for CCA addition. In some bacteria and in all archaea and eukaryotes (including their organelles), CCA at the 3′ end of mature tRNAs is not transcriptionally encoded, and a CCA-adding enzyme is required (1.Aebi M.

Substitutions in Motifs II–V, HEAT, and HST loop residues did not show increases in Km (17.Karkashon S. Hopkinson A. Levinger L.

This interpretation is supported by the co-crystal structure (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in which tRNase Z with a Motif II His→Ala substitution (introduced to reduce catalytic activity) bound only one metal ion/subunit but displayed structurally reasonable tRNA binding. Increases in Km observed with several of the substitutions in the PXKXRN loop and Motif I region (7.Zareen N. Hopkinson A. Levinger L.

Both forms are present in human and other vertebrate genomes and in Arabidopsis and other higher plants. Only tRNase ZS is found in bacteria and archaea; only tRNase ZL is found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence alignments suggest conserved FA structure and function between tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS (see Fig. 1), although they have different positions in the primary structure. tRNase ZL may have arisen from a tandem gene duplication of tRNase ZS (2.Tavtigian S.V.

Human tRNase ZL displays between 1,500–2,000-fold higher catalytic efficiency than tRNase ZS (24.Yan H. Zareen N. Levinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3926-3935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The short form has been more thoroughly studied (25.Redko Y. Li de Lasierra-Gallay I. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), including the solution of three high resolution crystal structures (15.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C.

Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The active site is found entirely within the carboxyl-terminal two-fifths of tRNase ZL, which is a close homolog of tRNase ZS. The amino-terminal three-fifths of tRNase ZL displays weak homology with the carboxyl-terminal two-fifths and with tRNase ZS. Architectural relics from tRNase ZS were apparently retained in the amino-terminal portion of tRNase ZL (2.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. Farnham J.M. Frank D. Frye C. Ghaffari S. Gupte J.S. Hu R. Iliev D. Janecki T. Kort E.N. Laity K.E. Leavitt A. Leblanc G. McArthur-Morrison J. Pederson A.

Cannon-Albright L.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), whereas residues involved with metal ion binding and catalysis were specifically replaced. Exceptionally, the FA of tRNase ZS occurs between the Motif III His and Motif IV Asp (twice in the homodimer), but only in the amino-terminal half of tRNase ZL between residues 173–232 (see Fig. 1). This adaptation, in which the FA occurs only in the amino portion of tRNase ZL and the active site is present only in the carboxyl-terminal part, could contribute to its expanded substrate range (10.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and higher catalytic efficiency (24.Yan H. Zareen N. Levinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3926-3935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were sufficient to identify the tRNase ZL FA (see Fig. 1) (21.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klacke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) despite the absence of additional structural information. Remarkably, deletion of the FA from S. cerevisiae tRNase Z abolished tRNA binding and catalysis without affecting its activity with the small molecule substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (21.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klacke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The co-crystal structure shows contacts principally between α5 residues in the hand of the FA and the D/T loops (elbow) of tRNA (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the FA of tRNase Z is involved with substrate recognition and binding remote from its active site and from the scissile bond of the substrate. Some of the substrate D/T loop substitutions in human tRNAArg also cause the Km for tRNase ZL to increase, suggesting effects on binding (28.Hopkinson A. Levinger L. RNA Biol. 2008; 5: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The FA of Thermotoga maritima tRNase Z (a short form with an atypical cleavage site and FA) (29.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30.Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is dispensable, but some of the mutations affected its cleavage site (31.Minagawa A. Ishii R. Takaku H. Yokoyama S. Nashimoto M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). D. melanogaster tRNase Z (a long form) with a deleted hand of the FA has a Km almost 100-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. A 40-residue Ala scan through the hand of the FA shows a cluster of residues centered on the β10–β11 loop with reduced kcat, increases in Km clustered in the GP (α4–α5) loop and at the boundary with α5, and additional Km increases scattered at other conserved positions suggested by the co-crystal structure (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to contact substrate. Interestingly, substitution of a single residue (Leu187) at the ascending stalk-α4 boundary (a conserved residue and predicted contact) (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) causes almost as great an increase in Km as deletion of the entire FA hand, with little decrease in kcat. D. melanogaster tRNase Z cDNA (accession number AY119279) was baculovirus-expressed from methionine 24 (suggested to be the translation start for the nuclear form of the enzyme) (32.Dubrovsky E.B. Dubrovskaya V.A. Levinger L. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Residues are thus numbered +1 from this methionine (19.Zareen N. Yan H. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), hence Gly200 for a central conserved residue in the GP (α4–α5) loop of the FA (see Fig. 1). Overlap extension amplification for the Ala scan through the hand of the FA was achieved using complementary mismatched oligonucleotides (Sigma Genosys) with a GCC Ala codon substituted at each of 40 positions (Ala186 in wild type tRNase Z was substituted with Thr). ΔFA hand deletions were similarly constructed; ΔFA designations refer to the last residue retained on the amino-terminal side of the breakpoint and the first residue retained on the carboxyl-terminal side (e.g. ΔFA183/226 retains Arg183 and Thr226 with 42 residues deleted from Ala184 to Val225) (see Fig. 1). Versions of tRNase Z with FA deletions closer to the boundary between the stalk and the body of the enzyme (e.g. from 173/232 to 177/228) did not express (data not shown), suggesting that a finishing loop is required to avoid interfering with structure of the body of the protein. Oligonucleotides were 33-nucleotides (nt) long (15 wild type nt on each side of the substitution). Forward and reverse primers for the unique internal BstEII (nt 470) and PflMI (nt 1149) subcloning sites were used to obtain A and B segments incorporating the mismatches. VENT DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for amplifications with an annealing temperature of 65° C. Longer oligonucleotides were used whenever an A or B segment failed to amplify. A/B segments were joined by overlap extension-amplification using the BstEII and PflMI primers and subcloned into the tRNase Z cDNA pFastBac-HTA (Invitrogen) transfer plasmid. Accuracy of construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genewiz). Bacmid DNA transfer, virus amplification, expression in insect Sf9 cells, and nickel chelate affinity purification of soluble tRNase Z were performed as described previously (19.Zareen N. Yan H. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad dye reagent and confirmed by gel electrophoresis and fluorescent staining (Figs. 3A and 4A). D. melanogaster tRNAArg(UUA) (Fig. 3B), a canonical tRNA with a 17-nt 3′ end trailer, was prepared by T7 transcription of a template DraI digest (to obtain -UUU at the 3′ end of the 3′ end trailer), cleaved with a cis-acting hammerhead to obtain a mature 5′ end (as in Ref. 33.Fechter P. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Théobald-Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and gel-purified as described previously (17.Karkashon S. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9380-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pre-tRNAArg was 5′ end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and repurified. Variant enzyme concentrations for processing kinetics were based on results of processing efficiencies (data not shown) determined using ∼10−10 m labeled pre-tRNAArg, between one and two orders of magnitude below the lowest Km observed (supplemental Table 1). At a low [S], V is pseudo-first order in [S], and % product/min (V/[S]) is a measure of reaction efficiency (kcat/Km). More than 50% of the substrate could be processed with sufficient wild type enzyme (data not shown). For kinetic experiments, a constant trace amount of labeled substrate was supplemented with a concentration series of unlabeled pre-tRNAArg. The substrate concentration range (usually 2–100 nm for wild type (WT) tRNase Z) was adjusted so that the Km fell within the [S] range for each tRNase Z variant. RNA concentrations were independently determined in each experiment by running analytical lanes of the unlabeled RNA samples and comparing with standards. Percent product/min (V/[S]) decreases with increasing [S] (supplemental Fig. 1, C–E); V (obtained by multiplying V/[S] by [S]) increases with [S] as expected. Enzyme concentrations were determined from original wild type and variant enzyme stocks (Bio-Rad assay). At the time of use, enzymes were diluted to 2 μg/μl (equivalent to 2.5 × 10−5 m) in the first tube of a dilution series. To refine the estimation of [E] in kinetic experiments, 2.5 μl of the subsequent 1:10 dilution (to 200 ng/μl, 25 μm) was electrophoresed on a protein gel (supplemental Fig. 1A) and compared with protein standards. Vmax (obtained from Eadie-Hofstee plots or by nonlinear regression analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots) (supplemental Fig. 1) was converted to kcat by dividing by [E]. Variant enzymes were used in two or more kinetic experiments (typically n = 3–4); a parallel experiment with wild type tRNase Z was included each time variant processing kinetics was performed. Calculations of values relative to WT were made between experiments with variant and wild type tRNases Z performed on the same day and, therefore, do not coincide with values calculated using the wild type tRNase Z data presented on row 1 of supplemental Table 1 (the means of all eighty kinetic experiments). Reproducible kinetic parameters were obtained with the lowest possible concentration of each variant enzyme (supplemental Fig. 1). Wild type tRNase Z was used at ∼25 pm, at least 1,000 times lower concentration than has been used by other laboratories (e.g. Refs. 31.Minagawa A. Ishii R. Takaku H. Yokoyama S. Nashimoto M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and 34.Späth B. Kirchner S. Vogel A. Schubert S. Meinlschmidt P. Aymanns S. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35440-35447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 1A) were prepared using ClustalW and displayed using GeneDoc. Structural designations for the hand of the FA (e.g. α4, α5, β10, and β11) are taken from the Bacillus subtilis tRNase ZS structure (Protein Data Bank code 1Y44) (15.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Corresponding residue numbers are higher by 29 or 30 in the FA hand of D. melanogaster tRNase Z than in B. subtilis (e.g. D. melanogaster Leu187 corresponds to B. subtilis Leu158, and Gly200 corresponds to Gly171) (see alignments in Fig. 1) (15.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klacke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Residue colors signify identity or similarity, with green being the most conserved. The tRNase Z structure model (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 3, A–C) (Protein Data Bank code 1Y44) (15.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was visualized with PyMOL (35.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) using a schematic with ball and stick or space filling side chains. The tRNA in the co-crystal structure (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 3D) (Protein Data Bank code 2FK6) (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Residue numbers are for B. subtilis tRNase Z; corresponding residue numbers for D. melanogaster tRNase Z are given in parentheses. The flexible arm of tRNase Z consists of 35–40 residues in a globular, compact ααββη structure (the hand) (15.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27.Kostelecky B. Pohl E. Vogel A. Schilling O. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) extruded from the body of the enzyme and held apart from it by an extended two-stranded polypeptide stalk (Fig. 1). The sequence of the hand is more conserved than that of the stalks (Fig. 1A). To further probe for residues and regions important for substrate recognition and binding, a FA hand deletion and an Ala scan through the hand of D. melanogaster tRNase Z (a long form) were analyzed using processing reaction kinetics. In the Ala scan, each of the 40 wild type residues (between the dashed lines in Fig. 1) was singly substituted with alanine, expressed using baculovirus, tested for processing efficiency (data not shown), and compared with the wild type enzyme in repeated kinetic experiments (Fig. 2) (cf. supplemental Fig. 1, supplemental Table 1, and supplemental Fig. 2). The Ala scan is bounded on the amino side by two residues of the ascending stalk and on the carboxyl side by three residues of a short conserved 3/10 helix (η in Fig. 1) following β11 and just preceding the descending stalk. From the amino-terminal side, the sequence at the ascending stalk-α4 boundary (Gly185-X-Leu187) is conserved; Leu187 may be replaced by another bulky hydrophobic residue (Phe or Ile). α4 is an amphipathic helix with polar residues present at both ends and in the middle (n = 1, 4, and 7) with their side chains pointing toward the solvent and the tRNA, when present. Length, sequence, and position of the GP (α4–α5) loop are conserved with the consensus GXPXGP (sometimes GXPPGP), producing its characteristic shape (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 3D), in which the polypeptide backbone in the vicinity of Gly200 runs parallel to the bases in the elbow of the tRNA (the tertiary Gly19-Cys56 base pair), producing favorable stacking interac"

https://openalex.org/W1977512473,"Copy Number Aberration (CNA) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) study using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have been received increasingly attentions in the recent years. In the current study, a new Constraint Moving Average (CMA) algorithm is adopted to determine the regions of CNA regions first. In addition to large regions of CNA, using the proposed CMA algorithm, small regions of CNA can also be detected. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) results prove that the CMA algorithm presents an insightful discovery of both large and subtle regions. Based on the results of CMA, two independent applications are studied. The first one is power analysis for sample estimation. An accurate estimation of sample size needed for the desired purpose of an experiment will be important for effort-efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The power analysis is performed to determine the minimum sample size required for ensuring at least () detected regions statistically different from normal references. As expected, power increase with increasing sample size for a fixed significance level. The second application is the distinguishment of high-grade MDS patients from low-grade ones. We propose to calculate the General Variant Level (GVL) score to integrate the general information of each patient at genotype level, and use it as the unified measurement for the classification. Traditional MDS classifications usually refer to cell morphology and The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which belongs to the classification at the phenotype level. The proposed GVL score integrates the information of CNA region, the number of abnormal chromosomes and the total number of the altered SNPs at the genotype level. Statistical tests indicate that the high and low grade MDS patients can be well separated by GVL score, which appears to correlate better with clinical outcome than the traditional classification approaches using morphology and IPSS sore at the phenotype level."
