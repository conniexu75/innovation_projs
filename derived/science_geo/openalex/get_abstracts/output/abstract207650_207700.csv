https://openalex.org/W2037057300,"The ""staggerer"" mutant is recognized by its staggering gait, mild tremor, hypotonia, and small size. Symptoms develop during postnatal weeks 1 to 4 and remain stationary thereafter. The cerebellar cortex is grossly underdeveloped, with too few granule cells and unaligned Purkinje cells. Genetic linkage studies and neuropathological findings distinguish staggerer from other known mutants."

https://openalex.org/W1968031524,"By inserting microelectrodes into cells of various tissues, it was shown that elongated parenchyma cells in the phloem and protoxylem, which have larger membrane potential than inexcitable cells of other types, generate action potentials with conduction. The electrical features of these cells are essentially similar to those of nerve and muscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W1990968040,Delay of shock was made contingent upon acceleration of heart rate in human subjects. The number of accelerations rose across sessions for these subjects and fell for their yoked-controls who received equal amounts of noncontingent shock. A shorter delay produced more accelerations but faster adaptation. Interpretation of changes in heart rate is confounded by related respiratory changes.

https://openalex.org/W2061694754,An altered molecular form of erythrocyte esterase was discovered in hemolysates from two males and one female in three generations of the same family. This indicates that the alternate enzyme form is under the control of a single autosomal gene. Evidence suggests that the atypical esterase is a variant form of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase.

https://openalex.org/W1984325900,"With a photographic averager to extract evoked cortical responses, reactivity cycles of primary potentials were determined over 200 milliseconds in 105 subjects. The typical cycle was biphasic, with peaks before 20 and after 100 msec. Subjects who were not psychiatric patients showed full recovery of responsiveness during the initial peak phase, whereas most of the psychiatric patients did not."

https://openalex.org/W1974249863,"The melanin granules of the eye generate a free radical when irradiated with visible light under approximately physiological conditions. The rapid generation in light and decay in dark of the free radical as indicated by electron spin resonance studies, coupled with the anatomical proximity of the melanin granules to the rods and cones of the eye, suggest that these granules may play an important role in the visual process. The investigation of this free radical offers a possible approach to connect the photochemical events in the eye with the subsequent electrophysiological events in the nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2017661532,"IT is well known that the blood of the fœtal lamb contains a high concentration of fructose and that this disappears within a few hours of birth1–4, yet two recent publications have shown that the perfused liver of the fœtal and new-born lamb is unable to metabolize fructose before the fifth day after birth5,6, and it is known that fructokinase is absent from the liver of the fœtal lamb7. In view of these observations, the results of some preliminary experiments on the urinary excretion of fructose in newly delivered fœtal lambs would appear to be of interest."

The precipitin reaction in cases of clinical amœbiasis has been investigated1,2. Menendez3 reported the presence of precipitin antibodies in the serum of rabbit immunized with cultures of Entamœba histolytica. In the present work the precipitating antigens of these parasites were analysed by agar-gel diffusion and intragel absorption techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2064789877,"ATTEMPTS have been made to increase the sensitivity of analysis for catecholamines using the ethylenediamine condensation method described by Weil-Malherbe and Bone1. The objective was to be able to determine catecholamine-levels of 0.05 µgm. and below. Examination of the intensity of fluorescence of norepinephrine after various periods of heating demonstrated, in agreement with others2,3, that 1–2 hr. heating at 50° C. was optimum. It was also possible to obtain the same intensity of fluorescence by permitting the reaction to proceed at room temperature for about 7 hr. or at 5° C. overnight. At 50° C. the intensity of fluorescence was found to be maximum in 20 min. for epinephrine and in 40–50 min. for dopamine. When using the Klett fluorimeter, the fluorescence for epinephrine was stable while that for norepinephrine and dopamine was not."

Among the compounds tested so far, N-[2-(4-morpholino) ethyl]1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (I) has shown interesting biological activity."
