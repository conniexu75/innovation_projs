Hadjur et al. show here that cohesin is involved topologically and mechanistically in long-range interactions at the cytokine locus IFNG. As well as its role in sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin is thought to have a role in the control of gene expression. Here, cohesin is shown to form the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions at the developmentally regulated cytokine locus IFNG. Cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome segregation and post-replicative DNA repair1,2. In addition, evidence from model organisms3,4,5,6 and from human genetics7 suggests that cohesin is involved in the control of gene expression8,9. This non-canonical role has recently been rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites and to conserved noncoding sequences by the DNA-binding protein CTCF10,11,12,13. CTCF functions at insulators (which control interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure)14, and cohesin contributes to its enhancer-blocking activity10,11. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be determined. Here we show that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, the ability of cohesin to constrain chromosome topology is used not only for the purpose of sister chromatid cohesion1,2, but also to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci. This new aspect of cohesin function is probably important for normal development3,4,5,6 and disease7."

The CREB coactivator complex controls transcription of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Here, we show that both the antidiabetic agent metformin and insulin phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) at serine 436 via PKCι/λ. This event triggers the dissociation of the CREB-CBP-TORC2 transcription complex and reduces gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Mice carrying a germline mutation of this CBP phosphorylation site (S436A) demonstrate resistance to the hypoglycemic effect of both insulin and metformin. Obese, hyperglycemic mice display hepatic insulin resistance, but metformin is still effective in treating the hyperglycemia of these mice since it stimulates CBP phosphorylation by bypassing the block in insulin signaling. Our findings point to CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 by metformin as critical for its therapeutic effect, and as a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention.

Blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range by the liver through the opposing actions of insulin and glucagon (Biddinger and Kahn, 2006Biddinger C.B. Kahn C.R.

Impaired insulin signaling together with elevated glucagon levels result in hyperglycemia and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus (Baron et al., 1987Baron A.D. Schaeffer L. Shragg P. Kolterman O.G.

Glucagon promotes hepatic glucose production by activating cAMP-PKA signaling that induces the phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB at Ser133 and dephosphorylation of TORC2 (also referenced as CRTC2), leading to the formation of the transcriptional CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex (Ravnskjaer et al., 2007Ravnskjaer K. Kester H. Liu Y. Zhang X. Lee D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Montminy M.

This complex increases transcription of the Ppargc1 (also termed as PGC-1α, the protein product is PGC-1α) gene and its downstream target genes such as the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H.

Insulin counteracts the action of glucagon on hepatic gluconeogenesis mainly at the transcriptional level through PGC-1α (Yoon et al., 2001Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. et al.Control of hepatic gluconeogenesis through the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1.Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex binds to CRE site of Ppargc1 through transcription factor CREB, and both CBP and TORC2 are coactivators for CREB. CBP was originally identified as a CREB binding protein that interacts with the CREB KID domain (Radhakrishnan et al., 1997Radhakrishnan I. Pérez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R.

Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). CBP, which contains intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, also interacts with various components of the basal transcription machinery such as TATA box binding protein (TBP), TFIIB and with cell-specific transcription factors (Goodman and Smolik, 2000Goodman R.H. Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). TORC2, in contrast, binds to the bZIP domain of CREB in a phosphorylation-independent manner, and augments CRE-dependent transcription (Conkright et al., 2003Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. TORCs: transducers of regulated CREB activity.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 is critical for the recruitment of CBP to CREB. However, both glucagon and insulin were documented to stimulate phosphorylation at this site (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that insulin stimulates CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 and a germline mutation of this CBP phosphorylation site (S436A) in a mouse model leads to inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis and glucose intolerance (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou X.Y. Shibusawa N. Naik K. Porras D. Temple K. Ou H. Kaihara K. Roe M.W. Brady M.J. Wondisford F.E. Insulin regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis through phosphorylation of CREB-binding protein.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Insulin also stimulates the phosphorylation of TORC2 at Ser171 leading to its nuclear exclusion and degradation (Dentin et al., 2007Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates 3rd, J. Montminy M. Insulin modulates gluconeogenesis by inhibition of the coactivator TORC2.Nature. 2007; 449: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, which insulin signaling event determines the disassembly of CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. Metformin was introduced clinically in the 1950s and is widely used as a first line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin improves glucose metabolism mainly by suppressing hepatic glucose production (Hundal et al., 2000Hundal R.S. Krssak M. Dufour S. Laurent D. Lebon V. Chandramouli V. Inzucchi S.E. Schumann W.C. Petersen K.F. Landau B.R. Shulman G.I. Mechanism by which metformin reduces glucose production in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2063-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Metformin has been reported to stimulate the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of TORC2 (Shaw et al., 2005Shaw R.J. Lamia K.A. Vasquez D. Koo S.H. Bardeesy N. Depinho R.A. Montminy M. Cantley L.C. The kinase LKB1 mediates glucose homeostasis in liver and therapeutic effects of metformin.Science. 2005; 310: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar); however, since TORC2 is O-glycosylated at Ser171 in the insulin resistant state (Dentin et al., 2008Dentin R. Hedrick S. Xie J. Yates 3rd, J. Montminy M. Hepatic glucose sensing via the CREB coactivator CRTC2.Science. 2008; 319: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), phosphorylation at this site is unlikely to be the mechanism of action of metformin in patients with diabetes. Here we show that CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 by insulin and metformin requires aPKCι/λ, which has been previously reported to mediate insulin induced lipogenesis in the liver (Matsumoto et al., 2003Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Akimoto K. Inoue H. Miyake K. Furukawa K. Hayashi Y. Iguchi H. Matsuki Y. Hiramatsu R. et al.PKClambda in liver mediates insulin-induced SREBP-1c expression and determines both hepatic lipid content and overall insulin sensitivity.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This event is essential for the dissociation of CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. Only metformin is able to stimulate CBP phosphorylation in a mouse obesity model of insulin resistance, suggesting a mechanism for its therapeutic effect. In response to the argument that recruitment of CBP to CREB target genes is unnecessary for induction of the gluconeogenic program (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), we examined the potential role of CBP in mediating CREB target gene expression. First, we used a cAMP response element (CRE)-luciferase reporter assay in a transiently transfected hepatocyte cell line. Forskolin (FSK) treatment or cotransfection with an expression vector containing the catalytic subunit of PKA increased luciferase activity by approximately 5-fold (Figure 1A). RNAi-mediated CBP knockdown abolished the effects of both PKA and FSK on the CRE-responsive reporter. We next tested GAL4 fusion constructs of full length CREB cDNA and TORC2 cDNA on a GAL4 reporter. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CBP protein levels blocked the effect of cotransfected PKA on either fusion construct (Figures 1B and 1C); additionally, knock-down of CBP blocked the effect of cotransfected TORC2 (Figure 1B). FSK stimulation of Ppargc1α, Pck1 and G6pc mRNA levels was also significantly suppressed by adenoviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of CBP in primary hepatocyte cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, adenoviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of CBP protein in the liver of fasted mice decreased both glucose levels (Figure 1E) and the expression of gluconeogenic genes (Figure 1F). The above data indicate that CBP plays an essential role in mediating CREB target gene expression in the hepatocyte. We previously reported that insulin regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou X.Y. Shibusawa N. Naik K. Porras D. Temple K. Ou H. Kaihara K. Roe M.W. Brady M.J. Wondisford F.E. Insulin regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis through phosphorylation of CREB-binding protein.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This CBP phosphorylation site is conserved in eukaryotic species (Figure 2A), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may be a universal mechanism for controlling CBP responsive gene transcription. We therefore developed a phospho-specific CBP antiserum to this site. In a hepatocyte cell line, insulin stimulated CBP phosphorylation in a rapid (within 5 min) (Figure 2B, top) and a concentration-dependent manner (see Figure S1 available with this article online). In fasted mice, insulin stimulated CBP phosphorylation dramatically in liver extracts, and treatment with alkaline phosphatase eliminated the phospho-CBP signal (Figure 2B, bottom). This antiserum was proven to be specific for phosphorylation of this site and does not crossreact with the related p300 protein (Figures S2 and S3). The PI3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002) blocked insulin mediated CBP phosphorylation in hepatocyte cells (Figure S4), indicating that insulin stimulates CBP phosphorylation through the PI3K pathway. CBP Ser436 is part of a potential consensus PKC phosphorylation site (435-ASDKR-439) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the related p300 protein contains the identical amino acid sequence as CBP in the region, except that a glycine residue (Gly422) is substituted for the serine residue (Ser436). This difference is suggested to affect the length of the α4 helix in the C/H1 domain of the proteins (De Guzman et al., 2004De Guzman R.N. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Interaction of the TAZ1 domain of the CREB-binding protein with the activation domain of CITED2: regulation by competition between intrinsically unstructured ligands for non-identical binding sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To define the class of PKC is responsible for CBP phosphorylation at Ser436, we treated hepatocyte cells with two PKC inhibitors. The nonisoform selective PKC specific inhibitor, Ro31-8220, blocked insulin induced CBP phosphorylation; however, an inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isoforms, Go6976, had no effect on insulin induced CBP phosphorylation (Figure 2C, top). These data suggest that insulin mediates CBP phosphorylation through atypical PKCs (aPKCs). Atypical PKCs (ζ, ι/λ) are conserved across species and are ubiquitously expressed in most tissues (Selbie et al., 1993Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J.

A new member of the third class in the protein kinase C family, PKC lambda, expressed dominantly in an undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line and also in many tissues and cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and aPKCι and λ are human/mouse orthologs (Nishizuka, 1995Nishizuka Y. Protein kinase C and lipid signaling for sustained cellular response.FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2C (bottom), RNAi-mediated knockdown of aPKCι/λ in hepatocyte cells blocked CBP phosphorylation by insulin; in contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of aPKCζ had no effect on insulin induced CBP phosphorylation, suggesting that this aPKCι/λ mediates insulin-induced CBP phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of brain and liver tissue from mice demonstrates comparable amounts of aPKCι/λ in the liver and brain (Figure 2D); however, consistent with a previous finding (Selbie et al., 1993Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. Molecular cloning and characterization of PKC iota, an atypical isoform of protein kinase C derived from insulin-secreting cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is significantly less aPKCζ in the liver than in the brain. Further, knockdown of aPKCι/λ in the liver using an adenoviral shRNA blocked insulin induced CBP phosphorylation in the liver (Figure 2D, bottom). In cells, transfection of increasing amount of a CMV expression vector containing aPKCι/λ led to CBP phosphorylation (Figure 2E, top). In an in vitro phosphorylation assay, purified aPKCι/λ phosphorylated CBP of liver tissue extract from fasted wild-type mice, but not from CBP mutant (S436A) mice (Figure 2E, bottom). Finally, mice injected with an adenoviral aPKCι/λ shRNA exhibited fasting hyperglycemia (Scrambled shRNA versus CBP shRNA: 109 ± 3.3 versus 142 ± 2.9 mg/dl, p < 0.05) and glucose intolerance (Figure 2F), supporting the notion that aPKCι/λ phosphorylates CBP and modulates glucose metabolism (Chen et al., 2002Chen H.C. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M. Farese Jr., R.V. Farese R.V. Activation of the ERK pathway and atypical protein kinase C isoforms in exercise and aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-riboside (AICAR)-stimulated glucose transport.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23554-23562Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-riboside (AICAR), also activates aPKCs (Chen et al., 2002Chen H.C. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M. Farese Jr., R.V. Farese R.V. Activation of the ERK pathway and atypical protein kinase C isoforms in exercise and aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-riboside (AICAR)-stimulated glucose transport.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23554-23562Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which prompted us to evaluate the effect of AICAR and another AMPK activator, metformin, on CBP phosphorylation. Both AICAR and metformin stimulated CBP phosphorylation in a hepatocyte cell line (Figure 3A), and in contrast to insulin, did not cause phosphorylation of either AKT or GSK3. The antidiabetic effect of metformin requires AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. et al.Role of AMP-activated protein kinase in mechanism of metformin action.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4056) Google Scholar, Shaw et al., 2005Shaw R.J.

The kinase LKB1 mediates glucose homeostasis in liver and therapeutic effects of metformin.Science. 2005; 310: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), and AMPK can activate aPKCs, which increase glucose transport in muscle (Chen et al., 2002Chen H.C. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M. Farese Jr., R.V. Farese R.V. Activation of the ERK pathway and atypical protein kinase C isoforms in exercise and aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-riboside (AICAR)-stimulated glucose transport.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23554-23562Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We cotransfected increasing amounts of an AMPK expression vector in hepatocyte cells, and this resulted in an increase in CBP phosphorylation (Figure 3B), and either metformin treatment or AMPK overexpression led to the CBP phosphorylation even in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Figure 3C). In contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of aPKCι/λ blocked the ability of metformin or AMPK to stimulate CBP phosphorylation (Figure S5 and Figure 3D, respectively). In vivo, metformin like insulin stimulated CBP phosphorylation in the mouse liver (Figure 3E) and this effect was blocked in mice injected with adenoviral shRNA against aPKCι/λ. Phosphorylation plays an important role in activating PKC activity (Parekh et al., 2000Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. Multiple pathways control protein kinase C phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, Newton, 2003Newton A.C. Regulation of the ABC kinases by phosphorylation: protein kinase C as paradigm.Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined the phosphorylation status of aPKCι/λ. Metformin and AMPK overexpression stimulated phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ at Thr403 and Thr555, which are located in the activation loop of kinase domain and in the turn motif, respectively (Figures 3A–3C and 3F). Phosphorylation at Thr403 has been shown to be critical for kinase activity of aPKCι/λ (Messerschmidt et al., 2005Messerschmidt A. Macieira S. Velarde M. Bädeker M. Benda C. Jestel A. Brandstetter H. Neuefeind T. Blaesse M. Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human atypical protein kinase C-iota reveals interaction mode of phosphorylation site in turn motif.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 918-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor had no effect on AMPK induced aPKCι/λ phosphorylation (Figure 3C). Thus, metformin, AMPK and insulin mediate CBP phosphorylation by activated aPKCι/λ through increasing its phosphorylation at Thr403 and Thr555. Insulin stimulates CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and stimulates TORC2 phosphorylation at Ser171 (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, Shaw et al., 2005Shaw R.J. Lamia K.A. Vasquez D. Koo S.H. Bardeesy N. Depinho R.A. Montminy M. Cantley L.C. The kinase LKB1 mediates glucose homeostasis in liver and therapeutic effects of metformin.Science. 2005; 310: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Alternatively, we provide evidence that insulin stimulates CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 (Figure 2B). It is important, therefore, to understand the relative importance of phosphorylation of members of the CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. Since insulin counteracts the action of glucagon on hepatic gluconeogenesis mainly at the transcriptional level through the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (Yoon et al., 2001Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. et al.Control of hepatic gluconeogenesis through the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1.Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), we evaluated the binding states of CREB, CBP and TORC2 to promoters of Ppargc1α and Pck1 in liver tissue from fasted and refed mice. In this study, increased CBP phosphorylation and TORC2 degradation in refed mice (Figure 4A) coincided with the absence of both CBP and TORC2 from the Ppargc1α and Pck1 promoters as compared to fasted mice (Figure 4B). However, CREB binding to these promoters did not change, suggesting that the binding of coactivators (CBP and TORC2) to the complex determines Ppargc1α and Pck1 gene expression during fasting and refeeding. To explore further the phosphorylation and promoter occupancy of CREB, CBP and TORC2 in the control of hepatic glucose production, we conducted insulin time course experiments in fasted wild-type mice. In this experiment, blood glucose levels fell sharply after intraperitoneal administration of insulin within the first 30 min, and subsequently blood glucose levels began to rise (Figure 4C, insert). Serum insulin level reached its peak at 10 min after intraperitoneal insulin injection; we then observed robust glucagon secretion which reached a peak at 30 min after insulin exposure in response to the insulin induced hypoglycemia (Figure 4C). Hepatic mRNA expression pattern of Ppargc1α and Pck1 were very similar to the changes in blood glucose levels (Figure 4D). In liver tissue, the extent of CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 remained unchanged during the entire experiment (Figure 4E). These data are consistent with the notion that both insulin and glucagon induce phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulated CBP phosphorylation within 10 min of treatment; at subsequent time points, CBP phosphorylation decreased (Figure 4E). The reduction of CBP phosphorylation at later time points after insulin treatment accompanied by robust glucagon secretion indicates glucagon may be responsible for the dephosphorylation of CBP (Figures 4C and 4E). Indeed, pretreatment of hepatocyte cells with forskolin blocked insulin-induced CBP phosphorylation (Figure S6), and the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A blocked the effect of forskolin leading to increased CBP phosphorylation (Figures 4F and S7). Consistent with previous studies (Dentin et al., 2007Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates 3rd, J. Montminy M. Insulin modulates gluconeogenesis by inhibition of the coactivator TORC2.Nature. 2007; 449: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the peak of TORC2 phosphorylation occurred at a later time (30 min) than peak CBP phosphorylation after insulin exposure, and TORC2 phosphorylation led to its degradation (Figure 4E). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of hepatic tissue was then used to determine the occupancy of CREB, CBP and TORC2 on the CRE site of the Ppargc1α and Pck1 gene promoters. The binding of CBP and TORC2 started to decrease 10 min after insulin exposure and was absent from the Ppargc1α and Pck1 promoters 30 min after insulin treatment. In contrast to TORC2, however, CBP returned to these promoters at 60 min (Figure 4G), coinciding with an ∼4-fold increase in mRNA expression of Ppargc1α and Pck1 (Figure 4D). No change in CREB binding to the Ppargc1α and Pck1 promoters was observed (Figure 4G). These data strongly support the critical role for CBP in transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenic enzyme genes. It is important to note that CBP phosphorylation was inversely correlated with CBP occupancy on Ppargc1α and Pck1 promoters, suggesting that CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 might play an important role in dissociating and reforming the CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex after insulin treatment. To test this hypothesis, we compared wild-type and mutant CBP expression vectors in transient transfection studies. We found that insulin treatment decreased the activity of a CRE-responsive reporter in cells cotransfected with wild-type CBP (p < 0.01), but not with CBP mutants (Figure 5A). Insulin action on the CRE-responsive reporter was abolished by treatment with a PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) (Figure S8), suggesting that in this context insulin acts through the PI3K pathway. Metformin, like insulin, decreased CRE-mediated luciferase activity in cell cultures cotransfected with wild-type CBP (p < 0.01), but not CBP mutant expression vectors (Figure 5B). The above data indicate that Ser436 of CBP plays a key role in mediating the actions of insulin and metformin in the regulation of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. To examine this hypothesis more directly, a hepatocyte cell line was cotransfected with wild-type or mutant (S436A) CBP and TORC2 expression vectors in a GAL4-CREB (full length) reporter assay. Both insulin and metformin treatment decreased reporter activity significantly (p < 0.01) in cells cotransfected with wild-type CBP (Figure 5C). However, the effect of insulin and metformin on GAL4-CREB (full length) reporter activity was abolished in cells cotransfected with mutant (S436A) CBP. These data indicate that Ser436 of CBP plays a dominant role in the action of insulin and metformin on GAL4-CREB complex in this reporter assay and raise the possibility that the phosphorylation of CBP at Ser436 is the key event leading to dissociation of both CBP and TORC2 from the CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. TORC2 coimmunoprecipitated with CBP (Ravnskjaer et al., 2007Ravnskjaer K. Kester H. Liu Y. Zhang X. Lee D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Montminy M. Cooperative interactions between CBP and TORC2 confer selectivity to CREB target gene expression.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that TORC2 might associate with CBP as well in the CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. To test this possibility, we cotransfected wild-type or CBP mutants into a hepatocyte cell line with TORC2 and a GAL4-CREB construct (1-280 aa), which lacks the TORC2 binding domain (Figure 5D). We found that TORC2 significantly enhanced reporter activity when cotransfected with wild-type CBP and had an even greater effect when cotransfected with mutant (S436A) CBP. No effect on reporter activity was found with cotransfection of mutant (S436D) CBP, which mimics phosphorylated CBP (Figure 5D). These results suggest that TORC2 associates directly with CBP in the CREB-CBP-TORC2 complex. To examine this further, a hepatocyte cell line was cotransfected wild-type"
https://openalex.org/W2131404238,"During vertebrate embryogenesis, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region. We report here that blood flow is a conserved regulator of HSC formation. In zebrafish, chemical blood flow modulators regulated HSC development, and silent heart (sih) embryos, lacking a heartbeat and blood circulation, exhibited severely reduced HSCs. Flow-modifying compounds primarily affected HSC induction after the onset of heartbeat; however, nitric oxide (NO) donors regulated HSC number even when treatment occurred before the initiation of circulation, and rescued HSCs in sih mutants. Morpholino knockdown of nos1 (nnos/enos) blocked HSC development, and its requirement was shown to be cell autonomous. In the mouse, Nos3 (eNos) was expressed in HSCs in the AGM. Intrauterine Nos inhibition or embryonic Nos3 deficiency resulted in a reduction of hematopoietic clusters and transplantable murine HSCs. This work links blood flow to AGM hematopoiesis and identifies NO as a conserved downstream regulator of HSC development."

This model is based on the observation that HR lesions spread in plants with reduced autophagy gene expression. Here, we examined receptor-mediated HR PCD responses in autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis knockout mutants (atg), and show that infection-induced lesions are contained in atg mutants. We also provide evidence that HR cell death initiated via Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR)-type immune receptors through the defense regulator EDS1 is suppressed in atg mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCD triggered by coiled-coil (CC)-type immune receptors via NDR1 is either autophagy-independent or engages autophagic components with cathepsins and other unidentified cell death mediators. Thus, autophagic cell death contributes to HR PCD and can function in parallel with other prodeath pathways.

Thus, autophagic cell death contributes to HR PCD and can function in parallel with other prodeath pathways. Plants have evolved a multilayered immune system to recognize and respond to invading pathogens. The first layer includes pattern recognition receptors that detect conserved microbial associated molecular patterns and initiate an immune response (Jones and Dangl, 2006Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. The plant immune system.Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8335) Google Scholar). Another layer uses resistance (R) proteins whose activation triggers a rapid defense response that often includes a localized programmed cell death (PCD) reaction known as the hypersensitive response (HR) (Nimchuk et al., 2003Nimchuk Z. Eulgem T. Holt 3rd, B.F. Dangl J.L. Recognition and response in the plant immune system.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 579-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The most prevalent type of plant R proteins belongs to the nucleotide binding site (NB)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class that can be further separated into Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)- or coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR R proteins (Dangl and Jones, 2001Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Plant pathogens and integrated defence responses to infection.Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar). To overcome the first defense layer, successful pathogens deliver various virulence determinants, termed effectors, into plant cells. These effectors modify host proteins and manipulate the host cellular machinery to suppress immune responses and enhance virulence (Bent and Mackey, 2007Bent A.F. Mackey D. Elicitors, effectors, and R genes: the new paradigm and a lifetime supply of questions.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2007; 45: 399-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas syringae, use a type III secretion system (T3SS) for the export and translocation of effectors into host cells. Infection and multiplication of bacteria in the leaf interior can lead to disease-associated cell death, which typically appears several days after infection (Abramovitch et al., 2006Abramovitch R.B. Anderson J.C. Martin G.B. Bacterial elicitation and evasion of plant innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, if type III effector functions on host targets are perceived by specific alleles of NB-LRR genes, they act as avirulence factors (Avr proteins), and elicit HR PCD within hours after pathogen attack (Lam, 2004Lam E. Controlled cell death, plant survival and development.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Signaling components of R-gene mediated HR have been identified in genetic screens for loss of resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens in Arabidopsis. These analyses revealed that ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and NON RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE (NDR1) are required for the function of different R genes. Loss of EDS1 function suppresses signals generated by TIR-NB-LRR R proteins, whereas ndr1 mutants are compromised in resistance conditioned by CC-NB-LRR R proteins (Aarts et al., 1998Aarts N. Metz M. Holub E. Staskawicz B.J. Daniels M.J. Parker J.E. Different requirements for EDS1 and NDR1 by disease resistance genes define at least two R gene-mediated signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 10306-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well-documented signaling pathways associated with HR induction, little is known about how HR cell death is executed, or whether plants share conserved death mechanisms with metazoans (Hofius et al., 2007Hofius D. Tsitsigiannis D.I. Jones J.D. Mundy J. Inducible cell death in plant immunity.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2007; 17: 166-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The best described form of PCD in animals is apoptosis, but plants apparently lack apoptotic regulatory genes including cysteine proteases called caspases (Lam et al., 2001Lam E. Kato N. Lawton M. Programmed cell death, mitochondria and the plant hypersensitive response.Nature. 2001; 411: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, caspase-like activities have been detected during HR and disease-related cell death which could be assigned to different types of proteases (Woltering, 2004Woltering E.J. Death proteases come alive.Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Vercammen et al., 2007Vercammen D. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Van Breusegem F. Are metacaspases caspases?.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Among them, the vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) was shown to exhibit caspase-1 activity and to act as an executor of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-triggered PCD in tobacco (Hatsugai et al., 2004Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. A plant vacuolar protease, VPE, mediates virus-induced hypersensitive cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Additionally, the protease cathepsin B has been implicated in pathogen-induced PCD (Gilroy et al., 2007Gilroy E.M. Hein I. van der Hoorn R. Boevink P.C. Venter E. McLellan H. Kaffarnik F. Hrubikova K. Shaw J. Holeva M. et al.Involvement of cathepsin B in the plant disease resistance hypersensitive response.Plant J. 2007; 52: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cathepsins generally function in lysosomal catabolic processes and are involved in apoptotic and necrotic types of PCD (Guicciardi et al., 2004Guicciardi M.E. Leist M. Gores G.J. Lysosomes in cell death.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Another, nonapoptotic form of animal PCD involves autophagy (Edinger and Thompson, 2004Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Death by design: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), an ancient vesicular mechanism for digestion of cell contents in eukaryotes (Mizushima, 2007Mizushima N. Autophagy: process and function.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). A central feature of autophagy is the formation of double membrane vesicles, named autophagosomes, that engulf and deliver portions of the cytoplasm to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation (Levine and Klionsky, 2004Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Development by self-digestion: molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar, Mizushima, 2007Mizushima N. Autophagy: process and function.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). Autophagosome initiation and completion are mediated by autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) and require two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems to produce ATG12-ATG5 and ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine (ATG8-PE) conjugates. ATG8-PE conjugation involves the cysteine proteinase ATG4 and the E1-like protein ATG7, and lipidated ATG8 is linked to and translocated with autophagosomes to the vacuole (Geng and Klionsky, 2008Geng J. Klionsky D.J. The Atg8 and Atg12 ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in macroautophagy. ‘Protein modifications: beyond the usual suspects’ review series.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Therefore, conversion from soluble to lipid bound ATG8, as well as subcellular localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused protein, have been used to monitor the occurrence of autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2008Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175PubMed Google Scholar). Plants have a complement of autophagy proteins, and loss-of-function mutations in ATG genes such as ATG9, ATG7, ATG5, and ATG4a/b indicate that autophagy is central to plant source-sink relations and senescence (Thompson et al., 2005Thompson A.R. Doelling J.H. Suttangkakul A. Vierstra R.D.

Laporte M. Marty F. Moriyasu Y. Ohsumi Y. Olsen L.J. Yoshimoto K. Autophagy in development and stress responses of plants.Autophagy. 2006; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Autophagy is also implicated in animal innate immunity, and as an alternative death pathway which may be invoked during development (Gutierrez et al., 2004Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I. Deretic V.

Baehrecke E.H. Growth arrest and autophagy are required for salivary gland cell degradation in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 131: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, no genetic evidence has yet been provided in plants that autophagy has a prodeath function in either developmental or pathogen-inducible PCD. Instead, two reports indicate that autophagy is required to limit the spread of HR related cell death. Liu et al., 2005Liu Y. Schiff M. Czymmek K. Talloczy Z. Levine B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Autophagy regulates programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.Cell. 2005; 121: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar used virus-induced gene silencing to downregulate autophagy genes including BECLIN1/ATG6 and ATG7 in Nicotiana benthamiana expressing the N resistance gene. TMV infection of silenced plants triggered N-mediated HR cell death that extended to uninfected tissue and to leaves distant from the infection site in which viral RNA was undetectable (Liu et al., 2005Liu Y. Schiff M. Czymmek K. Talloczy Z. Levine B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Autophagy regulates programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.Cell. 2005; 121: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). These data suggested that systemic spread of prodeath signal(s) was no longer limited in autophagy-deficient cells. The conclusion that autophagy negatively regulates PCD in plant innate immunity is apparently supported by a recent finding in another host-pathogen system. In Arabidopsis, BECLIN1/ATG6 was shown to limit HR PCD conditioned by the RPM1 immune receptor upon local infections with avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) strain DC3000 harboring the avirulence gene AvrRpm1 (Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Arabidopsis ATG6 is required to limit the pathogen-associated cell death response.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to the essential role of Beclin1/ATG6 in pollen germination and plant development (Harrison-Lowe and Olsen, 2008Harrison-Lowe N.J. Olsen L.J. Autophagy Protein 6 (ATG6) is Required for Pollen Germination in Arabidopsis thaliana.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 339-348Google Scholar), Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Arabidopsis ATG6 is required to limit the pathogen-associated cell death response.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar were unable to obtain homozygous knockout mutants and therefore used antisense plants with various developmental abnormalities. Thus, the role of autophagy in plant innate immunity has so far only been studied by knock down approaches in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Using autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis knockout mutants, we provide genetic evidence that TIR-class NB-LRR receptors can activate EDS1-dependent, autophagic cell death during HR execution. We also demonstrate that strong HR cell death triggered by the CC-type immune receptor RPM1 involves autophagy and other PCD types. In contrast, we show that HR cell death induced by another CC-NB-LRR class receptor, RPS2, activates NDR1-dependent but autophagy-independent cell death. Therefore, we provide examples of the contribution of autophagy components to cell death execution in plant innate immune responses. Arabidopsis is a genetically tractable plant model and autophagy-deficient mutants have been described that, unlike BECLIN1/ATG6 antisense lines, are indistinguishable from wild-type plants when nutrients are not limited (Thompson et al., 2005Thompson A.R. Doelling J.H. Suttangkakul A. Vierstra R.D. Autophagic nutrient recycling in Arabidopsis directed by the ATG8 and ATG12 conjugation pathways.Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2097-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether uncontrolled cell death could also be observed in Arabidopsis autophagy-deficient knockout mutants. First, we challenged the loss-of-function mutants atg7 and atg9 (Doelling et al., 2002Doelling J.H. Walker J.M. Friedman E.M. Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. The APG8/12-activating enzyme APG7 is required for proper nutrient recycling and senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33105-33114Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, Thompson et al., 2005Thompson A.R. Doelling J.H. Suttangkakul A. Vierstra R.D. Autophagic nutrient recycling in Arabidopsis directed by the ATG8 and ATG12 conjugation pathways.Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2097-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) with avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 harboring the avirulence genes AvrRps4 or AvrRpm1. HR PCD elicited by Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) requires the TIR-NB-LRR class R gene RPS4, whereas HR in response to Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) is conditioned by the CC-NB-LRR R gene RPM1 (Aarts et al., 1998Aarts N. Metz M. Holub E. Staskawicz B.J. Daniels M.J. Parker J.E. Different requirements for EDS1 and NDR1 by disease resistance genes define at least two R gene-mediated signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 10306-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Parts of leaves of atg7, atg9 and wild-type Wassilewskija (Ws-0) were infected, and HR-associated symptom spread followed over several days. Surprisingly, no signs of death or tissue collapse were detectable in atg7 and atg9 beyond the primary HR lesion sites after infection, even after 15 days (see Figures S1A and S1B available with this article online). We also examined disease-associated cell death induced by virulent Pto DC3000. Again, lesions were contained and did not spread further than the initial infection site (Figure S1C). Autophagy is induced by different pathogens in both animals and plants (Gutierrez et al., 2004Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I. Deretic V. Autophagy is a defense mechanism inhibiting BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in infected macrophages.Cell. 2004; 119: 753-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2005Liu Y.

Autophagy regulates programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.Cell. 2005; 121: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, autophagy genes are transcriptionally upregulated, but autophagic activity has not been demonstrated upon pathogen infections (Seay et al., 2006Seay M. Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Autophagy and plant innate immunity.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Arabidopsis ATG6 is required to limit the pathogen-associated cell death response.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether autophagy was also associated with HR cell death in response to bacterial infection in Arabidopsis. To this end, we first used LysoTracker Green dye that stains acidic organelles such as autophagolysosomes to visualize possible autophagic activity (Liu et al., 2005Liu Y. Schiff M. Czymmek K. Talloczy Z. Levine B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Autophagy regulates programmed cell death during the plant innate immune response.Cell. 2005; 121: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Cells examined before infection did not accumulate punctate structures that could indicate autophagic activity (Figure 1A). In contrast, we found that cells 3 hr after infection with Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) and 6 hr after infection with Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) accumulated abundant autolysosomal-like structures (Figures 1A and S2A). The accumulation of these acidic organelles is likely to be caused by activation of R genes, because virulent infections with Pto DC3000 looked similar to cells examined before infection within this timeframe (Figure 1A). We then examined the occurrence of autophagy by assessing the behavior of ATG8 proteins during infection (Ichimura et al., 2004Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo and in vitro reconstitution of Atg8 conjugation essential for autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). ATG8 accumulation and modification, as indicated by the appearance of a faster migrating gel band, was detected 2 hr post Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) infection, and ATG8 processing increased to a maximum 6 hr after infection at which time AvrRpm1 triggered host cell death is complete (Figure 1B) (Mackey et al., 2003Mackey D. Belkhadir Y. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Dangl J.L. Arabidopsis RIN4 is a target of the type III virulence effector AvrRpt2 and modulates RPS2-mediated resistance.Cell. 2003; 112: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Processed forms of ATG8 started to accumulate 6 hr post Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) infection and reached a maximum 24 hr post infection when cell death was completed (Figure 1B). Since Arabidopsis ATG8 associates with autophagosomal membranes after induction of autophagy (Yoshimoto et al., 2004Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Processing of ATG8s, ubiquitin-like proteins, and their deconjugation by ATG4s are essential for plant autophagy.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), we additionally monitored autophagy activity with transiently expressed GFP-ATG8 fusion. GFP-derived fluorescence was not detectable in leaves before inoculation (data not shown), but occurred as punctate, autophagosomal-like structures throughout leaves 3 hr after infection with Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1), and after 6 hr with Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) (Figures 1C and S2B). GFP-like fluorescence was not detected in atg7 (Figure 1C) or in nontransfected control plants (data not shown) upon infection with avirulent bacteria. Collectively, these data indicate that autophagy is induced upon avirulent bacterial infection in Arabidopsis, and that ATG7 and ATG9, in apparent contrast to BECLIN1/ATG6, are not required to restrict HR cell death. To assess whether autophagy induction affects PCD processes upon avirulent bacterial infection, we monitored cell death development in infected leaves of atg7 and atg9. The effect of Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4)- or (AvrRpm1)-induced HR cell death was quantified using an electrolyte leakage assay (Mackey et al., 2003Mackey D. Belkhadir Y. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Dangl J.L. Arabidopsis RIN4 is a target of the type III virulence effector AvrRpt2 and modulates RPS2-mediated resistance.Cell. 2003; 112: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), as cell death causes release of electrolytes measured as changes in the conductance of a bath solution. These assays showed that Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4)-induced cell death caused an increase in conductance in Ws-0 by 10–12 hr (Figure 2A). However, this increase was significantly suppressed in the atg7 and atg9 mutants (Figure 2A). In contrast, inoculation of atg7 and atg9 mutants with Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) resulted in a minor but not significant reduction in electrolyte leakage compared to wild-type (Figure 2B). To verify this finding, we inoculated atg7 and atg9 mutants with an avirulent isolate (Noco2) of the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Recognition of Noco2 by the TIR-NB-LRR RPP1 R gene leads to EDS1-dependent HR cell death 24 hr after inoculation (Parker et al., 1996Parker J.E. Holub E.B. Frost L.N. Falk A. Gunn N.D. Daniels M.J. Characterization of eds1, a mutation in Arabidopsis suppressing resistance to Peronospora parasitica specified by several different RPP genes.Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2033-2046PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, microscopic analysis of Ws-0 wild-type leaves stained with trypan blue to detect dead cells showed HR cell death of individual mesophyll cells penetrated by the oomycete 24 hr after inoculation (Figure 2C). This contrasted with atg7, in which there was a dramatic suppression of cell death (p < 0.05, Figure 2C). Cell death in atg9 was also significantly suppressed (p < 0.05), but not to the extent as in atg7 (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data indicate that autophagy may have a death promoting function in some plant-pathogen R-Avr gene interactions. Since autophagy was induced upon infection with Pto DC3000 expressing AvrRps4 or AvrRpm1, the disease susceptibility of atg7 and atg9 mutants was examined. Time-course assays revealed that, after 2 days, growth of Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) or (AvrRps4) in atg7 was up to 10-fold higher than growth in wild-type Ws-0 (Figure 3A). However, 4 days after challenge, bacterial levels had decreased in the autophagic mutants with the same magnitude as observed in wild-type plants (Figure 3A) and the defense marker PR1 accumulated in both autophagic mutants to similar levels as in wild-type Ws-0 (Figure 3B). Thus, atg7 and atg9 mutants are compromised in early restriction of bacterial growth, but retain the capacity to induce other defense responses. However, knockdown of BECLIN1/ATG6 leads to enhanced disease susceptibility, suggesting that autophagy contributes to basal defense responses (Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Arabidopsis ATG6 is required to limit the pathogen-associated cell death response.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this notion, atg7 mutants supported increased growth of virulent Pto DC3000 as well as of the virulent Emwa isolate of H. arabidopsidis (Figure S3). It is important to note, that we did not observe autophagy induction upon virulent Pto DC3000 infections during the first 6 hr post infection (Figure 1A), but we cannot exclude that autophagy might become activated, either at weaker levels or at later stages upon virulent infection. Since cell death provoked by AvrRps4 is suppressed by mutations in autophagy genes, it is possible that RPS4 requires EDS1 to induce autophagy. We therefore infected eds1 and atg7 mutants with Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) and tested for autophagic activity using LysoTracker Green staining. Again, this revealed a marked accumulation of autolysosomal-like structures in the cytoplasm of Ws-0 cells 6 hr post infection. In contrast, only few autolysosomal-like structures were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from eds1 mutants that appeared indistinguishable from cells of atg7 (Figures 4A and 4B). This observation was supported by transmission electron microscopic examination of infected leaves. Autophagosomal-like vesicles could be observed already 4 hr post infection in the cytoplasm of Ws-0 cells, but not in atg7 and eds1 (Figures 4C and 4D). In line with these observations, GFP-ATG8 mediated labeling of autophagosomal-like structures was absent from Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) infected leaves in eds1 (Figure S4). This prompted us to compare the level of cell death suppression between eds1 and atg7 infected with Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4). In Ws-0, an increase in conductance was apparent by 9 hr (Figure 4E). As observed previously, this increase was considerably suppressed in the atg7 mutant. Remarkably, we did not observe a significant difference in electrolyte leakage between atg7 and eds1 (Figure 4E). This was supported by similar trypan blue stainings of atg7 and eds1 infected with Noco2 isolates of H. arabidopsidis (Figure 2C) and infections with Pto DC3000 (AvrRps4) (Figure 4F). Thus, EDS1 seems to be required for early induction of autophagy via RPS4, and eds1 and atg7 suppress AvrRps4-induced cell death to comparable levels. The observation that autophagy is induced by Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) could indicate that autophagy is, at least in part, involved in RPM1-mediated PCD execution. To analyze the possibility that the contribution of autophagy is masked by (an)other cell death pathway(s) in RPM1-mediated PCD execution, we set out to block another PCD mechanism in the autophagy deficient background. One such pathway may involve cathepsin B which was recently demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors and antisense to be required for cell death in N. benthamiana triggered by Phytophthora infestans (Gilroy et al., 2007Gilroy E.M. Hein I. van der Hoorn R. Boevink P.C. Venter E. McLellan H. Kaffarnik F. Hrubikova K. Shaw J. Holeva M. et al.Involvement of cathepsin B in the plant disease resistance hypersensitive response.Plant J. 2007; 52: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In our Arabidopsis system, cathepsin inhibitor treatments resulted only in a slight but not significant reduction of cell death upon infection with Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1) in the Ws-0 wild-type, and this reduction was comparable to the effect of autophagy deficiency in atg7 (Figure 5A). However, the use of cathepsin inhibitors on atg7 mutants revealed an additive effect, and resulted in considerable reduction of cell death compared to wild-type (p < 0.05 at 6 and 7 hpi). To analyze the biological relevance of this effect, we compared the level of cell death suppression to the signaling mutant ndr1 which is partially compromised in RPM1-conditioned resistance and HR cell death (Aarts et al., 1998Aarts N. Metz M. Holub E. Staskawicz B.J. Daniels M.J. Parker J.E. Different requirements for EDS1 and NDR1 by disease resistance genes define at least two R gene-mediated signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 10306-10311Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Because the ndr1-1 knockout allele is in the Col-0 background, we extended our studies and included an atg5 loss-of-function mutant in the same ecotype (Thompson et al., 2005Thompson A.R. Doelling J.H. Suttangkakul A. Vierstra R.D. Autophagic nutrient recycling in Arabidopsis directed by the ATG8 and ATG12 conjugation pathways.Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2097-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). As observed before, Pto DC3000 (AvrRpm1)-triggered cell death was comparably reduced by autophagy deficiency and cathepsin inhibition in relation to the wild-type control (Col-0). However, an additive effect leading to significant suppression of RPM1-conditioned cell death (p < 0.05 at 4-6 hpi) could be observed after cathepsin inhibitor treatment of atg5 plants, which reached levels resembling ndr1 (Figure 5B). These findings were further substantiated with an additional atg7 knockout allele (atg7-2) in the Col-0 background (Figure S5). In addition, cell death suppression by autophagy deficiency in combination with cathepsin inhibitor treatment became more evident under conditions with increased day length similar to those used by Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008Patel S. Dinesh-Kumar"

Kinetochores are protein assemblies at the periphery of centromeric chromatin that are required for segregating chromosomes in all eukaryotes (Maiato et al., 2004Maiato H. DeLuca J. Salmon E.D.

Robust spindle microtubule (MT) plus-end attachment is “end-on,” and MTs bound to kinetochores are known as kinetochore microtubules (kMTs; Rieder, 1982Rieder C.L.

The number of MTs bound per kinetochore can be as few as one for budding yeast and up to 20 in humans (Rieder, 1982Rieder C.L.

By electron microscopy (EM), human kinetochores show a multilayered disk structure (Maiato et al., 2004Maiato H. DeLuca J. Salmon E.D. Earnshaw W.C. The dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interface.J.

The periphery of centromeric chromatin has higher density and is called the inner plate, followed by a low-contrast gap of 20–30 nm, an outer plate 40–50 nm thick, and a peripheral fibrous corona extending 100–200 nm away from the outer plate. Protofilaments at plus ends of kMTs curve inside-out by various degrees near the inner surface of the outer plate, and kMTs rarely penetrate centromeric chromatin (Maiato et al., 2006Maiato H.

These observations suggest that protein linkages along the inner-outer kinetochore axis connect centromeric chromatin to spindle MTs. Information about relative inside-out locations of different proteins at kinetochores has been obtained from epistasis assays in conjunction with protein-protein interaction data (Maiato et al., 2004Maiato H.

KNL1 and the CENP-H/I/K complex coordinately direct kinetochore assembly in vertebrates.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The inner domain of the kinetochore is assembled from proteins constitutively present at centromeres during the cell cycle. First is CENP-A, a variant of histone H3, that replaces H3 in nucleosomes of chromatin at the base of the kinetochore (Blower et al., 2002Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H. Conserved organization of centromeric chromatin in flies and humans.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Following CENP-A are 14 proteins known as the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates III, J.R. Cleveland D.W.

Unlike the constitutively localized proteins, outer kinetochore proteins are assembled at kinetochores beginning at prophase and leave kinetochores at the end of mitosis. Important are three highly conserved protein complexes (the KMN network) which assemble stably within the outer kinetochore to produce core attachment sites for kMTs (Cheeseman et al., 2006Cheeseman I.M.

Other outer domain components transiently associate with kinetochores after entry into mitosis (Liu et al., 2006Liu S.T. Rattner J.B. Jablonski S.A. Yen T.J.

Salmon E.D. The spindle-assembly checkpoint in space and time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). To achieve a high-resolution picture of kinetochore protein architecture, a method is needed that approaches the nanometer resolution of electron microscopy, but also has molecular specificity. Here we describe a fluorescence microscopy method that we developed that measures the average separation, Delta, between proteins labeled with two different fluorophores at <5 nm accuracy along the inner-outer axis of human metaphase kinetochores. Our Delta assay calculates an average value from measurements obtained from sister kinetochore pairs in order to correct for chromatic aberration locally. To show that individual sister kinetochores exhibit similar values, we employed a technique previously developed for measuring separation distances within single molecules (SHREC; Churchman et al., 2005Churchman L.S. Okten Z. Rock R.S. Dawson J.F. Spudich J.A. Single molecule high-resolution colocalization of Cy3 and Cy5 attached to macromolecules measures intramolecular distances through time.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1419-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We have assayed 19 epitopes in 16 proteins representing all of the distinct protein groups comprising core kinetochore structure to yield to our knowledge the first nanometer-scale map of average protein position for the human kinetochore. We were also able to obtain measurements of the stiffness of the different protein linkages, because at metaphase, sister kinetochore pairs exhibit directional instability that produces oscillations in the stretch of centromeric chromatin between sisters (Maiato et al., 2004Maiato H. DeLuca J. Salmon E.D. Earnshaw W.C. The dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interface.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5461-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Only proteins like CENP-A and CENP-C that bind DNA were found to be compliant; the other linkages were stiff during metaphase oscillations. We added taxol to metaphase cells to test whether there were any significant changes in kinetochore protein architecture when kMTs are stabilized, centromeric stretch lost, and the SAC activated (Clute and Pines, 1999Clute P. Pines J. Temporal and spatial control of cyclin B1 destruction in metaphase.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, Maiato et al., 2004Maiato H. DeLuca J. Salmon E.D. Earnshaw W.C. The dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interface.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5461-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We discovered two major changes including the selective inward movement of the Ndc80 complex and outward movement of the motor domain of the kinesin CENP-E. Finally, we employed a modified two-color colocalization assay to locate the ends of kMTs relative to the MT-binding Ndc80 complex. Cumulatively, our assays provide a novel molecular resolution view of a macromolecular machine with a central role in cell division and reveal the mechanical nature of specific protein linkages at kinetochores as well as large-scale changes in kinetochore architecture induced by suppression of MT dynamics. We initially developed the Delta assay to analyze the four-subunit Ndc80 complex, which is the major MT-binding component of the outer kinetochore. Electron microscopy and atomic structure studies indicate that the Ndc80 complex is 57 nm long and has a dumbbell shape (Figure 1A; Wei et al., 2007Wei R.R. Al-Bassam J. Harrison S.C.

Cell. 2005; 16: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Globular C-terminal regions of Spc24 and Spc25 are at the opposite end of a long α-helical coiled-coil rod (Figure 1A). Previous work suggests that the 9G3 label is external to the Spc24 label along the inner-outer kinetochore axis (DeLuca et al., 2006DeLuca J.G. Gall W.E. Ciferri C. Cimini D. Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Kinetochore microtubule dynamics and attachment stability are regulated by Hec1.Cell. 2006; 127: 969-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), which is consistent with binding orientation of the complex relative to MT polarity (Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2008Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Cheeseman I.M. Yoshioka C. Desai A. Milligan R.A. Orientation and structure of the Ndc80 complex on the microtubule lattice.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We analyzed metaphase HeLa cells where kinetochore inner-outer linkages to kMTs are mostly parallel to the axis between sister kinetochores (Figures 1B and 1C). Two-color immunofluorescence was performed using the 9G3 antibody to Hec1 and polyclonal antibodies to the C-terminal heads of Spc24 or Spc25 (see Figures S1 and S2 available online). We acquired high-resolution, low-noise, 3D image stacks of cells where the metaphase spindle was parallel to the coverslip surface—ensuring that several sister kinetochore pairs were in focus together within the same set of optical sections (Figure 1B). The image in each color is a convolution of the label distribution within the kinetochore and the objective point spread function (Figure 1C; Maddox et al., 2003Maddox P.S. Moree B. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Spinning disk confocal microscope system for rapid high-resolution, multimode, fluorescence speckle microscopy and green fluorescent protein imaging in living cells.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 360: 597-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As kinetochore proteins are distributed across the width of kinetochores (Figure 1C), the “Airy disk” image is elongated into an elliptical cross-section whose major axis defines the orientation of the kinetochore face and whose centroid defines the average position of the label along the inner-outer kinetochore axis (Figures 1C, S3, and S4). Sister pairs in or close to the same image plane were selected for analysis. A 3D Gaussian fitting algorithm was used to obtain the four centroid coordinates needed to calculate the separation of the two color labels, Delta (Figures 1D and 1E). This calculation scheme automatically corrected for the considerable chromatic aberration—the green label was on average shifted down and to the left of red by ∼30 nm, but exact shifts varied by position within the cell. Delta measurement simulations showed that staggering of attachment site linkages by up to 150 nm along the interkinetochore (K-K) axis (Figure S3Dii) had little effect on Delta accuracy. However, the tilt of the kinetochore face that inclines attachment linkage to the K-K axis (Figure S3Di) was a source of measurement error (1% in untreated cells) that was corrected to obtain the final average value of Delta (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The average Delta value (Figure 1E) measured between the 9G3 label near the Hec1 head and the Spc24/Spc25 C terminus was 45 ± 6 nm and 45 ± 4 nm, respectively (SD; n = 107 sister kinetochore pairs for each combination). We also obtained the same value after correcting for the majority of lateral chromatic aberration between the 9G3 and Spc24 images (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S5). To assess the efficacy of the correction scheme and the accuracy of the Delta method using antibody labeling, we labeled Hec1 with 9G3 and used equal amounts of red and green secondary antibodies. The average Delta measured in this case was 0 ± 5 nm (SD; n = 91 sister kinetochore pairs). In a second test for accuracy, cells expressing GFP-Hec1 were labeled with anti-GFP and 9G3—in this case, the average Delta was 3 ± 7 nm, a value consistent with structure (Figure 1A; Ciferri et al., 2008Ciferri C. Pasqualato S. Screpanti E. Varetti G. Santaguida S. Dos Reis G. Maiolica A. Polka J. De Luca J.G. De Wulf P. et al.Implications for kinetochore-microtubule attachment from the structure of an engineered Ndc80 complex.Cell. 2008; 133: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Average Delta values typically had 95% confidence intervals of ±1–2 nm (Table S1), and two averages that differed by 3 nm or more were significantly different (paired t test with p value < 0.02) because of the high signal-to-noise ratio (>∼30) of the kinetochore fluorescence (Figure S4) and the averaging of many (>100) individual Delta values. A major assumption of our Delta assay is that the two sister kinetochores have the same protein architecture and stiffness. We verified this assumption by direct measurements of label separation within individual kinetochores of sister pairs for the Ndc80 complex and several other proteins (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S5). These and other tests (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) establish the Delta assay as a technique for analyzing kinetochore architecture with an accuracy of <5 nm. The 45 nm Delta value measured for Spc24/25 and Hec1 indicates that the Ndc80 complex adopts an elongated shape along the inner-outer kinetochore axis. Sister kinetochores of metaphase bioriented chromosomes exhibit directional instability—oscillations characterized by abrupt switches between persistent phases of poleward and antipoleward movement (Skibbens et al., 1993Skibbens R.V. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. Directional instability of kinetochore motility during chromosome congression and segregation in mitotic newt lung cells: a push-pull mechanism.J.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This directional instability produces oscillations in the stretch of centromeric chromatin between sister kinetochores that are asynchronous between different chromosomes. Consequently, a fixed image of a metaphase cell has within it sister kinetochore pairs in different mechanical states (Figure 2A). It is straightforward to assess the mechanical state of each sister pair by measuring the K-K distance using the 9G3 label, which varies during metaphase oscillations between a minimum of ∼0.8 to a maximum of ∼2 μm in HeLa cells; the rest length in nocodazole-treated cells is ∼0.7 μm. Thus correlating Delta values with the interkinetochore K-K distance provides direct information on mechanical properties of specific protein linkages. The slope of the least-squares line through a plot of Delta versus K-K distance represents compliance during oscillation of a particular protein linkage at metaphase, which we refer to as “oscillation compliance” (Figure 2A). When Delta values measured for 9G3 and Spc24 labels were plotted as a function of K-K distance, the slope was near zero, indicating that tension changes during sister kinetochore oscillations do not affect the conformation of the Ndc80 complex (Figure 2B). The slope was also near zero for cells labeled with 9G3 and equal amounts of red and green secondary antibody (Figure 2C), indicating that Delta measurements were insensitive to K-K separation. We conclude that the Ndc80 complex is a stiff mechanical entity within kinetochores, with one end attached to the plus ends of kMTs and the other end located toward the inner kinetochore. We next extended the analysis of position and mechanical properties to 19 epitopes in 16 proteins representing all of the distinct groups comprising core kinetochore structure (Table S1). For three large proteins (hKnl1, CENP-E, and CENP-F), we analyzed two different regions using independent antibodies (Table S2; Figure S6). The entire data set is summarized in Figure 3; the positions along the kinetochore inner-outer axis for all analyzed epitopes are plotted relative to Hec1-9G3. Positive values are outside (i.e., toward the spindle side) of the position of the 9G3 centroid, and negative values are inside (i.e., toward the centromeric chromatin). All average Delta values in this position map have been corrected for inclination tilt (Figures S3 and S7; Table S1). The data for control cells are on the left of Figure 3, with dots indicating average values. The mechanical properties of each Delta value are summarized by vertical lines through the average dots which indicate minimum to maximum variation with K-K separation. The average position data for taxol-treated cells are on the right, and insights derived from this perturbation are discussed in the next results section. With this overview of the entire data set, we describe specific aspects of measurements for each protein complex. The centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A and closely associated conserved CENP-C protein are present at centromeres throughout the cell cycle and provide a foundation for kinetochore assembly. We labeled CENP-A in two ways that gave similar results—in the first, CENP-A-GFP was stably expressed in HeLa cells (Gerlich et al., 2003Gerlich D. Beaudouin J. Kalbfuss B. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Global chromosome positions are transmitted through mitosis in mammalian cells.Cell. 2003; 112: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and GFP was detected with antibodies (Figure 3). In the second, a primary antibody to CENP-A was used. As this antibody required a different fixation condition (cold methanol) from the other epitopes, we focused on data acquired with the GFP fusion and the standard aldehyde-based fixation procedure. In control cells, the average Delta of CENP-A-GFP relative to the Hec1 head was 107 nm, and there was a pronounced upward slope of Delta with centromere stretch (Figures 2D and 3). The average Delta for CENP-C, which has direct DNA-binding activity (Politi et al., 2002Politi V. Perini G. Trazzi S. Pliss A. Raska I. Earnshaw W.C. Della Valle G. CENP-C binds the α-satellite DNA in vivo at specific centromere domains.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2317-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lacks extended coiled coils, was 79 nm and the oscillation compliance was ∼40% of that exhibited by CENP-A (Figure 3). From the entire set of proteins analyzed (Figure 3), these were the only two proteins that exhibited significant oscillation compliance relative to the Ndc80 complex. In addition to CENP-A and CENP-C, 13 additional CCAN proteins (CENP-H, I, and K–U) localize to centromeres throughout the cell cycle and play important roles in chromosome segregation (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R.

In Bacillus subtilis, two protein complexes have been implicated in this process: the ParAB homologs, Soj and Spo0J, and the bacterial Smc/ScpAB complex, also called condensin. Here we demonstrate that Smc is highly enriched in the region around the origin of replication, specifically near parS sites to which Spo0J binds and at highly transcribed genes. Furthermore, we find that efficient recruitment of Smc to a large region around the origin of replication depends on the presence of Spo0J. We show that Spo0J performs two independent functions: regulation of initiation of DNA replication via Soj and promotion of chromosome segregation by Smc recruitment. Our results demonstrate a direct functional interaction between two widely conserved systems involved in chromosome replication and segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2036907121,"DNA damage induces apoptosis and many apoptotic genes are regulated via alternative splicing (AS), but little is known about the control mechanisms. Here we show that ultraviolet irradiation (UV) affects cotranscriptional AS in a p53-independent way, through the hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and a subsequent inhibition of transcriptional elongation, estimated in vivo and in real time. Phosphomimetic CTD mutants not only display lower elongation but also duplicate the UV effect on AS. Consistently, nonphosphorylatable mutants prevent the UV effect. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. Splicing-sensitive microarrays revealed a significant overlap of the subsets of genes that have changed AS with UV and those that have reduced expression, suggesting that transcriptional coupling to AS is a key feature of the DNA-damage response."
https://openalex.org/W1970203866,"Organization and segregation of replicated chromosomes are essential processes during cell division in all organisms. Similar to eukaryotes, bacteria possess centromere-like DNA sequences (parS) that cluster at the origin of replication and the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes for faithful chromosome segregation. In Bacillus subtilis, parS sites are bound by the partitioning protein Spo0J (ParB), and we show here that Spo0J recruits the SMC complex to the origin. We demonstrate that the SMC complex colocalizes with Spo0J at the origin and that insertion of parS sites near the replication terminus targets SMC to this position leading to defects in chromosome organization and segregation. Consistent with these findings, the subcellular localization of the SMC complex is disrupted in the absence of Spo0J or the parS sites. We propose a model in which recruitment of SMC to the origin by Spo0J-parS organizes the origin region and promotes efficient chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2018425992,"Aberrant Wnt/beta-catenin signaling following loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is thought to initiate colon adenoma formation. Using zebrafish and human cells, we show that homozygous loss of APC causes failed intestinal cell differentiation but that this occurs in the absence of nuclear beta-catenin and increased intestinal cell proliferation. Therefore, loss of APC is insufficient for causing beta-catenin nuclear localization. APC mutation-induced intestinal differentiation defects instead depend on the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein-1 (CtBP1), whereas proliferation defects and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin require the additional activation of KRAS. These findings suggest that, following APC loss, CtBP1 contributes to adenoma initiation as a first step, whereas KRAS activation and beta-catenin nuclear localization promote adenoma progression to carcinomas as a second step. Consistent with this model, human FAP adenomas showed robust upregulation of CtBP1 in the absence of detectable nuclear beta-catenin, whereas nuclear beta-catenin was detected in carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2041853813,"We have studied the role of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), a cancer-associated extracellular isoform of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in multicellular spheroid growths (radius of approximately 300 microm) of human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. Spheroids were transfected with CA9 (or empty vector) and imaged confocally (using fluorescent dyes) for both intracellular pH (pH(i)) and pH in the restricted extracellular spaces (pH(e)). With no CA9 expression, spheroids developed very low pH(i) (approximately 6.3) and reduced pH(e) (approximately 6.9) at their core, associated with a diminishing gradient of acidity extending out to the periphery. With CA9 expression, core intracellular acidity was less prominent (pH(i) = approximately 6.6), whereas extracellular acidity was enhanced (pH(e) = approximately 6.6), so that radial pH(i) gradients were smaller and radial pH(e) gradients were larger. These effects were reversed by eliminating CA9 activity with membrane-impermeant CA inhibitors. The observation that CA9 activity reversibly reduces pH(e) indicates the enzyme is facilitating CO(2) excretion from cells (by converting vented CO(2) to extracellular H(+)), rather than facilitating membrane H(+) transport (such as H(+) associated with metabolically generated lactic acid). This latter process requires titration of exported H(+) ions with extracellular HCO(3)(-), which would reduce rather than increase extracellular acidity. In a multicellular structure, the net effect of CA9 on pH(e) will depend on the cellular CO(2)/lactic acid emission ratio (set by local oxygenation and membrane HCO(3)(-) uptake). Our results suggest that CO(2)-producing tumors may express CA9 to facilitate CO(2) excretion, thus raising pH(i) and reducing pH(e), which promotes tumor proliferation and survival. The results suggest a possible basis for attenuating tumor development through inhibiting CA9 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2168728782,"The transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is predominantly expressed in the brain where it can form heterotetrameric complexes with TRPC1 and TRPC4 channel subunits. These excitatory, nonselective cationic channels are regulated by G protein, phospholipase C-coupled receptors. Here, we show that TRPC5(-/-) mice exhibit diminished innate fear levels in response to innately aversive stimuli. Moreover, mutant mice exhibited significant reductions in responses mediated by synaptic activation of Group I metabotropic glutamate and cholecystokinin 2 receptors in neurons of the amygdala. Synaptic strength at afferent inputs to the amygdala was diminished in P10-P13 null mice. In contrast, baseline synaptic transmission, membrane excitability, and spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation at cortical and thalamic inputs to the amygdala were largely normal in older null mice. These experiments provide genetic evidence that TRPC5, activated via G protein-coupled neuronal receptors, has an essential function in innate fear."

In 2003, a novel family of cytokines was discovered simultaneously by two independent research teams (1Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A. Shen M. Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 2Sheppard P. Kindsvogel W. Xu W. Henderson K. Schlutsmeyer S. Whitmore T.E. Kuestner R.

Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Initially, the two research teams named these novel cytokines either interferon-λ (IFN-λ) 2The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonILinterleukinEMCVencephalomyocarditis virusSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationEC80concentration required for 80% protection. 2The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonILinterleukinEMCVencephalomyocarditis virusSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationEC80concentration required for 80% protection. 1, 2, and 3 or interleukin-29 (IL-29), -28A, or -28B. Throughout this report we will use the IFN-λ designation or type III IFN, when referring to all tree subtypes as a group. Like type I IFN, type III IFN induces antiviral activity both in vitro (3Meager A. Visvalingam K. Dilger P. Bryan D. Wadhwa M. Cytokine. 2005; 31: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Robek M.D. Boyd B.S. Chisari F.V. J.

Virol. 2006; 80: 4501-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus the two types of IFN seem to have similar biological effects at a cellular level. IFN-λ uses a distinct receptor complex consisting of a unique subunit, named IFN-λR1, as well as the IL-10R2 subunit. The similar biological effects caused by type I and III IFN can be explained by activation of a highly overlapping set of transcription factors. In particular, both types of IFN lead to phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1, 2, and 3, followed by assembly of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription factor and thus target the same population of genes for induction (6Doyle S.E.

The expression of type III IFN appears to be induced by the same stimuli and depend upon the same signaling pathways as type I IFN. For example, type III IFN has been shown to be induced by a variety of viruses such as influenza A virus, herpes viruses, and Sendai virus as well as lipopolysaccharides or double-stranded RNA (9Ank N.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 3434-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of different cell populations to the production of IFN-λ is not yet clear. An important difference between the type I and III IFN systems is the expression pattern of their receptors. Whereas most cell types express the type I IFN receptor complex and the IL-10R2 component of the IFN-λ receptor, the expression of the IFN-λR1 receptor subunit is highly restricted (12Mordstein M. Kochs G. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Paludan S.R. Klucher K. Staeheli P. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Sommereyns C. Paul S. Staeheli P. Michiels T. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000017Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The exact expression pattern of the IFN-λR1 is not yet fully established, but it is clear that cells of epithelial origin express IFN-λR1 (13Sommereyns C. Paul S. Staeheli P. Michiels T. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000017Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Because type III IFN cannot signal without both receptor subunits, the response to type III IFN is restricted as well. Recent work, using IFN-λR1 knock-out mice, demonstrated that IFN-λ is effective against influenza virus, if the virus is administrated through the intranasal route, but not if it is administrated in a systemic fashion (12Mordstein M. Kochs G. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Paludan S.R. Klucher K. Staeheli P. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This agrees well with a role for IFN-λ in preventing viruses in infecting and penetrating the lung epithelia. In addition to its antiviral activity, IFN-λ is capable of modulating the Th1/Th2 response (14Mennechet F.J. Uzé G. Blood. 2006; 107: 4417-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Jordan W.J. Eskdale J. Srinivas S. Pekarek V. Kelner D. Rodia M. Gallagher G. Genes Immun. 2007; 8: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). IFN-λ can down-regulate IL-13 and thus suppress the Th2 response (16Jordan W.J. Eskdale J. Boniotto M. Rodia M. Kellner D. Gallagher G. Genes Immun. 2007; 8: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that deficient IFN-λ expression after rhinovirus infection is linked to increased severity of asthma in patients (17Contoli M. Message S.D. Laza-Stanca V. Edwards M.R. Wark P.A. Bartlett N.W. Kebadze T. Mallia P. Stanciu L.A. Parker H.L. Slater L. Lewis-Antes A. Kon O.M. Holgate S.T. Davies D.E. Kotenko S.V. Papi A. Johnston S.L. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Whether the protection against asthma induced by IFN-λ is due to suppression of viral replication or to the reduced Th2 response or both is currently unknown. However, if type III IFN plays an important role in development and severity of asthma, the potential medical relevance of type III IFN is substantial. Type III IFN is a member of the class II cytokine family. This family includes type I, II, and III interferons and the IL-10 family (IL-10, IL-19, IL20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26). The IL-10R2 receptor subunit is shared by IL-10, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, and IFN-λ. Although these cytokines share one subunit of their receptor complexes, they have widely different biological activities. For example, IL-10 induces immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory activities, whereas IL-22 regulates protection and reorganization of tissue cells at outer body barriers and is critical in establishing an efficient antibacterial defense in lung and gut epithelia (18Aujla S.J. Chan Y.R. Zheng M. Fei M. Askew D.J. Pociask D.A. Reinhart T.A. McAllister F. Edeal J. Gaus K. Husain S. Kreindler J.L. Dubin P.J. Pilewski J.M. Myerburg M.M. Mason C.A. Iwakura Y. Kolls J.K. Nat.

Med. 2008; 14: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both IL-22 and IFN-λ play critical roles in the innate immune defense of epithelia cells against bacterial and viral infections, respectively. We present the first crystal structure of a type III IFN and suggest a model for receptor interaction. This model is based upon structure-based site-directed mutagenesis and is further validated by quantitative measurement of the antiviral activity and STAT2 phosphorylation induced by wild-type and mutated forms of human IFN-λ3. The crystal structure of human IFN-λ3 reveals a surprisingly close relationship with IL-22, which is further discussed. Expression and purification of human IFN-λ3 were done as previously described (20Dellgren C. Gad H.H. Hamming O.J. Melchjorsen J. Hartmann R. Genes Immun. 2009; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the buffer used for size exclusion chromatography was replaced with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, and the eluted protein was used immediately for crystallization. Initial crystallization screening was performed with the Crystal ScreenTM system (Hampton Research). Optimal crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of protein solution with reservoir solution containing 28% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 3% v/v isopropyl alcohol, and 10 mm zinc chloride and using the sitting drop, vapor-diffusion method. The crystals were frozen in the crystallization solution plus 10% v/v glycerol, and data were collected at either the I911-3 beam line at MAX laboratory (21Ursby T. Mammen C.B. Cerenius Y. Svensson C. Sommarin B. Fodje M.N. Kvick Å. Logan D.T. Als-Nielsen J. Thunnissen M.M. Larsen S. Liljas A. AIP Conf.

The crystals belonged to the P3121 space group with cell dimensions of a = b = 91.12 Å, c = 150.21 Å. To obtain experimentally determined phases, crystals were soaked in crystallization solution plus 100 mm sodium iodide for a few minutes before being frozen. Data were collected at both high (maximal anomalous signal) and low (maximal resolution) wavelengths. The program SHELX (22Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80558) Google Scholar) was used to find the initial iodide sites by a single wavelength anomalous dispersion approach using the high wave length dataset. The sites found using SHELX were transferred to SHARP (23delaFortelle E.B. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and a full single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering approach, using two different iodide derivatives and a native dataset, was adopted.

The final refined structure has five residues in the non-allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (1%). These residues are predominantly found in the poorly defined regions of chain D. Root mean square deviations were calculated using the SSM routine implemented in Coot. The figures were made using the program PyMOL. 3W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. Selected residues of human IFN-λ3 were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), expressed, and purified the same way as the wild-type protein. The antiviral activity of human wild-type and mutant IFN-λ3 against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in HepG2 cells was done as previously described (20Dellgren C. Gad H.H. Hamming O.J. Melchjorsen J. Hartmann R. Genes Immun. 2009; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were treated with either wild-type IFN-λ3 or the indicated mutants at concentrations, which correspond to the concentration required for 80% protection in the antiviral assay (EC80). Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates with a density of 60,000 cells per well and incubated for 24 h to allow the cells to settle. The induction with each IFN was done in replica of three, and the induction time was 2 h. For detection of the phosphorylation status of STAT2, we used Luminex Technology. Briefly, the filter plate was washed with assay buffer, and 50 μl of freshly vortexed antibody-conjugated beads was added to each well. The plate was washed with assay buffer, and samples and standards were added. After a brief shake (30 s at 1.100 rpm), the plate was incubated at 4 °C overnight in the dark with light shaking (300 rpm). After one washing step, 25 μl of the detection antibody was added to each well, and the plate was shaken and incubated as above. Subsequently, the plate was washed and incubated for 30 min with 50 μl of a streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution with shaking (30 s at 1.100 rpm, 10 min 300 rpm). Finally the plate was washed, 125 μl of assay buffer was added to each well, and the plate was shaken for 10 s at 1100 rpm and read immediately on the Bio-Plex machine. The phosphorylation of STAT2 is expressed in arbitrary units. Recombinant human IFN-λ3 (corresponding to the mature polypeptide except residues 1–12) was expressed in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies and purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography under denaturating conditions followed by renaturation. This procedure allows large scale production of fully active IFN-λ3 (Table 2), which was used for crystallization (20Dellgren C. Gad H.H. Hamming O.J. Melchjorsen J. Hartmann R. Genes Immun. 2009; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Crystals were diffracted to a maximal resolution of 2.8 Å, and the structure was determined using traditional isomorphous replacement combined with optimal use of the anomalous signal. The crystal structure of IFN-λ3 was determined and refined to a resolution of 2.8 Å with an R-factor of 26% and a free R-factor of 31% (see Table 1 for data statistics). The asymmetric unit contains four molecules that are pair-wise linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys-48 of neighboring molecules. The final model contains residues 13–117 and 128–175. Residues 118–127 could not be modeled because of poor electron density, which is probably due to the flexibility of this region (the DE loop) and the lack of stabilizing crystal contacts.TABLE 2Antiviral activity of IFN-λ3 mutantsEC5095% CISlope95% CIEfficacy95% CI-Fold increaseWT0.60.6–0.70.90.8–1.088.987.4–90.5Gln-27 → Ala6.14.1–8.90.80.6–0.9110.7100.8–120.610Gln-30 → Ala1.51.2–1.90.70.6–0.8104.599.9–109.02Lys-33 → Ala23.219.2–28.01.00.9–1.268.564.4–72.638Arg-34 → Ala20.417.6–23.61.00.9–1.178.274.6–81.833Lys-36 → Ala31.212.0–48.80.80.6–1.091.979.9–103.951Asp-37 → Ala26.017.3–39.10.70.6–0.8102.791.6–113.743Leu-44 → Ala7.15.2–9.60.90.7–1.1106.798.7–114.712Cys-48 → Ala0.40.3–0.50.70.6–0.981.778.7–84.61Arg-51 → Ala0.70.5–0.90.70.6–0.882.077.8–86.21Arg-53 → Ala4.33.7–5.01.41.2–1.682.078.8–85.17Leu-54 → Ala3.52.9–4.21.00.9–1.282.378.9–85.66Asp-96 → Ala2.21.8–2.70.80.7–0.8111.4106.9–115.84Val-97 → Ala41.532.3–53.41.10.9–1.276.169.3–82.968Gln-100 → Ala27.823.7–32.61.41.1–1.651.748.7–54.746Phe-155 → Ala24.520.2–29.60.80.7–0.993.488.4–98.440Phe-158 → Ala>400>650 Open table in a new tab TABLE 1Data collection, phasing and refinement statisticsNativeIodine 1Iodine 2Data collection Space groupP3121P3121P3121 Cell dimensions a = b, c (Å)91.0, 150.991.3, 150.991.2, 151.2 α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120Near remoteFar remote Wavelength0.907 Å0.905 Å1.65 Å0.9 Å Resolution (Å)50-4.050-2.850-3.050-3.4 Rsym or Rmerge0.036 (0.07)0.095 (0.45)0.094 (0.41)0.095 (0.45) I/σI45 (29.8)15.2 (2.2)14.7 (2.6)15.2 (2.2) Completeness (%)98.8 (99.8)99.7 (97.6)98.8 (88,6)99.7 (97.6) Redundancy8.8 (9.1)5.1 (3.0)5.2 (2.6)5.1 (3.0)Refinement Resolution (Å)23.8-2.8 No. reflections18,112 Rwork/Rfree0.26/0.31 No. atoms4,511 Protein4,419 Ligand/ion35 Water57 B-factors Protein95.11 Water69.57 r.m.s.d. values Bond lengths (Å)0.003 Bond angles (°)0.662For the iodine derivatives, Friedel pairs were kept separated.

Class II cytokines share a characteristic topology consisting of six secondary structure elements named A–F (29Pestka S. Krause C.D. Sarkar D. Walter M.R. Shi Y. Fisher P.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 929-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 30Pestka S. Krause C.D. Walter M.R. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 8-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Elements A and C–F are all α-helices, whereas element B generally is flexible and adopts a number of structures. Helices A, C, D, and F form a four-helix bundle, which is the core of the structure. The structure of IFN-λ3 follows this typical class II cytokine fold (Fig. 1). Element B is poorly ordered and adapts a flexible coil structure in the crystal structure of IFN-λ3. Helices A, C, D, and F constitute the typical four helix bundle where helix F is bending similar to what is seen in other members of the IL-10 family. Out of seven cysteines present in IFN-λ3, six cysteines are engaged in intramolecular disulfide bonds, and one cysteine (Cys-48) is presumed to be free in solution. In the crystal, Cys-48 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond connecting two molecules of IFN-λ3. This disulfide bond arose during crystallization as we failed to observe any dimeric forms of IFN-λ3 on non-reducing SDS-PAGE prior to crystallization (data not shown). The mutation of Cys-48 to alanine did not have any effect upon the antiviral activity of IFN-λ3 (Table 2), thus we do not believe that the intermolecular disulfide bond observed in the crystal has any biological relevance. Of the three intramolecular disulfide bonds, the first disulfide bond between Cys-16 and Cys-115 connects the N terminus to the end of helix D, the second disulfide bond between Cys-50 and Cys-148 connects the AB loop to the beginning of helix F, and the third disulfide bond between Cys-157 and Cys-164 forms a small loop at the end of helix F (Fig. 1). A comparison between the structure of IFN-λ3 and structures of other class II cytokines (IFN-α2, IFN-β, IL-10, IL-19, and IL-22, Protein Data Bank accession codes 1rh2, 1au1, 2ilk, 1n1f, and 1m4r, respectively) shows that IFN-λ3 is structurally more similar to members of the IL-10 family, especially IL-22, than to type I IFNs (Fig. 2). IFN-λ3 and IFN-α2 or IFN-λ3 and IFN-β have a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for C-α atoms of 4.2 and 3.7 Å, respectively, whereas IFN-λ3 and IL-19 or IFN-λ3 and IL-22 have an r.m.s.d. of 3.1 and 2.7 Å. IL-10 differs from the rest of the IL-10 family given that it is the only member so far that is known to form intertwined dimers, where helices E and F from one molecule pack with helices A, B, C, and D from another molecule and vice versa. However, if one ignores this and compares IFN-λ with an artificial IL-10 molecule composed of helices A, B, C, and D from one molecule (residues 12–117) and the intertwined helices E and F from another molecule (residues 118–156), the similarity between IL-10 and IFN-λ3 is relatively high with an r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å. In contrast, sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences of these proteins does not show the same pattern of similarities. The sequence similarity between IFN-λ3 and IFN-α2 or IFN-β is 33 and 31%, respectively, whereas the similarity between IFN-λ3 and IL-10, IL-19, and IL-22 is 23, 22, and 22%, respectively. Thus with respect to sequence, IFN-λ3 is more similar to type I IFNs than the IL-10 family. The pattern of disulfide bonds in IFN-λ3 is also similar to that of type I IFNs. The Cys-16 to Cys-115 disulfide bond in IFN-λ3 is conserved in type I and type III IFNs (except IFN-β and IFN-ϵ) as well as the IL-10 family. In contrast, the Cys-50 to Cys-148 disulfide bond in IFN-λ3 is only found in type I and type III IFNs and not in any members of the IL-10 family. The last disulfide bond, Cys-157 to Cys-164, is a unique feature found in all type III IFNs described so far except human IFN-λ1. The structure of IL-10 in complex with IL-10R1 showed that IL-10 interacts with its receptor via an area primarily composed of helices A, B, and F as well as the AB loop. The recent structure of IL-22 in complex with IL-22R1 showed that IL-22 likewise interacts with its receptor through an area composed of the same helices. We designed a series of alanine mutants of IFN-λ3, which cover many of the surface-exposed residues in helix A, D, and F as well as the AB loop and the part of element B that is close to helix A. All the mutated proteins were purified using size-exclusion chromatography, which served to confirm the structural integrity of the mutated proteins. Next, we determined the ability of these mutants and wild-type IFN-λ3 to induce antiviral activity against EMCV. The antiviral activities are given as the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50), the slope, and the efficacy (Fig. 3A and Table 2). The mutagenesis data show a cluster of eight residues at the center of helices A, D, and F, which is highly sensitive to alanine substitution (EC50 values is increased by a minimum of 30-fold). This cluster is composed of Lys-33, Arg-34, Lys-36, and Asp-37 on the A helix, Val-97 and Gln-100 on the D helix, and, finally, Phe-155 and Phe-158 on the F helix (Fig. 3B). Notably, the mutation of Phe-158 to alanine completely abolishes antiviral activity by IFN-λ3. These residues are positioned close to each other and presumably constitute the core area for receptor binding. This hotspot is surrounded by a number of residues with a significant, yet less dramatic effect upon the antiviral activity. These residues are found in element B (Arg-53 and Leu-54), the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of helix A (Gln-27 and Leu-44, respectively). On the contrary, mutations in the AB-loop (Cys-48 and Arg-51) had little or no effect upon the antiviral activity. It is often assumed that STAT2 phosphorylation is driving the antiviral effect of both type I and III IFN. Using the Luminex system, we performed measurements of the amount of phosphorylated STAT2 found in HepG2 cells after treatment with different doses of IFN-λ3. The experiment was performed using IFN-λ3 concentrations corresponding to 25, 50, 75, and 95% protection of cells against the cytopathic effect of EMCV virus. The data revealed a correlation between the dose of IFN-λ3 used and the amount of phosphorylated STAT2 found (Fig. 4a). To test the direct effect of the introduced mutations upon the signaling, we treated HepG2 cells with either wild-type IFN-λ3 or the indicated mutants at concentrations, which correspond to the concentration required for 80% protection in the antiviral assay (EC80). Subsequently, we measured the amount of phosphorylated STAT2. As seen in Fig. 4b, the various mutants and wild-type IFN-λ3 induce comparable levels of STAT2 phosphorylation when used at concentrations corresponding to their EC80 values, thus there is a direct correlation between the antiviral activity of the mutants and their ability to induced phosphorylation of STAT2. Although IFN-λ is functionally an interferon, our data show that is it structurally closer related to the IL-10 family than to type I IFNs. When one compares the different structures of the IL-10 family members available (IL-19, IL-22, and IL-10) to that of IFN- λ3, it is obvious that they share a common fold. The similarity is most pronounced between IFN-λ3 and IL-22 as well as IL-19, which are all monomers. However, even in the case of IL-10, which forms intertwined dimers, where the E and F helices switches position, the fold is still very similar to IFN-λ3. Not only do IL-22 and IFN-λ share a high degree of structural similarity, they are also both part of the innate immune system in epithelial cells. Here IL-22 confers protection against bacterial infections, whereas IFN-λ protects against viral infection. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that IL-22 and IFN-λ (and possibly also IL-19 and -20) arose as a group of cytokines responsible for the regulation of innate immunity in tissues that suffer from a high risk of infections, unlike type I IFNs, which function systemically. This would explain why two separate IFN systems (type I and III) have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, even though they regulate the same subset of genes. IFN-λ signals through the heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IFN-λR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains. Thus the similarity in structure between IFN-λ and members of the IL-10 family probably reflects a common evolutionary origin as well as the evolutionary restraint caused by the shared IL-10R2 receptor chain. Despite the similarities of this receptor complex to the IL-10 receptor complex, the resulting signal is very different and essentially identical to the one induced by type I IFN. The binding of IL-10 to its receptor complex, IL-10R1·IL-10R2, has been characterized through the crystal structure of the IL-10·IL-10R1 complex (31Josephson K. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Immunity. 2001; 15: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as well as surface plasmon resonance and site-directed mutagenesis (32Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Allman J.C. Izotova L. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Walter M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the IL-22·IL-22R1 complex has also helped to shed light on the binding of IL-22 to its receptor (33Bleicher L. de Moura P.R. Watanabe L. Colau D. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Polikarpov I. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2985-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Jones B.C. Logsdon N.J. Walter M.R. Structure. 2008; 16: 1333-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The binding area of IL-10 and IL-22 to their respective private receptor chains, IL-10R1 and IL-22R1, is often described in terms of two coupled binding sites, named 1A and 1B. The first binding site, 1A, is mainly located on the B element, part of the AB loop, and the F helix (Fig. 5). This binding site is spatially but not sequentially conserved between IL-10 and IL-22. Our data suggest that, although several residues in the corresponding 1A site in IFN-λ3 (Arg-53 and Leu-54 on the B element but not Cys-48 and Arg-51 on the AB loop) are involved in receptor binding with increases in EC50 values from 5- to 20-fold (Table 2), they do not play a major role. The second binding site, 1B, is located on helix A and helix F. Especially the A helix plays a major role in the binding of IL-10 to its receptor, whereas the 1B site in IL-22 appears to play a lesser role in receptor binding. We found a cluster of six residues (Lys-33, Arg-34, Lys-36, and Asp-37 on helix A and Phe-155 and Phe-158 on helix F) at the center of the A and F helices in IFN-λ3, corresponding to the 1B site in IL-10 and IL-22, which play a major role in receptor binding for IFN-λ3. Mutation of any of these residues had a profound impact on the antiviral activity with at increases of EC50 values from 30- to >500-fold. The binding site of IL-10 and IL-22 to the second receptor chain, IL-10R2, is located on the A and D helices (32Logsdon N.J. Jones B.C. Allman J.C. Izotova L. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Walter M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Wu P.W. Li J. Kodangattil S.R. Luxenberg D.P. Bennett F. Martino M. Collins M. Dunussi-Joannopoulos K. Gill D.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 35088-35096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is assumed for class II cytokines that receptor binding and activation are sequential processes where the cytokine binds the first receptor chain enabling the cytokine/receptor chain complex to bind the second subunit eventually leading to activation of signaling. According to this model, mutations affecting the binding to the second receptor chain should result in a lower efficacy as well as an increase in EC50 values. Mutation of Gln-100 resulted in a significant reduction of the efficacy as well as an increased EC50 value. Mutation of the neighboring residues, Arg-34 and Val-97, also resulted in decreased efficacy, albeit less significant. Thus we suggest that the IL-10R2 receptor chain contacts IFN-λ3 in the vicinity of Gln-100, with the interface of the IFN-λR1 and IL-10R2 binding sites located along helix A. In principle, the mutations that we introduced in IFN-λ3 could interfere either with receptor binding or with the subsequent activation of the receptor complex or possibly with both. We investigated the STAT2 phosphorylation induced by both wild-type IFN-λ3 and selected mutants assumed to be involved in interactions with the IFN-λR1. In doing so, we chose to use concentrations that induced similar levels of antiviral protection (EC80 concentrations). This experiment revealed a dose response for STAT2 phosphorylation similar to that seen for the antiviral effect for wild-type IFN-λ3.Furthermore, the levels of STAT2 activation were similar for different mutants at the same level of antiviral activity, demonstrating a direct correlation between the STAT2 phosphorylation and antiviral activity. Thus, it appears unlikely that these mutations have impaired the ability of the cytokine·receptor complex to signal. The STAT2 phosphorylation data rather support the sequential model mentioned above, where weakened interaction between IFN-λ3 and IFN-λR1 by site-directed mutagenesis leads to a lower affinity but identical signaling at saturating concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2066746047,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenously expressed 18-25-nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational repression by binding to a target mRNA. Recently, it was indicated that miRs act as key regulators in cell differentiation, cell growth, and cell death. In osteogenesis, several miRs (for example miR-26a, -125b, -133, and -135) regulate osteoblast cell growth or differentiation in human adipose tissue-derived stem cells, mouse mesenchymal ST2 stem cells, and mouse premyogenic C2C12 cells. Additionally, Smad proteins control Drosha-mediated miR maturation. Therefore, miRs are closely related to osteogenesis. Here we investigated miR expression profile by an miR array and identified the candidate miRs, miR-141 and -200a, as pre-osteoblast differentiation-related miRs. The effects of miR-141 and -200a on pre-osteoblast differentiation were examined by using transfection of murine pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells with mature miR-141 or -200a and antisense inhibitor for miR-141 or -200a. It was shown that miR-141 and -200a remarkably modulated the BMP-2-induced pre-osteoblast differentiation through the translational repression of Dlx5, which is a bone-generating transcription factor expressed in pre-osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, it was indicated that Dlx5 is a common target of miR-141 and -200a by using a luciferase reporter assay. Thus, we have observed for the first time that miR-141 and -200a are involved in pre-osteoblast differentiation in part by regulating the expression of Dlx5."
https://openalex.org/W2008166029,"Clamp loaders load sliding clamps onto primer-template DNA. The structure of the E. coli clamp loader bound to DNA reveals the formation of an ATP-dependent spiral of ATPase domains that tracks only the template strand, allowing recognition of both RNA and DNA primers. Unlike hexameric helicases, in which DNA translocation requires distinct conformations of the ATPase domains, the clamp loader spiral is symmetric and is set up to trigger release upon DNA recognition. Specificity for primed DNA arises from blockage of the end of the primer and accommodation of the emerging template along a surface groove. A related structure reveals how the psi protein, essential for coupling the clamp loader to single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), binds to the clamp loader. By stabilizing a conformation of the clamp loader that is consistent with the ATPase spiral observed upon DNA binding, psi binding promotes the clamp-loading activity of the complex."

More than 150 million individuals are infected with the filarial worms responsible for lymphatic filariasis (LF) 4The abbreviations used are: LFlymphatic filariasisTLR2/6Toll-like receptors 2 and 6PALpeptidoglycan-associated lipoproteinpsiplasmids encoding small interfering RNATNFtumor necrosis factorBMFEB. malayi female worm extractBMFEtetWolbachia-depleted extract following tetracycline treatmentLPSlipopolysaccharidePBSphosphate-buffered salineAF488Alexa Fluor 488HMVECdlyhuman adult, dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cellsILinterleukinDCdendritic cellFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIFNinterferonwBmPALB. malayi Wolbachia PALDiacyl WoLPDiacyl Wolbachia lipopeptideBmDCbone marrow-derived DCWSPWolbachia surface proteinVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorMFImedian fluorescent intensityAPCallophycocyaninOVAovalbumin. 4The abbreviations used are: LFlymphatic filariasisTLR2/6Toll-like receptors 2 and 6PALpeptidoglycan-associated lipoproteinpsiplasmids encoding small interfering RNATNFtumor necrosis factorBMFEB. malayi female worm extractBMFEtetWolbachia-depleted extract following tetracycline treatmentLPSlipopolysaccharidePBSphosphate-buffered salineAF488Alexa Fluor 488HMVECdlyhuman adult, dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cellsILinterleukinDCdendritic cellFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateIFNinterferonwBmPALB. malayi Wolbachia PALDiacyl WoLPDiacyl Wolbachia lipopeptideBmDCbone marrow-derived DCWSPWolbachia surface proteinVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorMFImedian fluorescent intensityAPCallophycocyaninOVAovalbumin.

Over 40 million suffer from disfiguring and incapacitating disease with an estimated 1.5 billion people at risk of infection, ranking filariasis as one of the major causes of global morbidity (1Molyneux D.H.

A feature of filarial pathogenesis is a host inflammatory response provoked by the death of larvae and adult stages within parasitized tissues (2Dreyer G. Norões J. Figueredo-Silva J. Piessens W.F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All causative agents of LF and O. volvulus harbor an intracellular symbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia, and are reliant on this endosymbiont for embryogenesis, growth, and survival (3Taylor M.J. Bandi C. Hoerauf A. Adv. Parasitol. 2005; 60: 245-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Previous studies have determined that the inflammatory potential of B. malayi and O. volvulus is dependent on the presence of Wolbachia. For example, Wolbachia-containing filarial extracts induce activation and tolerance in murine macrophages (4Taylor M.J. Cross H.F. Bilo K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Turner J.D. Langley R.S. Johnston K.L. Egerton G. Wanji S. Taylor M.J. J.

Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and activate human and murine neutrophils (7Brattig N.W. Büttner D.W. Hoerauf A. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Gillette-Ferguson I. Hise A.G. McGarry H.F. Turner J. Esposito A. Sun Y. Diaconu E. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5687-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, O. volvulus and B. malayi extracts containing Wolbachia stimulate neutrophil recruitment to the corneal stroma and development of corneal haze in a murine model of ocular onchocerciasis, in contrast with an aposymbiotic filaria (9Saint André A. Blackwell N.M. Hall L.R. Hoerauf A. Brattig N.W. Volkmann L. Taylor M.J. Ford L. Hise A.G. Lass J.H. Diaconu E. Pearlman E. Science. 2002; 295: 1892-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Moreover, isolated Wolbachia from filaria or from insect cells can replicate these effects (8Gillette-Ferguson I. Hise A.G. McGarry H.F. Turner J. Esposito A. Sun Y. Diaconu E. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5687-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Gillette-Ferguson I. Hise A.G. Sun Y. Diaconu E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2442-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activation of neutrophils results in further neutrophil recruitment leading to the disruption of normal corneal clarity and development of stromal haze (11Gillette-Ferguson I. Daehnel K. Hise A.G. Sun Y. Carlson E. Diaconu E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5908-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activation and subsequent desensitization of macrophages by Wolbachia molecules has been shown to be dependent on TLR2 and the adaptor molecule MyD88 (5Turner J.D. Langley R.S. Johnston K.L. Egerton G. Wanji S. Taylor M.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Gillette-Ferguson I. Hise A.G. Sun Y. Diaconu E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2442-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further studies have established that Wolbachia-induced inflammation is dependent on TLR2 and TLR6 recognition and signaling through the MyD88/Mal pathway and are independent of TRIF and TRAM (12Hise A.G. Daehnel K. Gillette-Ferguson I. Cho E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Golenbock D.T. Fitzgerald K.A. Kazura J.W. Pearlman E. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, Wolbachia ligands for TLR2/TLR6 have not been characterized. To address this, we used the TLR receptor recognition profile to identify TLR2/6 ligands in the Wolbachia genome. In this study, we demonstrate that Wolbachia-derived diacyl-lipoproteins are candidate stimulatory molecules required for TLR2/6 ligation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses. Furthermore, we show that a synthetic Wolbachia lipopeptide (Diacyl WoLP) induces TLR2/6-dependent corneal inflammation, and TLR2-dependent TNFα responses in filarial disease models and up-regulates surface markers of human lymphatic endothelium. Diacyl WoLP also induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and generated type 1 CD4+ T cell and antibody responses to filarial antigens. B. malayi adults were isolated from Mongolian jirds (TRS Labs, Atlanta, GA). For Wolbachia-depleted B. malayi, jirds were treated with 2.5 mg/ml tetracycline in drinking water for 6 weeks before parasite isolation. B. malayi female worms were processed for soluble extracts (B. malayi female extract (BMFE)) as described previously (5Turner J.D. Langley R.S. Johnston K.L. Egerton G. Wanji S. Taylor M.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Trace endotoxin and mycoplasma contaminants in BMFE were measured by the European Endotoxin Testing Service (colorimetric Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay) and MycoAlert assay, respectively (Cambrex). Only extracts with <5 pg of LPS/100 μg of BMFE and negative for mycoplasma were used. Ultra-pure LPS, PAM3CSK4, FSL-1 (Autogen BioClear), and rTNFα (R&D Systems) were used at the doses stated. Synthetic 20-mers of the N-terminal region of wBmPAL (CSKRGVNAINKMNFVVKQMK), di-(Diacyl WoLP) or tri-palmitoylated (Triacyl WoLP) at the N-terminal cysteine residue were synthesized by EMC Microcollections (Tubingen, Germany). Diacyl WoLP was labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 carboxylic acid, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester (Molecular Probes, UK) using the method outlined in Vasselon et al. (13Vasselon T. Detmers P.A. Charron D. Haziot A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7401-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and excess dye was removed using dye removal columns following the manufacturer舗s instructions (Thermo Scientific, UK). OVA peptide 323-ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR-339 was provided by Dr. E. Bell (Manchester University, UK) and used at 10 nm. HEK293-CD14, HEK293-CD14+TLR2, and HEK293-CD14+TLR4 transfectants were a gift from Prof. M. Yazdanbakhsh, Leiden University, Netherlands. HEK293-TLR2 transfectants and HEK293 parental cell lines were purchased from Invivogen, UK. For transfections, HEK293-TLR2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TLR1- or TLR6-specific shRNA under the control of 7SK RNA polymerase III promoter (Autogen BioClear) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For binding assays, HEK293-TLR2 or HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, trypsinized to a single cell suspension, and seeded onto coverslips at 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were incubated for 24 h, washed 3× in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) and incubated with 5 μg/ml Diacyl WoLP:AF488 or equivalent volume PBS:AF488 for 30 min at room temperature before being washed 3× and mounted for confocal microscopy. For flow cytometric quantification, 1 × 105 aliquots of cells were washed 3× in binding buffer before being exposed to 5 μg/ml Diacyl WoLP:AF488 or negative control for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Human adult, dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECdly, Cambrex) were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. 1 × 106 THP-1 cells (human monocytic cell line) were stimulated with 200 μg/ml BMFE or BMFEtet or 10 μg/ml Diacyl WoLP for 24 h. Supernatants were harvested and added to HMVECdly at a 1:3 dilution. TNFα (100 ng/ml) and IL-1β (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) were used as a positive control. C57BL/6 MyD88−/−, TLR1−/−, TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR6−/− mice were maintained at the University of Liverpool. WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan UK. Corneal experiments on TLR1−/−, TLR2−/−, and TLR6−/− mice were carried out at Case Western Reserve University; C57BL/6 mice were from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). MyD88−/−, TLR1−/−, TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR6−/− mice were a gift from Prof. S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan). DO11.10 transgenic mice (a gift from Dr. E. Bell, Manchester University, UK) were maintained at Manchester University. Peritoneal macrophages from mice were elicited by 1-ml intraperitoneal injection of sterile 2% thioglycolate solution (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow using a modified version of Inabi et al. (14Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar), developed by Jiang et al. (15Jiang H.R. Gilham D.E. Mulryan K. Kirillova N. Hawkins R.E. Stern P.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4288-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After 6 days of culture and isolation, the resulting yield was typically 90–95% MHCII+/CD11c+. DCs were seeded into 48-well plates at 1 × 106/ml and stimulated for 18 h. For in vivo inflammatory responses, mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 50 μg of Diacyl WoLP and terminated 3–24 h post-inoculation. Terminal bleeds were taken by cardiac puncture into heparin-coated syringes. Plasma was fractionated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Splenic supernatants were generated by digestion of splenic tissue within RPMI containing 1 mg of collagenase D (Roche Applied Science) followed by mashing through 70-μm gauze and harvesting of supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. For antibody experiments mice were inoculated with 50 μg of BMFE or BMFEtet at day 0 and day 7. Tail veins were bled into heparin-coated tubes at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 days post inoculation, and mice were terminally bled at day 25. Murine CD4+ lymphocytes or CD11c+ DCs were isolated from splenic cell suspensions using positive selection magnetic-associated cell sorting (Miltenyi Bio-tec). For DC-CD4+ co-culture, DCs were washed, γ-irradiated (1500 rads), and cultured with T cells at a ratio of 1:10 in 10% fetal calf serum RPMI. For proliferation assays, cells were seeded in triplicate into 96-well plates at 106/ml in 200 μl. Cells were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 72 h before being pulsed for 8 h with [3H]thymidine (MBP Biochemicals). Cells were harvested, and 3H incorporation was ascertained by liquid scintillation. For cytokine measurements, cells were seeded into 48-well plates in triplicate at 2 × 106/ml in 1 ml, and supernatant was harvested after 96 h with mitogen (1 μg/ml ionomycin and 0.1 μg/ml phorbol myristate acetate) added for the final 24 h. Experimental procedures were reviewed and approved for Liverpool by the Home Office (London, UK), and for the corneal keratitis model by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface receptor staining were: rat anti-mouse MHCII-PE (clone M5/114.15.2), CD11c-APC (clone N418), CD40-FITC (clone HM40-3), CD80-PE (clone 16-10A1), and CD86-PE/FITC (clone P03.1/GL1) with appropriate isotype controls (eBioscience). Antibody staining was undertaken as previously described (5Turner J.D. Langley R.S. Johnston K.L. Egerton G. Wanji S. Taylor M.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Podoplanin (gp38) surface expression was measured using APC-conjugated mouse-anti-human podoplanin (clone 18H5, Acris GmbH, Germany). Data acquisition was performed on a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with WinMDI v2.8. Murine IL-4, IFNγ (R&D Systems), IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-12p70, IL-23p19/p40 (eBioscience), TNF-α (BioSource), and human IL-8 (BioSource) were determined using matched antibody pair enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of BMFE-specific IgG1 and IgG2c were determined using Mouse IgG1 and IgG2c enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification kits (Bethyl) using BMFE (3 μg/ml) as antigen. BMFE was diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, heated to 96 °C for 10 min, and 5 μg was loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and run under reducing conditions in a 1× Tris/glycine running buffer at 50 mA. Proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm pore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blocked with TBS SuperBlock (Pierce) with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h, and incubated overnight with anti-rwBmPAL antibody diluted with 0.1× SuperBlock at 4 °C. Antibody binding was detected by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence. wBmPAL without the signal sequence was PCR amplified from genomic DNA isolated from B. malayi using primers WoLP-HindIII 5′-AAG CTT TGC TCA AAA AGA GGA-3′ and WoLP-BamHI 5′-GGATCC CTA GCT ATA GTT GAA AAA-3′ with incorporated restriction sites. The product was cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector and TOP 10 cells using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Following excision using HindIII and BamHI digestion, the product was ligated into the expression vector pJC40 and the ligation mix was used to transform TOP 10 cells. Following plasmid purification (QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, Qiagen) and verification by restriction digestion and sequencing, the expression vector was transformed into competent Escherichia coli DE3 cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant (r)wBmPAL was purified using ProBond His-tag resin (Invitrogen) and electro-elution (Bio-Rad). Expression and purification of rwBmPAL was monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Antibodies to rwBmPAL were produced in a NZW rabbit by subcutaneous injection of 100 μg of antigen in FreunD舗s complete adjuvant (first immunization) or FreunD舗s incomplete adjuvant (subsequent immunizations). Three inoculations were administered 3 weeks apart and serum-harvested 7 days following the final boost. Anti-rwBmPAL antibodies were affinity-purified using HiTrap Protein A and NHS columns (Amersham Biosciences). Human onchocercoma sections and B. malayi adult females were stained using the affinity-purified anti-rwBmPAL antibody. Reactivity was detected using an EnVision G 2 system/Alkaline phosphatase kit with a permanent red chromogenic substrate system (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence, cytospin preparations of C6/36 cells (an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line) infected with Wolbachia pipientis (5Turner J.D. Langley R.S. Johnston K.L. Egerton G. Wanji S. Taylor M.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Wolbachia-free C6/36 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and then stained with anti-rwBmPAL antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibody reactivity was detected with a goat anti-rabbit FITC-labeled (Invitrogen) secondary antibody. Cells were counterstained with Evans Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). The mouse model of ocular onchocerciasis has been described previously (8Gillette-Ferguson I. Hise A.G. McGarry H.F. Turner J. Esposito A. Sun Y. Diaconu E. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5687-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized prior to corneal scarification using a 26-gauge needle. 2 μl of Diacyl WoLP was injected into the corneal stroma using a 30-gauge Hamilton syringe. Neutrophil quantification in the cornea by flow cytometry and in vivo confocal microscopy analysis of corneal stromal haze was evaluated as described previously (11Gillette-Ferguson I. Daehnel K. Hise A.G. Sun Y. Carlson E. Diaconu E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Pearlman E. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5908-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mice were treated in accordance with regulations of Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. In instances where raw data or Log10 transformation of raw data (where indicated) approximated to a normal distribution pattern, differences between two groups were examined by Student舗s t test, and differences between three or more groups were examined by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post-hoc tests. In instances where data were skewed, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney tests) were used (non-parametric analysis indicated when used). All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v4.0. Several distinct molecular patterns ligate TLR2 and activate the MyD88-dependent pathway (16Kirschning C.J. Schumann R.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6, which confers specificity for recognition of microbial lipoproteins, with TLR2/TLR6 recognizing diacylated lipoprotein, and TLR2/TLR1 conferring specificity for triacylated lipoprotein (17Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Mühlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 18Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Using knock-out mice, we reported that, in addition to TLR2, macrophage activation by Wolbachia is also dependent on TLR6 (12Hise A.G. Daehnel K. Gillette-Ferguson I. Cho E. McGarry H.F. Taylor M.J. Golenbock D.T. Fitzgerald K.A. Kazura J.W. Pearlman E. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of TLR1 was not assessed. To determine if there is a role for TLR1 in the recognition of Wolbachia, we used small interference RNA knockdown of constitutive TLR1 or TLR6 expression in HEK-TLR2 cells. Suppression of TLR1 or TLR6 expression was confirmed by a >80% knockdown of IL-8 responsiveness to control triacylated PAM3CSK4 or diacylated FSL-1 lipopeptide, respectively (Fig. 1A). In TLR1-suppressed HEK-TLR2 cells, responsiveness to BMFE was reduced by 30% of control cells, whereas in TLR6-suppressed HEK-TLR2 cells, responsiveness to BMFE was reduced by 70% (Fig. 1A). As a second approach to examine the relative contribution of TLR1 and TLR6, we used peritoneal macrophages from TLR1−/− and TLR6−/− mice. BMFE induced a dose response from C57/BL6 wild-type (WT) cells, which was partially dependent on TLR1 only at the higher concentrations (200 μg/ml p < 0.001, 400 μg/ml, p < 0.001) but completely dependent on TLR6 at all concentrations tested (Fig. 1B). Thus, although TLR6 is essential for Wolbachia recognition, TLR1 has only a minor contribution to the activation of MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory responses induced by BMFE. To determine if TLR2/6 ligands of Wolbachia are lipoproteins, we treated the filarial extracts with CleanasciteTM, which selectively removes lipids and lipoproteins, or with BindProTM, a polymeric protein removal suspension reagent (Biotech Support Group). Both treatments completely ablated (to background levels) HEK-TLR2 cell IL-8 reporter gene activity to BMFE (Fig. 1C) thereby showing that the TLR2/6 activity depends on both lipid and protein moieties. Using the annotated B. malayi Wolbachia (wBm) genome (19Foster J. Ganatra M. Kamal I. Ware J. Makarova K. Ivanova N. Bhattacharyya A. Kapatral V. Kumar S. Posfai J. Vincze T. Ingram J. Moran L. Lapidus A. Omelchenko M. Kyrpides N. Ghedin E. Wang S. Goltsman E. Joukov V. Ostrovskaya O. Tsukerman K. Mazur M. Comb D. Koonin E. Slatko B. PLoS. Biol. 2005; 3: e121Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), we identified the lipoprotein biosynthesis-encoding genes: Ltg, prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase and LspA, lipoprotein signal peptidase. Importantly, in contrast to most other bacterial genomes, Lnt, apolipoprotein aminoacyl transferase gene, the enzyme responsible for acylation of the N terminus amide group was absent from the wBm genome (supplemental information). This suggests that Wolbachia proteins can be diacylated, but not triacylated, which is consistent with the predominant recognition of Wolbachia by TLR2/6. Putative candidate Wolbachia lipoproteins (WoLP) from the wBm genome were identified using three bioinformatic sources; the Data base of Lipoproteins, Lipo, and LipoP programs, which select lipoproteins using the predicted features of an N terminus lipobox and lipoprotein signal peptides (supplemental information). Only two proteins, 1) peptidoglycan-associated protein, PAL-like: YP197985, and 2) VirB6 component-like, putative type IV secretion system protein: YP198624, were predicted by all three programs and had predicted lipoprotein analogues in Drosophila melanogaster Wolbachia (wMel). A third protein, small protein A (smpA/omlA): YP198099 was predicted by both Data base of Lipoproteins and Lipo but not LipoP. Lipo uniquely predicted two proteins YP198553 and YP198182 without supporting orthologues in wMel. LipoP predicted a further six lipoproteins, four with supporting orthologues in the wMel genome. Further analysis of a fourth protein predicted exclusively by Data base of Lipoproteins, an uncharacterized protein involved in an early stage of isoprenoid biosynthesis YP197882, revealed that this predicted protein has an orthologue in wMel, both of which are most similar to enhancing lycopene biosynthesis protein 2. It lacks both a signal peptide (signalP) and a trans-membrane domain (TMHMM), and it was not predicted as a lipoprotein by either Lipo or LipoP programs. All of this evidence suggests it is not a lipoprotein and is a mis-annotation. Together these bioinformatic databases and predictive programs identified a total of eleven potential lipoproteins in the wBm genome. Of the two lipoproteins identified by all bioinformatic programs, we selected the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) for further characterization based on its predicted outer membrane location. In addition, triacylated Escherichia coli PAL is a potent TLR2 ligand capable of inducing septic shock and also displays synergistic inflammatory properties with LPS (20Liang M.D. Bagchi A. Warren H.S. Tehan M.M. Trigilio J.A. Beasley-Topliffe L.K. Tesini B.L. Lazzaroni J.C. Fenton M.J. Hellman J. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). B. malayi Wolbachia PAL (wBmPAL) consists of 159 amino acid residues with a typical lipobox and lipoprotein signal peptide (supplemental information). We cloned, expressed, purified, and raised rabbit polyclonal anti-sera against recombinant (r)wBmPAL. IgG was purified and used for Western blot analysis. An 18-kDa band was consistently reactive to anti-rwBmPAL in BMFE containing Wolbachia, but not in Wolbachia-depleted B. malayi-soluble extracts (BMFEtet) (Fig. 2A), indicating the presence and Wolbachia specificity of wBmPAL in TLR2/6-reactive BMFE. Anti-rwBmPAL antibodies also identified Wolbachia in the mosquito A. albopictus Wolbachia infected C6/36 cell line and in O. volvulus and B. malayi adult worms (Fig. 2B). Synthetic analogues of the wBmPAL N-terminal 20 amino acids, either diacylated (PAM2-CSKRGVNAINKMNFVVKQMK; Diacyl WoLP) or triacylated (PAM3-CSKRGVNAINKMNFVVKQMK; Triacyl WoLP) at the terminal cysteine residue, were generated in preference to the use of E. coli expression systems (which would result in triacylation) and to avoid the potential for E. coli-derived TLR ligand contaminants, including lipoprotein and LPS.

https://openalex.org/W2035523485,"Methionine oxidation leads to the formation of S- and R-diastereomers of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), which are reduced back to methionine by methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) A and B, respectively. MSRBs are classified in two groups depending on the conservation of one or two redox-active Cys; 2-Cys MSRBs possess a catalytic Cys-reducing MetSO and a resolving Cys, allowing regeneration by thioredoxins. The second type, 1-Cys MSRBs, possess only the catalytic Cys. The biochemical mechanisms involved in activity regeneration of 1-Cys MSRBs remain largely elusive. In the present work we used recombinant plastidial Arabidopsis thaliana MSRB1 and MSRB2 as models for 1-Cys and 2-Cys MSRBs, respectively, to delineate the Trx- and glutaredoxin-dependent reduction mechanisms. Activity assays carried out using a series of cysteine mutants and various reductants combined with measurements of free thiols under distinct oxidation conditions and mass spectrometry experiments show that the 2-Cys MSRB2 is reduced by Trx through a dithiol-disulfide exchange involving both redox-active Cys of the two partners. Regarding 1-Cys MSRB1, oxidation of the enzyme after substrate reduction leads to the formation of a stable sulfenic acid on the catalytic Cys, which is subsequently glutathionylated. The deglutathionylation of MSRB1 is achieved by both mono- and dithiol glutaredoxins and involves only their N-terminal conserved catalytic Cys. This study proposes a detailed mechanism of the regeneration of 1-Cys MSRB activity by glutaredoxins, which likely constitute physiological reductants for this type of MSR. Methionine oxidation leads to the formation of S- and R-diastereomers of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), which are reduced back to methionine by methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) A and B, respectively. MSRBs are classified in two groups depending on the conservation of one or two redox-active Cys; 2-Cys MSRBs possess a catalytic Cys-reducing MetSO and a resolving Cys, allowing regeneration by thioredoxins. The second type, 1-Cys MSRBs, possess only the catalytic Cys. The biochemical mechanisms involved in activity regeneration of 1-Cys MSRBs remain largely elusive. In the present work we used recombinant plastidial Arabidopsis thaliana MSRB1 and MSRB2 as models for 1-Cys and 2-Cys MSRBs, respectively, to delineate the Trx- and glutaredoxin-dependent reduction mechanisms. Activity assays carried out using a series of cysteine mutants and various reductants combined with measurements of free thiols under distinct oxidation conditions and mass spectrometry experiments show that the 2-Cys MSRB2 is reduced by Trx through a dithiol-disulfide exchange involving both redox-active Cys of the two partners. Regarding 1-Cys MSRB1, oxidation of the enzyme after substrate reduction leads to the formation of a stable sulfenic acid on the catalytic Cys, which is subsequently glutathionylated. The deglutathionylation of MSRB1 is achieved by both mono- and dithiol glutaredoxins and involves only their N-terminal conserved catalytic Cys. This study proposes a detailed mechanism of the regeneration of 1-Cys MSRB activity by glutaredoxins, which likely constitute physiological reductants for this type of MSR. Proteins are prone to oxidative modifications due to the action of reactive oxygen species. Methionine (Met), one of the most susceptible amino acids to oxidation (1.Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs), which catalyze the reduction of MetSO back to Met, are present in most living organisms. MSRA, the first MSR isolated (2.Brot N. Weissbach L. Werth J. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 2155-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), is specific of the MetSO S-diastereomer and participates in protection against oxidative stress (3.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A second MSR type, MSRB, which catalytically reduces the MetSO R-diastereomer, was identified later (4.Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C. Derrick P.J. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48915-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). MSRA and MSRB are monomeric enzymes that display no sequence or structural homologies but share a similar three-step catalytic mechanism, (i) reduction of MetSO by MSR and formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on the “catalytic” cysteine (Cys), (ii) formation of a disulfide bond between catalytic and “resolving” Cys and release of H2O, and (iii) reduction of the disulfide bond by a reductant (5.Olry A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 2155-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7.Kumar R.A. Koc A. Cerny R.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

They function as electron donors and play essential roles in many processes through control of protein conformation and activity by supplying the reducing power needed to reduce disulfide bonds in target proteins. methionine sulfoxide methionine sulfoxide reductases thioredoxin glutaredoxin reduced glutathione reduced dithiothreitol reduced dithioerythritol 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride peroxiredoxins wild type high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. methionine sulfoxide methionine sulfoxide reductases thioredoxin glutaredoxin reduced glutathione reduced dithiothreitol reduced dithioerythritol 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride peroxiredoxins wild type high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Most MSRBs, named 2-Cys MSRBs, possess two conserved Cys and are actually reduced by Trxs (7.Kumar R.A. Koc A. Cerny R.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37527-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8.Tarrago L. Laugier E. Rey P. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 202-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, in a second class of MSRBs, termed 1-Cys MSRBs and representing ∼40% of known MSRBs, the resolving Cys residue corresponding to Cys-63 in Escherichia coli is replaced by Thr or Ser (8.Tarrago L. Laugier E. Rey P. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 202-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9.Neiers F. Kriznik A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42462-42468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although some of these MSRBs possess another potential resolving Cys (9.Neiers F. Kriznik A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42462-42468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), most 1-Cys MSRBs do not have any additional Cys, indicating that an alternative mechanism, which does not involve the formation of an intramolecular disulfide reduction, is needed for their regeneration (7.Kumar R.A. Koc A. Cerny R.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37527-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Contrasting data concerning the role of Trxs in providing electrons to these MSRBs have been reported. Several studies showed that cytosolic Trx is not an efficient reductant for human 1-Cys MSRBs (10.Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11.Sagher D.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that regeneration of mammalian and plant 1-Cys MSRBs could involve direct reduction of the cysteine sulfenic acid form generated during catalysis (10.Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N.

Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana possesses two plastidial MSRBs referred to as MSRB1 and MSRB2 and related to 1-Cys and 2-Cys MSRB types, respectively. MSRB2 possesses two CXXC motifs potentially implicated in the coordination of a zinc atom, a Cys in position 187 corresponding to the catalytic Cys-117 of E. coli MSRB, a potential resolving Cys in position 134, and an additional Cys in position 115. MSRB1 also contains the four Cys residues potentially coordinating zinc, the potential catalytic Cys-186, and a Cys in position 116, whereas the potential resolving Cys is replaced by a Thr in position 132. Previously, we showed that various types of canonical Trxs are efficient electron suppliers to MSRB2, whereas MSRB1 can only be reduced by the peculiar Trx CDSP32 (chloroplastic drought-induced stress protein of 32 kDa) and by Grxs (15.Vieira Dos Santos C.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Grxs are oxidoreductases of the Trx superfamily possessing either a monothiol CXXS or a dithiol CXXC active site and are generally reduced by glutathione (18.Rouhier N. Lemaire S.D. Jacquot J.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Grxs are able to reduce protein disulfides, but also glutathione-mixed disulfides, a reaction termed deglutathionylation, for which Trxs are not efficient catalysts (19.Jung C.H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Zaffagnini M. Michelet L. Massot V. Trost P. Lemaire S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8868-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Classical dithiol Grxs can reduce disulfide bonds using both active site Cys residues, as shown for E. coli ribonucleotide reductase, but can also reduce glutathione-mixed disulfides through a monothiol mechanism that requires only the N-terminal active site Cys (21.Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). CXXS-type Grxs catalyze deglutathionylation either through a monothiol mechanism, as recently shown for chloroplastic GrxS12 (CSYS active site) (22.Couturier J. Koh C.S. Zaffagnini M. Winger A.M. Gualberto J.M. Corbier C. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.P. Lemaire S.D. Didierjean C. Rouhier N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9299-9310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or through a dithiol mechanism as suggested for Grxs with a CGFS active site (20.Zaffagnini M. Michelet L. Massot V. Trost P. Lemaire S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8868-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23.Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We reported recently the involvement of Grxs in the regeneration of MSRB activity (15.Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise biochemical mechanism underlying regeneration by Grxs remains unknown. In this study we performed a detailed analysis of the roles of redox-active Cys in reductants (Trxs and Grxs) and in acceptors (plastidial Arabidopsis MSRBs). We provide evidence that reduction of MSRB2 by Trxs is achieved through a classical dithiol-disulfide exchange. The data on MSRB1 reveal that 1-Cys MSRBs are regenerated by Grxs through a glutathionylation step of the catalytic Cys. Nucleotide substitutions at specific positions in MSRB1 and MSRB2 were performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) carrying the coding sequence of MSRB2 (17.Vieira Dos Santos C. Cuiné S. Rouhier N. Rey P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used as a template for mutagenic PCR. The MSRB1 coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI and PstI restriction sites of the pQE-30 expression vector and used to generate mutated forms. Primers for site-directed mutagenesis contained a modified restriction enzyme site allowing screening (supplemental Table 1). Arabidopsis NADPH thioredoxin reductase B, wild-type (WT), and mutated forms of poplar Trx h1, GrxC4, and GrxS12 were purified as described (22.Couturier J. Koh C.S. Zaffagnini M. Winger A.M.

Recombinant WT and mutant forms of MSRB1 and MSRB2 proteins fused to an N-terminal His6 tag were produced in M15rep4 E. coli strains and purified as previously described (15.Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After elution, proteins were desalted in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using HiTrapTM desalting column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were reduced using 10 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature, and excess DTT was removed by desalting using IllustraTM NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare) in the same buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BC Assay Reagent, Interchim, Montluçon, France) or spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 26,930 m−1·cm−1 for WT MSRB1, C116S MSRB1, T132A MSRB1, T132C MSRB1, and C189S MSRB1 and of 16,960 m−1·cm−1 for WT MSRB2 and C134T MSRB2. Protein purity was verified using SDS-PAGE gels stained with ImperialTM Protein Stain (Pierce). The activity of recombinant MSRB proteins was determined by monitoring reduction of the synthetic substrate, dabsyl-MetSO, in the presence or absence of 20 mm DTE or Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) using a method modified from Ref. 15.Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. Dabsyl-Met and dabsyl-MetSO were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 reverse phase column, SunFireTM 3.5 μm, 3.0 × 50 mm (Waters, Milford, MA) and 29 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.16, and acetonitrile as solvents. Km for substrate (KDabsyl-MetSO) was determined using substrate concentrations ranging from 7.8 μm to 1 mm and nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot 10.0, Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Alternatively, the MSRB activity was measured after NADPH oxidation at 340 nm in the presence of a Trx-reducing system (either 200 or 400 μm NADPH, 2 μm Arabidopsis NADPH thioredoxin reductase B, and a saturating concentration of poplar Trx h1 or C42S Trx h1 (40–100 μm)) or of a Grx-reducing system (400 μm NADPH, 0.5 unit yeast glutathione reductase (Sigma), 10 mm GSH, and 0.13 to 50 μm Grx) using a saturating concentration of N-acetyl-MetSO (2 mm) and 1–6 μm MSRB. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C in a 500-μl reaction volume. MSRB activity was calculated from the slope due to NADPH consumption after subtracting the background activity in the absence of enzyme, considering that 1 mol of oxidized NADPH corresponds to 1 mol of Met formed. Free thiols were determined using the 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) procedure (28.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21373) Google Scholar). Pre-reduced proteins (20–50 μm) were incubated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence or not of 0.5 mm N-acetyl-MetSO. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, 100 μm DTNB was added, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured after 30 min of incubation in the dark. The free thiol content was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m−1.cm−1 for thiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. Recombinant Arabidopsis MSRB1 and MSRB2 were reduced using 10 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently subjected to desalting on NAP-5 columns equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. Pre-reduced proteins were treated for 15 min at room temperature with 2 mm N-acetyl-MetSO or for 30 min with 2 mm N-acetyl-MetSO and 2 mm GSH and subjected to desalting as described above. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses were performed before and after treatment in the presence of 10 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. Mass determination of MSRB1 and MSRB2 proteins was carried out on whole proteins or after tryptic digestion as described in Augusto et al. (29.Augusto L.A. Decottignies P. Synguelakis M. Nicaise M. Le Maréchal P. Chaby R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plastidial MSRBs mainly differ in the presence or absence of a potential resolving Cys. MSRB2 possesses a conserved Cys in position 134, whereas MSRB1 contains a Thr at the corresponding position 132. To investigate the consequences for activity of this substitution, we assayed the MetSO reduction activity of WT and mutated MSRBs using DTE as a chemical reductant, an HPLC-based method, and dabsylated MetSO as a substrate. We measured a turnover number (kcat) of 0.075 s−1 for MSRB1 (Table 1). The replacement of Thr-132 by an Ala or a Cys in MSRB1 led to 6- and 14-fold activity decreases, respectively, compared with that of the WT form. Using mutated C186S MSRB1, no activity was detected (data not shown), confirming that Cys-186 is the catalytic residue absolutely required for MetSO reduction. We also tested the activity of mutated MSRB1 in which Cys-116 was changed into Ser. This mutant form was still able to reduce substrate with a turnover number representing two-thirds that of the WT form (Table 1). This result indicates that Cys-116 is dispensable for MetSO reduction.TABLE 1Catalytic parameters of WT and mutated MSRBskcatStoichiometryKDabsyl-MetSO+DTE+TCEPs−1Mol of Met formed·mol of MSRB−1μmMSRB10.075 ± 0.0180.002 ± 0.0001.0 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.6C116S MSRB10.047 ± 0.0090.9 ± 0.17.9 ± 2.2T132A MSRB10.012 ± 0.0010.7 ± 0.1T132C MSRB10.005 ± 0.0000.9 ± 0.15.2 ± 1.1MSRB20.028 ± 0.0070.014 ± 0.0020.9 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.6C134T MSRB20.064 ± 0.0121.3 ± 0.118.1 ± 3.2 Open table in a new tab A turnover number of 0.028 s−1 was determined for MSRB2 (Table 1). This value, 3-fold lower than that of MSRB1, is in agreement with previous results (15.Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activity of mutated MSRB2, in which Cys-134 was replaced by a Thr, was higher than that of WT MSRB2 and in the same range of that recorded for MSRB1. A similar value was recorded for C134S MSRB2 (data not shown). To determine whether the different levels of activity observed for these proteins were due to alterations in substrate reduction or in regeneration of catalytic Cys by reductant, we carried out assays in the absence of DTE to calculate the stoichiometry of the reactions and the Km for dabsyl-MetSO (KDabsyl-MetSO) (Table 1). MSRB1 and MSRB2 possess comparable KDabsyl-MetSO for the substrate, in the range of 2 μm. For all WT and mutated MSRBs, an expected stoichiometry of nearly 1 mol of Met formed per mol of enzyme was measured. The T132C MSRB1 mutation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the KDabsyl-MetSO value compared with that of WT MSRB1. This indicates that the mutation does not significantly affect the capacity of MetSO reduction and suggests that the very low activity observed in the presence of DTE likely originates from a modification affecting the reduction of the catalytic Cys. With regard to C134T MSRB2, the KDabsyl-MetSO is 9-fold higher than that of WT MSRB2. Nevertheless, C134T MSRB2 exhibits a higher activity than the WT enzyme in the presence of DTE, suggesting that the mutation favors the regeneration of the catalytic Cys. These results demonstrate that MSRB1 and MSRB2 share a similar capacity of MetSO reduction and indicate that they very likely possess distinct features regarding the regeneration of their activity. To delineate the mechanisms of reduction of plastidial MSRBs, we assayed the capacity of TCEP, a specific non-thiol based reductant of disulfide bonds (30.Rüegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31.Getz E.B. Xiao M. Chakrabarty T. Cooke R. Selvin P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), to regenerate the activity of MSRBs (Table 1). A very low turnover number, representing only 3% that of the value measured in the presence of DTE, was recorded for MSRB1. This result reveals that TCEP is not an efficient reductant for MSRB1. In contrast, a kcat of 0.014 s−1 was recorded for MSRB2. This value corresponds to nearly 50% that of the activity determined using DTE and shows that TCEP regenerates MSRB2 activity. As TCEP specifically reduces disulfide bridges, these results argue for the formation of disulfide bond in MSRB2 but not in MSRB1. The free thiol content of pre-reduced WT and mutated MSRBs was then measured in the presence or absence of N-acetyl-MetSO under non-denaturing conditions to avoid titration of the four zinc-coordinating Cys (Table 2). Reduced MSRB1 was found to contain 2.4 thiols, consistent with the expected 2 free thiols, Cys-186 and Cys-116. After the addition of N-acetyl-MetSO, 1.6 thiols were measured, corresponding to a decrease of 0.8 free thiols (Table 2). These results are consistent with the oxidation of one single Cys, very likely Cys-186, to a sulfenic acid form. Note that the formation of an intermolecular disulfide can be excluded, as no MSRB1 dimer was observed after oxidation of WT or mutated forms, even in the presence of a large amount of diamide (data not shown). Thiol titration experiments were also achieved using T132C MSRB1. The reduced form of T132C MSRB1 contains about 3 thiols, likely corresponding to Cys-116, Cys-186, and the Cys replacing Thr in position 132 (Table 2). The decrease of ∼1 thiol after oxidation by substrate is consistent with the oxidation of only the catalytic Cys-186, with Cys-116 and Cys-132 still being free to react with DTNB. These data indicate that no disulfide bridge is formed in WT or mutated MSRB1.TABLE 2Free thiol content in WT and mutated MSRB proteins in the absence or presence of N-acetyl-MetSONumber of free CysNumber of free thiol measuredBefore N-acetyl-MetSO treatmentAfter N-acetyl-MetSO treatmentDecrease in free thiols (before to after)MSRB122.4 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1T132C MSRB133.3 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.1MSRB233.2 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.1C134T MSRB221.9 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab In the case of reduced MSRB2, 3.2 thiol groups were titrated, likely corresponding to the two redox-active Cys (Cys-134 and Cys-187) and the additional free Cys (Cys-115). On the other hand, only 1.3 thiols were titrated after incubation with substrate (Table 2). The calculated decrease of 1.9 units of free thiols is consistent with the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Reduced C134T MSRB2 was found to contain ∼2 thiols/mol. A decrease of 0.7 units of thiol was observed after incubation with N-acetyl-MetSO, likely due to oxidation of one unique Cys, Cys-187, to a sulfenic acid intermediate after reaction with substrate, with the Cys-115 still free to react with DTNB. Thiol titration carried out using C134S MSRB2 gave similar values (data not shown). Consistent with TCEP reduction assays, the thiol titration data led us to conclude that a disulfide bond is formed between Cys-134 and Cys-187 of MSRB2 after MetSO reduction. To determine the regeneration mechanism of MSRB2 by Trxs, we then monitored the activity of MSRB2 and C134T MSRB2 in the presence of a Trx-reducing system composed of NADPH, Arabidopsis NADPH thioredoxin reductase B, and poplar Trx h1. The replacement of the potential resolving Cys, Cys-134, by Thr allowed us to mimic the MSRB1 sequence. In this assay WT MSRB2 exhibited a turnover number of 1.28 s−1, whereas no significant consumption of NADPH was observed for C134T MSRB2, indicating that the mutation compromises MSRB recycling by Trx (Table 3). Similar results were obtained with a mutated MSRB2, in which Cys-134 was replaced by Ser (data not shown). These results are consistent with the absence of recycling by Trx previously reported for MSRB1, which naturally possess a Thr at the position corresponding to the resolving Cys-134 (15.Vieira Dos Santos C. Laugier E. Tarrago L. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Rouhier N. Rey P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the reduction mechanism, we assayed the capacity of C42S Trx h1, a mutant form lacking the second active site Cys, to supply reducing power to MSRB2. No activity was detected using this mutant, indicating that the resolving Cys-42 of Trx h1 is required for MSRB2 reduction (data not shown). Then, we tested whether T132C MSRB1 could be reduced by Trx h1. Despite the presence of Cys instead of Thr in position 132, corresponding to the potential resolving Cys of MSRB2, we observed that this mutated MSRB1 does not use canonical Trxs as electron donors (data not shown). This could be due to an inappropriate distance between the sulfhydryl group of the introduced Cys and the one of the catalytic Cys and/or to an orientation not compatible with the formation of a disulfide bond with the catalytic Cys.TABLE 3Turnover numbers of WT and mutated MSRBs using Trx h1, GrxC4, and GrxS12 as electron donorskcatTrx h1GrxC4GrxS12s−1MSRB1ND0.48 ± 0.020.58 ± 0.01C116S MSRB10.34 ± 0.120.50 ± 0.02T132A MSRB10.37 ± 0.060.31 ± 0.04T132C MSRB1NDNDNDMSRB21.28 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01C134T MSRB2ND0.30 ± 0.010.36 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab We investigated the capacity of Grxs to reduce WT and mutated MSRBs.

https://openalex.org/W2031420476,"Temperature compensation of circadian clocks is an unsolved problem with relevance to the general phenomenon of biological compensation. We identify casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a key regulator of temperature compensation of the Neurospora clock by determining that two long-standing clock mutants, chrono and period-3, displaying distinctive alterations in compensation encode the beta1 and alpha subunits of CK2, respectively. Reducing the dose of these subunits, particularly beta1, significantly alters temperature compensation without altering the enzyme's Q(10). By contrast, other kinases and phosphatases implicated in clock function do not play appreciable roles in temperature compensation. CK2 exerts its effects on the clock by directly phosphorylating FREQUENCY (FRQ), and this phosphorylation is compromised in CK2 hypomorphs. Finally, mutation of certain putative CK2 phosphosites on FRQ, shown to be phosphorylated in vivo, predictably alters temperature compensation profiles effectively phenocopying CK2 mutants."

However, high concentrations are typically required to induce these effects in vitro, raising questions concerning therapeutic relevance. We present evidence that endothelial cell sensitivity to statins depends upon shear stress. Using heme oxygenase-1 expression as a model, we demonstrate differential heme oxygenase-1 induction by atorvastatin in atheroresistant compared with atheroprone sites of the murine aorta. In vitro, exposure of human endothelial cells to laminar shear stress significantly reduced the statin concentration required to induce heme oxygenase-1 and protect against H2O2-mediated injury. Synergy was observed between laminar shear stress and atorvastatin, resulting in optimal expression of heme oxygenase-1 and resistance to oxidative stress, a response inhibited by heme oxygenase-1 small interfering RNA. Moreover, treatment of laminar shear stress-exposed endothelial cells resulted in a significant fall in intracellular cholesterol. Mechanistically, synergy required Akt phosphorylation, activation of Kruppel-like factor 2, NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), increased nitric-oxide synthase activity, and enhanced HO-1 mRNA stability. In contrast, heme oxygenase-1 induction by atorvastatin in endothelial cells exposed to oscillatory flow was markedly attenuated. We have identified a novel relationship between laminar shear stress and statins, demonstrating that atorvastatin-mediated heme oxygenase-1-dependent antioxidant effects are laminar shear stress-dependent, proving the principle that biomechanical signaling contributes significantly to endothelial responsiveness to pharmacological agents.

The efficacy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase antagonists (statins) in reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality is widely recognized (1.Jain M.K.

Judging from in vitro studies, these may include immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-adhesive, anti-thrombotic, and cytoprotective actions (6.Greenwood J. Mason J.C.

Expression of HO-1 in atherosclerotic lesions, and its ability to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic effects, suggests a protective role during atherogenesis (9.Wang L.J.

HMOX1 promoter polymorphisms affecting HO-1 expression may influence susceptibility to intimal hyperplasia and coronary artery disease, whereas a low serum bilirubin constitutes a cardiovascular risk factor (11.Exner M. Minar E. Wagner O. Schillinger M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of HO-1 inhibited atherogenesis, whereas Hmox1−/− mice bred onto an ApoE−/− background developed more extensive and complex atherosclerotic plaques (12.Juan S.H. Lee T.S.

Recent interest has focused on the therapeutic potential of HO-1 and its products, with probucol, statins, rapamycin, nitric oxide donors, and aspirin being shown to induce HO-1 (reviewed in Ref. 10.Stocker R.

However, induction of HO-1 in vascular EC in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Vascular endothelium exposed to unidirectional, pulsatile laminar shear stress (LSS) >10 dynes/cm2 is relatively protected against atherogenesis. LSS increases nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, prolongs EC survival, and generates an anticoagulant, anti-adhesive cell surface. In contrast, endothelium exposed to disturbed blood flow, with low shear reversing or oscillatory flow patterns, such as that located at arterial branch points and curvatures, is atheroprone. Thus endothelial cells exposed to disturbed blood flow exhibit reduced levels of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), increased apoptosis, oxidative stress, permeability to low density lipoprotein, and leukocyte adhesion (19.Berk B.C. Circulation. 2008; 117: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The atheroprotective influence of unidirectional LSS and the overlap between these actions and those of statins led us to hypothesize that LSS increases endothelial responsiveness to statins. We demonstrate for the first time that treatment of mice with atorvastatin induces HO-1 expression in the aortic endothelium and that this occurs preferentially at sites exposed to LSS. In vitro, pre-conditioning human EC with an atheroprotective, but not an atheroprone waveform, significantly reduces the concentration of atorvastatin required to enhance HO-1-mediated cytoprotection against oxidant-induced injury. A synergistic relationship between LSS and statins is revealed, resulting in maximal Akt phosphorylation and dependence upon eNOS, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), and NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) activation. Actinomycin D, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), paraformaldeyde, Triton X-100, trypan blue, and anti-α-tubulin antibody were from Sigma. Atorvastatin and simvastatin were from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) from Promega (Southampton, UK). NG-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), leptin from R&D Systems, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and anti-HO-1 antibodies were from Cambridge Bioscience (Cambridge, UK) and Stressgen (Victoria, BC). The nuclear extraction kit NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents were from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Nrf2 activation in EC nuclear extracts was analyzed using an Nrf2 TransAMTM assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) and human aortic EC (purchased from Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured as described (20.Mason J.C. Ahmed Z. Mankoff R. Lidington E.A. Ahmad S. Bhatia V. Kinderlerer A. Randi A.M. Haskard D.O. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The use of human EC was approved by Hammersmith Hospitals Research Ethics Committee (number 06/Q0406/21). Confluent EC monolayers (passage 3) on fibronectin-coated glass slides were exposed to control static conditions, high shear unidirectional laminar flow (12 dynes/cm2), or oscillatory flow (OF) with directional changes of flow at 1 Hz (± 5 dynes/cm2), for up to 48 h using a parallel-plate flow chamber (Cytodyne, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (21.Kinderlerer A.R.

To investigate synergy between LSS and statins, EC were exposed to static conditions or unidirectional LSS (12 dynes/cm2) for a total of 24 h. After 12 h, statin or vehicle control was added to the culture medium of static cells or to the medium in the flow apparatus via the injection port, whereas EC remained under conditions of continuous LSS. Cell viability was assessed by examination of EC monolayers using phase-contrast microscopy, cell counting, and estimation of trypan blue exclusion. Previously validated siRNA sequences targeting KLF2, HO-1, or scrambled control siRNA were transfected into HUVEC using oligofectamine-based transfection in endothelial basal medium 2 as described (18.Ali F.

The specificity of siRNA targeting was confirmed using a second set of sequences. Efficacy of siRNA was verified in each experiment. The recombinant adenovirus expressing dominant-negative (DN) Akt was a gift from Dr. C. Wheeler-Jones (Royal Veterinary College, London). The adenovirus expressing DN-Nrf2, which lacks the transactivation domain (Ad-Nrf2-DN) was provided by Dr. Jeffrey A. Johnson, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (22.Kraft A.D. Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were amplified in HEK-293A cells, purified, and titered using BD Adeno-X Purification and Rapid Titer Kits (BD Biosciences). HUVEC were infected by incubation with adenovirus in serum-free M199 for 2 h at 37 °C. The media was then changed to M199, 10% fetal bovine serum and HUVEC incubated overnight prior to experimentation. Infection of HUVEC with a β-galactosidase control adenovirus demonstrated a transfection efficiency of ≥95%. The optimal multiplicity of infection for the DN-Nrf2 and DN-Akt adenoviruses was determined by immunoblotting (not shown). The plasmid pHO-1-Luc was a gift from J. Alam (Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA). EC were transfected in triplicate with pGL3-basic or pHO-1-Luc using microporation technology (Digital Bio, Seoul, Korea) as described previously (18.Ali F. Hamdulay S.S. Kinderlerer A.R. Boyle J.J.

HUVEC were loaded with 5 μm 5-(and -6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. ECs were incubated in serum-free M199 with H2O2 (5 μm) for 30 min or 100 ng/ml leptin for 2 h and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Intracellular dihydrodichlorofluorescein (H2DCF) was oxidized to 2,7-dichlorofluorescein and quantified by flow cytometry. H2O2 (50 μm) was used to induce cellular injury and this was quantified using either: (i) trypan blue exclusion or (ii) a MTT assay. Cell numbers were not significantly altered by any of the treatment conditions prior to addition of H2O2. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad). β-Actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were used as housekeeping genes, with data calculated in relation to the β-Actin gene and verified with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. DNase-I-digested total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using 1 μm oligo(dT) and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 5 μl of cDNA template, 12.5 μl of iSYBR supermix, 0.5 pm sense and antisense gene-specific primers, and double distilled H2O.

HUVEC were incubated with atorvastatin for up to 72 h prior to lysis, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Immunoblots were probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by appropriate secondary reagents for 1 h at room temperature and developed with a chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure equivalent sample loading, protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad) and membranes were stripped and re-probed with a control antibody. Integrated density values were obtained with an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager 5500 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The measurement of intracellular cholesterol was carried out using a procedure previously described in detail by Wang et al. (26.Wang Y. Karu K. Griffiths W.J. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice were from Harlan Olac (Bicester, Oxford, UK) and housed under controlled climactic conditions in microisolator cages with autoclaved bedding. Irradiated food and drinking water were readily available. All animals were housed and studied according to UK Home Office guidelines. Sentinel mice were housed alongside test animals and regularly screened for a standard panel of murine pathogens. En face confocal microscopy was used to assess changes in the expression of HO-1 in the murine aortic vascular endothelium. C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) were injected intraperitoneally with atorvastatin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle alone and sacrificed 24 h later by CO2 inhalation, followed by perfusion fixation with 2% formalin and harvesting of aortae. Fixed aortae were treated with an HO-1 specific primary antibody (Cambridge Biosciences) and an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody. Stained vessels were mounted prior to visualization of endothelial surfaces en face using confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Changes in the expression of HO-1 in murine aortic EC located in regions of the lesser curvature exposed to disturbed flow and both the greater curvature and descending aorta exposed to laminar flow were quantified as described (27.Hajra L. Evans A.I. Chen M. Hyduk S.J. Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). EC were identified by co-staining with anti-CD31 antibody conjugated to the fluorophore fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen). Nuclei were identified using a DNA-binding probe with far-red emission (Draq5; Biostatus, Leicester, UK). Isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies against irrelevant antigens were used as experimental controls for specific staining. HO-1 protein expression was quantified by image analysis of fluorescence intensity in 100 cells in at least 3 distinct sites using Image J software. EC fluorescence was measured above a threshold intensity defined by background fluorescence. Data were grouped according to treatment and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) and the analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction or an unpaired Student's t test. Data are expressed as the mean of individual experiments ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p values of <0.05. To establish whether statins increase endothelial HO-1 expression in vivo, C57Bl/6 mice were treated with atorvastatin for 24 h. Changes in HO-1 expression were quantified by en face confocal microscopy of the aortic endothelium, with endothelial cells identified by CD31 staining. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with atorvastatin induced a significant increase in HO-1 expression in murine aortic endothelium at a site with low probability of developing atherosclerotic lesions (27.Hajra L.

In contrast, although HO-1 induction was detectable, EC located in the lesser curvature of the aorta, which has a high probability of developing lesions, were relatively refractory to atorvastatin treatment (Fig. 1B). Quantification by image analysis confirmed that HO-1 induction at high probability sites was significantly less than that at low probability sites (Fig. 1C). Statins and unidirectional LSS separately induce EC HO-1 expression in vitro. An established physiologic hemodynamic environment was therefore used to explore the influence of LSS on statin responsiveness. As expected, treatment of HUVEC with either 2.5 μm atorvastatin under static conditions, or exposure of HUVEC to LSS for 24 h, significantly increased HO-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). Pre-conditioning of EC with LSS (12 dynes/cm2) for 12 h prior to addition of atorvastatin and continuation of culture under LSS for a further 12 h resulted in an additive increase in HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Reduction of the atorvastatin concentration applied to static-cultured EC to 0.6 μm led to loss of HO-1 induction. In contrast, a significant increase of HO-1 mRNA was still seen when this concentration was applied to EC pre-conditioned by LSS, with 0.6 μm atorvastatin inducing a 14-fold increase in HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). A dose-response study confirmed synergy between LSS (12 dynes/cm2) and atorvastatin (1.25 and 0.6 μm), and this was lost with 0.3 μm atorvastatin (Fig. 2C). Moreover, further studies using an HMOX1 promoter reporter construct confirmed synergy between atorvastatin (0.6 μm) and LSS, as indicated by relative luciferase activity (Fig. 2D). A comparable synergistic response was also seen with simvastatin (supplementary Fig. S1A), whereas immunoblotting confirmed enhanced induction of HO-1 protein by 0.6 μm atorvastatin in LSS-conditioned EC (Fig. 2E). The importance of the duration of LSS was revealed by loss of the synergistic response when pre-conditioning was reduced to 6 h (supplementary Fig. S1, B and C). Subsequent experiments performed with human aortic EC, to represent an endothelial surface affected by atherosclerosis, demonstrated that they responded similarly to HUVEC with synergy observed between LSS and atorvastatin (0.6 μm), resulting in a 13-fold increase in HO-1 mRNA (supplementary Fig. S1D). To compare the effect of atheroprotective and atheroprone waveforms on responsiveness to statins, EC were exposed to LSS (12 dynes/cm2) or OF (±5 dynes/cm2 at 1 Hz) (21.Kinderlerer A.R. Ali F. Johns M. Lidington E.A. Leung V. Boyle J.J. Hamdulay S.S. Evans P.C. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14636-14644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A 10-fold increase in HO-1 expression was seen in EC exposed to 24 h LSS, whereas HO-1 mRNA induction was reduced to 3-fold in EC exposed to OF. Furthermore, OF-conditioned EC failed to demonstrate a synergistic relationship with atorvastatin (Fig. 2F). To investigate the functional relevance of HO-1 induction, EC were exposed to free radical-induced injury. Atorvastatin (0.6 μm) failed to protect static-cultured HUVEC exposed to H2O2 (50 μm). However, EC exposed to LSS for 24 h were protected by 50%, and this was significantly enhanced by atorvastatin (0.6 μm) (Fig. 3A). An oxygen radical-sensitive fluorescent probe (CM-H2DCFDA) was used to explore the ability of atorvastatin to modulate oxidative stress. LSS alone led to low-level oxidant generation, whereas exposure of EC to H2O2 (5 μm) induced a maximal response (Fig. 3B). Pre-treatment of static-cultured EC with atorvastatin (0.6 μm) failed to protect, whereas LSS alone significantly reduced H2O2 generated oxidative stress. However, as predicted, maximal protection was seen in LSS-conditioned EC treated with atorvastatin (Fig. 3B). Treatment with leptin also increased EC oxidant generation by 5-fold. LSS was again protective, with maximal reduction in leptin-induced oxidative stress seen in those cells exposed to both LSS and atorvastatin (Fig. 3C). To determine the role of HO-1 in the cytoprotective response, HUVEC were transfected with HO-1-specific or control siRNA. HO-1 siRNA reduced mRNA levels by 80% (supplementalFig. 2A) (18.Ali F. Hamdulay S.S. Kinderlerer A.R. Boyle J.J. Lidington E.A. Yamaguchi T. Soares M.P. Haskard D.O. Randi A.M. Mason J.C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 2537-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interference with HO-1 expression significantly reduced cytoprotection against H2O2-induced cell death afforded by atorvastatin in LSS-conditioned EC, from 75 to 40% (Fig. 3D), suggesting HO-1 is an important but not necessarily unique protective mechanism. In line with reduced HO-1 induction, exposure of EC to an atheroprone OF pattern revealed markedly attenuated protection against H2O2. Moreover, atorvastatin failed to enhance cytoprotection against oxidant injury in this setting (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure of HUVEC to LSS, or treatment of static-cultured EC with atorvastatin (0.6 μm), resulted in a modest reduction in intracellular cholesterol, which did not reach significance. However, consistent with the effect on HO-1 expression, pre-conditioning of EC with LSS prior to addition of atorvastatin resulted in a significant fall in intracellular cholesterol up to 60%. These data, combined with that in Fig. 2, suggest that EC exposure to LSS significantly enhances responsiveness to statins. To determine whether LSS and atorvastatin regulate HO-1 expression post-transcriptionally, EC were exposed to LSS in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, prior to addition of actinomycin D (2 μg/ml) and analysis of HO-1 by quantitative RT-PCR. Treatment with actinomycin D resulted in less than 5% cell death as estimated by trypan blue exclusion studies. The rapid decay of HO-1 mRNA in static-cultured EC was not delayed by atorvastatin. In contrast, LSS increased HO-1 mRNA stability and this delay in degradation was"

The molecular mechanisms underlying chain termination and hence molecular weight control remain poorly understood, not only for hyaluronan synthases but also for other β-polysaccharide synthases, e.g. cellulose, chitin, and 1,3-betaglucan synthases. In this work, we manipulated metabolite concentrations in the hyaluronan pathway by overexpressing the five genes of the hyaluronan synthesis operon in Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis decreased molecular weight, whereas overexpression of genes involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis increased molecular weight. The highest molecular mass observed was at 3.4 ± 0.1 MDa twice that observed in the wild-type strain, 1.8 ± 0.1 MDa. The data indicate that (a) high molecular weight is achieved when an appropriate balance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid is achieved, (b) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine exerts the dominant effect on molecular weight, and (c) the wild-type strain has suboptimal levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Consistent herewith molecular weight correlated strongly (ρ = 0.84, p = 3 × 10−5) with the concentration of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.

Hyaluronan (HA) 3The abbreviations used are: HAhyaluronanGlcUAglucuronic acidGlcglucoseCmchloramphenicol. is a linear polymer of a repeating disaccharide, β1–3 d-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) β1–4 d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) (1.Fong Chong B.F. Blank L.M. Mclaughlin R. Nielsen L.K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 66: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Ubiquitous in the extracellular matrix in vertebrates, HA is particularly abundant in cartilage, synovial fluid, dermis, and the vitreous humor of the eye, where it serves specialized functions. HA also plays a critical role during fertilization and embryogenesis. In many group A and C streptococci, HA forms a capsule that helps these microbes evade the host immune system (2.Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). HA molecular weight is important for the physiochemical as well as biological properties of HA. High molecular weight is important for HA to exert its unique rheological properties (3.Fouissac E. Milas M. Rinaudo M. Macromolecules. 1993; 26: 6945-6951Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), for mucoadherence (4.Saettone M.F. Giannaccini B. Chetoni P. Torracca M.T. Monti D. Int. J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 36777-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) from the activated sugar precursors, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (see Fig. 1). In addition to the HA synthase (hasA), streptococcal has operons encode for one or more enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the activated sugars (11.Blank L.M. Hugenholtz P. Nielsen L.K. J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 67: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) operon encodes for five genes: HA synthase (EC 2.4.1.212; hasA), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.22; hasB), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9; hasC), a glmU paralog encoding for a dual function enzyme acetyltransferase and pyrophosphorylase activity (EC 2.3.1.4/EC 2.7.7.23; hasD), and a pgi paralog encoding for phosphoglucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9; hasE). Although the biosynthetic mechanism is well established, little is known about what controls HA molecular weight. This is true not only for HA, but also for the highly abundant β-polysaccharides: cellulose, chitin, and 1,3-betaglucan. Molecular weight is partly an intrinsic parameter of the HA synthase. Weigel and colleagues have demonstrated that, at least in vitro, mutation of conserved cysteine or polar residues in streptococcal HA synthases results in reduced molecular weight with limited effect on biosynthetic rate (12.Heldermon C.D. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13.Kumari K. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

In a vertebrate HA synthase from Xenopus, the mutation of a serine or a cysteine residue yielded HA of higher, lower, or similar molecular weight depending on the amino acid substitution (15.Pummill P.E. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19808-19814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that in vivo molecular weight is also affected by culture parameters, e.g. temperature and aeration (16.Johns M.R. Goh L.T. Oeggerli A. Biotechnol. Lett. 1994; 16: 507-512Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Armstrong D.C. Johns M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Fong Chong B. Nielsen L.K.

Although changed culture conditions affect the physiochemical environment of the HA synthase, a more likely explanation is that molecular weight is affected by the availability of activated sugar substrates (UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc) as well as the concentration of possible effector molecules, such as free UDP (21.Park M.G. Jang J.D. Kang W.K. Lucky Limited, Seoul, Korea, U.S.1996Google Scholar). Although such a mechanism has been suggested for several processive synthases (22.Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23.Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), there has never been any direct evidence linking molecular weight to the concentration of a substrate. Experimental support for the hypothesis has been obtained for the type 3 polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.Ventura C.L. Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like HA, the type 3 polysaccharide in S. pneumoniae is synthesized by a processive synthase from alternating addition of activated sugars, in this case UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-GlcUA. Mutants with reduced UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (“hasB”) activity not only produce less polysaccharide, but also polysaccharide with lower molecular weight (24.Ventura C.L. Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the levels of UDP-GlcUA were below detection in all strains, this supports the idea that UDP-GlcUA concentration controls molecular weight. Moreover, it is consistent with previous in vitro studies showing that low levels of UDP-GlcUA cause chain termination and hence low molecular weight (25.Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the concentration of UDP-GlcUA is critical for the successful transition from oligosaccharide lipid to highly processive polysaccharide synthesis (26.Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6283-6289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism is not likely for HA biosynthesis, because there is no indication that the HA synthase needs a primer (27.Weigel P.H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study, we manipulated metabolite concentrations in the HA pathway by overexpressing the five genes in the has operon of S. zooepidemicus (Fig. 1). Overexpression of these genes had a profound effect on HA molecular weight, which correlated with the levels of UDP-sugars and in particular, UDP-GlcNAc. MG1363 (L. lactis) (28.Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an intermediate host for plasmids.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The plasmid-free L. lactis strain MG1363 (28.Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed as an intermediate host for all recombinant plasmids and selected on M17 agar supplemented with 5 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol (Cm). The full gene sequence and insertion site were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The plasmid containing the genes was subsequently isolated from MG1363 and electrotransformed into S. zooepidemicus. Recombinant strains of S. zooepidemicus were selected on M17 agar supplemented with 2.5 μg ml−1 Cm. Cells were grown in M17 supplemented with 5 g liter−1 glucose (M17G). After 12 h of incubation, cells were inoculated into 100 ml of fresh M17G to 0.05 at A530 nm. The cells were further grown to about 0.6 at A530 nm. Prior to harvesting, 0.4 mg ml−1 of hyaluronidase was added followed by an additional incubation at 37 °C for another 30 min before centrifugation (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-26 XPI, 5000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed in 20 ml of 0.5 m sucrose solution. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed again in 1 ml of 0.5 m sucrose solution. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 250 μl of the same solution (31.Fong Chong B. Improving the Cellular Economy of Streptococcus Zooepidemicus through Metabolic Engineering. Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane2002Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene PulserTM with pulse control. Ice-cold cuvettes of path length 0.2 cm containing 40 μl of washed cells and up to 4 μl of purified plasmid DNA. Voltage was set at 3.0 kV (equivalent to 15 kV cm−1), resistance at 200 Ω, and capacitance at 25 microfarads. Immediately following pulse application, 1.0 ml of cold M17G broth was added to cells, which were then held on ice for 5 min prior to incubation at 37 °C for 2–3 h. Aliquots of electroporated cells (100 μl) were spread out on M17G agar plates supplemented with 2.5 μg ml−1 Cm. All plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified. A chemically defined medium was modified from previously described media (32.van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Chong B.F. Nielsen L.K. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 100: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by adding 20 g liter−1 of glucose, 4.5 g liter−1 of acetate, and 50 mg liter−1 of uridine. The medium contained 2.5 μg ml−1 Cm and 20 ng ml−1 nisin. Growth experiments were conducted in a 2-liter bioreactor (Applikon) at a working volume of 1.4 liter, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The reactor was agitated at 300 rpm, and anaerobic conditions were maintained by top sparging nitrogen during fermentation. During the experiment, pH was maintained at 6.7 by 5 m NaOH and 5 m HCl additions. Gene overexpression was induced by adding 20 ng ml−1 of nisin to the medium. Growth was monitored every hour by measuring the optical density at 530 nm. Experiments were conducted at least in duplicates with independent gene insertions for the mutant strains. Samples were collected hourly, and the optical density was measured at 530 nm and converted to biomass using the equation: Biomass (g liter−1) = A530 × 0.26 ± 0.01 (34.Goh L.T. Fermentation Studies of Hyaluronic Acid Production by Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane1998Google Scholar). The remaining sample was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% SDS to remove the HA capsule and filtered through a syringe filter (Millex-GS MSE 0.45 μm) for cell removal. Lactate, acetate, formate, glucose, and ethanol were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Bio-Rad HPX-87 H acid column with 1 m H2SO4 as eluant and a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The HA concentration was measured using a turbidimetric quantification assay (35.DI Ferrante N. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 220: 303-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular metabolites were measured as described elsewhere (36.Marcellin E. Nielsen L.K. Abeydeera P. Krömer J.O. Biotechnol. J. 2009; 4: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of cell suspension was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 2 min at 37 °C and subsequently extracted into boiling ethanol. Extracts were enriched using SAX resin columns as described elsewhere (37.Jensen N.B. Jokumsen K.V. Villadsen J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that metabolites were eluted from columns using 2 ml of 0.15 m sodium citrate instead of sodium acetate. Metabolites were analyzed using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and quantified via an integrated pulsed amperometric detector (36.Marcellin E. Nielsen L.K. Abeydeera P. Krömer J.O. Biotechnol. J. 2009; 4: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in the exponential phase of chemically defined medium fermentation cultures (A530 ∼ 2.0), treated with 0.4 mg ml−1 of hyaluronidase to remove HA, and pelleted at 5000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice in wash buffer (50 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7, with 10% v/v glycerol, 4 °C). Finally, the pellet was resuspended in wash buffer containing protease inhibitor and mixed with 1.44 g of 100-μm glass beads. Tubes were chilled on ice for 5 min prior to disruption in a Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products) through 5 cycles of 1 min beating at 5,000 rpm followed by 1 min on ice between cycles. After lysis, the sample was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min), and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Protein content of the extracts was determined using a commercial kit (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). The activity of HasA was measured by incubating cell extract with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA for 1 h at 37 °C (38.Yu H. Stephanopoulos G. Metab. Eng. 2008; 10: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by immersion in boiling water, before addition of 0.1% SDS to free HA molecules from membranes and measuring HA produced with the carbazole assay. The specific activity of 1 unit/mg of dry cell HA synthase is equivalent to 1 mg of HA generated/min/mg of dry cell. HasB, HasC, and HasE activities were measured in NADH/NADPH-linked enzyme assays at room temperature. HasB activity was measured based on the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-GlcUA (39.Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HasC activity was measured based on conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to UDP-Glc coupled to conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-GlcUA using excess UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (40.Grobben G.J. Smith M.R. Sikkema J. de Bont J.A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 279-284Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HasE activity was measured from the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate coupled to conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate using excess glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (41.Degeest B. De Vuyst L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Specific activities were expressed as nanomoles of substrate converted into product in 1 min for 1 mg of total cell protein. HasD transcript levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR with 500 ng of total RNA as a template using primers HasD_F2 and HasD_R2 amplifying a 398-bp DNA fragment of the hasD gene, followed by quantification of band intensity on a DNA gel (Scion Image, version 4.0.3.2). HA samples were purified from the broth by mixing 15 ml of culture with 15 ml of 0.1% w/v SDS and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Steritop-GP, 0.22 μm, polyethersulfone), mixed with 3 volumes of ethanol and left overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-26 XPI, 9630 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), and the pellet was washed in 30 ml of ethanol/saline solution (75% w/v ethanol, 25% w/v 0.15 m NaCl) and again centrifuged (17,600 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The pellet was allowed to dry overnight. The dry HA pellet was resuspended in 0.15 m NaCl with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C, and undissolved matter was removed by centrifugation (17,600 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). Samples were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millex-GS MSE) prior to analysis. Two-dimensional Quant (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the protein content in 3 samples (WT, MT, and HasED) and compared against protein content in two clinical HA samples. A dilution series from 200 μg to 10 μg of HA was analyzed for each sample. In all 5 samples, the protein content was below detection limit (1 μg of bovine serum albumin) corresponding to a purity of 99.5%. Intrinsic viscosity was measured with a Lauda Processor viscosity measuring system using an Ubbelohde Dilution Capillary (0.63-mm diameter and 5700-mm3 volume). All measurements were performed at 37 °C using 0.15 m NaCl as diluent. The average molecular weight was determined from the intrinsic viscosity using the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation (Equation 1), [η]=0.0292×M−W−0.7848(Eq. 1) with parameters obtained using standards of known molecular weight (Healon GV, Healon OVD, Sigma-Aldrich (cat. nos. H9390, 53747, and H5388)). Purified HA samples were further analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in a previous study (42.Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Samples were separated using a Sub-Cell GT (Bio-Rad) and 0.5% agarose gels (25 cm long). Samples containing 7 μg of HA in 14 μl of MilliQ water were electrophoresed for 16 h at room temperature with a constant voltage of 50 V. Select-HA Hiladder and Mega-HA ladder (Hyalose) were used as a reference. Staining was performed as described previously (42.Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A total of 26 batch fermentations with 2 to 6 biological replicates per strain were performed for 8 strains: wild type (nWT = 5), empty plasmid (nMT = 6), hasA (nA = 2), hasB (nB = 2), hasC (nC = 2), hasD (nD = 2), hasE (nE = 4), and the double gene construct, hasED (nED = 3). For each of the four measured parameters, molecular weight, growth rate, yield of HA, and yield of biomass, a linear model was fitted in R using the empty plasmid strain as control, e.g. MWi ∼ MWMT + ΔMWi, i.e. ΔMWi represents the difference from the empty plasmid for strain i, and the significance of the fitted parameter is the significance of the difference between strain i and the empty plasmid strain. Variance homogeneity was confirmed using a Bartlett test and normality of the residuals confirmed using a Shapiro-Wilk test. 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the pooled residual error on 18 degrees of freedom. Correlations between molecular weight and UDP-sugars were analyzed using the Spearman's rank correlation test in R. The five genes encoded by the has operon were cloned into pNZ8148 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. Following transformation, overexpression was confirmed with enzyme assays or, in the case of hasD, quantitative PCR (Table 3). Eight strains, wild type (WT), empty plasmid (pNZ8148), the five individual genes and the double gene construct, hasED, were characterized in a total of 26 batch fermentations performed in a 1.4-liter bioreactor. Fermentations were inoculated with strains from separate transformation events to avoid the impact of fortuitous or deleterious random mutations in individual colonies. Fermentations were characterized in terms of molecular weight using viscometry (Fig. 2), and the trends were confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Fermentations were also characterized in terms of growth rate, HA yield, and biomass yield (Fig. 4).TABLE 3Activity of enzymes of corresponding overexpressed strainsStrainWT specific activity-Fold increaseHasA0.5 ± 0.0a10−3 mg HA.min−1.mg protein−1.1.5 ± 0.1HasB40.9 ± 1.0bnmol.min−1.mg protein−1.5.0 ± 0.2HasC11.1 ± 0.5bnmol.min−1.mg protein−1.4.7 ± 0.6HasE1500 ± 200bnmol.min−1.mg protein−1.5.0 ± 0.9a 10−3 mg HA.min−1.mg protein−1.b nmol.min−1.mg protein−1.

In the presence of the plasmid, the average molecular mass increased from 1.8 ± 0.1 MDa to 2.5 ± 0.1 MDa (p = 4 × 10−7). The plasmid effect was not due to the inducer, nisin. Including nisin in two wild-type fermentations yielded molecular masses of 1.9 and 1.8 MDa, whereas excluding nisin from a pNZ8148 fermentation yielded a molecular weight of 2.6. Assuming variance homogeneity, a linear model analysis (molecular weight ∼ plasmid + nisin) showed that the plasmid alone had a significant effect (p = 1 × 10−4), whereas nisin had no effect (p = 0.962). Relative to the empty plasmid control, overexpression of hasA (p = 0.012), hasB (p = 0.006), and hasC (p = 5 × 10−4) had a negative effect on molecular weight (Fig. 2), whereas overexpression of hasE had a strong positive effect (p = 6 × 10−6). Overexpression of hasD alone had no effect (p = 0.843), but further increased molecular weight when combined with hasE (p = 2 × 10−6). The growth rate of the wild-type strain was marginally (p = 0.047) higher than that of plasmid carrying strains. The strain overexpressing hasC grew significantly (p = 0.027) slower than the other engineered strains. Our wild-type strain achieved a high HA yield on sugar of around 10% (w/w) (Fig. 4). The empty plasmid appears to increase yield, although not significantly (p = 0.162). Overexpression of hasA results in a 47% increase in yield (p = 4 × 10−4), whereas overexpression of hasC led to a 37% decrease in yield (p = 0.002). Strains overexpressing hasD and hasE have a HA yield similar to the empty plasmid strain, whereas the strain expressing both genes hasE and hasD had a significantly lower yield (p = 0.009). The biomass yield appears to follow the reverse pattern of the HA yield, except both HA and biomass yields (p = 0.001) are high for strains overexpressing hasA. Among the remaining strains, only the increased biomass yield for strains overexpressing both hasD and hasE is statistically significant (p = 0.021). Overexpression of genes in the has operon other than the synthase is expected to affect the level of the activated precursors, UDP-GlcUA and UPD-GlcNAc. Overexpression of hasB and hasC resulted in a dramatic increase in UDP-GlcUA levels of 11-fold and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). Overexpression of hasC also resulted in the expected increase in UDP-Glc levels. However, there was no correlation between UDP-GlcUA (or UDP-Glc) levels and the observed molecular weight (Spearman's ρ test, p = 0.633). In contrast, molecular weight was strongly correlated with UDP-GlcNAc (ρ = 0.84, p = 3 × 10−5). The absence of a molecular weight effect when overexpressing hasD alone was mirrored in the absence of a significant increase in UDP-GlcNAc, when overexpressing hasD alone. In combination with hasE, however, both UDP-GlcNAc and molecular weight achieved their highest values. The molecular weight of HA is important for its physiochemical properties and biological functions. In this study, we explored the commonly stated but unproven hypothesis that the molecular weight of polysaccharides produced by processive synthases depends on the availability of activated sugar substrates (23.Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We cloned and overexpressed the five genes of the has operon in S. zooepidemicus (Table 3), to manipulate the levels of UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc. To our surprise, we noted a 41% increase in HA molecular weight in strains harboring the control plasmid (Fig. 2). The increase in molecular weight was not associated with the presence of the inducer nisin. Interestingly, increased molecular weight in response to an empty plasmid was also observed during heterologous production of HA in Bacillus subtilis (44.Sloma A. Behr R. Widner W. Tang M. Sternberg D. Brown S. Novozymes Biotech, Inc., 2003Google Scholar) suggesting that foreign DNA stress is beneficial for HA molecular weight. Indeed, there is evidence that stress in general (plasmid stress, aerobic conditions, changes in pH, and low temperature) is beneficial for high molecular weight HA production (16.Johns M.R. Goh L.T. Oeggerli A. Biotechnol. Lett. 1994; 16: 507-512Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Armstrong D.C. Johns M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Huang W.C. Chen S.J. Chen T.L. Biochem. Eng. J. 2006; 32: 239-243Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses are underway to identify the molecular basis of this stress effect. Relative to the empty vector control, overexpression of the HA synthase gene (hasA) caused a significant increase in HA yield (Fig. 4) and a significant lowering of molecular weight (Fig. 2). The lowering in molecular weight may be explained by increased competition for a fixed pool of UDP-monomers leading to suboptimal levels of UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-GlcUA biosynthesis resulted in a significant increase in UDP-Glc (hasC) and UDP-GlcUA (hasB and hasC) (Fig. 5) associated with a decrease in molecular weight (Fig. 2). Increasing the activity of the last two steps in UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (hasD) had limited effect on molecular weight (Fig. 2) or UDP-GlcNAc concentration (Fig. 5) suggesting that an upstream step was limiting. This limitation could be overcome by overexpressing hasE; both hasE alone and hasED together significantly increased UDP-GlcNAc levels and molecular mass. At 3.4 ± 0.1 MDa, HA produced by the hasED strain has twice the molecular mass of that produced by the wild-type strain. The mechanism in S. zooepidemicus is evidently different from transition model proposed for S. pneumoniae (see the introduction): 1) With the current evidence, the HA synthase is a monomeric, processive synthase that polymerize directly from UDP-sugars without the need for an initiation complex or covalent modifications (43.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 2) Both UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc are relatively abundant in S. zooepidemicus (Fig. 5). 3) Unlike S. pneumoniae, the HA yield did not correlate with molecular weight; the hasED strains had a significantly lower yield than the empty plasmid strains, whereas hasE had a similar yield (Fig. 4). Our data indicate that maximum molecular weight requires an optimal balance between UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc and that the balance in wild-type strains is toward UDP-GlcUA. Competition between UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc has previously been observed to affect the rate of polymerization by streptococcal HAS (43.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The competition is attributed to the affinity of UDP-GlcUA to the UDP-GlcNAc binding site, and vice versa. Competition is also seen with other sugar nucleotides and even UDP. It is possible that chain termination occurs when a site for one sugar nucleotide is blocked for too long by another sugar nucleotide. If molecular weight is dictated by a competition between UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc, there must be an optimum ratio of the two sugars, which we have not achieved in this study. This study, however, points to several strategies to further enhance molecular weight. Overexpression of hasE (pgi) had a surprisingly strong effect in this study. S. zooepidemicus is a lactic acid bacterium with a highly active Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and ∼80% of all glucose is processed to pyruvate indicating that pgi activity is inherently high. Moreover, mucoid strains have 4-fold higher pgi transcript levels and 2-fold higher enzyme activity compared with non-mucoid strains, in which the has operon is silenced (11.Blank L.M. Hugenholtz P. Nielsen L.K. J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 67: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, the benefit from the 5-fold increase in the hasE strain must be due to shift in the ratio of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, rather than overcoming a metabolic bottleneck. If this is the case, lowering phosphofructokinase activity (or increasing Km for fructose 6-phosphate) would be an alternative strategy to increase fructose-6-phosphate, UDP-GlcNAc and hence molecular weight. Overexpression of other enzymes in the UDP-GlcNAc pathway (i.e. GlmS or GlmM) or feeding with glucosamine would be alternative strategies to enhance UDP-GlcNAc concentration. HA has been produced in heterologous hosts, including Enterococcus faecalis (45.DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Escherichia coli (9.DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2007; 77: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given superior tools for strain engineering of the latter four hosts, it may prove easier to engineer microbial high molecular weight HA producers by targeting the UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GlcUA ratio in these hosts. Using these systems, the optimum ratio of UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc for maximum molecular weight and yield of HA could be determined.

Erythropoiesis is a complex process that requires a coordinated balance between proliferation/self renewal and differentiation, a process tightly linked to cell cycle control (10Koury M.J. Sawyer S.T. Brandt S.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).

There are E-BOX and E2f binding sites in the proximal promoter which can bind c-Myc and E2Fs in response to growth signals, but there are no conserved CACC box elements or SP1 binding sites (17Sears R.

The erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 has been shown to regulate the cell cycle by activation and repression of critical cell cycle control genes, including G1 cyclins and c-Myc (19Rylski M.

We previously identified E2fs as potential EKLF target genes in a global profiling study (5Hodge D. Coghill E. Keys J. Maguire T. Hartmann B. McDowall A. Weiss M. Grimmond S. Perkins A. Blood. 2006; 107: 3359-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The focus of this study was to examine how loss of EKLF altered the cell cycle and to interrogate possible direct links between EKLF and the E2fs. Like Pilon et al. (18Pilon A.M. Arcasoy M.O. Dressman H.K. Vayda S.E. Maksimova Y.D. Sangerman J.I. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7394-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we show the major cell cycle defect of EKLF−/− cells is defective S-phase entry and identify abnormal expression of E2f2 and E2f4 as the likely cause. However, in contrast to Pilon et al. (18Pilon A.M. Arcasoy M.O. Dressman H.K. Vayda S.E. Maksimova Y.D. Sangerman J.I. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7394-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we suggest that EKLF binding to a previously undescribed intronic enhancer is critical for E2f2 gene regulation. We suggest that our newly discovered enhancer region is likely to act in cooperation with the promoter to drive appropriate E2f2 expression. We also show partial rescue of the cell cycle phenotype in EKLF−/− mice is achieved by depletion of the E2F-binding protein Rb, providing further evidence for a genetic link between EKLF and the E2F-Rb G1/S checkpoint. Rb+/− EKLF+/− mice were obtained by mating EKLF+/− mice (3Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and Rb +/− mice (12Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Rb+/− EKLF +/− mice were intercrossed at 8–12 weeks of age. Genotyping of mouse lines and embryos was performed by genomic PCR using the primers indicated in supplemental Table 1. Peripheral blood collected at E10.5 (primitive red cells) or cells from homogenized E14.5 fetal livers (definitive red cells) were washed twice in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum) and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer. Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and stained by the addition of the cell-permeant DNA dye Draq5 (Biostatus) to a concentration of 2.5 μm and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. Co-staining with 7-AAD provided an assessment of DNA content. FACS analysis was performed using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and BD FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (Treestar) software. Intraperitoneal injection of 200 μl of BrdUrd solution (10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was performed on pregnant female mice 1 h before sacrifice. Peripheral blood at E10.5 or fetal livers at E13.5 and E14.5 were collected from embryos and stained using a fluorescein isothiocyanate BrdUrd flow kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. FACS analysis was performed using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and BD FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (Treestar) software. Total RNA was obtained using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions from E10.5 peripheral blood cells, homogenized E14.5 fetal liver, or K1-ER cells induced by the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma) as previously described (7Keys J.R.

Haematol. 2007; 136: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). cDNA was prepared from total RNA by reverse transcription using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR reactions were performed as previously described (5Hodge D. Coghill E. Keys J. Maguire T. Hartmann B. McDowall A. Weiss M. Grimmond S. Perkins A. Blood. 2006; 107: 3359-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using primers designed to cross an intron-exon boundary. Primer sequences are described in supplemental Table 1.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W280-W286Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) were used to align the genic and intergenic sequences of E2f2 and E2f4 between the mouse, human, and dog genomes and identify ECRs of greater than 100 bp in length and 70% similarity. Using the rVISTA (24Loots G.G. Ovcharenko I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W217-W221Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) user-defined motif search tool we identified EKLF consensus binding sites (5′-CCNCNCCCN-3′) within these regions. Evolutionary conserved regions from the first intron of E2f2 and fifth intron of E2f4 were identified as potential erythroid specific enhancer regions and aligned using AlignX software (Invitrogen). The seven species regulatory potential track available on the UCSC Genome Browser was also used to find putative erythroid specific enhancers (25Wang H. Zhang Y. Cheng Y. Zhou Y. King D.C. Taylor J. Chiaromonte F. Kasturi J. Petrykowska H. Gibb B. Dorman C. Miller W. Dore L.C. Welch J. Weiss M.J. Hardison R.C. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1480-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The XhoI restriction site of the pGL2-Promoter vector (Promega) was used to clone a 502-bp fragment of murine E2f2 intron 1 (shown in Fig. 3) or a 222-bp fragment including murine E2f4 intron 5 (shown in supplemental Fig. 1) in either the forward (5′–3′) or reverse (3′–5′) orientation upstream of the ubiquitous minimal SV40 promoter driving expression of luciferase. Constructs were transfected into murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations or Drosophila SL2 cells together with pPAC-EKLF or empty pPAC vector as previously reported (26Tallack M.R. Keys J.R. Perkins A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a VICTOR Light Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The erythroid cell line K1zf-ER was created by immortalization of EKLF−/− erythroid progenitors with J2 retrovirus as previously described (27Coghill E. Eccleston S. Fox V. Cerruti L. Brown C. Cunningham J. Jane S. Perkins A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) followed by infection with murine stem cell virus expressing the zinc finger DNA binding region (amino acids 273–376) of murine EKLF as an ERTM fusion. These cells or E14.5 fetal liver erythroid cells were used to determine in vivo chromatin occupancy of EKLF. K1zf-ER cells were induced for DNA binding activity by treating with 4-OHT (Sigma). ChIP was performed as previously described (26Tallack M.R. Keys J.R. Perkins A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a specific ERα antibody (Ab-10; Neomarkers) together with an irrelevant mouse IgG1 control antibody or a specific EKLF antibody (3Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) together with preimmune rabbit serum as a control. ChIP assays to address GATA-1 binding were performed in a similar manner using a specific monoclonal GATA-1 antibody (sc-265, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an irrelevant rat IgG control. Enrichment of transcription factor binding was determined by real-time PCR using specific primers designed to amplify putative enhancer regions. Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. EMSAs were performed as previously described (28Gordon C.T. Fox V.J. Najdovska S. Perkins A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1729: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were derived from COS7 cells that had been transfected with an EKLF expression plasmid (pSG5-EKLF) (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) or from MEL cells. Supershifts were performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for EKLF (3Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) or a rat monoclonal antibody specific for GATA-1 (sc-265, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Oligonucleotide sequences used to generate radiolabeled probes are provided in supplemental Table 1 with only the forward strand shown. Reverse oligonucleotides were annealed in excess after labeling of the forward strand with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 4Drissen R. von Lindern M. Kolbus A. Driegen S. Steinlein P. Beug H. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 2006; 107: 3359-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) suggested a cell cycle defect caused by a loss of EKLF. To examine cell cycle phasing of erythroid cells in vivo, we used the cell-permeable DNA dye Draq5. There was a significant reduction in cells with S-phase DNA content during primitive (E10.5 peripheral blood, Fig. 1A) and definitive (E14.5 fetal liver, Fig. 1B) erythropoiesis in EKLF−/− (Ek) embryos when compared with wild-type littermates (WT). To determine whether this was because of a shortened S-phase or an inability of cells to enter S-phase, we injected pregnant females with BrdUrd solution 1 h before sacrifice and collected primitive blood or fetal livers to determine the amount of BrdUrd incorporation by FACS. There was a marked reduction in BrdUrd incorporation in EKLF−/− embryonic (Figs. 1, C and E) and definitive red cells (Figs. 1, D and F) compared with litter mates, which is consistent with the Draq5 DNA content data. In addition, there was a significant increase in cells in G2-M-phase in EKLF−/− fetal liver cells, suggesting loss of EKLF in the erythroid compartment impairs progression through G2-M directly or indirectly by eliciting a G2/M checkpoint (compare Ek and WT in Figs. 1, E and F). To explain the defect in S-phase entry for EKLF−/− erythroid cells, we focused our studies on the E2F family of transcription factors as potential EKLF target genes because of their critical role in S-phase progression. E2f5 and E2f6 showed no difference in expression at the mRNA level between EKLF−/− and wild-type E14.5 fetal livers (0.98 and 1.098, respectively, Ek versus WT, data not shown), whereas E2f1 and E2f3 showed only a modest decrease in mRNA levels in EKLF−/− (0.708 and 0.717, respectively, Ek versus WT, data not shown). In contrast, E2f2 and E2f4 both showed a significant reduction in mRNA expression in EKLF−/− fetal livers at E14.5 when compared with wild-type (0.28 and 0.38, respectively, Ek versus WT, Fig. 2B). To confirm that E2f2 and E2f4 were likely to be critical EKLF target genes during erythropoiesis, we investigated the mRNA expression levels during primitive erythropoiesis at E10.5 when the phenotype is subtle. E2f2 expression was also significantly reduced at E10.5 in the EKLF−/− (0.4, Ek versus WT, Fig. 2A). However, E2f4 expression was unaffected at this time (1.03, Ek versus WT, Fig. 2A). We also sought to confirm that the change in E2f2 expression levels was a direct effect of EKLF activity by utilizing the K1-ER cell line system, which contains a 4-OHT (Tamoxifen)-inducible form of EKLF (27Coghill E. Eccleston S. Fox V. Cerruti L. Brown C. Cunningham J. Jane S. Perkins A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E2f2 is rapidly induced by 4-OHT, even faster than β-globin and α-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein in these cells (Fig. 2C) (7Keys J.R. Tallack M.R. Hodge D.J. Cridland S.O. David R. Perkins A.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 136: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility of direct regulation of E2f2 and E2f4 by EKLF, we looked for EKLF consensus binding sites (5′-CCNCNCCCN-3′ (29Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that were conserved between the mouse, human, and dog genomes. We identified a highly conserved region within the first intron of E2f2, with a high regulatory potential score (>0.3) (25Wang H. Zhang Y. Cheng Y. Zhou Y. King D.C. Taylor J. Chiaromonte F. Kasturi J. Petrykowska H. Gibb B. Dorman C. Miller W. Dore L.C. Welch J. Weiss M.J. Hardison R.C. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1480-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that contained EKLF consensus sites as well as consensus sites for the erythroid specific transcription factors GATA-1 and SCL/TAL1 (Fig. 3A). This region represents a putative erythroid-specific enhancer of E2f2 expression (hereafter referred to as E2f2-i1en). A multiple sequence alignment of this region shows that it contains three independent conserved EKLF consensus sites (designated CACC-1, CACC-2, and CACC-3, Fig. 3B) as well as a conserved GATA-1 consensus site (GATA, Fig. 3B) and five separate E-BOX binding sites for SCL/TAL1 and related proteins (E-BOX, Fig. 3B). Investigation of the E2f4 gene locus also showed a region containing conserved EKLF and GATA-1 consensus sites within intron 5 (hereafter referred to as E2f4-i5en), which has also been assigned a high regulatory potential score (>0.3, supplemental Fig. 1A). However, this region is not as highly conserved across the three genomes (supplemental Fig. 1B). We next sought to confirm that the regions E2f2-i1en and E2f4-i5en were functional enhancers of gene expression using reporter assays. Enhancer constructs containing either E2f2-i1en or E2f4-i5en in forward and reverse orientations were tested for activity in the murine erythroleukemia cell line, MEL. Both E2f2-i1en and E2f4-i5en were found to enhance transcription of the luciferase gene in MEL cells 10–30-fold relative to a basal vector containing the SV40 promoter only (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, both E2f2-i1en and E2f4-i5en seem to display a degree of directional preference, forward for E2f2-i1en and reverse for E2f4-i5en. To address whether these enhancers were directly responsive to EKLF, we performed further reporter assays in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells, which lack any SP/KLF proteins. E2f2-i1en shows a significant response (2–3-fold induction) upon co-transfection with an EKLF expression plasmid in either the forward or reverse orientation when compared with empty vector (Fig. 4B). However, the E2f4-i5en enhancer does not display a significant response in either orientation when compared with empty vector containing the basal SV40 promoter alone (Fig. 4B), suggesting it may not be directly EKLF-responsive. To determine whether the identified putative enhancers (E2f2-i1en and E2f4-i5en) were occupied by EKLF in vivo, we performed a ChIP assay (Fig. 5). Using a cell line containing an inducible form of the EKLF DNA binding domain (K1zf-ER, inducible by addition of 4-OHT), we found there is specific in vivo occupancy of E2f2-i1en but not regions 1 kilobase upstream or downstream and that this occupancy is dependent on 4-OHT (EKLF induced, Tamox (black bars), Fig. 5A). In contrast, there is no occupancy of E2f4-i5en by K1zf-ER in these cells (Fig. 5B). This is consistent with our observations made by reporter assay in SL2 cells (Fig. 4B). As a positive control, a previously identified site of EKLF binding in the α-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein gene promoter (7Keys J.R. Tallack M.R. Hodge D.J. Cridland S.O. David R. Perkins A.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 136: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was also occupied by K1zf-ER in these cells (data not shown). We were also able to show occupancy by endogenous EKLF at E2f2-i1en in primary fetal liver cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Pilon et al. (18Pilon A.M. Arcasoy M.O. Dressman H.K. Vayda S.E. Maksimova Y.D. Sangerman J.I. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7394-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) recently showed EKLF occupancy broadly at the E2f2 proximal promoter. Even though the CACC sites within the E2f2 proximal promoter are not conserved, we also found EKLF was enriched close to the transcriptional start site (supplemental Fig. 2). ChIP assays have limited resolution, which is dependent on efficiencies of DNA shearing; ChIP cannot reliably distinguish occupancy of sites within ∼50–100 bp. Thus, to determine EKLF binding at E2f2-i1en at higher resolutions, we used EMSA and specific probes designed for each of the bioinformatically identified EKLF binding sites (CACC-1, CACC-2, CACC-3, Fig. 3B). EKLF is only able to bind to the CACC-3 and CACC-2 probes in vitro (Fig. 5C) as confirmed by supershift with a specific EKLF antibody. EMSAs using a probe for the CACC site of E2f4-i5en confirmed what was observed in vivo by ChIP, as EKLF also failed to bind to this site in vitro (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest direct regulation of E2f2 by EKLF is likely to occur via binding to the enhancer region, E2f2-i1en, which contains two EKLF binding sites (CACC-2 and CACC-3). Direct regulation via binding to the promoter could also occur as suggested by Pilon et al. (18Pilon A.M. Arcasoy M.O. Dressman H.K. Vayda S.E. Maksimova Y.D. Sangerman J.I. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7394-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, we suggest that transcriptional regulation of E2f2 probably occurs via co-operating contributions of both the promoter and the E2f2-i1en element (supplemental Fig. 2). We hypothesized that the defects in S-phase entry observed in EKLF−/− embryos at E10.5 in the peripheral blood and E14.5 in the fetal liver were primarily caused by a loss of EKLF-dependent E2f2 gene expression. We postulated much of the abnormal erythroid differentiation phenotype in EKLF−/− embryos could be the result of aborted entry into S-phase. To test this, we generated Rb/EKLF double heterozygous mice (3Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 30Clark A.J. Doyle K.M. Humbert P.O. Blood. 2004; 104: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and crossed these mice for in vivo BrdUrd incorporation assays. Rb normally binds E2F2 and prevents its inappropriate activity until Rb phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, or CDK6 allows the release of E2F2 and subsequent activation of S-phase. Thus, loss of Rb in EKLF−/− embryos should permit the activity of residual E2F2 and hence S-phase entry. Previous studies have employed this genetic strategy to partially rescue the erythropoietic defects present in E2f2−/− mice (31Dirlam A. Spike B.T. Macleod K.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8713-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At E10.5 (embryonic erythropoiesis) there was no significa"

Here, we show that TGF-β induces phos pho ryl a tion at three sites in the Smad3 linker region in addition to the two C-terminal residues, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 is responsible for phos pho ryl a tion at one of these sites, namely Ser-204. Alanine substitution at Ser-204 and/or the neighboring Ser-208, the priming site for glycogen synthase kinase 3 in vivo activity, strengthened the affinity of Smad3 to CREB-binding protein, suggesting that linker phos pho ryl a tion may be part of a negative feedback loop that modulates Smad3 transcriptional activity.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2008: 29-43Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that the plethora of biological activities of TGF-β is initiated by the binding of the ligand to a heteromeric complex of two types of transmembrane receptors: TβRI and TβRII, each equipped with an intrinsic serine/threonine kinase (3Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Ligand occupancy causes an association between TβRII and TβRI, which results in phosphorylation of TβRI by the constitutively active TβRII. The phosphorylated TβRI then triggers activation of Smad2 and/or Smad3 by phosphorylation at the C-terminal serine residues, forcing Smad2 and Smad3 to dissociate from the membrane-bound receptors and form a heteromeric complex with Smad4 (4Wu J.W.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9845-9858Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), where Smad3 but not full-length Smad2 directly binds to DNA. However, the affinity of Smad3 to DNA does not support a one-on-one stoichiometry binding model in vivo (7Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); instead, Smad3 relies on cooperative binding with other transcription factors to elicit respective Smad-mediated transcriptional responses (3Feng X.H.

The Smad transcriptional complexes have the ability to either activate or repress transcription of a selected set of target genes depending on the nature of associated cofactors and the status of local chromatin structure in the context of signal receiving cells. It is now clear that this Smad-mediated signaling pathway is controlled by or functions in conjunction with Smad-independent mechanisms, such as those governed by MAPKs (9Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

The Smad proteins consist of an N-terminal (MH1) domain that binds DNA and a C-terminal (MH2) domain that interacts with type I receptors, other Smad proteins, and various transcriptional coactivators/corepressors (11Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). These two highly conserved domains are separated by a less conserved linker region. There are four SP/TP sites for proline-directed kinases in both Smad2 and Smad3 linker regions (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). However, except for the first TP site, flanking sequences around the other three SP sites of Smad2 are quite different from those of Smad3, suggesting potentially different modes of regulation between these two proteins. Previously, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, the Ras oncogene, and other activators of the MAPK pathway have been shown to induce phosphorylation of Smad2 and/or Smad3 at these linker sites (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 13Mori S. Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Furukawa F. Tahashi Y. Yamagata H. Sekimoto G. Seki T.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, during cell cycle progression, the Smad3 linker can also be phosphorylated by activated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) during the G1/S phase (15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Many of these phosphorylation events have been reported to have an antagonistic role on Smad3 activity (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 14Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), which may be a mechanism for overriding TGF-β-induced growth arrest by cancer cells expressing high levels of CDKs or oncogenic Ras. Conversely, a synergistic activation effect by linker phosphorylation on Smad3 activity has also been reported (13Mori S. Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Furukawa F. Tahashi Y. Yamagata H. Sekimoto G. Seki T. Matsui H. Nishizawa M. Fujisawa J. Okazaki K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is possible that each phosphorylation event produces a different impact on Smad3 activity through a different underlying molecular mechanism. Further detailed studies of individual phosphorylation sites are needed to clarify the contribution of these linker phosphorylation events to Smad3 function. Here, we report that TGF-β can induce phosphorylation of Smad3 at Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208. We show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) directly phosphorylates Smad3 at Ser-204, whereas a different kinase may be responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-208, which is a prerequisite priming site for GSK3 activity in vivo. We further demonstrate that mutations at Ser-204 and Ser-208 strengthened the transcriptional activity of Smad3 by enhancing its affinity to CBP. Thus, our findings reveal a novel aspect of the Smad3 signaling mechanism, entailing a negative feedback control by phosphorylation of the Smad3 linker region. Full-length Smad3 cDNA (16Zhang Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) were maintained in minimal essential Eagle's medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% FBS. AML12 cells (CRL2254, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% FBS, 40 ng/ml dexamethasone and ITS+ premix (VWR Scientific). Transfections of Hep3B and HEK293 cells were done using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), while transfection of MEFs was carried out with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for small interfering RNA transfection. The methods for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation have been described previously (19Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were performed by harvesting cells in buffer A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nonidet P-40 was added at a final concentration of 0.5%. After an incubation of 10–15 min on ice, the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was isolated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with buffer A and incubated with buffer B containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected as nuclear fraction. Recombinant GST or GST-Smad3 fusion proteins (1 μg) purified from bacteria were incubated with a Myc-tagged TβRI cytoplasmic domain immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells or commercially available activated recombinant JNK2, p38α, Erk2, and GSK3β (Calbiochem) in 1× kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2) at 30 °C. Either 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 μCi/mmol) or 1 mm ATP was included in the reaction. After a 30-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to autoradiography or anti-phospho-Smad3 blotting after electrophoresis using 10% SDS-PAGE. MEFs seeded into 12-well plates were transfected with (CAGA)12-Luc (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar) (0.25 μg), pRK-βgal (28Feng X.H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (0.05 μg), vector control, or Smad3 plasmid (0.01 μg). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% FBS for overnight. Cells were then harvested to measure luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated more than three times, and all values were normalized for transfection efficiency against β-galactosidase activity. To map the GSK3-dependent phosphorylation site within the Smad3 linker, GST-Smad3L phosphorylated by GSK3β in vitro was excised from SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining. The gel slice was subjected to digestion with trypsin and/or Glu-C. The peptides were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled directly on-line with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) as described previously (29Yu L.R. Conrads T.P. Uo T. Kinoshita Y. Morrison R.S. Lucas D.A. Chan K.C. Blonder J. Issaq H.J. Veenstra T.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 896-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The raw tandem mass spectrometry data were searched using SEQUEST (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) against a data base consisting of the human Smad3 protein sequence. The identified phosphopeptides were further examined by manual inspection of the tandem mass spectrometry spectra to confirm identification of the correct peptide sequence and sites of phosphorylation. Smad3 and Smad3 S204A/S208A double mutant (2SPAP) cDNA were subcloned into a pDUALCCM-CMVEGFP shuttle vector (Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) and transferred into an adenovirus genome and produced adenovirus constitutively expressing Smad3 and Smad3 (2SPAP). GFP control adenovirus was also obtained from Vector Biolabs. Infection of AML12 cells was performed in a 60-mm plate at a multiplicity of infection of 100 with a single virus for 2 h in plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium. Infected cells were recovered in regular medium for 24 h and split into 24-well plates. For proliferation assay, cells were incubated with TGF-β (4 ng/ml) for 40 h, and 3H-thymidine was added at the last 4 h. A major event leading to Smad3 activation is the TGF-β-induced, TβRI-mediated phosphorylation at two C-terminal serine residues, Ser-423 and Ser-425, which triggers dissociation of Smad3 from its receptors to form a complex with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus (3Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 8Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in the Smad3 linker region connecting two conserved MH1 and MH2 domains has been considered as part of the mechanisms responsible for cross-talks between TGF-β and other kinase pathways such as ERK, JNK, and p38, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2/4 (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 13Mori S. Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Furukawa F. Tahashi Y. Yamagata H. Sekimoto G. Seki T. Matsui H. Nishizawa M. Fujisawa J. Okazaki K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). When tested initially in mouse C2C12 myoblasts, however, we were surprised to find that TGF-β not only induced C-terminal phosphorylation but also phosphorylation of Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208 in the linker region (Fig. 1A), as evident by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies (15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The onset of these phosphorylation events had similar kinetics as the C-terminal phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the phospho-antibodies was confirmed in Smad3-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the TGF-β-induced linker phosphorylation on Smad3 requires the TβRI, we examined the phosphorylation status of Smad3 in RIBL17 cells, a line of the TβRI-defective mink lung epithelial cells (25Cárcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas in wild type mink lung cells (Mv1Lu) TGF-β was able to induce phosphorylation at Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208 residues, it failed to do so in the RIBL17 cells (Fig. 1C). Stable expression of TβRI restored TGF-β-induced linker phosphorylation in RIBL17 cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the type I receptor is essential. However, it appeared that TβRI is not the kinase that directly phosphorylates Smad3 at these linker sites because purified cytoplasmic domain of TβRI with an intact kinase domain failed to phosphorylate the Smad3 linker sites in vitro, albeit it was capable to phosphorylate the Ser-423 and Ser-425 at the C terminus (Fig. 1D). Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208 of Smad3 are situated immediately N-terminal to a proline residue in the linker region, making them plausible sites for phosphorylation by proline-directed protein kinases. Previously, Thr-179 was shown as a phosphorylation site for CDKs, whereas all three residues were shown as sites for ERK induced by epidermal growth factor (14Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A separate study also reported that Ser-208 could be phosphorylated by JNK in response to hepatocyte growth factor stimulation (13Mori S. Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Furukawa F. Tahashi Y. Yamagata H. Sekimoto G. Seki T. Matsui H. Nishizawa M. Fujisawa J. Okazaki K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because these MAP kinases can be activated by TGF-β as the consequence of non-Smad signaling, we examined whether they had a role in the TGF-β-induced linker phosphorylation of Smad3 in AML12 cells. By treating the cells in the presence of specific kinase inhibitors, we found that neither ERK, p38, nor JNK kinases had any effect on the status of TGF-β-induced linker phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in C2C12 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that one or several different kinases are likely responsible for phosphorylation at the above three sites. Indeed, we found that phosphorylation of Ser-204 was significantly inhibited by a selective GSK3 inhibitor, SB216763 (Fig. 2A). Treating C2C12 cells with LiCl, a potent GSK3 inhibitor, also diminished TGF-β-induced Ser-204 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), whereas phosphorylation at all three sites was blocked by SB431542, a TβRI kinase-specific inhibitor (Fig. 2A). These data reiterated the requirement of TβRI in linker phosphorylation and suggest that GSK3 can phosphorylate Smad3 at least at one site within the linker region. To corroborate the above findings, we probed the role of GSK3 in Ser-204 phosphorylation with two previously verified human GSK3 small interfering RNAs (30Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) in Hep3B cells. The separate knocking down of either GSK3α or GSK3β had little effect on Ser-204 phosphorylation, whereas knockdown of both GSK3 genes simultaneously diminished the phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 2C). As expected, phosphorylation of Ser-208 or the two C-terminal residues Ser-423/Ser-425 was not affected by GSK3-specific small interfering RNA (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that GSK3 activity is required for TGF-β-induced Ser-204 phosphorylation. GSK3 recognizes a (S/T)XXX(S/T) consensus motif on its substrates, in which the first serine or threonine residue of this motif is the actual GSK3 phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation by GSK3 in vivo requires a priming event at the second serine or threonine residue, usually catalyzed by a different kinase (31Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Ser-204 is the only potential GSK3 site in the entire linker region of Smad3. Because phosphorylation of Ser-208 slightly precedes that of Ser-204 (Fig. 1A), this phosphorylation could potentially be the priming event for the GSK3 action at Ser-204. To test this hypothesis, we created point mutations at Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208, respectively, and introduced these Smad3 mutants into the Smad3-deficient cells. Our results showed that alanine substitution at Ser-208 but not Thr-179 abolished phosphorylation at Ser-204, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-208 or Thr-179 was not affected by the mutation of other residues (Fig. 3). These results suggest that prior phosphorylation at Ser-208 is likely required for the subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-204 in vivo. A recent study identified Smad3 in a complex with GSK3 (32Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and we also observed the physical interaction between endogenous GSK3 and Smad3 in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4A) or between the transfected HA-GSK3β and FLAG-Smad3 in Hep3B cells (Fig. 4B) as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The affinity of Smad3 to GSK3 was decreased after TGF-β stimulation, possibly due to a rapid dissociation after phosphorylation. This argues that Ser-204 may be phosphorylated directly by GSK3. To investigate this possibility, we performed in vitro kinase assays on various full-length or truncated Smad3 fragments using purified recombinant GSK3β and found that full-length Smad3, the N-terminal domain plus the linker region (Smad3NL), and the linker fragment (Smad3L) can be phosphorylated by GSK3β (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the C-terminal domain alone (Smad3C) or the GST control was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the phosphorylated GST-Smad3L fusion proteins by tandem mass spectrometry identified a phospho-peptide generated by Glu-C digestion corresponding to residues from 194 to 222 of Smad3 (Fig. 5B). A phosphoserine residue, Ser-204, is present in this peptide, but surprisingly, Ser-208 was also found to be phosphorylated (Fig. 5B). This result was likely caused by the diminished requirement of priming phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro. To further confirm the direct phosphorylation by GSK3 in the linker region, the in vitro kinase assays were repeated on GST-Smad3 fusion protein, and Western blot analysis was conducted using Ser-204 and Ser-208 phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5C, Ser-204 was phosphorylated by GSK3β, ERK, JNK, and p38 in vitro, as was Ser-208, but the efficiency of GSK3β toward Ser-208 was lower in comparison with other kinases. Taken together, the above results demonstrated that Smad3 could be directly phosphorylated by GSK3 at Ser-204.FIGURE 5GSK3 directly phosphorylates Smad3 at Ser-204. A, autoradiography of various GST-Smad3 fusion proteins phosphorylated in vitro for 30 min by recombinant GSK3 in the presence of 32P-labeled ATP.

GSK3 was recently shown to phosphorylate Smad3 at Thr-66 in the N terminus, thereby causing Smad3 to be unstable (32Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To exclude the effect of Thr-66 phosphorylation, we performed this experiment with a T66V mutant Smad3 in MEFs isolated from Smad3-deficient embryos. In the absence of Smad3, TGF-β cannot activate transcription from the (CAGA)12-Luc reporter (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), but this activity can be restored upon transfection of Smad3 T66V, and suppressing GSK3 activity with LiCl treatment further augmented this activity (Fig. 6A). To specifically assess the effect of Ser-204 and Ser-208 phosphorylation on Smad3, we measured the transcriptional activity of Smad3 S204A and S208A mutants and found that these mutants were more potent in restoring TGF-β activation of the (CAGA)12-Luc reporter than their wild type counterparts (Fig. 6B). The S204A/S208A double mutant (2SPAP) exhibited even higher activity in this rescuing experiment (Fig. 6B). Because the expression levels of these mutants were comparable with that of the wild type Smad3, their elevated transcriptional activity was likely due to changes in the phosphorylation status. Next, we examined the effects of S204A and S208A mutants on the growth inhibitory response of TGF-β by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation in AML12 cells that were infected with adenoviruses expressing wild type Smad3 or the S204A/S208A double mutant, 2SPAP. Control GFP adenovirus-infected cells exhibited a normal TGF-β-induced inhibitory response on DNA synthesis in the presence of 10% FBS, as their proliferation was reduced to 44% in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 6C). Overexpression of wild type Smad3 further reduced the proliferation in the presence of TGF-β to 37% as expected. Expression of the Smad3 2SPAP mutant rendered cells even more sensitive to TGF-β-induced growth inhibition, as proliferation was reduced to 21% in comparison with that of untreated cells (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Smad3 at the linker region by GSK3 inhibits Smad3 activity. A recent report showed that phosphorylation of Smad1 linker by ERK and GSK3 enhances interaction between Smad1 and Smurf1, thereby promoting Smad1 degradation (33Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because Smad3 binds to the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 through a PY motif, upstream of Ser-204/Ser-208 in the linker region (19Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser-204 affects Smad3 stability by strengthening the interaction between Smad3 and Smurf2. However, this result was not observed in our experiments as the Ser-204 and/or Ser-208 mutants bound Smurf2 with the same affinity as wild type Smad3 (Fig. 7A), and no change in stability of these mutants was detected compared with wild type Smad3 (data not shown), which was consistent with reports by other laboratories (32Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation within Smad3 linker regions has been shown to prevent nuclear accumulation (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether phosphorylation of Ser-204 has this effect, we examined the intracellular distribution of Smad3 in AML12 cells that had been deprived of serum for overnight and then treated with TGF-β for 1 h. After subfractionating cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, we analyzed the content of various forms of Smad3 in these two fractions by Western blotting. As expected, TGF-β treatment increased nuclear but decreased cytoplasmic content of total Smad3 (Fig. 6B). Under this condition, the C-terminally phosphorylated form of Smad3 (pSer-423/pSer-425) was detected exclusively in the nucleus, whereas the majority of Ser-204 phosphorylated form of Smad3 was also found in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-204 does not prevent nuclear accumulation of Smad3. In light of the increased transcriptional activity of the S204A and 2SPAP mutants (Fig. 7B) and a previous report showing that the linker region of Smad3 can interact physically with transcription coactivator p300/CBP (34Wang G. Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Liu F. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Prokova V. Mavridou S. Papakosta P. Kardassis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3708-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we tested whether phosphorylation of Ser-204 affects the binding between Smad3 and CBP. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with Myc-tagged CBP and FLAG-tagged Smad3 along with the constitutively active TβRI(TD) and then determined binding affinity using immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 8A, activation of the TGF-β pathway by TβRI(TD) induced the interaction between Smad3 and CBP, but the S204A and 2SPAP mutants exhibited even stronger affinity toward CBP after TβRI activation. We also examined the effect of endogenous GSK3 on the interaction between Smad3 and CBP using Smad3-T66V in the absence or presence of LiCl. As shown in Fig. 8B, suppressing GSK3 activity with LiCl greatly enhanced the physical interaction between Smad3 and CBP, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-204 by GSK3 likely inhibits the Smad3 transcriptional activity by reducing its interaction with CBP. In this report, we showed that upon TGF-β stimulation, Smad3 undergoes a relatively rapid phosphorylation at three residues in the linker region in addition to C-terminal phosphorylation and identified GSK3 as the kinase responsible for one of the sites, Ser-204. We further showed that an alanine substitution at Ser-204 strengthened the ability of Smad3 to bind CBP, implying that phosphorylation at this site may decrease the transcriptional activity of Smad3. Thus, our findings suggest that by eliciting these two phosphorylation events simultaneously, TGF-β likely calls on a negative feedback loop to modulate the amplitude of final signaling output. The structurally diverse linker region of Smad proteins harbors a number of kinase recognition motifs and a Smurf binding site. Numerous studies have shown that this region is the convergence point by multiple signaling pathways to attenuate or otherwise modulate downstream cellular responses to the TGF-β family of ligands. For instance, there are four ERK consensus sites present in Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway; phosphorylation at these sites in response to fibroblast growth factors is associated with Smurf1 binding and cytoplasmic retention (33Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 36Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Balancing bone morphogenetic protein signaling through integrating fibroblast growth factor input at the Smad1 linker region is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis during development (37Pera E.M. Ikeda A. Eivers E. De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 38Aubin J. Davy A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are also four MAPK sites in Smad2 and Smad3 linkers; phosphorylation at these sites was attributed as one of the mechanisms that the Ras oncogene uses to counteract the tumor suppressive function of TGF-β (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation within the Smad3 linker was also shown to be catalyzed by CDK2 and CDK4 during the entry into mitosis, leading to decreased expression of CDK inhibitor p15 and thus a subdued TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition (15Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The PY motif in the linker region recognized by the HECT domain E3 ligase Smurf is critical in curtailing Smad functions by allowing Smurf-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (19Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 39Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, the notion that TGF-β also taps into the linker region to moderate Smad3 transcriptional activity is consistent with the regulatory function of this domain. Together with a previous study of Smad1, the current finding on Smad3 linker phosphorylation revealed a general aspect of Smad signaling mechanism. However, not all kinases or the consequential effects of the linker phosphorylation are known. Although ample experimental data have implicated activation of MAPK pathways as part of the non-Smad TGF-β signaling mechanism, our results nevertheless pointed to GSK3, not any MAPK, as the kinase that directly phosphorylates Ser-204 upon TGF-β stimulation. This is reminiscent of the BMP-induced Smad1 linker phosphorylation, which is also independent of MAPK (33Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recently, GSK3 was shown to phosphorylate Thr-66 outside the linker region, which has a role in controlling the basal level of Smad3 through degradation (32Guo X. Ramirez A. Waddell D.S. Li Z. Liu X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In our experiments, alanine substitution of Ser-204 not only had no effect on Smad3 stability, but it also failed to influence Smurf2 binding, suggesting that the negative feedback control exerted by GSK3 over Smad3 differs from its activity at Thr-66 in both location and effect. However, because in most experiments TGF-β treatment was carried out in serum-starved cells, a condition in which GSK3 is constitutively active, phosphorylation of Ser-204 by GSK3 might require input from an unknown priming kinase induced by TGF-β that phosphorylates Ser-208. The different priming kinase activities likely represent two faces of the same GSK3 function as a repressive kinase of TGF-β signaling. Earlier studies also showed cytoplasmic retention of Smad3 phosphorylated by MAPK/Ras and mutated Smad3 lacking all linker phosphorylation sites, suggesting linker phosphorylation could lead to nuclear exclusion of Smad3 precluding it from participating in target gene transcription (12Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that phosphorylation of the Smad1 linker by ERK and GSK3 enables Smad1 to be recognized by Smurf1, which in addition to inducing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Smad1, can dislodge Smad1 binding to nuclear translocation factor Nup214 due to steric hindrance, thus leading to cytoplasmic retention of Smad1 (33Sapkota G. Alarcón C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, we found a majority of the Ser-204 phosphorylated form of Smad3 in the nucleus upon TGF-β stimulation, and alanine substitution at either Ser-204 or Ser-208 did not alter the physical interaction between Smurf2 and Smad3. Instead, the S204A and S208A mutant of Smad3 exhibited heightened affinity toward CBP, suggesting that phosphorylation at these two sites may have direct impact on Smad3 transcriptional activity. The discrepancy between these observations is likely a reflection of the nature of linker mutations used in different experiments and awaits further resolution by more detailed studies. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1977084836,"A heterozygous frameshift mutation causing a 12-amino acid extension to the C terminus of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was recently genetically linked to patients with familial atrial fibrillation (Hodgson-Zingman, D. M., Karst, M. L., Zingman, L. V., Heublein, D. M., Darbar, D., Herron, K. J., Ballew, J. D., de Andrade, M., Burnett, J. C., Jr., and Olson, T. M. (2008) N. Engl. J. Med. 359, 158-165). The frameshift product (fsANP), but not wild-type ANP (wtANP), was elevated in the serum of affected patients, but the molecular basis for the elevated peptide concentrations was not determined. Here, we measured the ability of fsANP to interact with natriuretic peptide receptors and to be proteolytically degraded. fsANP and wtANP bound and activated human NPR-A and NPR-C similarly, whereas fsANP had a slightly increased efficacy for human NPR-B. Proteolytic susceptibility was addressed with novel bioassays that measure the time required for kidney membranes or purified neutral endopeptidase to abolish ANP-dependent activation of NPR-A. The half-life of fsANP was markedly greater than that of wtANP in both assays. Additional membrane proteolysis studies indicated that wtANP and fsANP are preferentially degraded by neutral endopeptidase and serine peptidases, respectively. These data indicate that the familial ANP mutation associated with atrial fibrillation has only minor effects on natriuretic peptide receptor interactions but markedly modifies peptide proteolysis."

Here, we show that HIV-1 RNAs and Gag are transported on endosomal vesicles positive for TiVamp, a v-SNARE involved in fusion events with the plasma membrane. Inhibition of endosomal traffic did not prevent viral release. However, inhibiting lysosomal degradation induced an accumulation of Gag in endosomes and increased viral production 7-fold, indicating that transport of Gag to lysosomes negatively regulates budding. This also suggested that endosomal Gag-RNA complexes could access retrograde pathways to the cell surface and indeed, depleting cells of TiVamp-reduced viral production. Moreover, inhibition of endosomal transport prevented the accumulation of Gag at sites of cellular contact. HIV-1 Gag could thus generate virions using two pathways, either directly from the plasma membrane or through an endosome-dependent route.

Endosomal Gag-RNA complexes may be delivered at specific sites to facilitate cell-to-cell viral transmission. The production of infectious retroviral particles is an ordered process that includes many steps (for review see Refs. 1.Demirov D.G. Freed E.O.

In particular, three major viral components, Gag, the envelope, and genomic RNAs have to traffic inside the cell to reach their assembly site. Viral biogenesis is driven by the polyprotein Gag, which is able to make viral-like particles when expressed alone (4.Accola M.A. Strack B. Gottlinger H.G. J.

Gag is processed by the viral protease into matrix (MA(p17)), capsid (CA(p24)), nucleocapsid (NC(p7)), p6, and smaller peptides SP1 and SP2. Gag contains several domains that are essential for viral assembly: a membrane binding domain (M) in MA; a Gag-Gag interaction domain in CA; an assembly domain (I) in NC; and a late domain (L) in p6, which recruits the cellular budding machinery. Genomic RNAs are specifically recognized by NC, and they play fundamental roles in viral biogenesis by acting as a scaffold for Gag multimerization (5.Muriaux D. Mirro J. Harvin D. Rein A. Proc.

It has been demonstrated that retroviruses bud by hijacking the endosomal machinery that sorts proteins into internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (for review, see Refs. 6.Hurley J.H. Curr.

Indeed, these vesicles bud with the same topology as viral particles. Proteins sorted into this pathway are usually destined for degradation in lysosomes, but some can also recycle to the plasma membrane (for review see Refs. 8.Stoorvogel W. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Raposo G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 9.Trombetta E.S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 975-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). They are also frequently ubiquitinated on their cytoplasmic domain (10.Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 11.Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), allowing their recognition by ESCRT complexes. ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I recognize ubiquitinated cargo present at the surface of endosomes and recruit other ESCRT complexes (12.Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev.

ESCRT-III is believed to function directly in the formation of multivesicular body intralumenal vesicles (12.Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), even though its mechanism of action is currently not understood. Remarkably, Gag L domains interact directly with components of the multivesicular body-sorting machinery (for review see Ref. 15.Bieniasz P.D.

Finally, various ubiquitin ligases are also required directly or indirectly during HIV-1 biogenesis (23.Chung H.Y. Morita E. von Schwedler U. Müller B. Kräusslich H.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4884-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24.Usami Y. Popov S. Popova E. Göttlinger H.G. J.

In many cell lines, Gag is found both at the plasma membrane and in endosomes. This has led to the hypothesis that there are several assembly sites for HIV-1 (1.Demirov D.G. Freed E.O. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3.Morita E. Sundquist W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 395-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). First, Gag can initiate and complete assembly at the plasma membrane. This is thought to occur predominantly in T lymphocytes, and this process is supported by several lines of evidences: (i) disruption of endosomal trafficking with drugs does not prevent viral production (26.Finzi A. Orthwein A. Mercier J. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7476-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27.Jouvenet N. Neil S.J. Bess C. Johnson M.C. Virgen C.A. Simon S.M. Bieniasz P.D. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e435Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); (ii) ESCRT complexes can be recruited at the plasma membrane, at sites where Gag accumulates (28.Deneka M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Byland R. Ruiz-Mateos E. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 29.Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); (iii) Gag can be seen multimerizing and budding from the plasma membrane in live cells (31.Jouvenet N. Bieniasz P.D. Simon S.M. Nature. 2008; 454: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Second, Gag could initiate assembly in endosomes, and then traffic to the cell surface to be released. This is mainly supported by the presence of Gag in endosomes in several cell lines (32.Grigorov B. Arcanger F. Roingeard P. Darlix J.L. Muriaux D. J. Mol.

However, we are currently lacking functional experiments addressing the role of this endosomal pool of Gag, and it is still not clear to what extent it contributes to the production of viral particles. Nevertheless, the presence of Gag in endosomes might facilitate recruitment of ESCRT complexes (34.Sherer N.M. Lehmann M.J. Jimenez-Soto L.F. Ingmundson A. Horner S.M. Cicchetti G. Allen P.G.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2481-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Despite great progress, the traffic of HIV-1 components is still not fully elucidated. In particular, the transport of the genomic RNAs is poorly understood. In this study, we have used single molecule techniques to investigate the trafficking of HIV-1 RNAs in fixed and live cells, and we show that they are transported on endosomal vesicles. We also obtained functional evidence that Gag and viral RNAs can use at least two trafficking pathways to produce virions, one going directly from the plasma membrane and another one passing through endosomes. The pTRIP-MS2×24 and pMS2-YFP plasmids were described previously (47.Boireau S. Maiuri P. Basyuk E. de la Mata M. Knezevich A. Pradet-Balade B. Bäcker V. Kornblihtt A. Marcello A. Bertrand E. J.

Cells were transfected with either Lipofectamine and plus reagent (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To disrupt endosomal pathways, cells were incubated for 6 h with monensin (5 μm), nocodazole (5 μm), or chloroquine (20 μm), with 30 min of pretreatment. Kinetic analyses revealed that similar results were obtained after 2, 4, or 6 h of treatment, and no cellular toxicity was observed (data not shown). To inhibit translation, cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml cycloheximide. To stimulate endosomal exocytosis, cells were treated with 10 μm ionomycin and 3 mm CaCl2. For TiVamp depletion, cells were transfected with siRNAs against TiVamp for 72 h. 5L. Danglot and T. Galli, personal communication. To label early and recycling endosomes, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 1% FBS for 3 h at 37 °C, and then in the same media containing 20 μg/ml Cy3- or Cy5-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. To label Gag-TC, live cells were labeled with ReAsH-EDT2, according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in a non-fluorescent medium (48.Fusco D. Accornero N. Lavoie B. Shenoy S.M. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and plated on a gelatin-coated glass coverslip mounted in an FCS2 chamber kept at 37 °C (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Observations were performed with a wide-field Leica DMRA upright microscope, and images were captured with a Cool-snap HQ charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific). Two-dimensional time series were deconvolved using Huygens (Bitplane) and analyzed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging). RNAs were detected as described previously (48.Fusco D. Accornero N. Lavoie B. Shenoy S.M. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), with oligonucleotide-Cy3 probes specific for the MS2 sequence. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed with 1× PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were saturated for 30 min with 0.2% bovine serum albumin/1× PBS and immunostained for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies. Cells were washed, stained with secondary antibodies, and mounted in Vectashield. Cell culture supernatants were collected and filtered on 0.45-μm membranes. Viral-like particles were purified by centrifugation on 20% sucrose cushion for 2 h at 20,000 × g and analyzed by Western blotting. Viral-like particle production was quantified by direct measurement of light with a charge-coupled device camera (GeneGnome, Ozyme). To analyze RNAs, cellular and viral fractions were incubated in TRIzol (Invitrogen), processed as recommended by the manufacturer, and analyzed by slot-blot hybridization. For infectivity tests, supernatants of HT*A-GFP cells were harvested, and serial dilutions were used to infect indicator HT1080 cells. Three days later, cells were fixed, and infected cells were detected by flow cytometry using the GFP label. Titers were then normalized by measuring the amount of HIV-1 Gag in the supernatants. HT* cells were starved during 30 min in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. Cells were then pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label methionine (Amersham Biosciences), for 10 min at 37 °C, washed three times, and chased in DMEM containing 10% FBS and an excess of unlabeled cysteine and methionine. Drugs were added during the starvation period and maintained throughout the experiment. Cellular and viral fractions were prepared as above and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Fractions were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CA(p24), and Western blots were quantified with a PhosphorImager. Cells were harvested in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0)), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Cells were broken with a ball-bearing cell cracker (41.Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J.M. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and cellular debris. Postnuclear supernatants were loaded onto a 5 to 20% linear Optiprep gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and at 4 °C for 3 h. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blot. Three recombinant adenoviruses were used. The first expressed a tetracycline-regulatable chimeric transcription activator (AdtTA; kindly given by Y. Altschuler (54.Le P.U. Guay G. Altschuler Y. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3371-3379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)). The two others expressed WT dynamin (AdDynWT) or a dominant negative mutant (AdDynK44A), both under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (kindly given by S. L. Schmid (55.Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)). To enhance infection rates, AdtTA (5000pp), AdDynWT (2500pp), and AdDynK44A (2500pp) were diluted in 320 μl of sterile PBS and preincubated with 72 μl of 1 μg/ml polylysine for 30 min at room temperature. HT* cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes for 3–5 h, washed, and incubated with adenoviral mix overnight at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing tetracycline. Cells were then washed and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and tetracycline. Expression of dynamin was finally induced by withdrawing tetracycline from the media. Cells were fixed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde, phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C, washed in phosphate buffer, and post-fixed in 1% osmic acid, 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice in phosphate buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon resin. 85-nm sections were cut with a Leica-Reichert Ultracut E and collected at different levels in each block. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed using a Hitachi 7100 transmission electron microscope (Pleasanton, CA). To study the trafficking of HIV-1 RNA, we used a reporter that carried all the elements required for RNA production and packaging (pTRIP-MS2×24 (Fig. 1A)) (47.Boireau S. Maiuri P. Basyuk E. de la Mata M. Knezevich A. Pradet-Balade B. Bäcker V. Kornblihtt A. Marcello A. Bertrand E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar): the 5′ long terminal repeat, the major splice donor site (SD1), the packaging signal, the Rev-responsive element, the splice acceptor site (A7), and the 3′ long terminal repeat that drives 3′-end formation. In addition, this reporter was tagged with 24 binding sites for the coat protein of phage MS2, because the use of MS2-YFP fusions allows its visualization in live cells with single molecule sensitivity (48.Fusco D. Accornero N. Lavoie B. Shenoy S.M. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To avoid overexpression levels often obtained with transient transfection, we worked with three stable cell lines: HT*, which expresses HIV-1 Gag, Gag-Pol, Tat, and Rev proteins; HT*A, which is derived from HT* and expresses the amphotropic MLV envelope; and HT*A-GFP, which is similar to HT*A, but in addition contains a packageable HIV-1 RNA-encoding GFP. To verify that binding of MS2-YFP molecules to the reporter RNA did not affect its incorporation into viral particles, we expressed pTRIP-MS2×24 RNAs and compared their packaging efficiency in the presence and absence of MS2-YFP. As previously observed for MLV, MS2-YFP had no adverse effect (data not shown (41.Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J.M. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). We next co-transfected pTRIP-MS2×24 with pMS2-YFP in HT* cells and performed live cell microscopy. In HT* cells, but not in the parental cell line that expressed no viral components, rectilinear movements of HIV-1 RNAs were observed (Fig. 1B, supplemental movies S1–S5, and data not shown). Because we had previously observed that MLV RNAs are transported on endosomal vesicles (41.Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J.M. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this was also the case for HIV-1. HT* cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing MS2-YFP, pTRIP-MS2×24, and TiVamp-CFP, a v-SNARE specific for late endosomes (also referred as Vamp7 (56.Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)). By two-color imaging, we observed that a fraction of HIV-1 RNAs co-localized with the endosomal marker in living cells (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we were able to visualize simultaneous movements of TiVamp vesicles and HIV-1 RNAs (Fig. 1D and supplemental movies S1–S5). To ensure that these observations were not an artifact induced by MS2-YFP binding, we examined the localization of HIV-1 RNAs by FISH. HT*A cells were co-transfected with pTRIP-MS2×24 and TiVamp-CFP, fixed, and processed such that single molecules of the viral RNA were efficiently detected (48.Fusco D. Accornero N. Lavoie B. Shenoy S.M. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Two distinct patterns were observed (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results obtained in live cells, HIV-1 RNAs were first found throughout the cytoplasm and in late endosomes, in 57% of the cells. In the remaining cells, a second pattern was observed in which RNAs were diffuse and did not show any particular localization. Similar results were obtained in HT* cells (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that HIV-1 RNAs, like MLV RNAs (41.Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J.M. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), can travel through the cytoplasm on endosomal vesicles. Because Gag is responsible for the recognition and packaging of genomic RNAs and is also essential for viral biogenesis, we investigated its trafficking. Late endosomes were identified with TiVamp-CFP, early and recycling endosomes with fluorescent transferrin, and HIV-1 Gag was detected by immunofluorescence with an antibody against CA(p24), which recognizes both processed and unprocessed forms of Gag. Similar to the case of HIV-1 RNAs, several patterns were observed (Fig. 2B). In the most frequent one (67% of the cells), Gag was diffuse in the cytoplasm. In the second pattern (33% of the cells), Gag was also present in intracellular vesicles corresponding mainly to late endosomes (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). These endosomes were not deep invaginations of plasma membrane, as proposed in other systems (28.Deneka M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Byland R. Ruiz-Mateos E. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 57.Welsch S. Keppler O.T. Habermann A. Allespach I. Krijnse-Locker J. Kräusslich H.G. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), because they were negative for the plasma membrane marker CD44 (data not shown). In addition, endosomal Gag did not correspond to endocytosed virions produced by surrounding cells (supplemental Fig. S2). We also noted that a minute amount of Gag was present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). This is different from the strong enrichment observed in transient transfection (58.Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Martin-Serrano J. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9560-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 9A), but the high expression levels obtained in these conditions are known to induce the association of Gag with the plasma membrane (58.Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Martin-Serrano J. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9560-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we noted that, in our cell lines, Gag was frequently concentrated at sites of cellular contact (Fig. 2B and see Fig. 11B). In conclusion, although HIV-1 Gag and its genomic RNAs were predominantly diffuse in the cytoplasm, they were also present in endosomal compartments. To gain functional insights into the endosomal trafficking of HIV-1 Gag and genomic RNA, we used drugs that disrupted endosomal pathways: (i) monensin, an ionophore that neutralizes acidic intracellular compartments and leads to defects in vesicular budding; (ii) nocodazole, which depolymerizes microtubules and blocks motorized transport; and (iii) chloroquine, which inhibits late en"

The Dps pores are called “ferritin-like” because of the structural resemblance to the 3-fold channels of 24-subunit ferritins used for iron entry and exit to and from the protein cage. In ferritins, negatively charged residues lining the pores generate a negative electrostatic gradient that guides iron ions toward the ferroxidase centers for catalysis with oxidant and destined for the mineralization cavity.

The results, discussed in the framework of crystal growth in a confined space, indicate that iron uses the hydrophilic 3-fold pores to traverse the protein shell. For the first time, the strength of the electrostatic potential is observed to modulate kinetic cooperativity in the iron uptake/release processes and accordingly the size distribution of the microcrystalline iron minerals in the Dps protein population.

For the first time, the strength of the electrostatic potential is observed to modulate kinetic cooperativity in the iron uptake/release processes and accordingly the size distribution of the microcrystalline iron minerals in the Dps protein population. The widely distributed bacterial Dps proteins (1.Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. Biometals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2.Morikawa K. Ohniwa R.L. Kim J. Maruyama A. Ohta T. Takeyasu K. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) belong to the ferritin superfamily and are characterized by strong similarities (3.Liu X. Theil E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) but also distinctive differences with respect to “canonical” ferritins, the ubiquitous iron storage, and detoxification proteins found in biological systems. The structural resemblance is apparent in the overall molecular assemblage because both Dps proteins and ferritins are shell-like oligomers constructed from four-helix bundle monomers. However, Dps proteins are 12-mers of identical subunits that assemble with 23 symmetry, whereas ferritins are built by 24 highly similar or identical subunits related by 432 symmetry. The functional similarities consist in the common capacity to remove Fe(II) from cytoplasm, catalyze its oxidation, and store Fe(III) thus produced in the protein cavity, wherefrom the metal can be mobilized when required by the organism. However, ferritins use molecular oxygen as iron oxidant with the production of hydrogen peroxide, whereas Dps proteins prefer hydrogen peroxide, which is typically about 100-fold more efficient than molecular oxygen (1.Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. Biometals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This difference is of major importance because it renders Dps proteins capable of removing concomitantly Fe(II) and H2O2 whose combination leads to the production of reactive oxygen species via Fenton chemistry (4.Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 395-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). This capacity confers H2O2 resistance and hence may be a virulence factor in certain pathogens (e.g. Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus mutans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis) because the H2O2 burst represents one of the first defense lines of the host during infection (5.Ishikawa T.

In both 24-subunit ferritins and 12-subunit Dps proteins, the subunit assemblage creates pores across the protein shell that put the internal cavity in communication with the external medium. In ferritins there are two types of pores: largely hydrophobic ones along the axes with 4-fold symmetry and hydrophilic ones along the axes with 3-fold symmetry. The latter channels are funnel-shaped, with the smaller opening toward the protein cavity, and are lined with conserved glutamic and aspartic residues located in the narrow region of the funnel (8.Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These 3-fold pores were recognized to provide the route for iron entry into the protein cavity soon after resolution of the horse ferritin x-ray crystal structure (9.Stefanini S. Desideri A. Vecchini P. Drakenberg T. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Later site-directed mutagenesis studies defined the role of specific residues (Asp131 and Glu134) that line the pore (10.Treffry A. Bauminger E.R. Hechel D. Hodson N.W. Nowik I. Yewdall S.J. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11.Levi S. Santambrogio P. Corsi B. Cozzi A. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas electrostatic calculations related the passage of iron to the existence of a gradient that drives metal ions toward the protein interior cavity (12.Douglas T. Ripoll D.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13.Takahashi T. Kuyucak S. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More recently, the 3-fold symmetry pores were shown to be involved also in the exit process of iron from the protein cavity. Thus, in H-frog ferritin used as model system, iron exit is affected by local protein unfolding promoted by site-specific mutagenesis of individual amino acid residues (14.Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15.Jin W. Takagi H. Pancorbo B. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), by the use of chaotropes (16.Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and by means of selected peptides designed to bind at these channels (17.Liu X.S. Patterson L.D. Miller M.J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31821-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In Dps proteins, the protein shell is breached by two types of pores along the 3-fold axes, one type is formed by the N-terminal portion of the monomers and bears a strong similarity to the typical 3-fold channels of 24-subunit ferritins in that it is funnel-shaped, hydrophilic, and lined by conserved, negatively charged residues. It was therefore named “ferritin-like” and assumed to be involved in iron entry into the protein cavity upon resolution of the Listeria innocua x-ray crystal structure (18.Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The other type of pore is formed by the C-terminal ends of the monomers and was called “Dps type” because it is created at a subunit interface that is unique to Dps proteins. Although somewhat variable in length and in the size of the openings, the Dps type pore is mainly hydrophobic in nature (19.Franceschini S. Ceci P. Alaleona F. Chiancone E. Ilari A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4913-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The present paper investigates the role of the ferritin-like pores in the iron uptake and release processes in Dps proteins using the well characterized L. innocua Dps (LiDps) as a model system (18.Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20.Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In LiDps, the ferritin-like pores contain a set of three aspartate residues, Asp121, Asp126, and Asp130 that would be encountered in succession by a metal ion that is attracted by the electrostatic gradient they create and moves down the funnel-shaped pore toward the protein cavity (Fig. 1). Asp130, which is located in the narrowest part of the funnel, is conserved significantly among Dps proteins (∼ 80%), whereas Asp121 and Asp126 are less conserved (Fig. 1). Such considerations were used in the design of site-specific variants D121N, D126N, D130N, and D121N/D126N/D130N to elucidate the function of the ferritin-like pores in Dps proteins.The results demonstrate that iron uses the LiDps ferritin-like pores to enter and leave the protein shell and hence that these pores have the same role as the structurally similar 3-fold channels in 24-subunit ferritins. LiDps residue Asp130 is the most important determinant of the negative electrostatic gradient because of its location in the narrow part of the pores. Importantly, the data show for the first time that the electrostatic gradient at the pores modulates cooperativity in the iron uptake process and influences the size distribution of the iron core (23.Ricard J. Kellershohn N. Mulliert G. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The effect of the electrostatic gradient can be explained in terms of the electrostatic interaction effects between the fixed negative charges of the aspartate residues at the pores and the mobile positive charges of iron ions.RESULTSTo elucidate the role of the ferritin-like pores in the management of iron by Dps proteins, site-specific variants of the aspartate residues that line these pores in L. innocua Dps (LiDps) have been designed, and their behavior in the iron uptake and release processes has been investigated in comparison with the wild type protein. With regard to the iron uptake reaction, the kinetics of the various steps, namely Fe(II) binding, Fe(II) oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, and formation of the iron core, were followed; in addition the molecular mass (size) distribution of the iron core was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation in sedimentation velocity experiments.Fe(II) Binding to the Ferroxidase CenterThe ferroxidase centers of LiDps are located at the interface between 2-fold symmetry related monomers that contribute the iron ligands. Fe(II) binding to the ferroxidase center results in the quenching of the protein intrinsic fluorescence given the presence of a tryptophan residue (Trp32) at less than 5 Å (22.Su M. Cavallo S. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In LiDps, the stoichiometry of Fe(II) binding under anaerobic conditions corresponds to 12 Fe(II)/dodecamer (22.Su M. Cavallo S. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On this basis, the kinetics of Fe(II) binding was followed in anaerobic stopped flow experiments by measuring quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence upon addition of 12 Fe(II) to LiDps and its pore variants D121N, D126N, D130N, and D121N/D126N/D130N. In LiDps and in the D121N and D126N variants, the binding reaction is fast and is complete within the dead time of the instrument (≤3.0 ms). In contrast, Fe(II) binding to D130N and to the triple variant occurs at significantly slower rates and is characterized by a half-time of about 650 ms and 11 s, respectively (Fig. 2). The fact that the extent of quenching is the same for LiDps and all of the variants is in accord with the expectation that the site-specific mutations at the 3-fold ferritin-like pores have only a very localized structural effect.FIGURE 2Aspartate residues at the L. innocua Dps ferritin-like pores control the rate of Fe(II) binding at the catalytic centers, measured as fluorescence quenching of the Trp32 residue. The Fe(II) binding to the catalytic centers was monitored after mixing a 1.5 μm protein solution with a 18.0 μm FeSO4 solution. Excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the whole emission fluorescence signal up to 320 was recorded. The kinetic curves are representative of three to five experiments with two or three independent protein preparations. LiDps, D121N, and D126N binding kinetics are complete in the stopped flow mixing dead time (less than 3.0 ms). LiDps (solid line), D130N (dashed line), and D121N/D126N/D130N (dotted line).

The iron/protein molar ratio was 12:1 to monitor exclusively ferroxidation at the catalytic centers. Under these conditions the rate of ferroxidation by molecular oxygen in the presence of LiDps is extremely slow (24.Ilari A. Latella M.C. Ceci P. Ribacchi F. Su M. Giangiacomo L. Stefanini S. Chasteen N.D. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 1:1 iron/hydrogen peroxide molar ratio was used to ensure full oxidation of the metal in the absence of protein (Fenton reaction stoichiometry).When LiDps, D121N, and D126N are present, iron oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is about 70 times faster than the control reaction measured in the absence of protein. In contrast, the oxidation rate is increased only about 3-fold relative to control in the presence of the D130N variant and is unaffected when the triple variant D121N/D126N/D130N is present (Fig. 3 and Table 1).FIGURE 3Aspartate 130, at the L. innocua Dps ferritin-like pores, is required for fast Fe(II) oxidation by hydrogen peroxide.

For all of the proteins examined the kinetics of core formation is sigmoid, as expected for crystal formation that entails a slow nucleation step followed by fast, cooperative growth of the crystal. Notably, the absorbance values at the end of the reaction are alike, although the autocatalytic behavior displays significant variations (Fig. 4). Thus, the D121N and D126N are indistinguishable from LiDps, whereas kinetic cooperativity is less pronounced, and the half-time of the reaction is longer in the D130N variant and even more so in the triple variant relative to the wild type protein (Table 1).FIGURE 4Iron mineralization kinetics in the presence of L. innocua Dps and its ferritin-like pores mutants.

The sedimentation profile of the wild type protein shows two clearly resolved peaks, one corresponding to the apoprotein (10 ± 0.5 S) and the other to heavily mineralized protein (∼19 S; 17.Liu X.S.

The sedimentation pattern of the D130N mutant likewise displays two peaks (∼10.5 and ∼16.5 S) attributable to iron-poor and iron-rich protein, in accord with the decreased cooperativity of the uptake process, which favors formation of partially filled protein molecules. This tendency is even more marked in the triple mutant where the iron-poor peak is centered at ∼12 S and the iron rich one at ∼16 S. A small heavier component (∼30 S) is also present that may be attributed to formation of a small amount of Fe(III) aggregates in solution (see below).FIGURE 5Size distribution of the iron core in the protein cavity of L. innocua Dps and its D130N and D121N/D126N/D130N variants. The iron distribution in the proteins was assayed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Mineralized LiDps, D130N, and D121N/D126N/D130N samples were prepared at 2.0 μm protein concentration by the addition of 480.0 μm FeSO4 (A; 240 Fe(III)/dodecamer) in one increment or 900.0 μm FeSO4 (B; 450 Fe(III)/dodecamer) in three increments, in MOPS, 100.0 mm, pH 7.0.

Therefore, to better appreciate the effect of added iron on the mineral distribution in the LiDps wild type and mutant proteins, subsaturating amounts of 450 iron atoms were added to each, in three successive 150-atom aliquots (Fig. 5B). For LiDps, part of the protein remains iron-free and part becomes fully mineralized (∼20.5 S), whereas in the two mutants iron is distributed more homogeneously throughout the population of protein molecules. As a result, in the D130N mutant and in the D121N/D126N/D130N mutant, the iron-rich peak dominates (∼17 S). The sedimentation profiles of the proteins mineralized with 450 Fe(III)/dodecamer display an additional peak at around 30 S, even though the samples contain 1.0 mm citrate. This additional peak is significantly larger when citrate is omitted (data not shown), indicating that they are ferric oxyhydroxide particles that are formed outside the protein and are dissolved by citrate.Release of Iron from the Ferric Oxyhydroxide CoreSamples of LiDps and the 3-fold ferritin-like pore variants containing 240 Fe(III)/dodecamer have been used to study iron release from the protein cavity. The release process was triggered by reduction of the ferric oxyhydroxide core with either a NADH/FMN mixture under aerobic conditions or a sodium dithionite solution under anaerobic conditions and was monitored as formation of the [Fe+2-bipyridyl3] complex at 522 nm (Fig. 6, A and B).

The reduction of intercellular adhesion in a solid tumor is a critical step in the progression of tumor cells to metastasis (1.Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In normal epithelial tissues, α-catenin localizes to junctions that organize at the interface between adjacent epithelial cells through clustering of cell surface adhesion transmembrane molecule cadherin and its association to the cytoskeleton (10.Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 11.Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Shu W. Drobnjak M. Kakonen S.M. Cordón-Cardo C. Guise T.A. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). On the extracellular side, structural studies suggest that cadherin molecules form molecular pairs that interact with cadherin pairs on an adjacent cell through their distal Ca2+-binding domains (12.Patel S.D. Chen C.P. Bahna F. Honig B. Shapiro L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the intracellular side, cadherin pairs are connected to the cytoskeleton network through specific linker proteins. Until recently it was believed that one critical linker protein between the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton was α-catenin, because it can both bind filamentous actin (F-actin) and E-cadherin through β-catenin (13.Perez-Moreno M. Fuchs E. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 601-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14.Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, a recent study indicates that α-catenin can either bind the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex as monomer or cross-link actin filaments as homodimer but cannot bind both E-cadherin-β-catenin and F-actin simultaneously (15.Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether the loss of α-catenin plays a direct role in the loss of adhesion in human cancer cells is unclear. Our recent data using engineered Chinese hamster ovarian cells suggest that α-catenin mediates the rapid strengthening of individual intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds following initial molecular recognition between cells bearing E-cadherin molecules (16.Bajpai S. Correia J. Feng Y. Figueiredo J. Sun S.X. Longmore G.D. Suriano G. Wirtz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18331-18336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-catenin mediates the formation of additional E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds once a first bond is formed between adjoining cells to form a nascent intercellular junction (16.Bajpai S. Correia J. Feng Y. Figueiredo J. Sun S.X. Longmore G.D. Suriano G. Wirtz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18331-18336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesize that the loss of cytoplasmic protein α-catenin in human cancer cells greatly affects the ability of E-cadherin molecules on the surface of these cells to form firm adhesion by reducing the strength of individual intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds. Our strategy is to compare parental breast cancer cells that lack α-catenin (MDA-MB-468 cells; denoted here MDA468) with these cells when α-catenin is introduced and exploit high resolution live cell single-molecule force spectroscopy (17.Dobrowsky T.M. Panorchan P. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 89: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to probe the strength of individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between adjacent cells (18.Panorchan P. Thompson M.S.

The cells are juxtaposed for a controlled time of contact, the probability of successful interactions is subsequently measured, and the mechanical properties (tensile strength, molecular stiffness, and reactive compliance) and biochemical properties (interaction energy, dissociation rate, and bond lifetime) of single intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds are analyzed. Our main hypothesis cannot be readily tested using purified proteins. Our ability to measure molecular interactions between live cells (17.Dobrowsky T.M. Panorchan P. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 89: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) rather than recombinant proteins ensures that the proper orientation of cadherin on the cell surfaces and its post-translational modifications are physiological. Moreover, using living cells ensures that the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane receptors (here human E-cadherin) can interact with cytoplasmic proteins (in particular β-catenin and α-catenin), thereby allowing cell signaling pathways that can influence cell adhesion to function normally. MDA-MB-468 is a human breast carcinoma cell line derived from a 51-year-old black female (19.Cailleau R. Olivé M. Cruciger Q.V. In Vitro. 1978; 14: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). MDA468 cells show no measurable expression of α-catenin (see Fig. 1). MDA468 cells where α-catenin was stably transfected are those described in Ref. 20.Marie H. Pratt S.J. Betson M. Epple H. Kittler J.T. Meek L. Moss S.J. Troyanovsky S. Attwell D. Longmore G.D.

Parental MDA468 and MDA468 cells engineered to stably express α-catenin were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. These cells were cultured in DMEM-10 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin). A 70% confluent T-25 flask, incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, was harvested for loading cells on molecular force probe cantilevers, as well as plated on a bottom culture dish. The cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and incubated with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 min, resuspended in 5 ml of cell culture medium. The cells were then plated for normal passing into a new T-25 flask, mixing 1 ml of resuspended cells in 4 ml of fresh culture medium. Prior to molecular force probe measurements, the cells were passed into a 50-mm Corning dish and incubated overnight. For all procedures that had to be conducted outside of the incubator, the culture medium was supplemented with 2% HEPES (Invitrogen) to control pH. For the preparation of cell lysates, subconfluent cultures of the cells in p100 cell culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease mixture freshly added) were added to the plates and collected with cell lifter, vortexed in Eppendoff tubes, and maintained on ice for 10 min with vortex every 2 min to obtain the cell lysates. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay reagent (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). For Western blot analysis, 20 μg of cell lysate were mixed equal volume of 2× SDS protein loading buffer, boiled, and loaded to each lane. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and each panel was immunoblotted with antibodies as described in the figure. Standard flow cytometry was used to quantify possible changes in cell surface expression of E-cadherin (see Fig. 2c). Briefly, single cells were suspended in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum) and incubated with primary HECD1 anti-human E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Lab, San Francisco, CA) for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed twice in staining buffer and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor secondary antibody for 30 min in the dark and washed thoroughly. The stained cells were immediately used for measurements of cell surface expression using flow cytometry. IgG1 type anti-mouse antibody was used as isotype control (Sigma). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed these results (Fig. 2b). For immunofluorescence microscopy studies, the cells were plated on glass-bottomed dishes and fixed according to the standard protocol. Mouse anti-human α-catenin monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) was used for staining the fixed samples for α-catenin. atomic force microscope. atomic force microscope. The softest available AFM cantilevers, with nominal force constant around 10 pN/nm, were used (model MLCT-AUHW; Veeco Instruments, Plainview, NY). Cantilevers were cleaned thoroughly with 70% EtOH, 10% HCl solution, ultrapure water, and 95% EtOH for 1 min each, followed by 5 min washing with acetone. The cleaned cantilever was immediately used for loading cells or incubated at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline for later use. A flame-blown borosilicate microneedle (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) was used to deposit four or five cells on the tip of the AFM cantilever. The procedure was carried out using a temperature-controlled TE-2000 Nikon microscope, using a 10× Plan Fluor objective (N.A. 0.3) and an Eppendorf Transjector 5246 (Brinkmann Instruments, Riverview, FL). pH in the medium was maintained using 2% HEPES. Cells deposited on the cantilevers were allowed to spread overnight. Single-molecule force spectroscopic measurements were made using a piconewton sensitive molecular force probe (MFP-1D; Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). The cantilever carrying cells was brought in contact for 1 ms with a bottom layer of cells (plated on a 50-mm dish) and retracted. Prior to single-molecule force spectroscopic measurements, the 50-mm Corning dish with plated cells was washed thoroughly with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and was filled with 5 ml of serum-free medium supplemented with 2% HEPES, preheated to 37 °C. The rupture of intercellular bonds could be visualized as sharp peaks in the force-distance curves (see Fig. 1). The cantilevers were calibrated for their rigidity and optical lever sensitivity. The method of thermal resonance was used for calibrating the force constant, whereas the inverse of optical sensitivity was obtained by lowering the cantilever on a hard surface by a known distance and measuring the corresponding voltage signal (17.Dobrowsky T.M. Panorchan P. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 89: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18.Panorchan P. Thompson M.S. Davis K.J. Tseng Y. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because calibration of the cantilever involves large impingement forces leading to rupture of cell and/or detachment of the cell from the cantilever, calibration was done at the end of the experiments, as per the manufacturers' protocol. Depending on the calibration, the height of the peak yielded the force required to break a bond. Using the built-in digital camera in the molecular force probe body, the cantilever was lowered at a specified velocity. Approximately 30 force-distance curves for a given retraction velocity were collected per cell. The cantilever was then moved to another location in the dish to ensure proper sampling. To move the cantilever to a new location on the plated cells, the cantilever was manually raised, and the plated cells were shifted using side screws. Data collection and analysis were conducted using IgorPro 4.09 software (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). The loading rate applied on an intercellular bond was calculated as the product of the retraction velocity and the slope of the force curve immediately before bond rupture (see Fig. 1). Only the last rupture in a force-distance curve was analyzed, because the strength of the last bond could be modulated by the presence of earlier bonds. The noise in measurements was <10 pN; subsequently, all ruptures smaller than the noise were disregarded. The measured ruptures were binned, using 5-pN-wide bins. The force distribution for a given velocity was fitted using Hummer and Szabo's model, and corresponding fitting parameters were obtained by the random search method (21.Dudko O.K. Hummer G. Szabo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15755-15760Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). To evaluate the loading rate dependence of bond strengths, 100 pN/s wide bins were used below 1000 pN/s, and 1000-pN/s bins were used between 1000 pN/s and 10,000 pN/s. A 96-well plate was used to grow cells to confluence. It was ensured that the entire well was covered with a monolayer of cells. Just prior to the assay, each well was washed thoroughly to ensure that all rounded/floating cells were removed. Cells tagged with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's protocol were introduced into each well at 104 cells/well. The tagged cells were allowed to adhere to the monolayer of cells in each well for 1 h, followed by inversion of the 96-well plate for 6 min, using a static adhesion chamber (GlycoTech, Gaithersburg, MD). The cells that fell off were allowed to settle down at the base of the inverted chamber. The base plate was then removed. Pre- and post-inversion readings of the fluorescence intensity in each well was measured using a fluorescence plate reader. The ratio of the fluorescence reading in each well after inversion to that before inversion related to the degree of cell-cell adhesion; the higher the ratio, the greater the extent of cell-cell adhesion. For E-cadherin function-blocking controls, plated cells were treated with HECD1 anti-human E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Lab) at a concentration of 200 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Postincubation, 4 ml of serum-free medium was added, and the cells were immediately used for measurements. The main hypothesis of this study is that the loss of α-catenin in certain human breast cancer cells causes a failure of E-cadherin molecules on the surface of these cells to form strong individual intercellular bonds. Using live cell single-molecule force spectroscopy, we probed the biomechanical and biochemical properties of individual cadherin bonds formed between two juxtaposed living parental MDA468 breast cancer cells, which lack α-catenin, or MDA468 cells where α-catenin is expressed (Fig. 1a). Single cells were delicately placed and allowed to spread on the surface of soft triangular cantilevers using weakly adhesive microneedles under a light microscope (Fig. 1b). The rigidity of the cantilever (5–20 pN/nm) was measured prior to each experiment to measure adhesion forces between cadherin molecules forming individual bonds on opposing cells with piconewton force resolution. The cell on the cantilever was gently brought into contact with a cell on a bottom culture dish (Fig. 1b). The repeated approach and retraction of the top cell to and from the bottom cell set at a controlled retraction velocity (either 5 or 30 μm/s) produced force displacement spectra, which were recorded with high temporal resolution (Fig. 1c). The presence of an abrupt drop in the spectrum indicated the rupture of an intercellular bond between the top and bottom cells (Fig. 1c, arrows). Fig. 1c shows typical features exhibited by force displacement curves, including the rupture of no intercellular bond, one bond, and more than one bond during the retraction of the top cell from the bottom cell. The height of the force drop is the tensile strength of the bond that was formed upon cell contact, and the product of the retraction velocity by the slope of the force spectrum just prior to bond rupture is the loading rate applied to that bond (Fig. 1c). The time of contact (typically 1 ms) and impingement force (200–500 pN) were adjusted to allow for only very few successful binding interactions to occur between E-cadherin molecules on the surfaces of adjacent cells. These conditions allowed us to target ∼28% of force-distance spectra displaying at least one bond rupture event (Fig. 1d). In these conditions, the probabilities of forming a single adhesive bond, two bonds, and three bonds upon cell-cell contact are 85, 12, and <2%, respectively (22.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). MDA468 cancer cells express a wide range of adhesion molecules on their surface, including integrin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (C-CAM), and E-cadherin. To ensure that our measurements of intercellular adhesion are mainly due to Ca2+-activated E-cadherin, cells were either treated with chelating molecule EDTA or treated with a specific anti-E-cadherin function-blocking monoclonal antibody. In both cases, the probability of interactions between cancer cells was reduced to background levels (Fig. 1d). These levels of interactions are comparable with those between a bare cantilever (no cell present) and cells on the bottom dish (data not shown). These results indicate that our single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements are specific and that binding interactions between individual cancer cells are dominated by homotypic E-cadherin interactions. We developed a cell line stably expressing α-catenin based on the parental MDA468 cell line (Fig. 2). Notably, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2a), immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2b), and flow cytometry (Fig. 2c) suggested that MDA468 parental cells and α-catenin-positive cells showed the same levels of expression of E-cadherin. A simple global cell adhesion assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that global intercellular adhesion (as opposed to single-molecule level adhesion) was significantly increased in α-catenin-expressing MDA468 cells compared with α-catenin-lacking MDA468 cells (Fig. 1e). Because levels of surface expression of E-cadherin were similar (Fig. 2), this result suggests that that the lower cell-cell adhesion for MDA468 cells is caused by the absence of α-catenin. We sought to determine whether this loss of global intercellular adhesion was due to an increased adhesion strength of individual intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy (17.Dobrowsky T.M. Panorchan P. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 89: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we characterized the force required to rupture individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds (also called the tensile strength or de-adhesion force of the bond) as a function of the loading rate on the bonds (Fig. 3a). We found that the mean tensile strengths of homotypic E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between parental cells and between α-catenin-expressing cells increased both logarithmically with loading rate. Such a micromechanical response is observed for a wide range of ligand-receptor pairs, including P-selectin-CD44 (23.Konstantopoulos K. Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R611-R613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), selectin-PSGL-1 (24.Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Konstantopoulos K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), N-cadherin/N-cadherin (18.Panorchan P. Thompson M.S. Davis K.J. Tseng Y. Konstantopoulos K. Wirtz D. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and VE-cadherin/VE-cadherin bonds (25.Panorchan P. George J.P. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Importantly, the mean tensile strength of E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between parental cells was significantly lower than the tensile strength of E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between α-catenin-expressing cells over a wide range of loading rates (Fig. 3, a and b). Because rupture forces are distributed (see Fig. 5), we also compared the most probable bond rupture forces at given loading rates and found similar trends (Fig. 3, b and c) (26.Ray C. Brown J.R. Akhremitchev B.B. Langmuir. 2007; 23: 6076-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, forced expression of α-catenin greatly increases the strength of single E-cadherin adhesion bonds. From fits of the mean bond strength versus loading rate using Bell model analysis (24.Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Konstantopoulos K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27.Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar), we extracted the unstressed dissociation rate, koffo, and the reactive compliance, xβ, of single E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between parental breast cancer cells and E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between α-catenin-expressing cells, respectively (Fig. 4, a and b). The unstressed dissociation rate describes the rate at which spontaneous unbinding between cadherin molecules on opposing cells occurs; the reactive compliance describes the effective molecule length over which cadherin molecules on opposing cells disengage from each other upon unbinding. We found that the absence of α-catenin in parental cells caused a significant increase in the unstressed dissociation rate (Fig. 4b). Accordingly, the unstressed bond lifetime, 1/koffo, was increased 7-fold for cells expressing α-catenin (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that the loss of α-catenin in cancer cells resulted in much shorter lived cadherin bonds between cells. The reactive compliance of individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds was also different: 0.76 nm versus 0.51 nm for MDA468 cells and α-catenin-expressing MDA468 cells, respectively (Fig. 4d). A higher reactive compliance indicates E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between cancer cells that lack α-catenin are more prone to rupture than the same cells where α-catenin is expressed. We note that bond lifetimes determined by fitting force spectra to Bell's model have values that can be at variance with values obtained by direct measurements of bond lifetimes (28.Marshall B.T. Sarangapani K.K. Lou J. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1458-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although this discrepancy can be attributed to the difference in model systems used (live cell in our case compared with purified proteins), this difference in absolute values does not alter our main conclusions regarding the role played by α-catenin in cell-cell adhesion. The forces required to rupture individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds were distributed (Fig. 5, a and b). For a given retraction velocity, the distribution of bond forces can be fitted using the Bell model (24.Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Konstantopoulos K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27.Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). We found excellent agreement between measured and theoretical force distributions for both parental cells and α-catenin-expressing cells (Fig. 5, a and b). Because the Evans-Ritchie model assumes a single dissociation rate and a single reactive compliance, this agreement indicates that indeed one type of adhesive bonds dominates intercellular interactions between MDA468 cells and α-catenin MDA468 cells (confirming results in Fig. 1d) and that other adhesion molecules, such as integrin and C-CAM, contribute little to intercellular adhesion at least at short contact times. Using the recent analysis of single-molecule force spectroscopy data by Dudko et al. (21.Dudko O.K. Hummer G. Szabo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15755-15760Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), we extracted the effective energy of interaction, Ea, of individual intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds from the theoretical fits of force distributions (Fig. 5, a and b). We found that the relative depth of the energy barrier for the rupture of individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between α-catenin-expressing cells was significantly deeper than for E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between parental cells, which lack α-catenin (Fig. 5, c and d). This result indicates that intracellular protein α-catenin greatly stabilizes extracellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds against tensile forces. The energy profile of single intercellular E-cadherin/E-cadherin bond can be approximated by the harmonic energy potential Ea ≈ (kmx*2)/2, which defines an effective molecular stiffness km for the E-cadherin/E-cadherin bond and the width of the energy barrier, x* (Figs. 5, d and e, and 6). We found that the molecular stiffness of E-cadherin intercellular bonds was much higher, and the energy barrier was much narrower and deeper in cells expressing α-catenin than in parental cells lacking α-catenin (Figs. 5e and 6). These results suggest that the conformation of individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin is significantly more rigid in cells expressing α-catenin and that α-catenin provides individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds with additional stability against tensile forces. To examine the potential role played by the actin cytoskeleton on E-cadherin/E-cadherin bond strength, we conducted single-molecule measurements using α-catenin-expressing cells treated with F-actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin B (concentration, 80 nm) (29.Lee J.S. Hale C.M. Panorchan P. Khatau S.B. George J.P. Tseng Y. Stewart C.L. Hodzic D. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2542-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The mean bond strength was found to be only marginally decreased (p = 0.03) compared with the same cells in the absence of latrunculin B treatment (Fig. 2d). This slight difference may be explained by the softening of the cytoplasm of latrunculin B-treated cells (29.Lee J.S. Hale C.M. Panorchan P. Khatau S.B. George J.P. Tseng Y. Stewart C.L. Hodzic D. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2542-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 30.Tseng Y. Kole T.P. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3162-3176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). More importantly, the mean bond strength remained significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the bond strength measured for α-catenin null cells. The corresponding global adhesion assay for latrunculin B-treated α-catenin-expressing cells reinforced the finding from our single-molecule experiments that the actin cytoskeleton does not affect the binding strength of E-cadherins between cells (Fig. 1e). We further examined the influence of α-catenin on E-cadherin/E-cadherin bond strength by conducting single-molecule measurements between unlike top and bottom cells. Cells expressing α-catenin were plated as monolayer, and an AFM cantilever loaded with an α-catenin null cell was brought in contact for a short duration (∼1 ms). The corresponding mean E-cadherin/E-cadherin bond strength was closer to the strength of a bond between two α-catenin null cells than the strength of a bond between two cells expressing α-catenin (Fig. 3d). The corresponding global adhesion assay confirmed this finding (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that the absence of α-catenin causes a dominant negative effect on both global cell-cell adhesion and E-cadherin-mediated single intercellular adhesion bond strength. The loss of E-cadherin expression is a common feature of tumor progression and metastasis in cancers of epithelial origin (31.Cavellero U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 4: 118-132Google Scholar). This is presumably because E-cadherin down-regulation reduces the global strength of intercellular adhesion within a tissue, therefore enhancing cellular motility (32.Mareel M. Leroy A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Re-expression of E-cadherin reduces metastatic potential of cancer cells (31.Cavellero U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 4: 118-132Google Scholar, 32.Mareel M. Leroy A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, in many types of cancers, cell detachment from a primary tumor site and transition to metastasis strongly correlates with the loss of α-catenin (4.Nakopoulou L. Gakiopoulou-Givalou H.

Pathol. 1999; 52: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, the loss of α-catenin seems to be sometimes a better predictor of clinical outcome than the loss of E-cadherin (5.Kadowaki T. Shiozaki H. Inoue M. Tamura S. Oka H. Doki Y. Iihara K. Matsui S. Iwazawa T. Nagafuchi A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ropponen K.M. Eskelinen M.J. Lipponen P.K. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we show that the loss of α-catenin in human breast cancer cells plays a direct and profound role in reducing individual cadherin/cadherin binding interactions between adjoining cells. Specifically, the loss of α-catenin drastically reduces the lifetime, tensile strength, and mechanical stability of single cadherin bonds between human breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that the changes in bond strength are partly caused by a change in the configuration of E-cadherin/ E-cadherin bonds mediated by the loss of α-catenin. Indeed, the absence of α-catenin in MDA468 cells reduces >3-fold the flexural rigidity of single E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds (measured by km) compared with α-catenin-expressing MDA468 cells. A mechanism that could explain the α-catenin-dependent strength of individual E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between adjacent cells is that the presence of α-catenin in the adhesion molecular-complex might induce clustering of E-cadherins caused by the dimerization of α-catenins bound to adjacent E-cadherin-β-catenin/α-catenin complexes. Although our data cannot per se test this hypothesis directly, we must note that such a mechanism seems improbable based on previously reported binding screen studies. Using chimeric proteins, it has been shown that the dimerization site of α-catenin overlaps with its β-catenin-binding site (33.Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In other words, α-catenin cannot simultaneously bind β-catenin and form a dimer with another α-catenin bound to an adjacent E-cadherin-β-catenin complex. Binding to β-catenin disrupts the dimerization of α-catenin. In light of these results, it seems improbable that the observed enhanced bond strength of E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds in α-catenin-expressing cells is due to the dimerization of α-catenin across the cytoplasmic domains of E-cadherin. Nevertheless, more studies need to be conducted to further test this hypothesis. Together our results suggest the loss of intercellular adhesion commonly observed in solid tumors of epithelial origin (31.Cavellero U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 4: 118-132Google Scholar, 32.Mareel M. Leroy A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) may stem not only from the loss of global cell adhesion through down-regulation of E-cadherin (and ensuing reduced cadherin-mediated intercellular avidity) but also the reduction of intercellular cadherin bond strength induced by the loss of α-catenin. We also show that the forced expression of α-catenin in human breast cancer cells can restore both higher intercellular avidity and intercellular bond strength of E-cadherin, which suggests an alternative strategy to stop or slow down the metastatic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2074632656,"Formins assemble non-branched actin filaments and modulate microtubule dynamics during cell migration and cell division. At the end of mitosis formins contribute to the generation of actin filaments that form the contractile ring. Rho small GTP-binding proteins activate mammalian diaphanous-related (mDia) formins by directly binding and disrupting an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism. Although the Rho-regulated activation mechanism is well characterized, little is known about how formins are switched off. Here we reveal a novel mechanism of formin regulation during cytokinesis based on the following observations; 1) mDia2 is degraded at the end of mitosis, 2) mDia2 is targeted for disposal by post-translational ubiquitin modification, 3) forced expression of activated mDia2 yields binucleate cells due to failed cytokinesis, and 4) the cytokinesis block is dependent upon mDia2-mediated actin assembly as versions of mDia2 incapable of nucleating actin but that still stabilize microtubules have no effect on cytokinesis. We propose that the tight control of mDia2 expression and ubiquitin-mediated degradation is essential for the completion of cell division. Because of the many roles for formins in cell morphology, we discuss the relevance of mDia protein turnover in other processes where ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is an essential component."
https://openalex.org/W2036885100,"The conserved CaaX box peroxin Pex19p is known to be modified by farnesylation. The possible involvement of this lipid modification in peroxisome biogenesis, the degree to which Pex19p is farnesylated, and its molecular function are unknown or controversial. We resolve these issues by first showing that the complete pool of Pex19p is processed by farnesyltransferase in vivo and that this modification is independent of peroxisome induction or the Pex19p membrane anchor Pex3p. Furthermore, genomic mutations of PEX19 prove that farnesylation is essential for proper matrix protein import into peroxisomes, which is supposed to be caused indirectly by a defect in peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) targeting or stability. This assumption is corroborated by the observation that mutants defective in Pex19p farnesylation are characterized by a significantly reduced steady-state concentration of prominent PMPs (Pex11p, Ant1p) but also of essential components of the peroxisomal import machinery, especially the RING peroxins, which were almost depleted from the importomer. In vivo and in vitro, PMP recognition is only efficient when Pex19p is farnesylated with affinities differing by a factor of 10 between the non-modified and wild-type forms of Pex19p. Farnesylation is likely to induce a conformational change in Pex19p. Thus, isoprenylation of Pex19p contributes to substrate membrane protein recognition for the topogenesis of PMPs, and our results highlight the importance of lipid modifications in protein-protein interactions."

In this study, phos pho ryl a ted MT1-MMP is detected using a phospho-specific antibody recognizing a protein kinase C consensus sequence (phospho-TXR), and a MT1-MMP tail peptide is phos pho ryl a ted by exogenous protein kinase C. To characterize the potential role of cytoplasmic residue Thr567 in these processes, mutants that mimic a state of either constitutive (T567E) or defective phos pho ryl a tion (T567A) were expressed and analyzed for their functional effects on MT1-MMP activity and cellular behavior. Phospho-mimetic mutants of Thr567 exhibit enhanced matrix invasion as well as more extensive growth within a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix.

Largely composed of a mixture of collagens, laminins, and vitronectin, the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseMT1-MMPmembrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinasePKCprotein kinase C. serves as both a physical scaffold and a barrier against cell invasion. It has become increasingly evident that the structural condition of the ECM plays a unique role in regulating cell behavior. Proteolysis of integral components of the basement membrane disturbs the barrier provided by the ECM. Without physical restriction, cells invade the surrounding environment in an unregulated manner. The ability of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to collectively degrade nearly all ECM constituents allows this class of enzymes to function in a diverse range of physiological processes (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar, 2Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Of the anchored MMPs, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) was the first to be discovered and has been most thoroughly characterized. Unlike soluble MMPs, MT1-MMP has a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that traverse the cell membrane, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail composed of 20 amino acids (3Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). The advantage of cell surface localization is 2-fold. Surface restriction allows MT1-MMP to modify the immediate pericellular environment, overcoming physical constraints imposed by the ECM (2Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Localization at the cell surface also places tethered MMPs in an optimal position to function at invadapodia, highly specialized areas of the cell membrane that form during focalized cell invasion (4Buccione R. Orth J.D. McNiven M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Although information regarding the role of the cytoplasmic tail is relatively limited (5Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Conversely, its enzymatic activity is key to acquiring a metastatic phenotype in a variety of tumor cells, including lung, colon, breast, and cervical carcinomas (2Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K.

The ability to alter the physical structure of the pericellular environment, while triggering the activation and modification of several cell surface proteins, identifies a central role for MT1-MMP in influencing cellular behavior (12Barbolina M.V. Stack M.S. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2008; 19: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In return, stringent cellular regulation of MT1-MMP enzymatic activity is necessary to prevent aberrant proteolysis. Increasing evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP may regulate its activity at the cell surface. It has been demonstrated that MT1-MMP is internalized from the cell surface and that this process requires the presence of the cytoplasmic domain (5Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Tail truncation restricts MT1-MMP to the cell surface, suggesting that this domain contains sequence(s) that either mediate internalization or are required for physical interaction with another protein that facilitates its internalization (5Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mechanism regulating this process has yet to be determined. Interestingly, both invasion and migration are down-regulated in cells where MT1-MMP is restricted to the cell surface (5Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These data suggest a correlation between internalization and matrix turnover, where MT1-MMP activity is either abrogated or enhanced under appropriate stimuli. Reversible phosphorylation is widely recognized as a key post-translational modification that regulates protein function. The cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP has three potential phosphorylation sites: Thr567, Tyr573, and Ser577. Recent work by Nyalendo et al. (13Nyalendo C. Michaud M. Beaulieu E. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Béliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) indicates that MT1-MMP is phosphorylated at tyrosine residue Tyr573, and that this modification influences cell migration. Several surface proteins are regulated by phosphorylation at multiple residues. In the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail, Thr567 has homology with the consensus sequence for both protein kinase C (TXR) and ERK1/2 (XTP) (14Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that active MT1-MMP might also be regulated through phosphorylation of this cytoplasmic tail residue. In the present study, we report that MT1-MMP bears a threonine phosphorylation site in its cytoplasmic tail and that this modification plays an important role in regulating several aspects of carcinoma cell behavior, including invasion and three-dimensional growth. Anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-MT1-MMP (hinge or catalytic domain) antibodies were purchased from Chemicon or Abcam. Antibodies directed against phosphothreonine were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA) or Abcam. Calyculin A (serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Super Signal-enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Pierce. Rat tail collagen type I and Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix were purchased from BD Biosciences. Gold chloride was purchased from Fisher. TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2) was graciously provided by Dr. Rafael Fridman (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). The breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231 was kindly provided by Dr. V. Craig Jordan (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) and was maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). The human MT1-MMP cDNA with C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was kindly provided by Dr. Duanqing Pei (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). The open reading frame sequences of MT1-MMP cDNA were TA-subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1-Uni (Invitrogen) to obtain the wild type construct. To facilitate different studies, the wild type construct was further FLAG-tagged in the stalk region, as described (15Wu Y.I. Munshi H.G. Sen R. Snipas S.J. Salvesen G.S. Fridman R. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8278-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the T567A and T567E point mutations were generated on the wild type cDNA and on the tagged constructs using QuikChange (Stratagene). Transfection of cells was done using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stable cell lines were generated using G418 selection. These cells were selected because they express endogenous MT1-MMP, insuring proper activation of the proMT1-MMP zymogen, as well as key components of the pro-MMP-2 activation system (i.e. pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2), thereby facilitating the assay of potential functional changes brought about by phosphorylation. Stable cell lines were generated using G418 selection, and cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using an antibody against the FLAG epitope tag (M2). To ensure equivalent expression levels, cells were sorted using anti-FLAG M2 every 3–5 passages. All experiments were performed with freshly sorted cell populations. Analysis of PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of a purified synthetic MT1-MMP tail peptide was performed as described previously (16Maizels E.T. Peters C.A. Kline M. Cutler Jr., R.E. Shanmugam M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrate (MT1-MMP tail peptide or histone H1 (45 μg/ml)) was incubated with recombinant PKCδ (3.5 nm) in 45 μm α-glycerol phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 9.0 mm MgCl2, 0.45 mm CaCl2, and 4.5 μm ATP in the presence or absence of the activators phosphatidylserine (45 μg/ml) and diacylglycerol (1.6 μg/ml) (as indicated). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 3× Laemmli SDS stop solution and thermal denaturation at 100 °C for 5 min (16Maizels E.T. Peters C.A. Kline M. Cutler Jr., R.E. Shanmugam M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) prior to separation on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography. Gelatinase activities in conditioned media were determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography. Conditioned media (20 μl) from an equivalent number of cells were electrophoresed without reduction on SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared with 9% acrylamide containing 0.1% gelatin. SDS was removed through a 1-h incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100, and gels were incubated in 20 mm glycine, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2 (pH 8.3) at 37 °C for 24 h prior to staining for gelatin with Coomassie Blue. Enzyme activity was visualized as zones of gelatin clearance within the gels. For Western blotting of whole cell lysates, cells were lysed using 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and the protein concentration of lysates was analyzed using the Bio-Rad DC detection kit and bovine albumin standards. Cell lysates (50 μg) were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Trizma (Tris base) (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBST. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000 in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBST) and enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation analyses, cells were serum-starved in the presence of the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), switched to serum containing medium for 3 h, collected with lysis buffer (above), and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-MT1-MMP (hinge antibody, 1:4000 dilution) and protein G beads. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 9% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting using anti-MT1-MMP catalytic domain (1:4000) or anti-phospho-TXR antibodies (1:1000) followed by ECL detection, as described above. Alternatively, cells were treated with the serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A (20 nm, 10 min), collected as above, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-phospho-Thr antibody (2 μg). Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2. To label cell surface proteins, cells were incubated with the non-cell-permeable biotin analogue Sulfo-NHS-LCBiotin (1 mg/ml) for 25 min on ice, washed three times in cold 100 mmol/liter glycine in phosphate-buffered saline and once in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/liter EDTA). Equivalent amounts (50–70 μg) of lysate, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, were incubated with 25–30 μl NeutrAvidin protein overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The NeutrAvidin biotin-labeled lysate complex was then washed five times in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, resuspended in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer plus sample dilution buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and prepared for Western blot analysis. To assess cell motility, migration through transwell membranes coated with a thin layer of collagen (100 μg/ml, 37 °C, 1 h) on both the upper and lower surfaces was evaluated as described below for invasion using an incubation time of 18 h. To conduct in vitro scratch wound assays, cells were plated in 8-well plates, cultured to confluence, and serum-starved overnight. Two scratch wounds were made in each well using a micropipette tip. Two points were randomly selected, marked for each scratch, and photographed using a digital camera at 0, 24, and 48 h. Five relative measurements were taken for each of the four points for each experimental condition using the MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). These resulting five measurements for each point were averaged and then normalized based on the initial measurement for that point at 0 h. The four normalized values were then averaged for each experimental condition. The data include results from three separate assays. To measure haptotactic migration, a colloidal gold migration assay was utilized. The collagen-colloidal gold coating was prepared as previously described (17Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 18Tjia J.S. Moghe P.V. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2002; 30: 851-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, glass coverslips (22 mm2) in a 6-well plate were coated with rat tail type I collagen (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 5 μg/cm2 by slowly evaporating 2 ml of a 12 μg/ml collagen solution in 0.02 n acetic acid at room temperature. The colloidal gold particles were prepared as follows. Distilled water (11.3 ml) was combined with 6 ml of 36.5 mm Na2CO3 and 1.5 ml of 17.4 mm AuCl4H (Fisher). The solution was heated with a burner just to boiling, and 1.8 ml of 0.1% formaldehyde (diluted from 36.5–38% formalin) was added. In order to prevent denaturation of collagen, the solution was then cooled to below 70 °C. The cooled solution was layered over collagen-coated coverslips (2 ml each) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h to allow absorption of gold particles to the coated collagen. The unabsorbed gold salts were carefully rinsed off with culture medium, preventing drying of the coverslip. 1 × 103 cells were plated onto the coated coverslip and allowed to migrate for 24–48 h. The coverslips were then rinsed carefully with cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice and fix with 3.7% formaldehyde on ice for 10 min. The coverslips were briefly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline following distilled water and mounted on slides with gelvatol. The images of phagokinetic track were acquired by dark field with a Nikon D100 camera mounted on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope. The images were then analyzed by Adobe Photoshop CS. Type I collagen was dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. For invasion experiments, the collagen stock was neutralized with 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 9.6) to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Transwell inserts (0.8 μm; BD Biosciences) were coated on the underside with 500 μl of collagen diluted to a concentration of 100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h. Collagen gels were prepared in the inner well by adding 50 μl of collagen (20 μg) at room temperature and allowing gels to air-dry overnight. Collagen-coated inserts were then washed with minimum essential medium three times to remove salts and used immediately. Cells were trypsinized and washed with serum-free medium, and 1 × 105 cells were added to the inner invasion chamber in a volume of 200 μl. The outer wells contained 400 μl of culture medium. Cells were allowed to invade for 24–48 h as indicated; non-invading cells were removed from inner wells using a cotton swab, and invading cells adherent to the bottom of the membrane were fixed and stained using a Diff-Quick staining kit (DADE AG, Miami, FL). Invading cells were enumerated by dividing membranes into four quadrants and counting the number of cells in three distinct areas for each quadrant under a ×10 objective using an ocular micrometer. Assays were performed in triplicate. For Matrigel invasion assays, the inner well of transwell inserts (0.8 μm; BD Biosciences) were coated with 100 μl of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and allowed to permeabilize at room temperature for 1 h. Unpermeabilized liquid was removed, and filters were washed with serum-free medium and allowed to air dry. Cells were trypsinized and washed with serum-free medium, and 3.75 × 105 cells were added to the inner invasion chamber in a volume of 500 μl. The outer well contained 750 μl of cell culture medium. Cells were allowed to invade for 18 h, as indicated; non-invading cells were removed from inner wells using a cotton swab, and invading cells adherent to the bottom of membrane were fixed and stained using the Diff-Quick staining kit (DADE AG). Invading cells were enumerated by dividing membranes into four quadrants and counting the number of cells in three distinct areas for each quadrant under a ×10 objective using an ocular micrometer. Three-dimensional cultures were prepared by diluting type I rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences) with 10× minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Cells (5 × 104) were added to the collagen mixture prior to solidification. In parallel control experiments, the MMP inhibitor TIMP-2 was included at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml (19Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Following growth for 5–8 days in three-dimensional collagen, gels were dissolved using bacterial collagenase (2 mg/ml; Worthington), and cell number was evaluated by hemocytometry, as described (19Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated in triplicate. In control experiments, solidified collagen gels were prepared as described above, with 5 × 104 cells being added to the gel surface following collagen solidification. To investigate the hypothesis that MT1-MMP undergoes phosphorylation at residue Thr567 (Fig. 1A), in vitro kinase assays were conducted using a synthetic peptide containing the MT1-MMP tail sequence as substrate and recombinant PKCδ. Tail peptide was incubated in the presence or absence of purified PKC, and reactions were initiated in the presence or absence of the PKC-activating cofactors diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine (16Maizels E.T. Peters C.A. Kline M. Cutler Jr., R.E. Shanmugam M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of the MT1-MMP tail peptide was readily noted on autoradiograms (Fig. 1B), whereas 32P incorporation was not observed in the absence of PKC and was greatly diminished in the absence of PKC activators diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. Histone H1, a recognized substrate for PKC, was used in these experiments as a positive control for 32P incorporation. To further investigate the hypothesis that MT1-MMP undergoes phosphorylation at residue Thr567, MT1-MMP was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using an antibody recognizing the hinge domain of MT1-MMP, electrophoresed, electroblotted, and probed using an antibody specific to the phosphorylated PKC recognition sequence, phospho-TXR (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1C, the phosphothreonine antibody recognized a 55-kDa species co-migrating with active MT1-MMP. Taken together, these studies suggest that MT1-MMP can be phosphorylated at residue Thr567 and that this event can occur in a PKC-dependent manner. Based on the observation that MT1-MMP can be phosphorylated at Thr567, studies were undertaken to characterize the effect of this modification on cell behavior. To date, studies investigating the functional role of the cytoplasmic tail have primarily involved deletion of the entire domain. This approach makes it difficult to determine whether the observed effects are due to the absence of specific sequences in the cytoplasmic domain or whether functional phenotypes are a pleiotropic effect of truncation. In order to investigate the potential functional consequence(s) of Thr567 modification, a more specific approach was developed. Using site directed mutagenesis, Thr567 was mutated to glutamic acid (T567E) to mimic constitutive phosphorylation or alanine (T567A) to represent a phospho-defective mutation. Wild type MT1-MMP (MT in Fig. 2) and cells transfected with vector alone (CAT) were used as controls. Constructs were transfected into MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cells, and stable clones were obtained by G418 selection, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunoblotting for MT1-MMP expression. Analysis of whole cell lysates from wild type, T567A, and T567E demonstrated equivalent MT1-MMP expression (Fig. 2A). Direct activation of pro-MMP-2 (progelatinase-A) is a classical function of MT1-MMP (3Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

MMP-2 is responsible for degrading type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane (3Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Gelatin zymography was used to determine the effect of Thr567 mutation on the ability of MT1-MMP to catalyze pro-MMP-2 activation. Relative to wild type cells, no reproducible change in pro-MMP-2 activation was demonstrated by T567A or T567E mutant cell lines (Fig. 2B), indicating that Thr567 mutation does not alter the ability of MT1-MMP to act as an upstream effector of MMP-2 activity. Since previous studies indicate that the cytoplasmic tail alters the surface presentation of active MT1-MMP by regulating its internalization from the cell surface (5Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), studies were conducted to determine whether alteration of residue Thr567 modulates basal MT1-MMP surface presentation. Surface labeling (Fig. 2C) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 2D) indicate surface presentation of wild type and mutant MT1-MMP, with the T567E mutant exhibiting relatively lower surface expression compared with wild type MT1-MMP. In control experiments, cells expressing wild type MT1-MMP or the T567E and T567A mutants were immunoprecipitated with a phospho-Thr antibody, followed by Western blotting with FLAG M2 antibody to detect only exogenous epitope-tagged MT1-MMP (Fig. 2, E and F). These data show a significant decrease in detection of phospho-Thr-modified MT1-MMP in cells expressing mutant proteins. Acquisition of MT1-MMP expression stimulates migration in a variety of cell types and requires focalized degradation of ECM components. In addition to modifying the ECM, MT1-MMP promotes migration through interaction with and modification of various cell adhesion molecules (24Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H.

A variety of assays were used to determine whether Thr567 mutation affects the ability of MT1-MMP to promote cell migration. A Boyden chamber migration assay was first used to investigate possible phenotypic differences. Relative to vector controls, all MT1-MMP-expressing cells exhibited enhanced migration (Fig. 3A). Further, the T567E mutant exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in chemotactic migration relative to wild type MT1-MMP (p = 0.003) (Fig. 3A). Collagen-driven single cell motility was then analyzed by a colloidal gold assay (17Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 26Chen J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2092883977,"Upon DNA replication stress, stalled DNA replication forks serve as a platform to recruit many signaling proteins, leading to the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint. Activation of Rad53, a key effector kinase in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for stabilizing DNA replication forks during replication stress. Using an activity-based assay for Rad53, we found that Mrc1, a replication fork-associated protein, cooperates with Mec1 to activate Rad53 directly. Reconstitution of Rad53 activation using purified Mec1 and Mrc1 showed that the addition of Mrc1 stimulated a more than 70-fold increase in the ability of Mec1 to activate Rad53. Instead of increasing the catalytic activity of Mec1, Mrc1 was found to facilitate the phosphorylation of Rad53 by Mec1 via promotion of a stronger enzyme-substrate interaction between them. Further, the conserved C-terminal domain of Mrc1 was found to be required for Rad53 activation. These results thus provide insights into the role of the adaptor protein Mrc1 in activating Rad53 in the DNA replication checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2040147869,"Ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors is a complex process that involves sequential receptor conformational changes, ligand translocation, and possibly ligand-induced receptor oligomerization. Binding events at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are usually interpreted from radioligand binding studies in terms of two-step ligand-induced receptor isomerization. We report here, using a combination of fluorescence approaches, on the molecular mechanisms for Bodipy-pirenzepine binding to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused muscarinic M1 receptors in living cells. Real time monitoring, under steady-state conditions, of the strong fluorescence energy transfer signal elicited by this interaction permitted a fine kinetic description of the binding process. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements allowed us to identify discrete EGFP lifetime species and to follow their redistribution upon ligand binding. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, with EGFP brightness analysis, showed that EGFP-fused muscarinic M1 receptors predominate as monomers in the absence of ligand and dimerize upon pirenzepine binding. Finally, all these experimental data could be quantitatively reconciled into a three-step mechanism, with four identified receptor conformational states. Fast ligand binding to a peripheral receptor site initiates a sequence of conformational changes that allows the ligand to access to inner regions of the protein and drives ligand-receptor complexes toward a high affinity dimeric state."
https://openalex.org/W2091870709,"Intermediate filament (IF) abnormalities frequently appear in neurodegenerative disorders, but how they may contribute to neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of IF disorganization on the fast axonal transport using timelapse microscopy. We studied the axonal transport of mitochondria and lysosomes in cultured primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons derived from mice deficient for neurofilament light (NFL–/–), mice overexpressing peripherin (Per), and mice double transgenic Per;NFL–/–. Unexpectedly, a net retrograde transport of mitochondria was detected in Per;NFL–/– neurons, opposite to the net anterograde transport of these organelles observed in wild-type (Wt), NFL–/–, and Per neurons. A detailed analysis of the kinetic properties of mitochondrial movements revealed an increased frequency of retrograde movements and an increase of their velocity in Per;NFL–/– neurons compared to Wt, NFL–/–, and Per neurons. We also noticed that the depletion of axonal neurofilaments (NFs) in NFL–/– and Per;NFL–/– neurons induced longer and more persistent movements of mitochondria and lysosomes in both directions, which suggests that the NF network hampers the traffic of these organelles. The finding that an up regulation of peripherin in context of NFL deficiency can provoke a net retrograde transport of mitochondria is a phenomenon that may contribute to pathogenic changes in some neurodegenerative disorders with IF protein accumulations.—Perrot, R., Julien, J.-P.

https://openalex.org/W1972674299,"Recent efforts have underlined the role of serine/threonine protein kinases in growth, pathogenesis, and cell wall metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although most kinases have been investigated for their physiological roles, little information is available regarding how serine/threonine protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation regulates the activity of kinase substrates. Herein, we focused on M. tuberculosis Rv2175c, a protein of unknown function, conserved in actinomycetes, and recently identified as a substrate of the PknL kinase. We solved the solution structure of Rv2175c by multidimensional NMR and demonstrated that it possesses an original winged helix-turn-helix motif, indicative of a DNA-binding protein. The DNA-binding activity of Rv2175c was subsequently confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy, as well as in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mass spectrometry analyses using a combination of MALDI-TOF and LC-ESI/MS/MS identified Thr(9) as the unique phosphoacceptor. This was further supported by complete loss of PknL-dependent phosphorylation of an Rv2175c_T9A mutant. Importantly, the DNA-binding activity was completely abrogated in a Rv2175c_T9D mutant, designed to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, but not in a mutant lacking the first 13 residues. This implies that the function of the N-terminal extension is to provide a phosphoacceptor (Thr(9)), which, following phosphorylation, negatively regulates the Rv2175c DNA-binding activity. Interestingly, the N-terminal disordered extension, which bears the phosphoacceptor, was found to be restricted to members of the M. tuberculosis complex, thus suggesting the existence of an original mechanism that appears to be unique to the M. tuberculosis complex."
https://openalex.org/W2019600375,"Src family kinases (SFKs) signal in response to E-cadherin to support cadherin adhesion and the integrity of cell-cell contacts (McLachlan, R. W., Kraemer, A., Helwani, F. M., Kovacs, E. M., and Yap, A. S. (2007) Mol. Biol. Cell 18, 3214–3223). We now identify the actin-regulatory protein, cortactin, as a target of E-cadherin-activated SFK signaling. Tyr-phosphorylated cortactin was found at cell-cell contacts in established epithelial monolayers, and cortactin became acutely tyrosine-phosphorylated when E-cadherin adhesion was engaged. In all circumstances, cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by inhibiting SFK signaling. Importantly, Tyr-phosphorylated cortactin was necessary to preserve the integrity of cadherin contacts and the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, expression of a phosphomimetic cortactin mutant could prevent SFK blockade from disrupting cadherin organization, thereby placing cortactin functionally downstream of SFK signaling at cadherin adhesions. We conclude that SFK and cortactin constitute an important signaling pathway that functionally links E-cadherin adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton. Src family kinases (SFKs) signal in response to E-cadherin to support cadherin adhesion and the integrity of cell-cell contacts (McLachlan, R. W., Kraemer, A., Helwani, F. M., Kovacs, E.

We conclude that SFK and cortactin constitute an important signaling pathway that functionally links E-cadherin adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton. Functional cooperation between cadherin adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskeleton is commonly believed to play a key role in the morphogenesis of cell-cell interactions (1.Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 2.Mège R.M. Gavard J. Lambert M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This functional interplay, and the biochemical mechanisms that underpin it, are much more complex than previously realized. Increasingly it is apparent that a range of distinct actin regulators can be recruited to cadherin adhesions depending on the biological context of cell-cell interactions (2.Mège R.M. Gavard J. Lambert M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is likely that the choice of actin regulator(s) recruited determines the dynamics and organization of the actin cytoskeleton at those contacts, with morphogenetic implications for the formation, modeling, and turnover of cell-cell interactions. Identifying the actin regulators that influence cell-cell interactions and how they cooperate with adhesion receptors are important open issues. Adhesion-activated cell signaling provides a useful paradigm to analyze how classical cadherins regulate the actin cytoskeleton (2.Mège R.M. Gavard J. Lambert M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3.Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Over the past several years, a range of signal transduction pathways have been identified that are stimulated upon productive engagement of cadherins, such as E-, C-, and N-cadherin (reviewed in Ref. 3.Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among these signals are Rho family GTPases, lipid kinases, and protein-tyrosine kinases. Of the latter, we recently identified Src family kinase (SFK) 5The abbreviations used are: SFKSrc family kinaseRNAiRNA interferenceDMSOdimethyl sulfoxidesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinKDknockdown. activity as a component of E-cadherin signaling (4.McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3214-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SFK was stimulated in an E-cadherin-dependent fashion when cells assembled contacts with one another. Indeed, binding to recombinant cadherin ligands was sufficient to activate SFK, implying that the cadherin itself can serve as a receptor to transduce an adhesive signal to SFK. Furthermore, inhibiting SFK signaling perturbed cadherin adhesion and the integrity of cell-cell contacts. This suggested a model where adhesive ligation of E-cadherin stimulated an SFK signaling cascade to ultimately support cell-cell interactions. An important challenge now is to identify targets of cadherin-activated SFK signaling that contribute to cadherin biology. Src family kinase RNA interference dimethyl sulfoxide small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein knockdown. In this work, we tested whether the actin-binding protein, cortactin, might be just such a target. A multidomain scaffolding protein, cortactin regulates the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with a range of other actin-regulatory proteins (5.Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 6.Ammer A.G. Weed S.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 687-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is best understood to participate in actin filament assembly (6.Ammer A.G. Weed S.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 687-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) by promoting Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation and also by stabilizing nascent Arp2/3-generated actin filament branches (7.Weaver A.M.

Cortactin exerts many of these effects through direct interactions with actin filaments and Arp2/3 (8.Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) as well as indirectly by associating with proteins such as N-WASP and WIP, which can themselves activate Arp2/3. Consistent with this, cortactin is often found at sites in the cortex where Arp2/3 drives membrane protrusion, such as lamellipodia and invadopodia (9.Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cortactin is also found at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts where a biochemical complex with E-cadherin or N-cadherin has been detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (10.Helwani F.M.

Overall C.M. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5117-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligation of the cadherin with recombinant ligands could induce formation of a complex with cortactin and also recruited cortactin to the cortex at the sites of adhesion (10.Helwani F.M.

Cortactin is found with Arp2/3 at newly forming E-cadherin adhesive contacts, and disruption of cortactin by RNAi or dominant-negative mutants perturbs efficient assembly of cadherin-based contacts (10.Helwani F.M.

At N-cadherin adhesions, cortactin promotes adhesive strengthening and its surface expression (12.El Sayegh T.Y. Arora P.D. Laschinger C.A. Lee W. Morrison C. Overall C.M. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5117-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Overall, these reports identified a role for cortactin in modulating cadherin biology, likely through regulation of the cadherin-based actin cytoskeleton. Of note, cortactin was first identified as a substrate for v-Src (13.Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and as a target of fibroblast growth factor-stimulated SFK signaling (14.Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is implicated in cellular events that are accompanied by extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, such as cell migration and invasion (6.Ammer A.G.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at the key Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482 residues is necessary to maintain the integrity of established cell-cell contacts and their perijunctional actin cytoskeleton. Plasmids for FLAG-tagged wild-type mouse cortactin and the Y421F/Y466F/Y482F (3YF) cortactin mutant have been described (8.Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A.

Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used to stain F-actin. Samples were prepared for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (20.Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Fixed material was mounted in 1% N-propyl gallate in 50% glycerol:phosphate-buffered saline for epi-illumination and spinning disc confocal microscopy; fixed material was examined either by epi-illumination using Olympus AX70 or IX81 microscopes or with a PerkinElmer spinning disc confocal microscope, and images were captured using Hamamatsu Orca 1 ER cameras driven by Metamorph software. All images were acquired within the linear range of the cameras. Figures were arranged for presentation in Adobe Photoshop CS2. ImageJ was used to measure the average E-cadherin contact width and intensity using a “line-scanning method.” In brief, a fixed length line (65 pixels) was placed orthogonal to individual E-cadherin contacts. The ImageJ “Plot Profile” function was applied and plots of intensity (0–255) along the line distance (0–65) were obtained. Contact width was estimated by calculating +2 S.D. that covers 95% of contact pixel intensity. ImageJ was also used to quantify the ratio of the intensity of phosphocortactin to the intensity of E-cadherin at each pixel along a defined contact. All images for a single antibody were taken at the same exposure and an identical spinning disc microscope setting. To decrease nonspecific staining, the average background fluorescence for the image was determined and subtracted from intensities for all pixels. An ImageJ built-in calculator was then used to calculate the ratio of phosphocortactin to the intensity of E-cadherin. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with either HECD1 E-cadherin monoclonal antibody or an antibody against the FLAG epitope bound to protein A-agarose beads. Twenty percent of each immunoprecipitation reaction was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Immune complexes were blotted for E-cadherin, cortactin, and phosphocortactin. Cells were grown to 100% confluence and then incubated in 2 mm EGTA solution for 15–30 min or until cell-cell contacts were disrupted. Following washing, cells were incubated with unsupplemented culture medium containing 2 mm CaCl2 for a time course from 0 to 90 min before paraformaldehyde fixation or lysis in Laemmli sample buffer. To inhibit Src family kinase activities, 10 μm PP2 (Merck) or SU6656 (Merck) was added to MCF7 cell monolayers. The nonfunctional PP2 analog PP3 and solvent DMSO were also introduced as controls. Cortactin is phosphorylated by SFK at Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482 (21.Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol.

Accordingly, we first used antibodies specific for either the phosphorylated Tyr-421 (Tyr(P)-421)- or phosphorylated Tyr-466 (Tyr(P)-466) residue to characterize the subcellular localization of Tyr(P)-cortactin in MCF7 epithelial monolayers (Fig. 1). Confluent MCF7 monolayers formed cohesive, linear cell-cell contacts enriched in E-cadherin that co-stained for cortactin (Fig. 1A) (10.Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Paterson A.D. Verma S. Ali R.G. Fanning A.S. Weed S.A. Yap A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both Tyr(P)-421- and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin clearly co-accumulated with E-cadherin, indicating that these established cadherin-based contacts were enriched in Tyr(P)-cortactin (Fig. 1A). Punctate Tyr(P)-cortactin staining was also identified in the cytoplasm, possibly decorating vesicles. Similar junctional staining for cortactin and Tyr(P)-421- and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin was also detected in confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (data not shown). We found that probing for Tyr(P)-421- and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin yielded similar results throughout this study. E-cadherin ligation activates a number of intracellular signaling pathways, including Src family tyrosine kinases (4.McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3214-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a first test of whether E-cadherin might be necessary for junctional Tyr(P)-cortactin, we depleted E-cadherin in MCF7 cells using either single siRNA duplexes (Fig. 1B) or an siRNA SMARTpool (data not shown). Although E-cadherin depletion was moderate, junctional staining for Tyr(P)-421- and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin was substantially reduced (Fig. 1C). This suggested that E-cadherin might be necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at cell-cell contacts. Junctional cortactin staining was also decreased (Fig. 1C), however, making it difficult to determine whether cadherin adhesion triggered a pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin or simply served to localize cortactin itself at cell-cell contacts. To pursue this issue, we then asked whether the assembly of cell-cell contacts affects the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cortactin. We acutely disrupted MCF7 interactions by chelating extracellular calcium and then monitored contacts as they reassembled after restoration of calcium (Fig. 2, A–C). Cells began to re-establish E-cadherin-based contacts within 15 min of adding Ca2+. Tyr(P)-cortactin was not detectable in very early contacts, but began to accumulate with E-cadherin at ∼30 min and persisted as contacts became more extensive and linear (Fig. 2A). In Western blot analysis of total cell lysates (Fig. 2B), we found that Tyr(P)-cortactin levels were relatively low after chelation of extracellular calcium and then began to rise significantly ∼30 min after replenishment of Ca2+, consistent with the appearance of junctional Tyr(P)-cortactin detected by immunofluorescence. Characteristically, the rise in total Tyr(P)-cortactin levels appeared biphasic, with an initial rise at ∼30 min, followed by a second peak at ∼90 min, although the precise timing of these peaks showed some inter-experiment variation, perhaps due to variations in culture density. We then used co-immunoprecipitation analysis to test whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin-associated cortactin pool changed as cells assembled contacts with one another. As shown in Fig. 2C, a low level of Tyr(P)-cortactin was detectable in E-cadherin immune complexes after chelation of calcium, but this rose significantly ∼45 min after restoration of extracellular Ca2+. Interestingly, total levels of cortactin protein in the immune complexes did not change greatly during the course of these experiments. Overall, these findings implied that the assembly of cell-cell contacts triggered a signaling pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin-associated cortactin. Cell-cell contact can induce signaling through cadherin receptors themselves, but also by a variety of other juxtacrine signaling pathways (3.Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To test directly whether ligation of E-cadherin was able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, we allowed MCF7 cells to adhere to substrata coated with the recombinant ligand hE/Fc, which consists of the complete ectodomain of human E-cadherin expressed as an Fc fusion protein. In previous studies, we have shown that adhesion to hE/Fc stimulates cell signaling through Rac (19.Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), Cdc42 (23.Kraemer A. Goodwin M. Verma S. Yap A.S. Ali R.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1061-C1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and SFK (4.McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3214-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) themselves. Tyr(P)-cortactin was largely undetectable in freshly isolated non-adherent MCF7 cells, but increased as cells adhered to hE/Fc (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation was biphasic, with an early peak at ∼30 min and a later, further rise in Tyr(P)-cortactin levels. Adhesion to the nonspecific ligand poly-l-lysine produced no comparable rise in Tyr(P)-cortactin levels, corrected for protein loading. Similarly, when we presented ligands immobilized on 10-mm latex beads, we found that Tyr(P)-cortactin accumulated at the sites of adhesion to hE/Fc-coated beads to a much greater extent than at sites of binding to concanavalin A-coated beads. 6F. Helwani, unpublished data. Together, these findings indicate that ligation of E-cadherin alone is sufficient to activate a signaling pathway that induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. We then used cortactin knockdown and reconstitution to test the functional significance of Tyr(P)-cortactin. Transfection of siRNA reduced overall cortactin levels in confluent MCF7 cells by ∼90% (Fig. 3A), and cortactin was largely undetectable at the cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3A). Although cortactin KD cells made contacts with one another, E-cadherin staining was clearly perturbed. Instead of the crisp, linear staining seen in controls, cortactin-depleted cells showed broadened zones, where junctional E-cadherin staining was replaced by fragmented streaks and loose networks distributed extensively throughout the lateral cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 3A). To quantify the alterations in cadherin staining at contacts, we measured the width and the average pixel intensity of E-cadherin staining at cell-cell contacts. As shown in Fig. 3B, cortactin KD cells showed consistently broader cadherin staining at cell-cell contacts associated with a reduction in average pixel intensity. The perijunctional actin cytoskeleton was also greatly perturbed by cortactin KD (Fig. 3A). Whereas control cells showed an intense band of F-actin staining at the apical interface between cells, cortactin KD cells showed intermittent perijunctional staining, often with extensive discontinuities at the contacts. Exogenous expression of mouse cortactin, which was resistant to the human-specific siRNA (Fig. 4A), restored both linear E-cadherin staining and the integrity of the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 4A), confirming that these alterations were due to cortactin depletion. Quantitation demonstrated that exogenous mouse cortactin restored both the width of cadherin staining and the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4B). To test the significance of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin, we reconstituted cortactin expression in cortactin KD cells either with a phosphorylation-incompetent cortactin mutant (3YF) in which Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482 were mutated to phenylalanines or with a phosphomimetic mutant (3YD) in which these tyrosine residues were replaced by aspartic acid (Fig. 4). All transgenes expressed polypeptides of the expected molecular mass (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type cortactin, reconstitution with cortactin 3YF did not restore the cortactin KD phenotype. E-cadherin staining at contacts remained dispersed (Fig. 4A) and was quantitatively indistinguishable from KD cells (Fig. 4B). Similarly, perijunctional F-actin staining remained fragmented and discontinuous (Fig. 4A). The linear integrity of both E-cadherin and perijunctional F-actin staining was restored by the 3YD mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Overall, these findings suggest strongly that cortactin is necessary for the integrity of E-cadherin and actin cytoskeletal organization at cell-cell contacts in established epithelial monolayers. They indicate further that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was necessary for these effects to occur. Interestingly, immunofluorescence staining for the tight junction marker ZO-1 was much less disrupted by cortactin depletion than that for E-cadherin. Subtle irregularity in ZO-1 staining was evident in both cortactin KD cells (Figs. 3A and 4A) and KD cells reconstituted with the 3YF mutant (Fig. 4A) compared with the more linear staining seen in control cells (Fig. 3A) and in KD cells expressing the 3YD mutant (Fig. 4A). However, the overall integrity of ZO-1 staining was not compromised, in contrast to the dramatic changes seen in E-cadherin organization. This suggested that cortactin has a greater impact on E-cadherin adhesions than on tight junctions. Together, these observations suggested that tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin was a functionally important downstream effector of cadherin signaling. To further characterize the relevant signaling pathways, we sought to identify protein-tyrosine kinases critical for E-cadherin to signal to cortactin. We focused on SFK activity, given its roles in both E-cadherin signaling (4.McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3214-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and cortactin regulation (24.Tehrani S. Tomasevic N. Weed S. Sakowicz R. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25.Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). First we tested whether SFK activity was required for homophilic cadherin ligation to increase tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin (Fig. 5A). Freshly isolated MCF7 cells were allowed to adhere to hE/Fc-coated substrata for 30 or 90 min, when cadherin-induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was clearly detectable (Fig. 2A); Western blots of cell lysates were then probed for Tyr(P)-cortactin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at both time points was significantly reduced when adhesion assays were performed in the presence of SFK inhibitors PP2 (Fig. 5A) and SU6656 (data not shown). In contrast, PP3 did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin when cells adhered to hE/Fc (Fig. 5A). These findings strongly suggest that SFK activity is, directly or indirectly, necessary for E-cadherin homophilic ligation to tyrosine phosphorylate cortactin. We then examined whether inhibiting SFK signaling affected Tyr(P)-cortactin at cell-cell contacts in confluent MCF7 monolayers. Western analysis of cell extracts showed that Tyr(P)-421- and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin levels were substantially reduced in monolayers treated with either PP2 or SU6656 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the prominent junctional staining of Tyr(P)-421-cortactin and Tyr(P)-466-cortactin was greatly decreased in cells treated with either drug (Fig. 5B). Tyr(P)-cortactin staining was lost before E-cadherin integrity was disrupted in these acutely treated cultures; E-cadherin staining was perturbed with more prolonged treatment (data not shown) as reported previously (4.McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Yap A.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3214-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To confirm a role for Sr"

Since the discovery of the first known example of a covalent bond between a flavin cofactor and an amino acid side chain occurring in enzymes in the 1950s (1Singer T.P. Kearney E.B. Massey V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 60: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a number of different types of linkages have been identified: 8α-histidylation (either to N1 or to N3), 8α-O-tyrosylation, 8α-S-cysteinylation, and 6-S-cysteinylation.

The mode of flavin linkage observed in this case employs both 8α-histidylation and 6-S-cysteinylation to form a bicovalently attached cofactor. Representative members of all these groups have been studied in detail, and several explanations for the role of the covalent flavinylation have been put forward. Some of the suggestions tend to be rather specific for the system being studied, e.g. prevention of cofactor inactivation at the C-6 position for trimethylamine dehydrogenase (5Huang L. Scrutton N.S.

Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) from Eschscholzia californica is a plant enzyme involved in alkaloid biosynthesis, catalyzing the challenging oxidative cyclization of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine (Scheme 1). This enzyme was recently shown to belong to the group of flavoenzymes with a bicovalently attached FAD (14Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After the discovery of this unusual mode of linkage in the crystal structure of GOOX (4Huang C.H.

Because some of the suggested benefits of a covalent cofactor attachment can easily be brought about by a single linkage, e.g. prevention of cofactor dissociation or stabilization of the tertiary structure, the two amino acids attached to FAD might have different and individual functions as well as an additive effect on physicochemical properties such as redox potentials or substrate binding and oxidation. To elucidate the relative importance for the overall enzymatic functioning of members of this group, more detailed studies have been performed on GOOX (11Huang C.H. Winkler A. Chen C.L. Lai W.L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Common results of these analyses show that the bicovalent FAD has a redox potential of about +130 mV, which is among the highest potentials reported for flavoenzymes. Replacement of one of the amino acids involved in anchoring of the cofactor generally reduces the rate of cofactor reduction and the steady-state turnover rate, but whether this can be directly linked to reduced redox potentials of these mutant proteins has been under debate (11Huang C.H.

To address these issues further, we report the expression of the H104A mutant protein of BBE. A biochemical characterization of this protein variant with respect to the redox potential, transient kinetics, and steady-state analysis is combined with the structural analysis of both the H104A and the C166A mutant proteins. In addition, a structure of wild type (WT) BBE in complex with the product of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is presented, which provides further insights toward the involvement of active site amino acids during the course of the reaction. Together with the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of WT BBE with and without substrate bound (21Winkler A. Lyskowski A. Riedl S. Puhl M. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. Gruber K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the biochemical characterization of the C166A mutant protein (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), these results provide interesting insights into the role of bicovalent FAD attachment in enzymes. To overcome the low level of expression for BBE H104A and H104A-C166A reported previously (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we attempted to improve the level of secretory expression in Pichia pastoris by co-overexpression of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a protein reported to have a general positive effect on the secretory machinery in yeasts (22Robinson A.S. Hines V. Wittrup K.D. Biotechnology. 1994; 12: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Inan M. Aryasomayajula D. Sinha J. Meagher M.M. Biotechnol.

Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). To screen a larger amount of transformants for expression analysis, we employed deep well plates for the cultivation of about 30–50 clones of each protein variant as described in Ref. 25Weis R. Luiten R. Skranc W. Schwab H. Wubbolts M. Glieder A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 5: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar. These plates were harvested by centrifugation after 72 h of induction with methanol, and the supernatants were analyzed for BBE expression by dot-blot assays. Therefore, 100 μl of the supernatant were applied onto a nitrocellulose membrane according to the instructions of the Bio-Dot® microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad) manual. A qualitative analysis of BBE expression on the membrane was performed according to standard Western blot procedures. Briefly, the membrane was blocked with 15% milk powder in TTBS (0.1 m Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief washing step with TTBS, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with the primary antibody targeted against BBE (anti-BBE 1:500; donated by Prof. T. M. Kutchan) at 4 °C overnight. Excess first antibody was removed by washing the membrane with TTBS three times, 10 min each, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase-coupled) 1:15000; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C. After this, the membrane was again washed three times with TTBS, and detection of the protein dots was carried out by incubating the membrane with 4 ml of SuperSignal® West Pico luminol/enhancer solution and 4 ml of SuperSignal® West Pico stable peroxidase solution (both from Thermo Scientific) and exposing the membrane to an Eastman Kodak film for various time periods depending on the level of BBE expression. The best producing colonies identified by the deep well plate assay were used to start large scale fermentations as described in Ref. 14Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J.

Fractions from the gel filtration step showing activity were pooled and loaded onto a MonoQTM 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0 (buffer A). Although most of the impurities bound strongly to the column, BBE eluted with the breakthrough due to limited capacity of the column. This flow-through was then diluted 4-fold with distilled water and rechromatographed on the same column. Bound BBE was eluted during a 1-h gradient from 100% buffer A to 70% buffer A and 30% 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 9.0 (buffer B). Steady-state and transient kinetic parameters were determined using the substrate (S)-reticuline as described previously (14Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol.

Substrate concentrations ranging from 2 to 350 μm reticuline were covered to study effects on Km and Ki because for C166A BBE, a considerable amount of substrate inhibition was observed. For the comparison of turnover rates in Table 1, a substrate concentration of 100 μm reticuline was used, which is ∼30 times the reported Km of WT BBE (26Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Open table in a new tab Transient kinetics experiments for determination of the reductive and oxidative rate constants were performed as described recently (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The term reductive rate refers to the apparent rate of cofactor reduction under saturating concentrations of (S)-reticuline determined in single turnover experiments. Observed rate constants at substrate concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 μm were fit with a hyperbolic function to obtain the parameters Kd and kred. For studying reoxidation of the cofactor, the protein sample was reduced with 0.9 equivalents of substrate and mixed with an air-saturated buffer solution (243 μm O2). The redox potential of the H104A mutant protein was determined as published previously for the WT enzyme and the C166A variant (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) based on the dye-equilibration method originally described by Massey (27Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Como, Italy1990: 59-66Google Scholar). The experimental setup was slightly modified and included an automated shutting unit to reduce the possibility of photochemical reactions in the flow cell during the long incubation times. Reductions of the enzyme and reference dye were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C and contained benzyl viologen (5 μm) as mediator, 500 μm xanthine, and catalytic traces of xanthine oxidase (∼20 nm). Used reference dyes included thionine acetate (EM = +64 mV) and toluidine blue (EM = +34 mV), and the reactions were carried out over a time period of about 2 h. The redox potentials were estimated from plots of log([ox]/[red]) of H104A mutant protein versus log([ox]/[red]) of the dye toluidine blue according to Minnaert (28Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BBE WT crystals grown with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method as described in Ref. 21Winkler A. Lyskowski A. Riedl S. Puhl M. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. Gruber K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar were used for seeding of crystallization setups with protein variants H104A and C166A. For this, drops of 1 μl of enzyme solution (∼25 mg ml−1 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 9.0) were mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m MgCl2 and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5) and equilibrated for 2 h prior to streak seeding. Tetragonal crystals appeared overnight and reached final dimension in 3–4 days for both mutant proteins. Crystals for native structures were directly transferred to liquid nitrogen for flash-freezing, whereas substrate soaks were performed by incubating the crystals for 60 min in drops containing 20 mm (S)-reticuline in the reservoir solution prior to flash-cooling. Data sets for H104A, C166A, C166A_reticuline, and WT_ scoulerine were collected at beamline X06DA at the Swiss Light Source in Villigen, Switzerland. A summary of data collection, processing, and structure refinement is presented in supplemental Table S1. Processing of all data sets was carried out using the XDS software package (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). Due to the isomorphicity of all crystals (supplemental Table S1), the structures could be solved by rigid body fitting using the program PHENIX (30Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3596) Google Scholar) based on the available model of WT BBE. The structures were further refined with the same software. Model building and fitting steps involved the graphics program Coot (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar) using σA-weighted 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps. Rfree values (32Kleywegt G.J. Brünger A.T. Structure. 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) were computed from 5% randomly chosen reflections not used throughout the refinement. Ligands were excluded from the initial refinement process and inserted only in the final round when clear electron density was visible for (S)-scoulerine (WT_scoulerine). In the case of C166A_ reticuline, two conformations of reticuline were included to explain the electron density. Water molecules were placed automatically into difference electron density maps and were retained or rejected based on geometric criteria as well as on their refined B-factors. In all structures, residues Gly-178, Phe-392, and Arg-409 were found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Their electron density, however, was well defined in each case. In the structure of the H104A variant, two residues (Lys-350 and Phe-351) of the poorly defined surface loop were found in the less favored region. Expression levels of the H104A single and H104A-C166A double mutant proteins of BBE with the standard expression system (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were too low to allow a biochemical characterization of these variants. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, co-overexpression of PDI reduced this problem. Analysis of the protein secretion level in dot-blot assays demonstrated that WT BBE was expressed much better than the H104A mutant protein, and this in turn was significantly stronger than the H104A-C166A protein variant. Analysis of several transformants for each gene construct resulted in relatively similar expression levels for all protein variants, whereas a comparison with the strains previously used for protein expression (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) without cotransformation of PDI showed a significant improvement. Transformants with the H104A-C166A bbe gene, however, showed only a very weak positive signal when compared with the negative controls. The transformant producing the most intense signal for each protein variant was then used for scale up to fermentation and protein expression in 5-liter fermenters. Purification of WT BBE allowed the recovery of about 500 mg of protein from a single fermenter, which is about twice the amount we obtained without coexpression of PDI (14Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the H104A protein variant, we were able to isolate 6 mg of pure enzyme from two fermenters. The H104A-C166A protein variant, however, could not be detected in the fermentation supernatant in quantities suitable for an initial characterization. Due to the low level of expression observed in the initial screening procedure (supplemental Fig. S1), this was not unexpected taking into account the still relatively low expression level of the H104A mutant protein. A first indication toward the mode of cofactor attachment for H104A BBE comes from the comparison of absorption spectra under native and denatured conditions (Fig. 1). As reported recently (14Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the near UV absorbance band of the flavin cofactor in WT BBE at ∼380 nm disappears upon denaturation. By comparison with the spectral properties of the C166A variant, this feature was attributed to the covalent linkage between C-6 of FAD and the cysteine residue (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of the H104A mutant protein, this absorption around 380 nm is slightly shifted to higher wavelength in the native state. After denaturation, this spectral feature completely vanishes (Fig. 1B), and the overall spectrum approaches that of free 6-S-cysteinyl FMN (33Steenkamp D.J. McIntire W. Kenney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2818-2824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded that 6-S-cysteinylation of FAD also occurs without 8α-histidylation being present. We determined the x-ray crystal structures of both the H104A and the C166A protein variants, as well as of complexes of the C166A variant with (S)-reticuline and of WT BBE with (S)-scoulerine. While crystals of the C166A variant grew to comparable dimensions as for WT enzyme, crystals obtained with the H104A mutant protein were generally significantly smaller and diffracted to a comparatively lower resolution. Initial electron density maps showed the missing covalent linkages according to the amino acid substitutions and confirmed the retention of the respective other FAD attachment for both H104A and C166A (Fig. 2), as suspected from the spectral characteristics (Fig. 1) (20Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apart from these differences, the overall structural changes are relatively small with root mean square deviations for Cα atoms on the order of 0.15 Å. The removal of the covalent linkages has only subtle impacts on the geometry of the isoalloxazine ring system (Fig. 3). Apart from the relaxing movement of FAD in the regions around C-6 and the 8α-methyl group away from the substituted amino acid due to removal of the covalent bond by 0.5 and 0.8 Å, respectively, only a slightly more pronounced bending around the N-5–N-10 axis in the case of C166A is observed. More pronounced are the structural influences on some of the neighboring amino acids. Removal of the sulfur atom of Cys-166 causes the disordered Trp-165 to adopt a well defined orientation. This conformation resembles that observed in the structure with bound substrate (21Winkler A. Lyskowski A. Riedl S. Puhl M. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. Gruber K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although His-104 is relatively distant to Trp-165, the latter residue is also affected by the deletion of 8α-histidylation. Similar to observations in the WT structure, this side chain is not very well defined in H104A BBE. The conformation best representing the electron density, however, corresponds to an ∼100° rotation around the Cβ–Cγ bond when compared with the conformation found in the WT structure (Fig. 4). The removal of 8α-histidylation additionally causes Gln-59 to attain a new conformation, occupying the space created by the His-104 to Ala substitution. This in turn breaks the interaction of the glutamine with Lys-350 (supplemental Fig. S2), which is part of a poorly defined surface loop becoming better ordered upon substrate binding (21Winkler A. Lyskowski A. Riedl S. Puhl M. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. Gruber K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although in the structures of WT and C166A BBE, residues 349–353 already have a significantly higher B-factor than main chain atoms of well defined regions, this"
https://openalex.org/W2080155470,"Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor in the outer membrane of sensitive cells in the form of a high affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. Upon cell entry the immunity protein is lost from the complex by means that are poorly understood. We have developed a sensitive fluorescence assay that has enabled us to study the molecular requirements for immunity protein release. Nuclease colicins use members of the tol operon for their translocation across the outer membrane. We have demonstrated that the amino-terminal 80 residues of the colicin E9 molecule, which is the region that interacts with TolB, are essential for immunity protein release. Using tol deletion strains we analyzed the cellular components necessary for immunity protein release and found that in addition to a requirement for tolB, the tolA deletion strain was most affected. Complementation studies showed that the mutation H22A, within the transmembrane segment of TolA, abolishes immunity protein release. Investigation of the energy requirements demonstrated that the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane is critical. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time a clear energy requirement for the uptake of a nuclease colicin complex and suggest that energy transduced from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane by TolA could be the driving force for immunity protein release and concomitant translocation of the nuclease domain."
https://openalex.org/W1986910294,"A role for the RUNX genes in cancer fail-safe processes has been suggested by their induction of senescence-like growth arrest in primary murine fibroblasts and the failure of RAS-induced senescence in Runx2-deficient cells. We now show that RUNX1 induces senescence in human primary fibroblasts. High-affinity DNA binding is necessary but not sufficient, as shown by the functional attenuation of the truncated RUNX1/AML1a isoform and the TEL-RUNX1 fusion oncoprotein. However, a similar phenotype was potently induced by the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) oncoprotein, despite its dominant-negative potential. A detailed comparison of H-RASV12, RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO senescent phenotypes showed that the RUNX effectors induce earlier growth stasis with only low levels of DNA damage signaling and a lack of chromatin condensation, a marker of irreversible growth arrest. In human fibroblasts, all effectors induced p53 in the absence of detectable p14Arf, whereas only RUNX1-ETO induced senescence in p16Ink4a-null cells. Correlation was noted between induction of p53, reactive oxygen species and phospho-p38, whereas p38MAPK inhibition rescued cell growth markedly. These findings indicate a role for replication-independent pathways in RUNX and RUNX1-ETO senescence, and show that the context-specific oncogenic activity of RUNX1 fusion proteins is mirrored in their distinctive interactions with fail-safe responses."

However, the mechanisms underlying such compartmentalization remain poorly understood. In the present study we found that AQP4 resided in Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, whereas dystroglycan was recovered in the soluble fraction in astrocytes.

Upon laminin treatment AQP4 and the dystrophin complex, including dystroglycan, reorganized into laminin-associated clusters enriched for the lipid raft markers GM1 and flotillin-1 but not caveolin-1. Reduced diffusion rates of GM1 in the laminin-induced clusters were indicative of the reorganization of raft components in these domains. In addition, both cholesterol depletion and dystroglycan silencing reduced the number and area of laminin-induced clusters of GM1, AQP4, and dystroglycan.

In oligodendrocytes, laminin induces the relocalization of α6β1 integrin to lipid rafts containing PDGFαR, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the incorporation of cell survival signals (22.Baron W. Decker L. Colognato H. ffrench-Constant C. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are defined as small (10–200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. These small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (23.Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Indeed, the immunological synapse is a good example where rafts are brought together to form large functional membrane domains (24.Khan A.A. Bose C. Yam L.S. Soloski M.J. Rupp F. Science. 2001; 292: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At the immunological synapse, agrin induces the clustering of lipid rafts and their colocalization with CD3 and CD28 complex surface antigens as well as with Lck tyrosine kinase leading to T cell activation (24.Khan A.A. Bose C. Yam L.S. Soloski M.J. Rupp F. Science. 2001; 292: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Together, these studies provide evidence for a functional role of ligand-induced clustering of lipid rafts. We have previously shown that laminin induces the coclustering of the DAP complex with Kir4.1 and AQP4 in glial cell cultures (8.Guadagno E. Moukhles H. Glia. 2004; 47: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25.Noël G. Belda M. Guadagno E. Micoud J. Klöcker N. Moukhles H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that the perivascular localization of these channels and several components of the DAP complex at astrocyte endfeet require the interaction of laminin with α-DG (6.Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H. Straub V. Mathews K.D. Moore S.A. Campbell K.P.

In light of these data we asked whether lipid rafts contribute to the laminin-DG-dependent compartmentalization of the DAP complex and AQP4 to key active domains of astrocytes. We show here using fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB), a common marker for GM1-containing lipid rafts, that laminin induces a dramatic reorganization of GM1 into large clusters or macrodomains that colocalize extensively with components of the DAP complex in cortical astrocyte cultures. Laminin-mediated clustering of AQP4 is dependent both on cholesterol-sensitive lipid rafts and the DAP complex bringing novel insight into ECM-dependent membrane domain organization and the mechanisms underlying the polarized distribution of these proteins in astrocytes. The following antibodies were used in the present study: rabbit anti-AQP4 against rat glutathione S-transferase AQP4 corresponding to residues 249–323 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), rabbit anti-laminin against purified mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin, which recognizes laminin α1, β1, and γ1 chains, rabbit polyclonal antibody to dystrophin (a generous gift from Dr. S. Carbonetto, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), rabbit anti-caveolin-1 against the N terminus of human caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-GFAP against the glial fibrillary acidic protein isolated from cow spinal cord (Dako, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), mouse anti-β-DG, 43DAG1/8D5, against the 15 of the last 16 amino acids at the C terminus of the human dystroglycan sequence (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK), mouse anti- syntrophin, SYN1351, against Torpedo syntrophin (Affinity Bioreagents), mouse anti-flotillin-1 (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-α-tubulin against residues 426–450 (Abcam), mouse anti-TfR against the transferrin receptor (TfR) against residues 3–28 of the human TfR tail (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and mouse anti-utrophin (8A4, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rats (E18) (Sprague-Dawley, Charles River). Cortices were dissected, and meninges and choroid plexus were removed. They were then cut into small pieces and incubated for 25 min with trypsin (3.0 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Dissociated cortices were then plated in culture flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) for 2–3 weeks. The culture medium was changed every 3 days. To remove microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitors, the flasks were shaken the day following the plating. After trypsinization, the cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) in 24-well plates at a density of 200–250 × 103 cells/ml. Two days after plating, the cells were treated for 8 h with either 30 nm Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich), C-agrin 4,8 (10 nm), C-agrin 0,0 (10 nm, generous gift from Dr. M. Ferns, University of California, Davis), or with 100 nm fibronectin (Sigma). Astrocytes were transfected in suspension before plating with 100 nm Dag1 and Aqp4 siRNAs (siGENOME and ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA reagents, Dharmacon) and control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA, Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. One day and a half after plating, astrocytes were treated for 8 h with 30 nm laminin-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequently analyzed by immunofluorescence. The efficiency of transfection was assessed by immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted on ice using an extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm glycine, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 5 mm EDTA. For the cholesterol depletion experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm mevastatin or 0.5 μg/ml filipin for 8 h or with 20 mm methyl β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. For the cholesterol repletion experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm mevastatin and 50 μg/ml cholesterol (Sigma) for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated for 25 min at 4 °C with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 μg/ml FITC-conjugated CtxB (Sigma). Then, they were rinsed with warm PBS and fixed by immersion in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 20 min followed by rinsing in PBS, 3 × 15 min. The cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.25% Triton X-100. Double immunolabeling was performed by incubating the cells at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of primary antibodies against β-DG (1/25) and laminin (1/1500) or AQP4 (1:200), syntrophin (1:100) and laminin (1/1500), utrophin (1/10) and dystrophin (1/100), flotillin-1 (1/25) and AQP4 (1/100), or β-DG (1/25) and caveolin-1 (1/100). Subsequently, they were rinsed with PBS (3 × 15 min) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h (1/200, Molecular Probes). After several washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with or without 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). To confirm the specificity of the labeling, control cells were treated equivalently in the absence of primary antibodies. Fluorescent labeling of cultured cells was visualized using a confocal microscope (Fluoview 1000, Olympus) and an Uplan Apochromat 1.35 numerical aperture 60× objective (Olympus). Cortical astrocytes plated in 8-well μ-slides (Ibidi, Munich, Germany) were incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-CtxB for 20 min. Images were acquired on a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus) with an Uplan Apochromat 1.35 numerical aperture 60× objective and fully opened pinhole. Photobleaching of FITC-CtxB was performed for 50 ms using a 405 simultaneous scanner set at 60% power within a circular area of 15-pixel diameter. Fluorescence recovery data were collected every second for over 120 s from 8 cells per experiment and analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad) using non-linear regression. To separate detergent-soluble from -insoluble fractions, the cultured astrocytes were harvested and suspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture. After 20-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) and non-detergent-resistant membranes (non-DRMs). For the flotation assay, astrocyte cultures were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in TNE buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Other astrocyte cultures were harvested and lysed in a detergent-free buffer using 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, as previously described (26.Song K.S. Li Shengwen Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were collected and subjected to a flotation assay using a discontinuous sucrose gradient. To prepare the latter, 1 ml of supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of 85% sucrose in TNE and transferred to the bottom of a Beckman centrifuge tube. The diluted cell lysate was overlaid with 2 ml of 50% sucrose, 3 ml of 35% sucrose, 1 ml of 15% sucrose and finally with 200 μl of TNE buffer. The samples were centrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 200,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. Fractions numbered 1–8 were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western and dot blots. The samples obtained from siRNA-transfected astrocytes as well as from the subcellular fractionation of astrocyte cultures were denatured by boiling for 9 min in reducing sample buffer and then loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and the blots were probed with antibodies to AQP4 (1/1000), caveolin-1 (1/500), flotillin-1 (1/500), β-DG (1/300), α-tubulin (1/1000), and TfR (1/1000). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (1/2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch). To detect the GM1 ganglioside, 1 μl of each fraction was dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled CtxB (10 ng/ml horseradish peroxidase-CtxB, Sigma). Signals were visualized on Bioflex econo films (Interscience, Markham, Ontario, Canada) using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The number of clusters, surface area of the clusters, and the colocalization between clusters containing GM1 and β-DG, β-DG and laminin, β-DG and AQP4, laminin and GM1, as well as AQP4 and GM1 were determined on images subjected to a threshold using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). Signals were considered as clusters when their intensity was above background and above surrounding diffuse immunofluorescence and when their size was at least 1.5 μm2. Clusters were counted in an average of 15 random fields per treatment, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Images from the same experiment were captured using identical acquisition parameters and subjected to the same threshold. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 3.00 software and unpaired Student's t test. To determine the distribution pattern of β-DG and AQP4 in lipid raft-containing fractions, Triton X-100 extracts from primary astrocyte cultures were subjected to a flotation assay. The distribution of these proteins was also evaluated in lipid raft fractions obtained using detergent-free astrocytes extracts. The efficiency of the subcellular fractionation was confirmed by probing the obtained fractions with antibodies to the TfR, α-tubulin, flotillin-1, caveolin-1, as well as with horseradish peroxidase-CtxB to detect GM1 (Fig. 1A). Fractions 1–4 obtained from Triton X-100 and detergent-free extracts were both enriched for the lipid raft markers flotillin-1, caveolin-1, and GM1 (Fig. 1A). As previously described (27.Hibino H. Kurachi Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2539-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), AQP4 was enriched in low density lipid raft-containing fractions 1 to 4 and was not detected in non-lipid raft fractions 5–8 (Fig. 1A). However, β-DG co-distributed with the TfR and α-tubulin to fractions 5–8 (Fig. 1A). This is in agreement with previous findings showing that β-DG was not found in the GM1-containing lipid raft fractions isolated from embryonic stem cell cultures (28.Shah W.A. Peng H. Carbonetto S. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We then determined whether the disruption of lipid rafts using mevastatin, filipin, or methyl β-cyclodextrin to deplete membrane cholesterol resulted in alteration of AQP4 distribution in astrocyte cultures. In control astrocytes, we found that the DRM fraction was enriched for flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 as well as GM1 and contained AQP4 but virtually no β-DG (+DMSO, Fig. 1B). However, high amounts of β-DG were found in the non-DRM fraction (+DMSO, Fig. 1B), confirming the results obtained using the flotation assay (Fig. 1A). In astrocyte cultures treated with either mevastatin (+Mevastatin, Fig. 1B), filipin (supplemental Fig. S1A), or methyl β-cyclodextrin (supplemental Fig. S1B), a decrease in the amounts of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 was observed in the DRM compared with control untreated cells (+DMSO, Fig. 1B). Moreover, a pool of flotillin-1, caveolin-1, and GM1 translocated to non-DRM confirming that mevastatin (Fig. 1B), filipin, and methyl β-cyclodextrin (supplemental Fig. S1) efficiently depleted membrane cholesterol. Most interestingly, AQP4 also partially translocated to non-DRM fractions indicative of the cholesterol-dependent association of a pool of AQP4 with DRM (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). To investigate the effect of laminin on the organization of lipid rafts containing the ganglioside GM1, we used FITC-CtxB. In laminin-treated astrocytes, GM1 presented a robust clustering (Fig. 2E) compared with control untreated astrocytes where the distribution of GM1 was diffuse (Fig. 2A). These clusters presented a high degree of colocalization with the laminin clusters (Fig. 2, E–H). Furthermore, laminin did not induce a detectable change in the morphology of astrocytes, because laminin-treated astrocytes presented a flat and polygonal shape similar to that of control untreated astrocytes as assessed by wheat germ agglutinin labeling (supplemental Fig. S2). Together these data show that the laminin-induced reorganization of the raft component GM1 is not associated with a change in astrocyte morphology. To determine whether laminin-induced clustering of GM1 affected its diffusion in the membrane (29.Kenworthy A.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 398: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Lajoie P. Partridge E.A. Guay G. Goetz J.G. Pawling J. Lagana A. Joshi B. Dennis J.W. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of FITC-CtxB in untreated and laminin-treated astrocytes (Fig. 3). Laminin treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in the rate of FITC-CtxB recovery but only for FITC-CtxB localized within the laminin-induced clusters (Fig. 3, A–C). This shows that laminin stabilizes GM1-bound FITC-CtxB within the clusters and reduces the exchange rate of FITC-CtxB within the bleached region with FITC-CtxB outside the bleached region. Therefore, the colocalization of CtxB and laminin clusters not only reflects a laminin-induced redistribution of GM1 but also reveals a role for laminin in the stabilization of this raft component in astrocyte membrane domains. Given that laminin induces the coclustering of the DAP complex with both Kir4.1 and AQP4 (8.Guadagno E. Moukhles H. Glia. 2004; 47: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we asked whether this coincided with the laminin-induced clustering of GM1. In the absence of laminin, GM1 labeled with FITC-CtxB was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 4, A, E, and I). Utrophin (Fig. 4B), dystrophin (Fig. 4C), syntrophin (Fig. 4F), β-DG (Fig. 4J), and AQP4 (Fig. 4K) also exhibited a homogeneous distribution. Upon laminin treatment, CtxB-labeled GM1 coclustered with utrophin and dystrophin (Fig. 4, M–P), syntrophin, and laminin (Fig. 4, Q–T) as well as with β-DG and AQP4 clusters (Fig. 4, U–X). This laminin-induced clustering of these DAP complex components was not accompanied by a change in their expression levels as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Quantitative analysis revealed over 2-fold increase in the number of GM1 clusters in the laminin-treated compared with the untreated astrocytes that parallels the increase in the number of β-DG, laminin, and AQP4 clusters, as previously reported (Fig. 5A) (8.Guadagno E. Moukhles H. Glia. 2004; 47: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25.Noël G. Belda M. Guadagno E. Micoud J. Klöcker N. Moukhles H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The surface area of GM1-containing clusters increased significantly by >6-fold in the laminin-treated compared with untreated astrocytes, as did the surface area of β-DG and AQP4 (Fig. 5B). The higher laminin concentration used in the present study (30 nm instead of 15 nm) may account for the increase in the surface area of these AQP4 clusters relative to a previous study (8.Guadagno E. Moukhles H. Glia. 2004; 47: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A significant degree of colocalization was f"

Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The shortest RNA molecule able to retain contacts with these two regions simultaneously is a 10-nucleotide fragment, and this is also the minimum length necessary to maintain the processivity of the enzyme (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, simultaneous binding of substrate to both sites is necessary for a processive degradation. Moreover, the structure of the RNA-bound complex revealed a tight packing of the five 3′-terminal nucleotides in the catalytic cavity, mediated by the conserved aromatic residues Tyr-253 and Phe-358 (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). When the RNA substrate is shorter than 5 nucleotides the required packing of the bases can no longer occur, impeding the translocation of the RNA and generating the typical 4-nt fragment as the end-product for RNase II. A mutational analysis of E. coli RNase II has been reported (26Barbas A. Matos R.G. Amblar M. López-Viñas E. Gomez-Puertas P. Arraiano C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), confirming the crucial role of Tyr-253 in setting the end-product of RNase II degradation. In addition, this analysis showed that conserved acidic residues in the active site can have a different role during the degradation mechanism (26Barbas A. Matos R.G. Amblar M. López-Viñas E. Gomez-Puertas P. Arraiano C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNase II is specific for RNA. However, although it does not degrade DNA, it is still able to bind it. DNA oligonucleotides have been shown to act as reaction inhibitors of the E. coli RNase II, suggesting that both DNA and RNA compete for the same binding sites of the enzyme (25Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that the ribose specificity of RNase II is not for the scissile bond but for the nearby nucleotides (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of a ribose between positions 2 through 5 from the 3′-end of the RNA substrate is required for cleavage to occur (25Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 930-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RNase II-RNA-bound complex (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) revealed direct contacts between the residues Asp-201, Tyr-313, and Glu-390 and the O2′ ribose oxygens of nucleotides in positions 2, 4, and 6 (Fig. 1B). Such interactions seem to be responsible for the proper orientation of the RNA at the catalytic cavity and may account for the specificity of RNA versus DNA in RNase II. Structural data also revealed that there are two other conserved residues at the active site that seem to be crucial for RNase II activity, Arg-500 and Glu-542 (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the RNA-complexed structure, the Arg-500 is positioned between the two nucleotides at the 3′-end interacting with their phosphate backbones (Fig. 1B). It was postulated that Arg-500 could assist in catalysis by fixing the phosphodiester bond at the cleavage position and enhancing the susceptibility of the leaving phosphorous atom to a nucleophilic attack (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Glu-542 is in close proximity to the nitrogen atoms of the leaving nucleotide (Fig. 1B) and was suggested to facilitate the elimination of this nucleotide upon phosphor-ester cleavage by pulling it out of the base-stacked position (22Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this report we analyze the role of some of these highly conserved amino acids in RNase II activity. We studied the function of Asp-201, Tyr-313, and Glu-390 in the cleavage discrimination of RNA versus DNA. Our results showed that only Tyr-313 and Glu-390 are crucial for RNA specificity of RNase II. We also demonstrate that Arg-500 is essential for RNase II activity, but it is not involved in RNA binding. Moreover, the most prominent findings presented are the extraordinary catalysis and binding abilities observed in the E542A mutant that turns RNase II into a super-enzyme. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Pfu DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Fermentas. Unlabeled oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by STAB Vida, Portugal.

All mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at STAB Vida, Portugal. The plasmid used for expression of wild-type E. coli histidine-tagged RNase II protein was pFCT6.9 plasmid (10Cairrão F. Chora A. Zilhão R. Carpousis J. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 276: 19172-19181Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the rnb gene cloned into pET-15b vector (Novagen) under the control of ϕ10 promoter, allowing the expression of the His6-tagged RNase II fusion protein. All other plasmids bearing mutations were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen) to allow the expression of the recombinant proteins. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.45 and then induced for 2 h by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Purification of all proteins was performed by histidine affinity chromatography using HiTrap Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare) and the AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) following the protocol previously described (30Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Arraiano C.M. Barbas A. Amblar M. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 447: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell suspensions were lysed using a French press at 9000 p.s.i. in the presence of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The crude extracts were treated with Benzonase (Sigma) to degrade the nucleic acids and clarified by a 30-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The clarified extracts were then added to a HiTrap chelating-Sepharose 1-ml column equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8, 20 mm imidazole and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Protein elution was achieved by a continuous imidazole gradient (from 20–500 mm) in buffer A. The fractions containing the purified protein were pooled together, and buffer was exchanged to buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using a desalting 5-ml column (GE Healthcare). Eluted proteins were concentrated by centrifugation at 15 °C with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices of 30,000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry, and 50% (v/v) glycerol was added to the final fractions before storage at −20 °C. 0.5 μg of each purified protein was applied in a 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1C). Exoribonucleolytic activity was assayed using different RNA oligoribonucleotides as substrates (30Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar): a poly(A) chain of 35 nt as a single-stranded substrate, a 30-mer oligoribonucleotide (5′-CCCGACACCAACCACUAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-3′) annealed to the complementary 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-AGTGGTTGGTGTCGGG-3′) as a double-stranded substrate with a 3′-single-stranded extension, and the DNA-RNA chimeric substrates Chi1 (5′-dTdTdTdTdTdTdTdTdTdTdTrCrCdTdT-3′) and Chi2 (5′-dTdTdT dTdTdTdTdTdTdTdTrCdTrCdT-3′). All the oligoribonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32ATP] and T4 polynucleotide kinase and further purified with Microcon YM-3 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) to remove the non-incorporated nucleotides. The hybridization between 30-mer and 16-mer oligomers was performed in a 1:1 (mol:mol) ratio in the Tris component of the activity by 5 min of incubation at 68 °C followed by 45 min as room temperature. The exoribonucleolytic reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10 μl containing 30 nm concentrations of substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of each enzyme added to the reaction was adjusted to obtain linear conditions and is indicated in the respective figures (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn at the time points indicated in the figures (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), and the reaction was stopped by adding formamide-containing dye supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. Reaction products were resolved in a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea and analyzed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned, and the densities of the bands were quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software. The exoribonucleolytic activity of the enzymes was determined by measuring and quantifying the disappearance of the substrate from gels in several distinct experiments, and each value obtained represents the mean of at least three independent assays. The specific activity of each enzyme is given as the nmol of substrate consumed/min/nmol of protein at 37 °C. Results obtained are shown in Table 1.FIGURE 3Exoribonuclease activity with ds16–30 substrate; comparison of wild-type and mutant proteins.

Preliminary assays (not shown) showed that product formation proceeded linearly at the protein concentrations and for the incubation times used in the experiments reported here. As such, the protein activities were measured at the following substrate concentrations: 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 nm. The protein concentrations used were 5 pm and 0.1 fm for the WT and the E542A mutant, respectively. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 2 min with these protein concentrations as under these conditions less than 20% of substrate was degraded. Reactions were stopped by adding formamide-containing dye supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. Reaction products were resolved in a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea and analyzed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned, and the densities of the bands were quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software. The amount of product was calculated by using the original substrate concentration and the final ratio of remaining substrate and product formed. Lineweaver-Burk plots (32Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7890) Google Scholar) were used to estimate kinetic parameters: Km, Vmax, and kcat. Each value obtained represents the mean of at least three independent assays, and the S.D. was calculated from these data sets. Biacore SA chips were obtained from Biacore Inc. (GE Healthcare). The flow cells of the SA streptavidin sensor chip were coated with a low concentration of the following substrates. On flow cell 1 no substrate was added so this cell could be used as the control blank cell. On flow cell 2 a 5′-biotinylated 25-nucleotide RNA oligomer (5′-CCCGACACCAACCACUAAAAAAAAA-3′) was added to allow the study of the protein interaction with a single-stranded RNA molecule. On flow cell 3 a 5′-biotinylated 16-nucleotide DNA oligomer (5′-AGTGGTTGGTGTCGGG-3′) was added to allow the study of the protein interaction with a single-stranded DNA molecule. On flow cell 4 a 5′-biotinylated 35-nucleotide poly(A) oligomer was added to allow the study of the protein interaction with a single-stranded RNA molecule composed only of adenosines. The target RNA and DNA substrates were immobilized on flow cells 2 and 3 by injecting 20 μl of a 500 nm solution of the target RNA or DNA in 1 m NaCl at a 10 μl/min flow rate as described in previous reports (31Arraiano C.M. Barbas A. Amblar M. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 447: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The biosensor assay was run at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm EDTA. The proteins were injected over the flow cells for 2 min at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm using a flow rate of 20 μl/min. All experiments included triple injections of each protein concentration to determine the reproducibility of the signal and control injections to assess the stability of the RNA or DNA surface during the experiment. Bound protein was removed with a 60-s wash with 2 m NaCl, which did not damage the substrate surface. Data from flow cell 1 were used to correct for refractive index changes and nonspecific binding. Rate constants and equilibrium constants were calculated using the BIA EVALUATION 3.0 software package according to the fitting model 1:1 Languimir binding. Using standard comparative modeling methods and the software DeepView (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar), three-dimensional models of wild-type E. coli RNase II (RNB/ECOLI) and E542A mutant proteins were built up from the x-ray structure (PDB code 2IX1 (22Frazão C.

To obtain a fine-grained theoretical model of wild-type RNase II and E542A mutant enzymes bound to a 13-nt poly(A) RNA, a 4-ns MD simulation was performed.

In Xenopus oocytes, mRNA localization to the vegetal pole is important for germ layer formation and germ cell development. Using a biochemical approach, we identified Xenopus Elr-type proteins, homologs of the Hu/ELAV proteins, as novel components of the vegetal mRNA localization machinery. They bind specifically to the localization elements of several different vegetally localizing Xenopus mRNAs, and they are part of one RNP together with other localization proteins, such as Vg1RBP and XStaufen 1. Blocking Elr-type protein binding by either localization element mutagenesis or antisense morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated masking of their target RNA structures, as well as overexpression of wild type and mutant ElrB proteins, interferes with vegetal localization in Xenopus oocytes.

Two major transport pathways that guide specific mRNAs to the vegetal cortex can be distinguished from each other. The early or METRO pathway operates via the mitochondrial cloud during earliest stages of oogenesis. Several early localizing mRNAs have been found to be involved in germ cell development (1Zhou Y. King M.L. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although early localizing RNAs like Xcat2 or Xdazl become first enriched in the mitochondrial cloud by a microtubule-independent diffusion/entrapment mechanism and relocate to the vegetal cortex during stage II along with components of the fragmented mitochondrial cloud (2Forristall C.

Zoolog. B. Mol. Dev. Evol. 2008; 310: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A small population of RNAs exhibits localization features of both pathways and is therefore referred to as intermediate pathway RNAs (17Chan A.P. Kloc M. Etkin L.D.

Both early and late localization pathways are under the control of regulatory RNA elements, usually residing in the 3′-UTR 3The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionLElocalization elementPBSphosphate-buffered salineIPimmunoprecipitationwtwild typeRRMRNA recognition motifVTEVg1 translational element. 3The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionLElocalization elementPBSphosphate-buffered salineIPimmunoprecipitationwtwild typeRRMRNA recognition motifVTEVg1 translational element. of localized mRNAs, referred to as localization elements (LEs) or mitochondrial cloud localization element (reviewed in Refs. 20Jambhekar A.

LEs recruit proteins to form a localization complex. Although proteins that exclusively interact with LEs from early localizing RNAs and that could mediate the entrapment in the MC have not been identified to date, a number of proteins that interact with the localization element of the late localizing Vg1 mRNA have been identified; they include Vg1RBP, hnRNP I, Prrp, VgRBP71/KSRP, XStaufen 1, and 40LoVe (15Yoon Y.J.

Interestingly, mitochondrial cloud localization elements of all early pathway RNAs tested to date can enter the late localization pathway if injected into stage III/IV oocytes, suggesting that they are able to recruit late transport proteins (17Chan A.P.

A core transport RNP containing hnRNP I and Vg1RBP is formed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm. Although Vg1RBP and hnRNP I form direct protein-protein interactions in the nucleus, complex formation becomes RNase-sensitive in the cytoplasm, suggesting that a remodeling step occurs after export to the cytoplasm (32Kress T.L. Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Lewis R.A. Gagnon J.A. Mowry K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). VgRBP71/KSRP and 40LoVe can also be detected in the nucleus, but whether they are indeed part of a nuclear transport RNP remains to be determined (26Kroll T.T. Zhao W.M. Jiang C. Huber P.W. Development. 2002; 129: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Czaplinski K. Köcher T. Schelder M. Segref A. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Dev.

The reassembly step in the cytoplasm includes the recruitment of additional proteins; whereas hnRNP I, Vg1RBP, Prrp, XStaufen 1, and 40LoVe accompany the localizing RNA in the vegetal cytoplasm and get enriched at the cortex (15Yoon Y.J.

Dev. 1999; 88: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), VgRBP71/KSRP is found throughout the cytoplasm with a slight enrichment at the animal cortex (26Kroll T.T. Zhao W.M. Jiang C. Huber P.W. Development. 2002; 129: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rather than directly participating in the vegetal transport, VgRBP71/KSRP has been suggested to translationally activate cortical Vg1 mRNA by stimulating a nuclease that cleaves off the Vg1 translational control element (TCE) (36Kolev N.G. Huber P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because of its interaction with profilin, a regulator of actin dynamics, Prrp has been proposed to function in the microfilament-dependent anchoring of localized RNA at the cortex (25Zhao W.M. Jiang C. Kroll T.T. Huber P.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Staufen 1 into the transport particle might be mediated by hnRNP I, because dominant negative Staufen 1 mutants not only affect vegetal localization of injected RNAs but also lose interaction with hnRNP I (15Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. Development. 2004; 131: 3035-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The active particle transport along microtubule filaments is mediated by overlapping functions of kinesin I and II plus-end directed motor proteins (12Betley J.N. Heinrich B. Vernos I. Sardet C. Prodon F. Deshler J.O. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Messitt T.J. Gagnon J.A. Kreiling J.A. Pratt C.A. Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. Development. 2004; 131: 3035-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further remodeling of the localization RNP is likely to occur at the vegetal cortex, where late localizing RNAs become anchored. Cytokeratin intermediate filaments, in addition to microfilaments, seem to be required for anchoring (14Yisraeli J.K. Sokol S. Melton D.A. Development. 1990; 108: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar, 37Alarcón V.B. Elinson R.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1731-1741PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, vegetally localized RNAs themselves may function as structural components of the cortical cytokeratin meshwork, because antisense oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated depletion of localized RNAs like VegT or xlsirts disrupts the cytokeratin network and leads to a release of specific RNAs from the vegetal cortex (38Heasman J. Wessely O. Langland R. Craig E.J. Kessler D.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Kloc M. Etkin L.D. Science. 1994; 265: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Kloc M. Wilk K. Vargas D. Shirato Y. Bilinski S. Etkin L.D. Development. 2005; 132: 3445-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proteins of the ELAV/Hu protein family are RNA-binding proteins that contain three RRM domains, with RRM2 and 3 being separated by a linker region (41Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Vertebrates express four members of ELAV/Hu-type proteins, namely the ubiquitous HuR (also called HuA or ElrA in Xenopus), HuB (Hel-N1, ElrB), which is expressed in neurons, testes and ovaries, as well as the strictly neuronal proteins HuC (ElrC) and HuD (ElrD). ELAV/Hu-type proteins bind to AU-rich regions and function in a wide variety of posttranscriptional processes, such as control of RNA stability, translational regulation, splicing, and polyadenylation, as well as nucleocytoplasmic transport (reviewed in Ref. 42Hinman M.N. Lou H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). As part of its role in translational regulation, HuR has recently been described to mediate the stress-induced release of microRNA-silenced RNAs from P-bodies for active translation (43Bhattacharyya S.N. Habermacher R. Martine U. Closs E.I. Filipowicz W. Cell. 2006; 125: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Xenopus ElrA/B proteins have been shown to interact with the translational control element of Vg1 mRNA (VTE) and anti-HuR antibody injections support a role for ElrB in the translational repression of Vg1 mRNA during early to mid-oogenesis (44Colegrove-Otero L.J. Devaux A. Standart N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9028-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the function of the late localizing XDead end (XDE) mRNA in Xenopus. As revealed by UV cross-linking experiments, its localization element (XDE-LE) binds to a set of unknown proteins with molecular masses between 35 and 45 kDa (45Horvay K. Claussen M. Katzer M. Landgrebe J. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the identification of these proteins as Xenopus ElrA/B proteins. We further show that Elr-type proteins are part of one RNP complex together with other localization proteins from Xenopus oocytes. ElrA/B bind to a number of additional LEs from both early and late localizing mRNAs. Interfering with Elr-LE interaction, as well as overexpression of wild type or mutant versions of ElrB, results in a loss of vegetal mRNA localization, arguing for a critical role of Elr-type proteins during vegetal RNA localization. Full-length cDNA clones of ElrA (accession number BC086269) and ElrB (accession number NM_001087566) in pSPORT vector were obtained from the RZPD genome resource center. The corresponding IMAGE clone numbers for ElrA and ElrB are IMAGp998E0114218Q and IRBHp990C0179D, respectively. The open reading frames of ElrA and B were amplified by PCR from plasmids and subcloned into StuI and XbaI sites of the pCS2+MT (46Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and pCS2+ FLAG (47Koebernick K. Hollemann T. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the following primers: ElrB_F, AATAGGCCTATGGCAGTCAGACTGTGTGATGTGGCT; ElrB_R, GCCTCTAGATTAAGCTTTGTGTGTTTTGCTCGTTTTGAAC; ElrA_F, TCAAGGCCTATGTCTAACGGTTATGAAGATCACA; and ElrA_R, ATATCTAGATTATTTGTGTGACTTGCTGGTTTTG. For recombinant protein expression, ElrB open reading frame excised from the pCS2+ FLAG construct and subcloned into NcoI and NotI sites of pET21d (Novagen) was employed. The Vg1RBP expression construct was as described (22Havin L. Git A. Elisha Z. Oberman F. Yaniv K. Schwartz S.P. Standart N. Yisraeli J.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). His-tagged ElrB and Vg1RBP proteins were purified as described previously (48Git A. Standart N. RNA. 2002; 8: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For point mutagenesis of the XDE-LE, the XDE-LE was amplified with primers reported in (45Horvay K. Claussen M. Katzer M. Landgrebe J. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Mutant versions of XDE-LE were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step overlap extension PCR as originally described in Ref. 49Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar. PCRs were done using a high fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Fermentas), and DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels by use of a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The mutant XDE-LE was cleaved with BamHI and XhoI for cloning into the pBK-CMV-lacZ tagged vector (11Claussen M. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Horvay K. Claussen M. Katzer M. Landgrebe J. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sequences of mutagenesis primers are available in the supplemental materials. ElrB mutants defective in RNA binding were created by introducing point mutations in the RRM domains by site directed mutagenesis. Mutation sites were chosen according to (50Lisbin M.J. Gordon M. Yannoni Y.M. White K. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1789-1798PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of mutagenesis primers are available in the supplemental materials. Most likely because of inaccuracies of the DNA polymerase used for the mutagenesis PCR, ElrBmut1/2 and ElrBmut1/3 contain additional amino acid changes in the first RRM at amino acid position 100 (D100G, ElrBmut1/2) and amino acid position 73 (L73F, ElrBmut1/3). Oocytes were obtained as described (11Claussen M. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Blendzyme (Sigma) treatment was performed to release the oocytes from the ovary sac. The oocytes were homogenized using a syringe mounted with needles (27 and 24 gauge) in S100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 5% glycerol); after three passages crude extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C in a table top centrifuge (S16 extract). The yolk material was routinely removed by Freon (Merck) extraction (51Evans J.P. Kay B.K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This procedure was adapted from Ref. 52Abe S. Davies E. Memoirs of the College of Agriculture. Vol. 31. Ehime University, Ehime, Japan1986: 187-199Google Scholar; the gradient was formed using S100 buffer containing 5 and 60% glycerol (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5 or 60% glycerol). A polyallomer centrifuge tube (2.2 ml) was filled with 1 ml of the 5% glycerol S100 buffer, and then 1 ml of the 60% glycerol S100 buffer was gently loaded underneath. The tubes were sealed with parafilm and gently placed sideways on a flat plate and incubated at 4 °C for at least 2 h. An approximately linear gradient is formed after the tubes are returned to the upright position. Protein samples (usually a total of 200 μg of S16 in 200 μl of volume) were carefully loaded on top of the preformed gradient. High speed centrifugation was performed in the TLS 55 rotor at a speed of 50,000 rpm (214,200 × g) for 4 h at 4 °C in an Optima TL Ultracentrifuge (Beckmann). Fractions of 200 μl were carefully taken from the top of the gradient and processed for Western blot analysis. Protein fractions enriched for localization proteins were pooled. The glycerol concentration of these fractions was reduced to 5% by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra (Millipore) or Vivaspin (Vivascience) tubes in a swinging bucket rotor (Sorvall) at 4 °C (4000 rpm centrifugation until volume is reduced to desired levels). RNPs were disrupted either by RNase A treatment (10 μg/ml) or by increasing the salt concentration to 400 mm NaCl. After 2 h at 4 °C, the samples were again subjected to ultracentrifugation at ∼200,000 × g (68,000 rpm) in a TLA100.2 rotor (Beckmann). The high speed supernatants were concentrated to the desired levels by using ultrafiltration tubes. The Bio-Rad two-dimensional gel system was used according to the manufacturers instructions; the sample buffer recipe was modified, replacing dithiothreitol with hydroxyethyl-disulfide, DeStreak reagent (GE Healthcare; see Ref. 53Görg A. Weiss W. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3665-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was done with immobilized pH gradients of 3–10 (Bio-Rad) and 7–11 (GE Healthcare), with the second dimension on 11–12% SDS-PAGE. Manually excised gel plugs were subjected to an automated platform for the identification of gel-separated proteins (54Jahn O. Hesse D. Reinelt M. Kratzin H.D. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2006; 386: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as described in the framework of recent large scale proteome studies (55Werner H.B. Kuhlmann K. Shen S. Uecker M. Schardt A.

An Ultraflex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) was used to acquire both peptide mass fingerprint and fragment ion spectra, resulting in confident protein identifications based on peptide mass and sequence information. Data base searches in the NCBI nonredundant primary sequence data base restricted to the taxonomy Xenopus laevis were performed using Mascot software 2.0 (Matrix Science) with parameter settings described earlier (55Werner H.B. Kuhlmann K. Shen S. Uecker M. Schardt A. Dimova K. Orfaniotou F. Dhaunchak A. Brinkmann B.G. Möbius W. Guarente L. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Jahn O. Nave K.A. J.

All of the data sets were searched again without taxonomy restriction to account for potential matches to sequences from Xenopus tropicalis. The minimal requirement for accepting a protein as identified was at least one peptide sequence match above homology threshold in coincidence with at least four peptide masses assigned in the peptide mass fingerprint. Protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were diluted as follows: α-HuR (sc-5261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) 1/4000, α-Vg1RBP (35Zhang Q. Yaniv K. Oberman F. Wolke U. Git A. Fromer M. Taylor W.L. Meyer D.

Horseradish peroxidase-coupled α-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and α-rabbit (Dianova) secondary antibodies were used at 1/10,000 dilutions, and detection was performed using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). Stage II/IV oocytes were embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Tissue-Tek) for cryotome sectioning. The sections were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in PBS containing 0,5% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and blocked for 30 min in PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies (α-HuR (sc-5261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), α-XStaufen 1 (1% bovine serum albumin), and α-40LoVe (27Czaplinski K. Köcher T. Schelder M. Segref A. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Dev.

The specimens were embedded in Dako fluorescent mounting medium and analyzed with a Axioimager M1 microscope (Zeiss). Co-immunoprecipitation reactions were performed in principle as described (44Colegrove-Otero L.J. Devaux A. Standart N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9028-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using NET buffer containing 10% glycerol instead of 0.25% gelatin. To identify ElrA/B-interacting proteins, preparative scale IPs were performed with 50 mg of total oocyte lysate in 50 ml of total IP volume in 50 aliquots, whereas an equivalent of two aliquots was used for silver stained SDS-PAGE analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation of Alexa-labeled XDE-LE RNA were performed essentially as described (11Claussen M. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 1 pmol of Alexa-labeled XDE-LE RNA was added to the in vitro translated proteins. Binding reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 2.5 pmol of morpholino oligonucleotides added 30 min prior to the Alexa-XDE-LE. Sequences of morpholino oligonucleotides are available in the supplemental materials. To assess for the enrichment of localizing RNAs in ElrA/B-containing RNPs, RNA co-immunoprecipitation from stage II–IV oocyte S16 extracts was performed using either α-HuR (sc-5261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or α-Myc (Sigma) (control) antibodies immobilized on GammaBind Plus Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Co-IPs were performed using either YSS buffer (32Kress T.L. Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or IPP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8,0, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with both RNase inhibitors (RNaseOut, Invitrogen) and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Co-precipitated RNAs were released by addition of 1% SDS, phenol chloroform-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol/ammonium acetate. The amount of individual mRNAs in the ElrA/B-RNPs, the control IP or 2% of the input material was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix and iCycler-system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are available in the supplemental materials. The relative enrichment of individual mRNAs in the ElrA/B-RNPs versus the input (E1 = 2−(CT value (α-HuR-IP)-CT value (input))) or versus the control-IP (E2 = 2−(CT value (α-HuR-IP)-CT value (control-IP))), as well as control-IP versus input (E3 = 2−(CT value (control-IP)-CT-value (input))) were calculated according to the 2−ΔCT method (57Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). mRNA enrichment in the ElrA/B-RNPs was scored by the enrichment factor F = (E1 × E2)/E3. To compare the results of independent Co-IP experiments, the enrichment factors of the different mRNAs tested were normalized against the enrichment factor for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. Capped RNAs for oocyte injection were transcribed using the T3 mESSAGE mACHINE kit (Ambion), and pBK-CMV-lacZ-tagged XDE LE and mutant version templates were linearized with XhoI. Labeled RNAs or unlabeled competitor RNAs were synthesized using the T7 MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion). For radiolabeling, the unlabeled UTP provided with the kit was replaced by 5 μl of 20 μCi/μl [α-32P]UTP (GE Healthcare); for Alexa- or Cy3-labeled RNA, the reaction was supplemented with 1 μl of 1 mm ChromaTide Alexa Fluor 546–14-UTP (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) or Cy3-UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Templates of XDE LE and its mutant versions were prepared by cutting the pGEMT plasmids constructs with XhoI. In vitro transcribed RNAs were purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). T7 promoter-containing primers were used to generate templates for in vitro transcription of LE-RNAs by PCR amplification as listed in the supplemental materials. This assay was done as described previously (11Claussen M. Pieler T. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 58Mowry K."
https://openalex.org/W2141534909,Close packing of three chains in a standard collagen triple helix requires Gly as every third residue. Missense mutations replacing one Gly by a larger residue in the tripeptide repeating sequence in type I collagen are common molecular causes of osteogenesis imperfecta. The structural and dynamic consequences of such mutations are addressed here by NMR studies on a peptide with a Gly-to-Ser substitution within an alpha1(I) sequence. Distances derived from nuclear Overhauser effects indicate that the three Ser residues are still packed in the center of the triple helix and that the standard 1-residue stagger is maintained. NMR dynamics using H-exchange and temperature-dependent amide chemical shifts indicate a greater disruption of hydrogen bonding and/or increased conformational flexibility C-terminal to the Ser site when compared with N terminal. This is consistent with recent suggestions relating clinical severity with an asymmetric effect of residues N- versus C-terminal to a mutation site. Dynamic studies also indicate that the relative position between a Gly in one chain and the mutation site in a neighboring staggered chain influences the disruption of the standard hydrogen-bonding pattern. The structural and dynamic alterations reported here may play a role in the etiology of osteogenesis imperfecta by affecting collagen secretion or interactions with other matrix molecules.
https://openalex.org/W2080437967,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) productive replication occurs in an S-phase-like cellular environment with high cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. The EBV protein kinase (PK), encoded by the viral BGLF4 gene, is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which phosphorylates both viral and cellular proteins, modifying the cellular environment for efficient viral productive replication. We here provide evidence that the EBV PK phosphorylates the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner during EBV productive replication. Experiments with BGLF4 knockdown by small interfering RNA and BGLF4 knock-out viruses clarified that EBV PK is involved in p27Kip1 degradation upon lytic replication. Transfection of the BGLF4 expression vector revealed that EBV PK alone could phosphorylate the Thr-187 residue of p27Kip1 and that the ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1 occurred in an SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner. In vitro, EBV PK proved capable of phosphorylating p27Kip1 at Thr-187. Unlike cyclin E-CDK2 activity, the EBV PK activity was not inhibited by p27Kip1. Overall, EBV PK enhances p27Kip1 degradation effectively upon EBV productive replication, contributing to establishment of an S-phase-like cellular environment with high CDK activity.

It specifically inhibits the activity of CDK2 by binding to cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes. Levels of p27Kip1 protein oscillate during the cell cycle, and one of the key mechanisms involved in their regulation is ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (3.Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M.

In S-phase, p27Kip1 is phosphorylated at Thr-187 by cyclin E-CDK2 and is then recognized and targeted for ubiquitination by SCFSkp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2), an F-box protein that functions as the receptor component of an SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase complex (4.Bloom J.

Although p27Kip1-bound CDK2 is catalytically inactive in vitro, phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Tyr-74 and Tyr-88 by Abl and Src family kinases can impair the inhibitory action of p27Kip1 for cyclin E-CDK2, p27Kip1 consequently becoming a substrate for cyclin E-CDK2 and degraded in the nucleus (9.Chu I.

Thus, phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Tyr-74 and Tyr-88 residues is a prerequisite for phosphorylation of Thr-187 by cyclin E-CDK2. Alternatively, there exists another p27Kip1 degradation system in G1 phase, featuring phosphorylation at Ser-10 by kinase-interacting stathmin or the minibrain-related kinase in nuclei (12.Boehm M.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human lymphotropic herpesvirus with a linear double-stranded DNA, 172 kb in length (17.Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007Google Scholar). Primary EBV infection targets resting B lymphocytes, inducing their continuous proliferation. In resultant B lymphoblastoid cell lines, a limited number of viral proteins are usually expressed, and there is no production of virus particles, this being termed latent infection. Reactivation from latency can occur spontaneously or be induced artificially. A virus-productive lytic stage is initiated by the expression of the viral immediate early BZLF1 protein, a b-Zip transcriptional factor that binds to AP-1-like sequences present in the promoters of early lytic genes, followed by an ordered cascade of viral gene expression, viral DNA replication, and virion production (18.Le Roux F. Sergeant A. Corbo L. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). During lytic replication, the levels of cyclin E and cyclin A continue to be elevated, and cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated CDK activities increase, thereby causing accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and an increase of the level of E2F-1 protein (19.Kudoh A.

Chemical CDK inhibitors, like purvalanol A and roscovitine, block viral lytic replication through prevention of viral immediate early and early gene expression (20.Kudoh A. Daikoku T. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, a cellular environment with high CDK activity is required for efficient viral replication. The EBV protein kinase (PK) encoded by the BGLF4 gene is a Ser/Thr protein kinase conserved throughout all subfamilies of Herpesviridae, targeting proline-directed Ser/Thr (21.Kawaguchi Y. Kato K.

EBV PK phosphorylates not only viral proteins, such as EBV BZLF1, BMRF1 (EA-D), EBNA-LP, EBNA2, and protein kinase itself, but also several cellular proteins, including EF-1δ, lamin A/C, MCM4, and MCM6 (22.Lee C.P.

Especially, phosphorylation of Thr-19 and Thr-110 residues on MCM4 results in loss of helicase activity of MCM4-6-7 complexes (26.Kudoh A. Daikoku T. Ishimi Y. Kawaguchi Y. Shirata N. Iwahori S. Isomura H. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10064-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), providing an example of EBV PK-mediated protein phosphorylation causing a dramatic functional change. Knockdown of the EBV PK protein by small interfering RNA reduces the yield of infectious virus particles (30.Gershburg E. Raffa S. Torrisi M.R. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this paper, we document evidence that, during EBV productive replication, EBV PK phosphorylates p27Kip1 so that it is ubiquitinated by SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Unlike the cyclin E-CDK2 activity, the EBV PK activity is not inhibited by p27Kip1. Overall, EBV possesses its own strategy to degrade p27Kip1 upon onset of productive replication, contributing to provision of an S-phase-like cellular environment with high CDK activity. HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

To prepare the expression vector for BGLF4, pcDNA-BGLF4, the PCR product of BGLF4 was amplified with the B95-8 genome as a template and two primers (5′-CAGTGAATTCATGGATGTGAATATGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-ATACTCTAGATCATCCACGTCGGCCATCTG-3′) and cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Next, pcDNA- BGLF4 was double-digested with EcoRI and XbaI, the purified BGLF4 DNA fragment was subcloned into EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) with a FLAG tag, and the resultant plasmid was designated pcDNA-FLAG/BGLF4. The expression vectors for kinase-dead (kd) BGLF4 containing a lysine 102 → isoleucine mutation (pcDNA-kd BGLF4 and pcDNA-FLAG/kd BGLF4) were constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the primer sets 5′-ATAATGCCACGGTCATACTCTATGACTCTGT-3′ and 5′-ACAGAGTCATAGAGTATGACCGTGGCATTAT-3′, with pcDNA- BGLF4 and pcDNA-FLAG/BGLF4 as templates, respectively.

Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 15% (acrylamide (A)/bisacrylamide (B) = 72:1) SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore). Immunoreactivity was detected by Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and images were processed with LumiVision PRO 400EX (Aisin/Taitec Inc.). Signal intensity was quantified with a LumiVision Analyzer 400. The system used in this study mounts a cooled CCD camera that has a 16-bit (65,535) grayscale wide dynamic range. It enhances the accuracy of the quantitative analysis up to 100 times compared with ordinary quantitative analysis scanning of an x-ray film into the personal computer after exposing the signal to the film. For detection of phosphorylation and degradation of endogenous p27Kip1, HeLa cells (6 × 105) and HEK293T cells (1.2 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA-FLAG/BGLF4 or FLAG/kd BGLF4 using a microporator (Digital Bio). For detection of phosphorylation and degradation of exogenous p27Kip1 or mutated p27Kip1, 0.5 μg of pcDNA-FLAG/p27Kip1 or expression vectors of mutated p27Kip1 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells (1.2 × 106) with 4 μg of pcDNA-FLAG/BGLF4 or FLAG/kd BGLF4 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 27 h post-transfection (hpt), the transfected cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis. For lytic induction of 293/EBV-WT, 293/EBV-dBGLF4/NeoSt, or 293/EBV-dBGLF4/NeoSt/R cells, the cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA-BZLF1 using a microporator.

Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 200 pmol of si-BGLF4 or control siRNA using a microporator. For overexpression of p27Kip1 in EBV-latently infected cells, 293/EBV-WT cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA-BZLF1 and 0.5 μg of pcDNA-FLAG/p27Kip1 using a microporator.

The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS gel loading buffer, and samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-p27Kip1-phospho-Thr-187 and p27Kip1 antibodies. To assess inhibition by p27Kip1, inhibition assays were performed with some modifications from the previous report (37.Swanton C. Mann D.J. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Peters G. Jones N.

A 30-ng aliquot of GST-fused BGLF4 and 50 ng of cyclin E-CDK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) were preincubated with various amounts of GST-fused p27Kip1 (8, 40, 200, and 1000 ng) in the absence of ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation reactions (40 μl) were conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 μg of histone H1, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in each p27Kip1/kinase mixture for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS gel loading buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-15% PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation was performed under denaturing conditions. HEK293T cells transfected with pcDNA-FLAG/ p27Kip1, pcDNA-WT or kd BGLF4, and pcDNA-HA-Ub were added with MG132 (10 μm) at 24 hpt, harvested at 40 hpt, and suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and boiled for 3 min to completely denature proteins and disrupt non-covalent interactions. Then samples were sonicated and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The lysate was diluted with 950 μl of dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 167 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 3 h. The immune complex was washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and eluted with SDS gel loading buffer. 293/EBV-WT, 293/EBV-dBGLF4/NeoSt, and 293/EBV-dBGLF4/NeoSt/R cells were transfected with the BZLF1 expression vector to induce lytic replication. Alternatively, 293/EBV-WT cells were transfected with BZLF1 expression plasmid together with non-targeting/control siRNA, Skp2 siRNA, or various amounts of pcDNA-FLAG/p27Kip1. Cells and the culture supernatant were harvested at 60 hpt, freeze-thawed, and centrifuged. The supernatant from centrifugation was filtered and used as a virus stock. EBV-negative Akata(−) cells (38.Shimizu N. Tanabe-Tochikura A. Kuroiwa Y. Takada K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6069-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were infected with the virus, and enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells were counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. EBV-latently infected Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells, in which exogenous BZLF1 protein is conditionally expressed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (31.Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), were treated with doxycycline to induce lytic replication. As shown in Fig. 1A, BZLF1 protein was detected by 10 h postinduction (hpi) and reached a plateau at 24 hpi. The early EBV proteins, BMRF1 (polymerase accessory protein) and BGLF4 (protein kinase), became strongly detectable at 24 hpi. Interestingly, the protein level of p27Kip1 decreased gradually from 24 hpi, and only 30% remained at 72 hpi. A proteasome inhibitor, MG132, restored the p27Kip1 protein level in doxycycline-treated Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that down-regulation of p27Kip1 upon EBV lytic infection is proteasome-dependent. Similarly, when Akata(+) cells, an EBV-positive B cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma, were treated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgG to induce lytic replication, the p27Kip1 protein level became reduced remarkably upon lytic replication (Fig. 1C). There are two different pathways for the proteasome-dependent degradation of p27Kip1. During the G1 phase, p27Kip1 is phosphorylated at Ser-10, exported to the cytoplasm, and then ubiquitinated by KPC (14.Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M.

On the other hand, p27Kip1 is phosphorylated at Thr-187 by cyclin E-CDK2 and ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2 in the nucleus, followed by degradation (4.Bloom J. Pagano M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 5.Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Since EBV PK can phosphorylate CDK2 or CDK1 target sites (21.Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26.Kudoh A. Daikoku T. Ishimi Y. Kawaguchi Y. Shirata N. Iwahori S. Isomura H. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10064-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that the EBV PK is involved in p27Kip1 phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. At first, we examined whether silencing of BGLF4 expression by an siRNA strategy affects p27Kip1 levels after induction of lytic replication. Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells were transfected with BGLF4-targeting siRNA (si-BGLF4) or non-targeting/control siRNA. At 17 hpt, cells were treated with doxycycline for induction of lytic replication (Fig. 2A). In control siRNA-transfected cells, BGLF4 protein became detectable by 24 hpi, whereas the BGLF4-targeting siRNA prevented accumulation of BGLF4 protein throughout the lytic replication. The level of p27Kip1 decreased significantly by 24 hpi in control siRNA-transfected cells. In contrast, the p27Kip1 levels in cells transfected with BGLF4-targeting siRNA proved constant throughout the lytic replication. The expression levels of BZLF1 and BMRF1 proteins were comparable between cells transfected with either control siRNA or BGLF4 targeting siRNA (Fig. 2A), confirming a previous report (30.Gershburg E. Raffa S. Torrisi M.R. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since the BMRF1 protein is a target of BGLF4 (24.Chen M.R. Chang S.J. Huang H. Chen J.Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the level of slower migrating bands of the BMRF1 protein in SDS-PAGE decreased with progression of the lytic replication in cells transfected with BGLF4-targeting siRNA, proving its efficacy. Next, p27Kip1 protein levels were compared in lytic replication-induced HEK293 cells with a wild-type or BGLF4-deficient EBV-bacmid genome. When HEK293 cells harboring the wild-type EBV-bacmid (293/EBV-WT) were transfected with the BZLF1 expression vector to induce lytic replication, the p27Kip1 protein level decreased (Fig. 2B), corresponding well with the data for Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 and Akata(+) cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, no reduction of p27Kip1 was observed in cells harboring the BGLF4 knock-out virus, whereas reduction was again observed in cells harboring revertant virus. Lytic replication appeared to be equally induced among the three viruses, since comparable amounts of BZLF1 protein were expressed. Lack of BGLF4 expression and change in phosphorylation states of BMRF1 protein in the cells with the knock-out virus were clearly observed, as expected. It was also confirmed that levels of viral DNA synthesis among those viruses are almost the same (data not shown), but the virus yield with the knock-out virus was significantly impaired as compared with wild-type and revertant virus cases (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggest that EBV PK is involved in p27Kip1 degradation in the context of lytic replication. We next investigated direct effects of BGLF4 expression on p27Kip1 protein levels in HEK293T and HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with empty vector or expression vectors for wild-type BGLF4 (WT BGLF4) or kinase-dead BGLF4 (kd BGLF4) containing a Lys-102 to Ile mutation (Fig. 3A). The level of p27Kip1 in both HEK293T and HeLa cells transfected with the wild-type BGLF4 expression vector was significantly decreased as compared with that in cells transfected with empty vector, whereas transfection of kinase-dead BGLF4 expression vector did not affect the level of p27Kip1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Treatment with MG132 increased p27Kip1 protein to comparable levels, regardless of the types of transfected plasmid (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Thus, p27Kip1 is subjected to deg"
https://openalex.org/W2090647264,"Most human genes undergo alternative splicing, but aberrant splice forms are hallmarks of many cancers, usually resulting from mutations initiating abnormal exon skipping, intron retention, or the introduction of a new splice sites. We have identified a family of aberrant splice variants of HAS1 (the hyaluronan synthase 1 gene) in some B lineage cancers, characterized by exon skipping and/or partial intron retention events that occur either together or independently in different variants, apparently due to accumulation of inherited and acquired mutations. Cellular, biochemical, and oncogenic properties of full-length HAS1 (HAS1-FL) and HAS1 splice variants Va, Vb, and Vc (HAS1-Vs) are compared and characterized. When co-expressed, the properties of HAS1-Vs are dominant over those of HAS1-FL. HAS1-FL appears to be diffusely expressed in the cell, but HAS1-Vs are concentrated in the cytoplasm and/or Golgi apparatus. HAS1-Vs synthesize detectable de novo HA intracellularly. Each of the HAS1-Vs is able to relocalize HAS1-FL protein from diffuse cytoskeleton-anchored locations to deeper cytoplasmic spaces. This HAS1-Vs-mediated relocalization occurs through strong molecular interactions, which also serve to protect HAS1-FL from its otherwise high turnover kinetics. In co-transfected cells, HAS1-FL and HAS1-Vs interact with themselves and with each other to form heteromeric multiprotein assemblies. HAS1-Vc was found to be transforming in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo when introduced as a single oncogene to untransformed cells. The altered distribution and half-life of HAS1-FL, coupled with the characteristics of the HAS1-Vs suggest possible mechanisms whereby the aberrant splicing observed in human cancer may contribute to oncogenesis and disease progression."

The PP2A holoenzyme is composed of three subunits, including a structural A subunit, a catalytic C subunit (PP2Ac), and one of several B regulatory subunits. The heterodimeric PP2A core enzyme, comprised of a C subunit and an A subunit, associates with a wide variety of B regulatory subunits. To date, 15 genes for the B subunit have been identified in the human genome (2Eichhorn P.J. Creyghton M.P. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys.

In conjunction with its multiple functions, there are many signaling molecules or modifications that have effects on rpS3 function. To date, although no clear correlation has been found between these modifications and rpS3 function, it has been determined that rpS3 is post-translationally modified, including by phosphorylation, neddylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination (22Kim T.S.

Among these, rpS3 phosphorylation in particular has been studied in conjunction with the function of rpS3. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) interacts with rpS3 and phosphorylates threonine 42 on rpS3 (23Kim H.D. Lee J.Y. Kim J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hrr25-dependent phosphorylation of rpS3 affects the stable integration of rpS3 into the pre-40 S subunit and the maturation of 40 S ribosomal subunits in yeast (24Schäfer T. Maco B. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Böttcher B. Aebi U. Hurt E. Nature. 2006; 441: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A similar situation has also been observed in mammalian cells where rpS3 is phosphorylated by PKCδ, and the phosphorylated form of rpS3 is only detected in the nonribosomal fraction (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we postulated that phosphorylated rpS3 was dephosphorylated by a phosphatase in the nucleus to be incorporated into the 40 S ribosomal subunit. We determined that PP2Ac interacted with the N terminus of nonribosomal rpS3 in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation sites on rpS3 were involved in the interaction between them. These results indicate that the phosphorylation status of rpS3 is regulated by both PKCδ and PP2A.

To verify the specific phosphatase of rpS3, phosphorylated His-rpS3 was mixed with PP1 (0.1 unit) or PP2A (0.05 unit) for indicated times at 30 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. After the gel was dried, labeled proteins were visualized with a BAS2500 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To determine the interaction of PP2Ac with rpS3, we first used a co-immunoprecipitation assay using overexpressed GFP-PP2Ac. HEK293T cells were transfected with either a GFP or a GFP-PP2Ac plasmid and then immunoprecipitated with GFP or rpS3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, an interaction between rpS3 and GFP-PP2A was verified (lanes 4 and 6) but not control GFP (lanes 3 and 5). We next investigated if this interaction occurred between endogenous PP2Ac and rpS3. We confirmed a specific interaction between endogenous proteins in HT1080 cells (Fig. 1B). Conversely, rpS3 protein was detected in immunoprecipitates derived from PP2Ac antibody (Fig. 1C). We also tested whether rpS3 interacted with PP1, but we detected no interaction between them by immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). These results indicate that rpS3 specifically interacts with PP2Ac in vivo. To expand our data, we examined which regulatory B subunit specifically interacts with rpS3. Even though there are many isoforms of the B subunit, we tested with B55α because this was purified as the sole B subunit complexed with the PP2A C and A subunit in HT1080 cells (29Junttila M.R. Saarinen S. Schmidt T. Kast J. Westermarck J. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows that rpS3 was associated simultaneously with PP2Ac and B55α. These results suggest that rpS3 is a substrate of PP2A. Furthermore, we tested whether PP2A actually dephosphorylates phosphorylated rpS3 through the in vitro dephosphorylation assay. We first obtained phosphorylated His-rpS3 as a substrate from PKCδ kinase assay. Equal amounts of phosphorylated His-rpS3 were mixed with PP1 or PP2A and incubated for the indicated times. Phosphorylation level of rpS3 was time-dependently decreased only in the PP2A mixture (Fig. 1E, upper panel) but not in the PP1 (Fig. 1E, middle panel). These data indicate that PP2A regulates the phosphorylation status of rpS3. We tested which region of rpS3 interacted with PP2Ac. For this we generated GST-fused rpS3 deletion constructs as described in Fig. 2A (25Kim T.S. Jang C.Y. Kim H.D. Lee J.Y. Ahn B.Y. Kim J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These GST fusion constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, and the binding of these rpS3 fragments to PP2Ac was examined using GST pulldown assays. As expected, PP2Ac was pulled down by wild-type GST-rpS3 (Fig. 2B, lane 2) but not by GST alone (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Additionally, PP2Ac was also co-precipitated with the N terminus that contained GST-rpS3 deletion constructs (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5). This result clearly indicates that the N terminus of rpS3 is essential for the interaction with PP2Ac. In previous studies, we demonstrated that rpS3 is phosphorylated by PKCδ and that the phosphorylation of rpS3 was increased by treatment with DNA-damaging agents, such as H2O2 and Ara-C (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, we first tested if the interaction between rpS3 and PP2Ac was affected by oxidative stress. HT1080 cells were treated with 100 μm H2O2 (Fig. 3A) or 10 μm Ara-C (Fig. 3B) for different periods of time, followed by immunoprecipitation assays using rpS3 antibody. We obtained similar results using H2O2 and Ara-C treatments indicating that the interaction between rpS3 and PP2Ac decreases in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). This result is in a good agreement with our previous results showing that rpS3 phosphorylation was increased by H2O2 and Ara-C (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Next, we performed a subcellular fractionation to explore the location of this interaction in cells. HT1080 cells were treated with Ara-C (Fig. 4A) or H2O2 (Fig. 4B) for the indicated times and then fractionated into cytosol and nuclear fractions. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with rpS3 to examine the rpS3 interaction with PP2A. The interaction between rpS3 and PP2A was observed only in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A, lane 5, and B, lane 5), and this was decreased by Ara-C or H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4, A, lanes 6–8, and B, lanes 6–8). This result was predicted, as we reported previously that rpS3 phosphorylation is promoted by oxidative stress and that phosphorylated rpS3 was accumulated in the nucleus (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these results suggest that the phosphorylated form of rpS3 associates with PP2A in the nucleus. We also confirmed that the all constructs used in this study are localized both in the cytosol and nuclear fraction (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 4rpS3 interacts with PP2Ac in the nucleus. A and B, HT1080 cells were treated with 10 μm Ara-C (A) or 100 μm H2O2 (B) for the indicated times. Cells were fractionated into cytosol and nuclear fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of fractionated proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with rpS3 antibody. Fractionated cell extracts (lower panel) and immunoprecipitates (upper panel) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting (IB) with the indicated antibodies. Tubulin was used as a cytosolic marker and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as a nuclear marker to estimate both correct fractionation and normalization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested the effects of OA, a specific inhibitor of PP2A, on the PP2Ac association with rpS3. HT1080 or NIH3T3 cells were treated with 1 or 10 nm OA for 1 h, and then cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with rpS3 antibody. This showed that treatment with 10 nm OA significantly reduced the interaction between the two proteins in both cell lines (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 6). We also examined the interaction using a combination of Ara-C and OA. HT1080 cells were pretreated with or without 20 nm OA for 1 h and were then stimulated with Ara-C as described in Fig. 5B. As shown previously, Ara-C attenuated the rpS3-PP2A interaction (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Moreover, combined stimulation with OA and Ara-C showed greater disruption of the interaction compared with Ara-C alone (Fig. 5B, lane 3). We obtained the same results for NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that the phosphatase activity of PP2A is necessary for the association with rpS3. In the previous data, we used OA as a specific inhibitor of PP2A. To strengthen our data, we tested other OA-sensitive phosphatases using siRNAs. HT1080 cells were transfected with siRNAs for control, PP1, PP2Ac, and PP6, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5D, rpS3 phosphorylation was increased only in the PP2Ac knockdown cells (Fig. 5D, lane 3). This result indicates that PP2A is a sole phosphatase modulating the phosphorylation status of rpS3. We previously verified that the interaction between rpS3 and PP2A was decreased by OA treatment. Therefore, we tested rpS3 phosphorylation under this condition. HT1080 and NIH3T3 cells were treated with OA for 3 h, and then rpS3 phosphorylation was determined using rpS3 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 6A, increased phosphorylation was detected in both of the OA-treated cell lines. To explore a connection with previous results that used genotoxins, we stimulated HT1080 or NIH3T3 cells with Ara-C in the presence or absence of OA pretreatment. rpS3 phosphorylation was not only increased by Ara-C treatment (Fig. 6, B, 2nd lane, and C, 2nd lane) but also increased to a greater extent by OA pretreatment than by Ara-C alone (Fig. 6, B, 3rd and 4th lanes, and C, 3rd lane). These results suggest that PP2A regulates the level of rpS3 phosphorylation. To strengthen these results, we transfected HT1080 cells with either a GFP or a GFP-PP2Ac expression plasmid to observe the effects on rpS3 phosphorylation after Ara-C (Fig. 6D) and H2O2 (Fig. 6E) treatments. We obtained the same results using both Ara-C and H2O2. Both agents promoted rpS3 phosphorylation in cells that expressed GFP (Fig. 6, D and E, 2nd lanes), but there was no induction in cells expressing GFP-PP2Ac (Fig. 6, D and E, 4th lanes). To explore a possible reciprocal relationship, we examined rpS3 phosphorylation in PP2Ac knockdown cells using siRNA. As shown in Fig. 6F, the level of phosphorylated nuclear rpS3 was increased by H2O2 (2nd lane) or Ara-C treatment (4th lane). Moreover, these phosphorylation levels were increased to a greater extent in PP2Ac knockdown cells (Fig. 6F, 3rd and 5th lanes, respectively). This also confirmed previous reports that the amounts of nuclear rpS3 are increased by genotoxic stress (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Yadavilli S. Hegde V. Deutsch W.A. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) indicating that PP2A regulates the rpS3 phosphorylation status in cells. We next performed metabolic labeling using [32P]phosphoric acid to confirm the previous results in vivo. Metabolically labeled cells were treated with Ara-C and OA as indicated, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with rpS3 antibody. As expected, rpS3 phosphorylation was induced by Ara-C or OA treatment (Fig. 6G, 2nd and 4th lanes), and phosphorylation was synergistically increased in cells treated with a combination of OA and Ara-C (Fig. 6G, 3rd lane). Taken together, these results clearly show that PP2A phosphatase activity regulates the phosphorylation level of rpS3. We previously reported that phosphorylated rpS3 was detected only in free nonribosomal rpS3 but not in ribosome-associated rpS3 (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if the interaction between rpS3 and PP2A occurs in the supernatant fraction with existing phosphorylated rpS3. OA-treated or untreated HT1080 cells were fractionated into ribosome fractions and nonribosome fractions by ultracentrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 7A, PP2A was co-purified with rpS3 immunoprecipitates only in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7A, lane 1). Moreover, the amounts of co-purified PP2A were significantly decreased in OA-treated cells (Fig. 7A, lane 3). These results suggest that PP2A interacts with nonribosomal free rpS3 and that OA abrogates the interaction. Subsequently, we examined rpS3 phosphorylation in the nonribosomal fraction. HT1080 cells were treated with Ara-C in the presence or absence of OA pretreatment, and then cell extracts were fractionated into a ribosomal pellet and a supernatant fraction as in Fig. 7A. The phosphorylation level of rpS3 was examined using rpS3 immunoprecipitates. As in our previous report (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), rpS3 phosphorylation was detected only in the nonribosomal fraction (Fig. 7B, lane 1) and was increased by Ara-C treatment (Fig. 7B, lane 3). Furthermore, a large increase in rpS3 phosphorylation was observed in cells treated with both Ara-C and OA (Fig. 7B, lane 5). These results show that PP2A regulates the level of phosphorylated rpS3 through an interaction with nonribosomal free rpS3 but not with ribosome-associated rpS3. Based on our previous and current results, the phosphorylation status of rpS3 appears to be bi-directionally regulated by PKCδ and PP2A. To confirm this supposition, HT1080 cells were treated with inhibitors for MEK (U0126 and PD98059) or PKCδ (rottlerin). The result showed that the phosphorylation status of rpS3 is decreased by the PKCδ inhibitor but not by the MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, association of PP2A with rpS3 also decreased only in the rottlerin-treated cells (Fig. 8A). We next used PKCδ siRNA to confirm the previous result. Control or PKCδ siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells were untreated or treated with PMA. PMA induced the level of rpS3 phosphorylation in control cells (Fig. 8B, 3rd lane) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 8B, 1st lane). However, PKCδ knockdown cells showed a remarkable decrease of rpS3 phosphorylation (Fig. 8B, 2nd and 4th lanes). Therefore, the phosphorylation status of rpS3 appears to be correlated with PP2A interaction. PP2A-rpS3 interaction was decreased by PKCδ down-regulation (Fig. 8B, compare 1st with 2nd lane) and decreased more by PMA treatment (Fig. 8B, 3rd and 4th lanes), suggesting that stress-induced rpS3 phosphorylation is increased both by PKCδ activation and PP2A dissociation. These results indicate that the level of phosphorylated rpS3 is regulated not only by PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation but also PP2A accessibility. Next, we tested whether PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation sites affect the interaction between these two proteins using immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 8C, PP2A interacted only with wild-type FLAG-rpS3 but not with mutant FLAG-rpS3 (S6A,T221A). Subsequently, we tested if this interaction was affected by H2O2 treatment. Wild-type or mutant FLAG-rpS3-transfected HT1080 cells were treated with or without H2O2, and then cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody. We clearly reconfirmed that PP2A only interacted with wild-type FLAG-rpS3 (Fig. 8D, 8th lane) and that the PP2A interaction with FLAG-rpS3 was interrupted by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 8D, 11th lane). These results indicate that the PKCδ phosphorylation sites on rpS3 are required for interaction with PP2A and that both PKCδ and PP2A regulate the status of rpS3 phosphorylation. We previously reported that PKCδ phosphorylated two residues on rpS3, serine 6 and threonine 221, and that this phosphorylation was only detected in nonribosomal rpS3 and not in ribosome-associated rpS3 (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reported that the rpS3 function between the ribosomal component and the extra-ribosomal protein was regulated by its phosphorylation status. These results indicated that there would be a phosphatase that negatively regulates the endonuclease activity of rpS3 function. We have confirmed that the phosphatase is PP2A in this study. We initially identified an interaction between rpS3 and the catalytic C subunit of the PP2A complex. Then we also verified that rpS3 is associated with B55α, a regulatory B subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme (Fig. 1D). Although we did not certify the association of PP2A A subunit in this study, rpS3 appears to be a novel substrate of PP2A. As described previously, there are three major classes of regulatory B subunits, including B/PR55, B′/PR61, and B″/PR72, and each of these subunits has several isoforms (31Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszyńska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These different B subunits regulate the enzyme activity, localization, and substrate specificity of PP2A (33Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R.L. Yang S.I. Craft C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20139-20148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tehrani M.A. Mumby M.C. Kamibayashi C. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Consequently, we can conclude from our previous results that the PP2A-dependent regulation of rpS3 influences the enzyme activity of rpS3 (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further experiments strengthened our results that the status of phosphorylated rpS3 is bidirectionally regulated by PKCδ and PP2A. The basal increment of rpS3 phosphorylation was induced only in the PP2A siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5D). We also demonstrated by using the in vitro dephosphorylation assay that PP2A specifically dephosphorylates rpS3 (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results indicate that PP2A is the only phosphatase for rpS3 dephosphorylation. It has been previously been shown that PP2A generally interacted with a phosphorylated form rather than an intact form of target proteins to induce its dephosphorylation (37Magenta A. Fasanaro P. Romani S. Di Stefano V. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Shouse G.P. Cai X. Liu X. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2008; 283: 22952-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We identified that PP2A interacts with wild-type rpS3, but not with mutants (S6A/T221A) (Fig. 8), and that it associates with the N-terminal region of rpS3 (Fig. 2). From our results presented here, we conclude that PP2A is involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated rpS3 by PKCδ, and that serine 6 on the N-terminal region of rpS3 appears to mediate the PP2A recruitment. In our previous report, we demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of rpS3 was increased and accumulated in the nucleus under oxidative stress conditions (22Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results perfectly coincide with the present results. We demonstrated that rpS3 interacted with PP2A only in the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Moreover, the interaction between rpS3 and PP2A in the nucleus was abrogated by H2O2 or Ara-C treatment. Although the effects of reactive oxygen species on PP2A activity are not precisely known, some reports indicate that reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, inhibits the serine/threonine phosphatase activity, including PP2A (41Hashigasako A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44573-44581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be collectively explained that incremental changes of nuclear rpS3 phosphorylation are due both to PKCδ activation and PP2A inactivation, which induces PP2A dissociation from rpS3 in the nucleus during oxidative stress. Moreover, we also used PMA to activate PKCδ in Fig. 8B. The result showed that rpS3 phosphorylation is increased by PMA, and the interaction between rpS3 and PP2A is decreased in cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 8B, 1st and 3rd lanes). Although there was no direct evidence for PMA-dependent inactivation of PP2A, we identified two possibilities from previous reports. One is the PP2Ac regulatory proteins, such as IEX-1 or SET, which suppress PP2Ac activity by PMA treatment (46Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 47Samanta A.K. Chakraborty S.N. Wang Y. Kantarjian H. Sun X. Hood J. Perrotti D. Arlinghaus R.B. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The other is a PP2Ac phosphorylation at Tyr-307, which inactivates PP2A phosphatase activity (48Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 49Bos C.L. Kodach L.L. van den Brink G.R. Diks S.H. van Santen M.M. Richel D.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Hardwick J.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6447-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that this phosphorylation is mediated by p60v-Src, p56Lck, or JAK, and these kinases are activated by PMA treatment (32Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 47Samanta A.K. Chakraborty S.N. Wang Y. Kantarjian H. Sun X. Hood J. Perrotti D. Arlinghaus R.B.

Ragolia L. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 895-901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2Ac is affected by PMA treatment, and we identified an increased tyrosine phosphorylation in PMA-treated cells (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). In this study, we demonstrated that PP2A interacted with rpS3 and regulated the phosphorylation status of rpS3. This interaction occurred only in the nucleus, and it was decreased under conditions of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we confirmed that PP2A interacted with wild-type FLAG-rpS3 but not with mutant FLAG-rpS3 (S6A/T221A). The interaction was abrogated by OA treatment, indicating that active PP2A interacted with the N-terminal region of rpS3 in the nucleus. Taken together, our results show that the phosphorylation status of rpS3 is regulated reciprocally by PP2A and PKCδ in cells (Fig. 9). Download .pdf (.25 MB) Help with pdf files"

Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The sPLA2s are small secreted proteins of 14–18 kDa that usually contain 5–8 disulfide bonds and an active site His/Asp dyad and are dependent on binding of Ca2+ ions for activity (1.Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The sPLA2s display different tissue distribution patterns and distinct physiological functions. The sPLA2s contain PLA2 groups I–III, V, and IX–XIV, including the snake venoms PLA2s (9.Brunie S. Bolin J. Gewirth D. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9742-9749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the mammalian pancreatic PLA2s (10.Dijkstra B.W. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Members of this family were first studied nearly 100 years ago, and a wealth of information on their structures and molecular action is available; to date, searching the Protein Data Bank for phospholipase A2 yields 230 structure hits, the majority of which refer to sPLA2s. phospholipase A2 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol single-wavelength anomalous dispersion secretory PLA2. phospholipase A2 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol single-wavelength anomalous dispersion secretory PLA2. The eukaryotic sPLA2s all contain highly conserved Ca2+-binding loop (XCGXGG) and catalytic site (DXCCXXHD) motifs. The catalytic mechanism was originally proposed by Verheij et al. in 1980 (11.Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 91: 91-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and subsequently modified from available crystal structures (12.White S.P. Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13.Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the catalytic cycle, substrate hydrolysis proceeds through the activation and orientation of a water molecule by hydrogen bonding to the active site histidine. Adjacent to this histidine there is a conserved aspartate residue, which, together with main-chain carbonyl-oxygen atoms from the Ca2+-binding loop, acts as ligands for Ca2+. The calcium ion assists by polarizing the scissile bond and by stabilizing the negative charge developing in the transition state during phospholipid hydrolysis (14.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a second water molecule, bridging the Ca2+-coordinated catalytic water to the active site histidine, has been inferred to be involved in catalysis, the water-assisted calcium-coordinate oxyanion mechanism of PLA2 (15.Rogers J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15468-15476Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of PLA2 catalysis is interfacial activation; i.e. the activity on monomeric substrates is low but hugely increases on aggregated substrates (19.Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of class I, II, and X PLA2s are very similar and are mainly folded into three long α-helices, a two-stranded β-sheet referred to as the β-wing, and a conserved calcium-binding loop (9.Brunie S. Bolin J. Gewirth D. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9742-9749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Dijkstra B.W. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Drenth J. J. Mol.

Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), although these proteins are more divergent. A structure of a prokaryotic sPLA2 (class XIV) showed a different, all α-helical fold (22.Matoba Y. Katsube Y. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20059-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas structures of PLA2s from the other sPLA2 families have not yet been determined. Only a few plant sPLA2s have been characterized (23.Ståhl U. Ek B. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24.Ståhl U. Lee M. Sjödahl S. Archer D.

Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In rice (Oryza sativa) a minimum of three isoforms of sPLA2 are present (24.Ståhl U. Lee M. Sjödahl S. Archer D. Cellini F. Ek B. Iannacone R. MacKenzie D. Semeraro L. Tramontano E. Stymme S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Isoform 2 (class XIb) contains 128 amino acids preceded by a 25-amino acid signal peptide and contains the conserved active site and calcium ion binding motifs of sPLA2s but otherwise shows low homology to other classes of sPLA2 (24.Ståhl U. Lee M. Sjödahl S. Archer D. Cellini F. Ek B. Iannacone R. MacKenzie D. Semeraro L. Tramontano E. Stymme S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of the mature isoform 2 PLA2 from rice (rPLA2) as well as that of a complex with octanoic acid. A synthetic cDNA coding for the predicted mature rPLA2 protein, amino acids 1–128 without the signal peptide, was designed with optimized codons for high level expression in Escherichia coli. The cDNA was generated by a sequence of five PCR reactions using ten synthesized single-stranded oligonucleotides, each about 60 nucleotides in length. These are listed as supplemental material in Table IS, and the cDNA sequence obtained for the mature rPLA2 is shown in supplemental Fig. S1a. The amplification started with the two most central oligonucleotides, 5′-5 and 3′-1, designed with 20 nucleotides overlap, being mixed and amplified with a 1 to 1 mixture of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases. For each PCR cycle the growing fragment was extended by ∼40 nucleotides in each direction. After each PCR reaction the obtained DNA fragment was separated on agarose gel, excised, and purified, before use as template in the next PCR amplification. In the second PCR oligonucleotides 5′-4 and 3′-2 were used, in the third PCR 5′-3 and 3′-3, in the fourth PCR 5′-2 and 3′-4, and finally in the fifth PCR oligonucleotides 5′-1 and 3′-5 were used. The final DNA fragment was then amplified using two different 5′ PCR primers together with a 3′ PCR primer (supplemental Table IS) to obtain two constructs with slightly different N-terminal amino acid sequences. The A construct has a start methionine and an alanine in front of Asn-2 of the rPLA2 sequence, and the B construct has a start methionine and a glycine in front of Leu-1, see supplemental Fig. S1b. The two cDNA constructs were gel-purified, blunt-end-polished with T4 DNA polymerase, phosphorylated, and then blunt-end-cloned into the EcoRV-digested and dephosphorylated pETBlue-1 vector. The sequences of the inserts and the cloning borders with the plasmid were verified by sequence analysis. The E. coli strain Tuner (DE3) LacI was used as host for the expression of the rPLA2 constructs. A preculture of 30 ml of Luria broth media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was inoculated from fresh single colonies and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.5. The preculture was used to inoculate 1 liter of the same media, which was grown until A600 reached 0.5–0.8 before isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was then grown for an additional 4 h after which the cells were harvested by 15-min centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C, frozen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Purification, solubilization, and refolding were done according to Valentin et al. (29.Valentin E. Singer A.G. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate) by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were broken by passing the cell slurry twice through a pre-cooled French press and an inclusion body pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The inclusion body pellet was washed by four cycles of resuspension in lysis buffer (two times with and two times without detergents), followed by sonication for 10 intervals of 15 s on ice with 15 s of cooling in between. After each cycle the inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The washed inclusion body pellet was either used directly or frozen at −80 °C. Cysteine residues of the rPLA2 were then sulfonated. The washed inclusion body pellet was dissolved to a concentration of ∼10 mg of wet pellet/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine chloride, 0.3 m Na2SO3 by stirring at room temperature. A 0.05 volume of Thannhauser reagent (30.Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was added, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for a further 1 h. The extract was then dialyzed overnight against 50 volumes of 1% acetic acid at 4 °C. Precipitated sulfonated protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein pellet was dissolved to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine chloride at room temperature by end-over-end rotation for 1 h. The protein solution was added dropwise at one drop per second to refolding buffer (0.9 m guanidine chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm freshly added l-cysteine, 30% acetonitrile) to a final concentration of ∼0.02 mg/ml with constant stirring at room temperature. The refolding solution was then stirred for a few minutes before it was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2–3 days. The refolding was monitored by measuring PLA2 activity. Lubrol PX 0.01% and 1 mm of methionine were added to the solution, which was then loaded into an Amicon-stirred cell with a YM-3 filter (Millipore) and concentrated ∼100-fold. The concentrate was dialyzed (cut-off of 10 kDa) overnight against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm methionine. A freshly packed 10-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column was run with buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm methionine and acetonitrile 20%) and buffer B (as buffer A plus 1 m NaCl) and eluted with a 30-ml gradient from 0 to 25% B. During elution 1-ml fractions were collected, and the fractions with peaking PLA2 activity were pooled. The pooled Q-Sepharose Fast Flow eluate was injected onto a C4 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (0.46 × 10.0 cm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA), previously equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed at 1.0 ml/min with a 30-min gradient (35–41% of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Absorbance was monitored at 214 and 280 nm, peak fractions were collected manually, and their pH was adjusted by adding 10 μl of Tris base per ml of eluate. The acetonitrile content was reduced by evaporation in a SpeedVac concentrator. The pooled fractions from several high-performance liquid chromatography runs were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C, divided into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Purity of the sample was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration was calculated from the absorbance measured at 280 nm of a small volume of sample diluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 6 m guanidine chloride, using the extinction coefficient 5120 m−1 cm−1. Prior to crystallization the protein was concentrated to 7–9 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and filtered through a 0.1-μm centrifugal filter. PLA2 assays were performed according to Ståhl et al. (23.Ståhl U. Ek B. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 nmol of 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]oleoylphosphocholine dissolved in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.06% (w/v) Lubrol PX) was incubated with enzyme fractions (0.5–10 μl) in a total volume of 50 μl at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped, and the lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (31.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The lipid-containing chloroform phases from PLA2 assays were applied to mini-columns of silica gel, and the chloroform eluates containing the 14C-labled free fatty acids were collected and their radioactivity was determined. The B construct of the rPLA2 was crystallized by the sitting drop, vapor-diffusion method. The well contained a mixture of two solutions, A and B, with best results obtained by using 750 μl of A and 250 μl of B. Solution A contained 16–18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m BisTris-propane, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m potassium thiocyanate. Solution B contained 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, and 2 m sodium chloride. The drop was comprised of 1.5 μl of well solution mixed with 1.5 μl of protein solution. After incubation for 24–48 h at 20 °C, crystallization was initiated by streak seeding, and incubation was continued at the same temperature. Crystals typically began to grow in seeded drops after 2–3 weeks and reached maximum size after ∼6 weeks. The A construct of the protein was crystallized in the same manner, with seeding performed using previously grown crystals of the B protein. In this case thin plate-like crystals grew after ∼8 weeks. Prior to data collection, both crystal forms were cryoprotected using either 20% glycerol or 25% ethylene glycol and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The octanoic acid derivative was prepared by adding 0.5 μl of octanoic acid directly to a crystallization drop after crystal growth. After 8-h soaking the crystals from the drop were harvested, cryoprotected with 20% glycerol in the presence of 5 mm octanoic acid, and frozen as before. All x-ray diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The structure of the rice PLA2 was solved by sulfur-SAD phasing using data collected to 2.2-Å resolution from a single hexagonal crystal on beamline BM14, which is equipped with a Mar225 charge-coupled device detector. 395 degrees of data were collected at a wavelength of 1.771 Å using a 1° oscillation angle, to give a single highly redundant dataset. Higher resolution native data were later collected to a resolution of 2.0 Å on the micro focus beamline ID23-2, using a second crystal. Native data from the orthorhombic crystal form were collected on beamline ID29 to a resolution of 2.3 Å. In each case the data were processed using the HKL2000 suite (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Where necessary, the scaled intensities were converted to CCP4 format using Scalepack2MTZ from the CCP4 suite (33.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), and structure factors were calculated using TRUNCATE. Data from the octanoic acid soaked crystals were collected on beamline ID14-1 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed using Mosflm (34.Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992Google Scholar) and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (33.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar).

Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79485) Google Scholar). The protein contains 12 cysteines and 2 methionines, and there are two subunits in the asymmetric unit, thus it was not trivial to locate the sulfur positions. We performed numerous trials in SHELX with different resolution intervals and varying number of sulfurs and super-sulfurs to search for and different resolutions for refinement of the sites. Finally, searching for 18 sites using the data to 3.8 Å, we obtained a solution that showed a substantial difference between the two possible enantiomorphs in contrast (0.57 versus 0.48) and connectivity (0.91 versus 0.88) as well as map correlation upon refinement to 2.8 Å. However, the non-crystallographic symmetry relation between the sites could not readily be determined, and averaging could thus not be used for improving the un-interpretable electron density map obtained. The sites were then refined in PHASER_EP (36.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13901) Google Scholar), and the phases obtained were modified with PIRATE (37.Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All versions of ARP/wARP (38.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar), including quick fold, were run at different resolutions, but no sensible structure fragments were obtained. However, while looking at an electron density map at 3.2 Å we observed some electron density that vaguely resembled a stretch of α-helix, which we built with COOT (39.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). Fortunately, in the vicinity there were three sulfur sites that could correspond to a Cys-Cys-Met sequence in the protein and that allowed us to put in some sequence and define the direction of the helix. After this began an iterative process, using the CCP4 program suite (33.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), consisting of model building in COOT, refinement with REFMAC5 (40.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar), phase-combination of the partial model and refined sulfur sites using PHASER_EP, and then phase improvement with PIRATE and, once the non-crystallographic symmetry operator became known, DM (41.Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) with NCS. Tight NCS restraints were applied during refinement. After a few rounds, the electron density maps became of excellent quality allowing unambiguous chain tracing and sequence fitting. Final refinement with inclusion of water molecules was performed using the high resolution data set to 2.0 Å with medium main-chain and loose side-chain NCS restraints. A final check of the model building was performed by calculating a composite omit map in CNS (42.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The structure of the second crystal form was determined by molecular replacement in MOLREP (43.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar), using the monomer of the refined P62 structure as the search model. The initial search placed two monomers in the asymmetric unit, but manual inspection of the resulting maps showed that a third monomer was present, albeit with weaker density. A second MOLREP search, performed after fixing the positions of both previously identified monomers, was successful in placing the final copy of the protein. The structure was refined with alternating cycles of restrained refinement in REFMAC5 (40.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) and manual inspection and model building in COOT. Initial refinement included the use of medium NCS restraints on all monomers, but this was later relaxed for chain C, in which crystal-packing effects result in slight differences for the other two chains. In the final stages of refinement, atomic displacement parameters were refined in REFMAC by the TLS (translation, libration, and screw) method (44.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) with each of the three monomers in the asymmetric unit treated as a single TLS group. The structure of the octanoic acid complex was solved by molecular replacement, using the monomer of the refined P62 structure as the search model. Restrained refinement with NCS was performed in REFMAC5 and model building in COOT. The geometry of each model was checked using the validation functions of COOT in addition to a final analysis in PROCHECK (45.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the fit between the data and model was assessed in SFCHECK (46.Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The results from refinement are detailed in Table 2. Structure alignments were carried out using the SSM superposition function in COOT, and LSQ in the program O (47.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Endogenous PKCδ and Spry2 interact in cells upon basic fibroblast growth factor stimulation, indicating a physiological relevance for the interaction. This interaction appeared to require the full-length Spry2 protein and was conformation-dependent. Conformational constraints were released upon FGFR1 activation, allowing the interaction to occur. Although this interaction did not affect the phosphorylation of PKCδ by another kinase, it reduced the phosphorylation of a PKCδ substrate, protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Spry2 was found to interact more strongly with PKCδ with increasing amounts of PKD1, which indicated that instead of competing with PKD1 for binding with PKCδ, it was more likely to form a trimeric complex with both PKCδ and PKD1. Formation of the complex was found to be dependent on an existing PKCδ-PKD1 interaction. By disrupting the interaction between PKCδ and PKD1, Spry2 was unable to associate with PKCδ to form the trimeric complex. As a consequence of this trimeric complex, the existing interaction between PKCδ and PKD1 was increased, and the transfer of phosphate groups from PKCδ to PKD1 was at least partly blocked by Spry2. The action of Spry2 on PKCδ resulted in the inhibition of both ERK phosphorylation and invasion of PC-3 cells via PKCδ signaling. By disrupting the capacity of PKCδ to phosphorylate its cognate substrates, Spry2 may serve to modulate PKCδ signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and to regulate the physiological outcome.

Further work identified four murine homologues (Spry1–4), of which Sprouty2 (Spry2) bears the highest homology to Drosophila Spry (2.de Maximy A.A. Nakatake Y. Moncada S. Itoh N. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although lacking any previously known domains, all four homologues retain a conserved cysteine-rich region (2.de Maximy A.A. Nakatake Y. Moncada S. Itoh N. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and like dSpry, murine Spry2 also negatively modulates lung branching morphogenesis (3.Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that Spry expression was induced by the Ras/ERK signaling pathway and acts as a negative feedback inhibitor of that same pathway (4.Casci T. Vinós J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Various studies have alluded to points of action of Spry2 on the Ras/ERK pathway, including upstream of Ras, by disrupting the Grb2-Sos interaction (5.Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W.

Therefore, it appears that there may be multiple points at which Spry2 inhibits Ras/ERK signaling. receptor tyrosine kinase protein kinase C fibroblast growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase immunoprecipitation glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin small hairpin RNA protein kinase D1 whole cell lysates. receptor tyrosine kinase protein kinase C fibroblast growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase immunoprecipitation glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin small hairpin RNA protein kinase D1 whole cell lysates. The Ras/ERK pathway is a convergence point of the many signaling pathways that originate from activated RTKs (8.McKay M.M. Morrison D.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition to the key proteins involved in propagating the signal, this central pathway is further regulated by a number of positive and negative modulators that affect the pathway at all levels (9.Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). At least three of the core components, RTKs together with Ras and Raf, have been shown to have many mutations in cancers (10.Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). This knowledge has stimulated interest in understanding and identifying the positive and negative regulators of the pathway and how they function. Spry2, which is transcriptionally controlled by and inhibits this central pathway, is therefore well placed to act as a key regulator. Unraveling the mechanism by which Spry2 inhibits the Ras/ERK pathway may be assisted by studying its interaction partners. To date, a number of interacting partners of Spry have been identified, including c-Cbl, Grb2, Tesk1, Raf1, PP2A, and DYRK1A (11.Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); several of these interactions contribute to the function of Spry2 as an inhibitor of the Ras/ERK pathway. In addition to binding to other proteins, studies have shown that Spry2 can affect the signaling effect of certain proteins, such as protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Physiologically, Spry2 has been shown to block PKCδ signaling in Xenopus cells (16.Sivak J.M. Petersen L.F. Amaya E. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this context, Spry2 was reported to block morphogenesis and cell polarity, although the exact mechanism was not described. PKCδ is a member of the PKC family of isozymes, which are classified into conventional, novel, and atypical subfamilies. Current models of PKC activation are based on the conventional PKC proteins, which are activated by diacylglycerol and calcium. A series of “priming” phosphorylations on conserved residues must also occur before the kinases can be fully active (17.Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 18.Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKCδ, as a novel member of the family, only requires diacylglycerol to be activated, but similar phosphorylations on PKCδ also take place (19.Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Like most members of the family, PKCδ consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain, which contains a pseudosubstrate domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain, which includes the activation loop, the auto-phosphorylation site, and the ATP-binding site (19.Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Various signals, including but not restricted to G-protein-coupled receptors, RTKs, and oxidative stress, can activate PKCδ (20.Qiu J. Bosch M.A. Tobias S.C. Grandy D.K. Scanlan T.S. Ronnekleiv O.K.

Among the different RTK activation mechanisms, PKCδ has been reported to be activated by FGF, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (16.Sivak J.M. Petersen L.F.

J. 2001; 353: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent reports have indicated that the activation of ERK1/2 via PKCδ signaling takes place through protein kinase D1 (PKD1), formerly known as PKCμ (25.Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26.Hausser A. Storz P. Hübner S.

J. 2002; 366: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This represents a relatively poorly studied pathway through which ERK1/2 is activated, especially with respect to the control mechanisms that regulate it. Current evidence places PKCδ as an important regulator of various physiological functions and disease states, including development (28.Kinoshita N. Iioka H. Miyakoshi A. Ueno N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1663-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), cardiac development (29.Schreiber K.L. Paquet L. Allen B.G. Rindt H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Because different factors can stimulate the PKCδ pathway, it is important that regulatory mechanisms are in place to control the gain, amplitude, and length of the signal initiated by PKCδ. The factors upstream of PKCδ that influence its activity have been relatively well documented (19.Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 34.Robles-Flores M. Rendon-Huerta E. Gonzalez-Aguilar H. Mendoza-Hernandez G. Islas S. Mendoza V. Ponce-Castaneda M.V.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mechanisms that specifically regulate the duration of PKCδ signaling remain inconclusive. Recent reports have indicated that signaling by PKCs can be controlled by ubiquitination following interaction with RINCK (RING finger protein that interacts with C kinase), a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3 ubiquitin ligase) (36.Chen D. Gould C. Garza R. Gao T. Hampton R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33776-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (37.Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Despite the involvement of PKCδ in the ERK pathway, it is currently unclear at which point in the pathway it acts, although there are suggestions that it is at the level of Raf (38.Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Notably, this is also one point where Spry2 has been suggested to interfere with ERK1/2 signaling (7.Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3195-3201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although Spry2 was shown to inhibit PKCδ signaling in Xenopus, this was not reported to be linked to ERK. Furthermore, Spry2 was also observed to associate with a number of other interacting partners, which serve to regulate the Ras/ERK pathway. Given these separate observations, we sought to investigate whether Sprouty2 played a role in regulating PKCδ signaling feeding into the ERK pathway, and whether this effect was exerted through an interaction with PKCδ. In this study, we present evidence that PKCδ is an interacting partner of Spry2 and that this interaction serves to block the phosphorylation of the PKCδ substrate. Furthermore, we also show that Spry2, by interacting with PKCδ, is able to block another mode of activating the Ras/ERK pathway, and consequently exerts a negative impact on the pathway in a hitherto unidentified manner. Mouse PKCδ was a kind gift from Peter J. Parker (London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London) and was subsequently subcloned into pXJ40-myc and pXJ40-HA mammalian expression vectors. The kinase-dead K376R mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Human PKD1 was purchased from Addgene (deposited by Alex Toker, plasmid 10808) and subsequently subcloned into pXJ40-HA vector. FGFR1, FLAG-tagged Spry1, Spry2, and Spry4 have been described previously (5.Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.Y. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1000 mg/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. All transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described previously (7.Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and harvested in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.2% NaF, 1% sodium deoxycholate), which were then used for immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting, as described previously (7.Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3195-3201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Quantification of immunoblots was performed with the GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad). All Western blot data shown are representatives of at least three separate individual experiments, unless otherwise stated. PC-3 cells were serum-starved for 3 h and subsequently stimulated for 2 h with bFGF (50 ng/ml). Cells were harvested using RIPA buffer, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using rabbit PKCδ antibody, and subsequent immunoblotting was carried out using the immunoprecipitates. Reverse endogenous immunoprecipitation was carried out by using rabbit Spry2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subsequently used for immunoblotting. Mammalian proteins were immunoprecipitated and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (5.Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.Y. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y.

Briefly, membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk overnight and subsequently overlaid with GST-tagged Spry2 protein produced in Escherichia coli DH5α. Immunoblotting was then carried out using GST antibodies as described above. COS1 cells were treated for immunofluorescence microscopy essentially as described previously (13.Chandramouli S. Yu C.Y.

Permeabilized cells were blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% fetal bovine serum, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. Images were visualized and captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Germany). Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against human PKCδ were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD) (catalogue number TR320468; sequence AGGCAATGTAACGCTGCCATCCACAAGAA) and from Sigma (catalog number NM_006254; clone no. TRCN0000010202; shRNA sequence CCGGGCAAGACAACAGTGGGACCTACTCGAGTAGGTCCCACTGTTGTCTTGCTTTTT). The plasmids containing the shRNA constructs were transfected into cells with about 30% confluency, using the transfection methods described above. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. The cell invasion assay was carried out on PC-3 cells using the QCM 24-well cell invasion assay system from Chemicon (Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, PC-3 cells were serum-starved 24 h post-transfection before being harvested and seeded in Boyden chambers for the assay. PC-3 cells were allowed to invade for another 24 h before the number of cells that had invaded was quantified using the Spectra Max Gemini EM fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). It has been reported previously that Spry2 has a negative regulatory effect on PKCδ signaling in Xenopus (16.Sivak J.M. Petersen L.F. Amaya E. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that PKCδ can target various substrates that feed into the Ras/ERK pathway, particularly centered on the complex phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events required to activate/inhibit the Raf isoforms. To study this effect in a mammalian context, we first sought evidence of an interaction between Sprouty isoforms and PKCδ. The different Sprouty isoforms, Spry1, -2, and -4, as well as the Y55F mutant of Spry2 were all tested for their interaction with endogenous PKCδ using immunoprecipitation. Of the isoforms tested, only Spry2 was present in a complex with PKCδ upon FGFR1 stimulation (Fig. 1A). Neither Spry1 nor Spry4 had any discernible interaction with PKCδ. The Tyr55 residue of Spry2 is seen as important, because mutation of this residue abrogates binding. We have previously demonstrated that FGFR1 stimulation results in the phosphorylation of the Tyr55 residue, followed by a conformational change in Spry2 (5.Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.Y. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and it is likely to be a similar scenario here. The interaction between Spry2 and PKCδ occurred with forced expression of FGFR1, which is deemed auto-activating. Although we believe this mimics the longer term signaling seen in development and cancer progression, we also wanted to verify that this interaction occurred with acute FGF stimulation. Because PC-3 cells have been reported to express high FGFR1 levels (39.Nakamoto T. Chang C.S. Li A.K. Chodak G.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 571-577PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to use this cell line for the next three experiments. Similar to our findings with FGFR1 activation, bFGF stimulation also induced binding between Spry2 and PKCδ (Fig. 1B). We next wanted to determine whether PKCδ interacts with Spry2 endogenously. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from PC-3 cell lysates and assayed for the presence of Spry2 in the immunoprecipitates. Spry2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKCδ upon FGF stimulation, indicating that these two proteins form a complex endogenously (Fig. 1C), and reflects a physiological relevance for the interaction between PKCδ and Spry2. To further verify the endogenous interaction, the reverse immunoprecipitation was performed, where Spry2 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for the presence of PKCδ. Similar to the previous experiment, endogenous PKCδ co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Spry2 (Fig. 1D). Direct binding between the two proteins also occurs, which is demonstrated later in the study. Our next aim was to determine the region of interaction between PKCδ and Spry2. To this end, N- and C-terminal truncated constructs of Spry2 and PKCδ were made (Fig. 2A). The hSpry2N1–179 and C179–315 constructs essentially divide Spry2 into its less conserved N terminus and its conserved Cys-rich C terminus. Two other sets of Spry2 N- and C-terminal truncations were made. PKCδ truncations were made to separate the N-terminal regulatory domain and C-terminal catalytic domain. These constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments, and assayed for the presence of the interaction partner. Besides several short motifs, the N-terminal domain of the different Spry isoforms is not conserved. However, there is a high degree of conservation in the Cys-rich C-terminal domain between the Sprouty isoforms. Because PKCδ interacted only with Spry2, it was postulated that PKCδ would interact with the more nonconserved N-terminal region of Spry2. However, we observed that PKCδ only interacted with the full-length Spry2 protein upon FGFR1 activation (Fig. 2B). To rule out the possibility that the binding site for PKCδ was cleaved upon truncation of the Spry2 protein, two other sets of truncation constructs with the truncation site moved progressively toward the N terminus were employed. Again, only the full-length Spry2 protein was able to interact with the full-length endogenous PKCδ protein (supplemental Fig. 1). Because the full-length Spry2 protein is required for its interaction with PKCδ, it was hypothesized that the interaction occurred on at least two sites of Sprouty2. To determine which region of PKCδ interacted with Spry2, the N-terminal regulatory domain and C-terminal catalytic domain of PKCδ were tested for interaction with full-length Spry2. As before, the two full-length proteins interacted with FGFR1 activation (Fig. 2C). Unexpectedly, we observed that both the N- and C-terminal domains of PKCδ interacted with Spry2 in the absence of FGFR1 activation (Fig. 2C), which was strengthened in the presence of FGFR1 activation. These results were then validated by co-expressing the N- and C-terminal domains of Spry2 with the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCδ (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Together, our findings support the assumption that there is more than one point of interaction between the two proteins, and imply that conformational constraints regulate the interaction of these two proteins. These constraints were released by truncating PKCδ, allowing the interaction to occur even in the absence of stimulation. Upon FGFR1 activation, the interaction strengthens, suggesting that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also required for maximal interaction. To validate the biochemical data, we examined the localization of Spry2 and PKCδ in COS1 cells under both control and stimulated conditions. In the absence of FGF stimulation, the proteins show distinct distribution patterns (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 4) with Spry2 localized on the microtubules (40.Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and PKCδ in the cytoplasm. Upon FGF stimulation, the proteins both localize at the cell membrane, suggesting that the two proteins co-localize upon FGF stimulation and supporting the possibility of a physical interaction. Like many other kinases, PKCδ requires post-translational modifications upon stimulation for it to be catalytically active. PKCδ has been reported to be phosphorylated within the activation loop on Thr505 by an upstream kinase. This phosphorylation is essential for the full PKCδ activity (41.Rybin V.O. Guo J. Gertsberg Z.

https://openalex.org/W2042170304,"Cytoplasmic localization of the prion protein (PrP) has been observed in different species and cell types. We have investigated this poorly understood phenomenon by expressing fusion proteins of sheep prion protein and green fluorescent protein (GFPPrP) in N2a cells, with variable sequence context surrounding the start codon Met1. GFPPrP expressed with the wild-type sequence was transported normally through the secretory pathway to the cell surface with acquisition of N-glycan groups, but two N-terminal fragments of GFPPrP were detected intracellularly, starting in frame from Met17. When GFPPrP was expressed with a compromised Kozak sequence (GFPPrP*), dispersed intracellular fluorescence was observed. A similar switch from pericellular to intracellular PrP localization was seen when analogous constructs of sheep PrP, without inserted GFP, were expressed, showing that this phenomenon is not caused by the GFP tag. Western blotting revealed a reduction in glycosylated forms of GFPPrP*, whereas the N-terminal fragments starting from Met17 were still present. Formation of these N-terminal fragments was completely abolished when Met17 was replaced by Thr, indicating that leaky ribosomal scanning occurs for normal sheep PrP and that translation from Met17 is the cause of the aberrant cytoplasmic localization observed for a fraction of the protein. In contrast, the same phenomenon was not detected upon expression of similar constructs for mouse PrP. Analysis of samples from sheep brain allowed immunological detection of N-terminal PrP fragments, indicating that sheep PrP is subject to similar processing mechanisms in vivo.

Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 2.Weissmann C. Fischer M. Raeber A. Büeler H. Sailer A. Shmerling D. Rülicke T. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1996; 77: 283-293PubMed Google Scholar). According to the prion hypothesis, a misfolded, pathogenic form of the protein (PrPSc) is the sole constituent of transmissible prions (3.Aguzzi A. Baumann F. Bremer J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 439-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 4.Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar), but the molecular details and required environs for the misfolding are incompletely understood. As would be expected for a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein with N-linked glycans, PrPC is observed at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, the end point of the secretory route. The half-time at the plasma membrane is fairly short, because the protein may undergo shedding or endocytic internalization (5.Morris R.J. Parkyn C.J. Jen A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5565-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6.Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol.

Thus, PrPC can be encountered throughout the secretory and endocytic routes and is also able to leave cells via exosomes derived from multivesicular endosomes (10.Fevrier B. Vilette D. Archer F. Loew D. Faigle W. Vidal M. Laude H. Raposo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, studies of the subcellular distribution of PrPC in mammalian brain have identified localization to the outer cell membrane, in the Golgi apparatus, and in endosomal vesicles (11.Lainé J. Marc M.E. Sy M.S. Axelrad H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 47-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Salès N. Rodolfo K. Hässig R. Faucheux B. Di Giamberardino L. Moya K.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2464-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, others have found that PrPC is not solely associated with membranes, but, in some subpopulations of neurons, is localized to the cytoplasm (13.Bailly Y. Haeberlé A.M. Blanquet-Grossard F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Grant N. Schulze T. Bombarde G. Grassi J. Cesbron J.Y. Lemaire-Vieille C. J. Comp Neurol. 2004; 473: 244-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14.Mironov Jr., A.

In line with the latter observations, transgenic mice expressing PrP carrying a C-terminal GFP tag demonstrated intense cytoplasmic fluorescence from a limited number (approximately 1%) of the neurons in certain brain areas, such as the hippocampus (15.Barmada S. Piccardo P. Yamaguchi K. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical detection of intracellular, possibly cytoplasmic, PrP has also been reported from large mononuclear cells in the gut wall of sheep (16.Heggebø R. Press C.M. Gunnes G. Lie K.I. Tranulis M.A. Ulvund M. Groschup M.H. Landsverk T. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2327-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and from enteric neurons in mice (17.González L. Terry L. Jeffrey M. J. Comp. Pathol. 2005; 132: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The recent observations of pronounced cytoplasmic aggregation of PrP in pancreatic β-cells of rats prone to development of diabetes mellitus provide a perplexing example of nonstandard PrP localization in non-neuronal cells (18.Strom A.

The flexibility observed in the subcellular localization of PrPC has been suggested to be a requirement for normal functions of the protein (14.Mironov Jr., A. Latawiec D. Wille H.

Cytoplasmic PrP could be a result of retro-translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as part of an unfolded protein response (21.Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 22.Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23.Yedidia Y. Horonchik L.

However, no signs of stress or pathology could be detected in neurons of wild-type mice expressing cytoplasmic PrP (14.Mironov Jr., A. Latawiec D. Wille H. Bouzamondo-Bernstein E. Legname G. Williamson R.A. Burton D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Peters P.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7183-7193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which led to the suggestion that the cytoplasmic appearance of PrP could constitute a physiologically relevant, but minor, pathway for the protein. Forced cytoplasmic expression of PrP in transgenic mice (22.Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (27.Park K.W. Li L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) resulted in neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that toxic mislocalization of PrP could be part of the pathogenic mechanism in prion diseases (28.Hegde R.S. Rane N.S. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 337-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, transgenic mice expressing cytoplasmic PrP, on a PrP-null background, developed cerebellar atrophy but were resistant to experimental prion infection (29.Norstrom E.M. Ciaccio M.F. Rassbach B. Wollmann R. Mastrianni J.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that cytoplasmic PrP is unlikely to serve as substrate for prion replication. Furthermore, data obtained from transgenic mice expressing an anchorless secretory PrP show that, although these mice accumulate PrP-containing amyloid plaques upon challenge with PrPSc, they fail to develop clinical prion disease (30.Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Thus, membrane-attached PrP appears to be a prerequisite for development of prion-derived neurodegeneration. In eukaryotes, ribosomes bind specifically to linear mRNAs carrying a 7-methylguanosine 5′-end cap and slide along the mRNA in the 5′ → 3′ direction until they encounter the first start codon (AUG), from which the protein translation starts exclusively. Therefore, eukaryotic mRNAs are generally monocistronic. However, deviations from this standard principle have been reported, in which protein translation is initiated at alternative start codons either up or downstream from the primary AUG. The best characterized mechanism is known as context-dependent leaky ribosomal scanning (LRS) (31.Kozak M. Gene. 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). This cap-dependent mechanism is particularly operative when the optimal (5′-GCCRCCaugG-3′) sequence context surrounding the first AUG codon is compromised, most notably at positions R−3 (where R= purine, A or G, but optimally G) and G+4 (32.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 47: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 33.Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In this work, we report that in a cell culture system, sheep PrP mRNA displays a tendency to allow alternative translation initiation through LRS. Met17 serves as an internal in-frame alternative start codon giving rise to PrP with a severely shortened ER-targeting peptide. Although the LRS mechanism is active in sheep PrP, it appears to occur much less in mouse PrP (34.Levine C.G. Mitra D. Sharma A. Smith C.L. Hegde R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The molecular explanation and possible pathophysiological relevance of these observations in relation to PrP function await further studies. Interestingly, during the review process of this paper, observations of cytoplasmic PrP similar to some of those described herein were reported for human and hamster PrP (35.Juanes M.E. Elvira G. García-Grande A. Calero M. Gasset M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2787-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmids coding for PrP* and GFPPrP* has been described previously (36.Tveit H. Lund C. Olsen C.M. Ersdal C. Prydz K. Harbitz I. Tranulis M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The PrP and the GFPPrP, which contain the naturally occurring sheep Kozak sequence (5′-GTC ATC preceding the start codon ATG, otherwise similar to PrP and GFPPrP*), were generated using the PrP* and the GFPPrP* constructs as templates, standard cloning techniques, and the following primers: forward, 5′-TAGCCTCGAGGTCATCATGGTGAAAAGCCACATAGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGACTCTAGAGTACTATCCTACTATGAGAAAAATGAGG-3. The GFPPrPM1R and GFPPrPV2A constructs were made using the same 3′-primer, but the forward primers were: 5′-TAGCCTCGAGGTCATCAGATCTAAAAGCCACATAGG-3′ and 5′-TAGCCTCGAGGTCATCATGGCGAAAAGCCACATAGG-3′, respectively. Insertion of the PCR product into the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA 3.0 vector (Invitrogen), was done using standard cloning techniques and the restriction enzymes XhoI and XbaI. The GFPPrPM17T was made by site-directed mutagenesis with the GFPPrP as template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GGTTCTCTTTGTGGCCACTTGGAGTGACGTGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCACGTCACTCCAAGTGGCCACAAAGAGAACC-3′. GFPPrPΔ2–24 was made by the forward (5′-CTGGAATTCAGTATGAAGAAGCGACCAAAACCTGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-ATTAGCTCGAGTACTATCCTACTATGAGAAAAAT-3′) primers and ligated into the pEGFP-C1 with the restriction enzymes NheI and XhoI. The mouse GFPPrP construct, GFPmoPrP, was kindly provided by Dr. Otto Windl (Veterinary Laboratory Agency, Weybridge, UK), and its cloning has previously been described (37.Lorenz H. Windl O. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8508-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). GFPmoPrP* was generated from the GFPmoPrP with the following primers: forward, 5′-ATATCTCGAGTTCTATGGCGAACCTTGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-TTAATCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCG-3′. The restriction enzymes XhoI and XbaI were used to insert the amplified products into multiple cloning sites in the pcDNA 3.0 vector. All of the mutations were verified by sequencing. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a was kindly provided by Dr. Jörg Tatzelt, (Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany). N2a cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) complemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone, Siziano, Italy), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, and pyruvate (Cambrex, Charles City, IA). Transfection of N2a cells was performed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transiently transfected cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with proteinase inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h on ice. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (LC) at 2.5 μm concentration was performed in Opti-MEM for 18 h. The antibodies used were P4 (Food Diagnostics, Oslo, Norway) and anti-GFP 6556 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The polyclonal anti signal-peptide antibody (anti-SP) that binds to the ER-targeting signal of PrP (38.Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. David A. Harris (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The polyclonal antibody R505, which binds to 102WNKPS106 in the sheep PrP (39.Thuring C.M. van Keulen L.J. Langeveld J.P. Vromans M.E. van Zijderveld F.G. Sweeney T. J. Comp.

In Western blots, primary antibodies were used at 0.05–0.2 μg/ml concentrations. Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad and Invitrogen) or alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) were used at 0.05–0.3 μg/ml concentrations. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm to remove aggregates and nuclear components. For enzymatic deglycosylation, samples were treated with N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C, with buffers recommended by the manufacturer. The protein concentration in cell lysates was measured with a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) to ensure similar loading between lanes. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and separated by electrophoresis on precast 12% Bis-Tris polacrylamide gels, with XT-MOPS as running buffer (Bio-Rad). The proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences) by a semi-dry blotter (Trans Blot Semi-Dry; Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked by incubation with 5% (w/v) fat-free dried milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Incubations with antibodies were performed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) fat-free dried milk overnight at 4 °C for primary antibodies and for 1 h at room temperature for secondary antibodies. The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) and captured by ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) or by fluorescence scanning with a variable mode imager (Typhoon 9200, Amersham Biosciences) when secondary antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase were used. Post-nuclear supernatants from transiently transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody P4, covalently linked to Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy (Invitrogen). The beads were diluted in 2 ml of dimethyl formamide to a final concentration of 2 × 109 beads/ml. The paramagnetic beads were covalently coated with P4 as follows: the beads were washed and resuspended in 55 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, complemented with 15 μg of P4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After thorough mixing by vortexing, 35 μl of 3 m ammonium sulfate was added. After incubation for 48 h at room temperature with gentle mixing, the beads were washed four times in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. A subsample of 1 ml of cell lysate was added to a pellet of coated beads, corresponding to 27 μl of bead suspension, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before washing three times in PBS. The resulting bead pellet was boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The beads were removed by use of a magnet, and the supernatants electrophoresed as previously described. Coomassie-stained bands of interest were excised by scalpel for in-gel digestion in 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, with either 0.1 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or 0.2 μg of chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). The enzymatic digests were purified using ZipTip μ-C18 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the eluates were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant, Holbrook, NY). The peptides were dissolved in 0.5 μl of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:1) and mixed with 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:1). The samples were applied to a stainless steel sample holder and, after drying, introduced into the ULTRAFLEX II (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and analyzed in the MS mode (for generation of peptide mass fingerprints) as well as in the TOF/TOF mode (for fragmentation analysis). MS spectra were transformed into peak lists using the software FlexAnalysis version 2.4. (Daltonics). The software program PeptideMass was applied to predict tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. Matching peptide masses within the peptide mass fingerprints were selected for MALDI-MS/MS analysis. Fragment b and y ions were calculated using the software program Fragment Ion Calculator. Post-nuclear supernatants of transiently transfected N2a cells were rolled with 2 μg of monoclonal antibodies P4 or Saf-32 overnight at 6 °C. A protein G-agarose (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) slurry (50/50) was prepared in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and 1% bovine serum albumin as described by the manufacturer and incubated on a roller overnight at 6 °C. Aliquots of 20 μl of protein G slurry were added to the samples and mixed on a roller for 3 h at 6 °C. Thoroughly washed agarose pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min at room temperature. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western immune blots were developed with mouse TrueBlot ULTRA and horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse IgG (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) after incubation with monoclonal primary antibodies, whereas the polyclonals anti-SP and R505 were developed with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). Cells transiently transfected with untagged PrP were grown on glass coverslips (Assistent) in a 24-well plate (Sarstedt). After 24 h, the cells were fixed in PBS supplemented with Ca2+ (0.02 mm) and Mg2+ (0.2 mm) (PBS+) and 3.7% formaldehyde before permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocking in 5% fat-free dried milk in PBS, and incubation for 1 h with primary antibody P4 in PBS with 1% fat-free dried milk. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with Alexa 488 fluorochrome (Molecular Probes) before confocal microscopy. Cells transiently transfected with various GFPPrP constructs were grown on glass slides (LabTek II Chambered coverglass; Nunc) and analyzed after 24 h by the fluorescence protease protection assay (41.Lorenz H. Hailey D.W. Wunder C. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with KHM buffer (110 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C and treated with either digitonin (40 μm) to permeabilize the plasma membrane, trypsin (4 mm), or both in the presence or absence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nonsaturated images were captured by a Plan-Apochromat 63/1.4 oil objective in a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescent inverted microscope, equipped with a LSM 510 laser confocal unit, a 488-nm argon laser, and a 546-nm helium/neon laser; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Purification of synaptosomal/microsomal membrane fractions from sheep brain was performed as described by Pergami et al. (42.Pergami P. Jaffe H. Safar J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, immediately after euthanasia, the brain was removed, and 40 g was homogenized in a Dounce all-glass homogenizer in 200 ml of ice-cold bicarbonate buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 0.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3, and protease inhibitor tablets (Complete; Hoffman-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland). After initial low speed centrifugations and rehomogenization, the supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g on a 0.85 m sucrose cushion at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting pellet was highly enriched in PrP and used for Western blot analysis. We have generated a large number of sheep GFPPrP gene constructs in which GFP is positioned between amino acids 43 and 44 in the N-terminal region of PrP (Fig. 1). Our initial observations indicated remarkable differences in intracellular trafficking of both untagged PrP and GFPPrP fusion variants. These enticed us to conduct a more systematic study, particularly of the region surrounding the start codon triplet (AUG), including the Kozak sequence. Constructs (PrP* and GFPPrP*) with compromised Kozak sequence were expressed in N2a cells, giving diffuse intracellular staining, indicating cytoplasmic localization of these PrP variants (Figs. 2A and 3A). For comparison, wild-type PrP and GFPPrP (intact Kozak sequence) displayed a typical cell surface localization, with some of the protein localized to intracellular vesicular compartments. Western blot analysis revealed that mono- and di-glycosylated forms of PrP prevailed when PrP with intact Kozak sequence was expressed, whereas for PrP*, unglycosylated and mono-glycosylated forms dominated. An N-terminal fragment of ∼8 kDa was faintly visible in untreated cells and more clearly visible after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor LC (Fig. 2B). Next, we expressed a construct lacking the region coding the ER-targeting signal peptide (GFPPrPΔ2–24) to compare the subcellular localization of the corresponding protein with that of GFPPrP*. The two proteins displayed similar distribution patterns in N2a cells (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 2Sheep PrP expressed in mouse neuroblastoma cells. Untagged sheep PrP and PrP* (corresponding to GFPPrP and GFPPrP* but lacking the inserted GFP) were transiently transfected into mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor LC was performed for 18 h. A, immunofluorescence using P4 and Alexa 488-conjugated antibody, the images were captured by a laser confocal microscope at 63× magnification. B, sheep PrP and PrP* were transiently expressed in N2a cells, and then PrP and PrP* from both untreated and LC (2.5 μm) treated cells were immunoprecipitated by the P4 antibody, followed by Western blot analysis using the same antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Sheep GFPPrP constructs expressed in mouse neuroblastoma cells.

However, few academic scientists seem to be noticing proposals posted for public comment on the Federal Register that concern the application of science to society. With science and technology high on the agenda of the new US administration, scientists should welcome the opportunity to influence policy. However, few academic scientists seem to be noticing proposals posted for public comment on the Federal Register that concern the application of science to society. President Obama has pledged to pay attention to scientists, but do they know how to be heard? One simple way for scientists to contribute beyond university walls is to comment on proposed rules and guidelines within their area of expertise—be it the application of genomics to genetic tests or recombinant technology to genetically modified organisms (see Table 1; Box 1). Once federal agencies have listened to public opinion, they finalize rules and use them to clarify laws. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is currently requesting comments, before May 26, on draft guidelines that specify which embryonic stem cell lines will be eligible for federal funds. Once finalized, these guidelines will be used to evaluate research proposals to ensure that “NIH-funded research in this area is ethically responsible, scientifically worthy, and conducted in accordance with applicable law.”Table 1Federal Register Documents for Public CommentDocument IDDatedAgencyExplanationComments due bySelected Documents Open for Comment as of April 30, 2009FR Doc.

Comment: A written expression of an opinion or attitude by a member of the public to a government agency about a rulemaking or other action. Source: Regulations.gov The process of posting a comment is straightforward. During the comment period—which typically lasts 30, 60, or 90 days—the public can go online (http://www.regulations.gov), access rules and guidelines as they are being drafted, and submit a comment before the rules are finalized. Once the period ends, a public meeting on the topic is often held. Federal agency officials then consider each written and oral comment and respond; their response is publicly available as well. Public participation in the process that makes, applies, and amends US federal rules has been officially encouraged since 1946. In 2003, it went online. And by the end of this year, its accessibility will be enhanced due to President Obama's mandate to make the rulemaking process more transparent and democratic. Yet despite federal encouragement and the ease of posting a comment, scientists do not seem to be participating unless the proposals directly impact their research. “People whose research is affected probably look more carefully” at the Federal Register, says Harvard geneticist Daniel Hartl. “But people who are more peripherally associated tend to think that someone else should deal with it.” However, the result of translating scientific advances into products used by the general public—be it genetically engineered organisms, genetic tests, stem cell therapy, or gene therapy—will affect all researchers in the long run. When concerns arise about the safety of a particular method or product, society tends to question science in general. “The public must be able to trust the science and the scientific process informing public policy decisions,” wrote President Obama in a memorandum on scientific integrity, published on March 9. In response to his memo, the Office of Science and Technology Policy posted a notice on the Federal Register asking for recommendations from the public before May 13 on how to ensure that the scientific information that agencies rely on is reliable. Will scientists comment on the restrictions listed in the NIH's draft guidelines for federal funding of stem cell research? “I will comment however I can,” says Irving Weissman, the director of the Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine Institute at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. “When you read the guidelines, the NIH says it will not use stem cells derived by [somatic cell] nuclear transfer,” he says. “I hope they use this time of comments to rethink the issue of why they want to ban funding, especially when it might be the sole way to treat real human disease.” George Daley, the director of the stem cell transplantation program at Children's Hospital in Boston, has concerns about the eligibility of existing embryonic stem cell lines established from embryos whose donors chose to discard them but might not have been informed of alternative options required for consent today. “It's problematic to hold yesterday's cell lines to today's informed consent standards,” Daley says. “Lines derived long ago by the highest standards of the time and with thoughtful informed consent should be ‘grandfathered’ into the new policy.” Another notice up for comment until May 15 poses questions about whether certain gene patenting and licensing practices may have adverse effects on the cost and quality of genetic tests and on patients' access to them. In part, this notice is a response to recent controversies about restrictive patents on disease genes such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Critics have argued that the monopoly held by biotech companies on patented genes keeps the cost of diagnostic tests high and also limits the ability of other groups to analyze the genes and improve the reliability of tests. Scientists can choose to be alerted by email as rules on stem cells, recombinant molecules, and other topics of interest appear on the Federal Register by signing up at http://www.regulations.gov. Newsletters sent from nongovernmental science societies sometimes include notifications when pertinent rulings are open for public comment. For example, in March this year, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) let their members know about a proposal from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that would require NSF grantees to teach students and postdocs about the ethics of research. FASEB responded with a comment on behalf of their members, asking that online training be acceptable. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists is encouraging its members to submit comments on the first comprehensive revision since 1987 of regulations regarding the release and importation of genetically engineered plants and invertebrates. The comment period on this important proposal has been extended until June 29. And the International Society for Stem Cell Research has circulated emails asking their members to prepare comments in response to the NIH stem cell guidelines so that they can submit a comment on behalf of the society. People affiliated with biotechnology companies and advocacy groups often flood the Federal Register with comments. For example, draft guidelines posted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding genetically engineered animals that produce drugs, vitamins, or other marketable traits received some 200 comments earlier this year; only a few were from scientists at academic institutions. “It may be that the academic community is not familiar with the commenting process and did not understand that they could comment,” says Larisa Rudenko, senior advisor for biotechnology at the FDA and the agency's point person for animal biotechnology. “We were hoping more academics would comment on the guidance” because their comments tend to be substantial and specific, she says. Rules usually take years to finalize, in part because federal agencies do not want to downplay risks. Documents posted on the Federal Register often direct questions to scientists, soliciting advice on say, the mutability of certain gene constructs. Although the first FDA approved biopharm animals—goats producing anticoagulant drugs—were approved soon after the guidance was finalized, the FDA staff responsible for implementing the guidance can still be reached. “After every point [in the process], come in, comment, or call,” Rudenko says. “You don't need to submit a package, just give us a call and we'll work with you.” Rudenko says the last thing the FDA wants to do is frighten off academics by presenting themselves as bureaucratic or unresponsive. Yet when asked what he knows about the Federal Register, Kristofor Langlais, a molecular geneticist at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, answers, “I don't know exactly what it is, but I've heard of it.” He says that although he cannot speak for others, he can guess why scientists rarely get involved with policy. “Most science programs teach science…but neglect to include training in how science and society go together,” he says. “My hunch is that scientists that never had a significant society aspect included in their training don't feel comfortable getting involved with these issues, because perhaps the mechanisms by which policy is developed and adapted are so foreign.” “In all fairness, scientists working day to day are not going to read the Register unless someone prods them to comment,” says Neil Holtzman, now a professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of the 1989 book Proceed with Caution: Predicting Genetic Risks in the Recombinant DNA Era. But it is not a time issue, he says. Perhaps the issue is where their concerns lie. When the various scientific societies he belonged to sent him emails or letters asking that he comment on a federal proposal, he says these requests rarely involved public policy. “I got letters asking about expanding the budget [for research], but I seldom got a letter saying here's a policy that's harmful to the public, would you write a letter?” Instead, Holtzman and a handful of other scientists influenced public policy on their own, by expressing their concerns about the Human Genome Project as it emerged in the early 1990s. Later, when Holtzman co-chaired the NIH-DOE Task Force on Genetic Testing, he helped to persuade the US Department of Health and Human Services to create a committee on genetic testing. Posting a comment may be less effective than testifying before Congress or serving on a federal task force like Holtzman did, but it is a way to strengthen the voice of science without impacting research productivity or teaching responsibilities. It took very little time for Bruce Tabashnik, an entomologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, to compose his comment for the Register. “Were my two hours worth it?” he says, “Absolutely.” Jeannette Martinez of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had met Tabashnik at an entomology meeting and later asked him to post a comment on a model of insect resistance to an insecticide produced by transgenic corn. In his comment, Tabashnik enumerated reasons why he thought that the assumptions of the model, submitted by the company that produced the corn, were incorrect. The final decision has yet to be released, but Tabashnik says he is satisfied knowing that his letter triggered a debate over something that would have otherwise been regarded as fact. Commenting does not pay and may not improve a CV, but according to Tabashnik, there are emotional benefits. He says, “I invest my life in developing knowledge in one area and I see it as rewarding to even expend the effort to have it be of some use to society.”"
