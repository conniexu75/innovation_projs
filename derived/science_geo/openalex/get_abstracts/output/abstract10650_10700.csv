https://openalex.org/W1484180915,"Glutathione peroxidase has been purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. The purification steps involved ammonium sulfate precipitation of hemolysate, CM-cellulose (CM-52), DEAE-cellulose (DE52), Sephadex G-200, and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography. In the last step, i.e. DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography, the enzyme was eluted in a major peak and tailing fraction. The major peak was found to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and disignated as glutathione peroxidase A (GSH-Px A). The tail fraction, however, separated into two protein bands on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. One of the bands corresponded to GSH-Px A while the other band was slower moving and was designated as GSH-Px B. GSH-Px A and GSH-Px B had specific activity of 103 and 4 enzyme units per mg of protein, respectively. Antibodies raised against the homogeneous GSH-Px A have been found to cross-react with GSH-Px B. Both, GSH-Px A and B are selenoproteins. GSH-Px A has been found to contain 3.5 g atoms of selenium per mol of protein. Selenium content of GSH-Px B, however, could not be determined accurately due to insufficient material. The molecular weight of GSH-Px A as determined by the sedimentation equilibrium method is 95,000 plus or minus 3,000. On urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis GSH-Px A and B dissociate into single subunits. The molecular weight of the subunits of GSH-Px A is 23,000 and that of GSH-Px B is 47,000. Thus, it appears that GSH-Px A is a tetramer. Our results suggest that GSH-Px B is probably an altered form of the major component, GSH-Px A, or its precursor. The properties of GSH-Px A have been studied. The isoelectric pH was found to be 4.9 and the optimum pH for enzyme activity was 8.5. The energy of activation was 8.2 kcal. The Km of the enzyme for GSH was 4.1 mM while the Km for t-butyl hydroperoxide was 52 mu-M. The effect of sulfhydryl reagents and the metal ions on the enzyme was also studied."
https://openalex.org/W1539133138,"MgATP-dependent calcium sequestering activity of rat liver microsomes has been characterized. This activity is linear over a 90-min period and specifically requires MgATP. Substitution of CTP, UTP, GTP, or ADP will not support calcium uptake. Oxalate, which serves as a trapping agent in calcium uptake of skeletal muscle microsomes, is required to maintain net accumulation of calcium. The reaction is temperature-dependent and has an apparent Vmax of 11.2 nmol/mg of protein/min. The apparent Km for calcium is 23.2 muM calculated from total calcium concentration, and approximately 4.6 muM based on free calcium concentration, and apparent Km for ATP is 1.8 mM. Calcium uptake activity normally measured in presence of 100 mM KCl is only slightly depressed if 100 mM NaCl is substituted and is considerably depressed when 200 mM sucrose replaces KCl. An appropriate hydrolysis of ATP is associated with the calcium uptake. Separation of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum on sucrose gradients indicates a considerably lower specific activity per mg of protein in the fraction enriched with rough endoplasmic reticulum. Azide, at a level which completely inhibits liver mitochondrial calcium sequestration, has no effect on the liver microsomal system. Oligomycin, which inhibits ATP-dependent calcium uptake of liver mitochondria, has a considerably lesser effect on calcium uptake of liver microsomes. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and mersalyl inhibit the liver microsomal calcium pump at levels as low as 10- minus 7 M. Calcium uptake activity is considerably reduced in adult female rats. Weanling rats, both male and female, have calcium uptake activities like that of the adult males. Because of the higher activity in the male rat, the fatty acid composition of the liver microsomal phospholipids was analyzed. The male rat had a higher percentage of linoleic and palmitic acids in the microsomal phospholipids. Endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane are postulated to play a role in regulation of the levels of free cytoplasmic calcium in the mammalian liver."

https://openalex.org/W1493236524,"R-phycocyanin was purified from two independent isolates of the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum. At pH 7.0 the protein sediments as a single component with s 20,w of 5.98 S (at 2 mg/ml, gamma/2=0.02). Over a protein concentration range of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/ml (gamma/2=0.16), sedimentation equilibrium gave a molecular weight of 103,000 +/- 6,000 with no evidence of heterogeneity. In common with C-phydocyanins, R-phycocyanin consists of alpha and beta subunits of molecular weights of 18,200 and 20,500, determined by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels resolves two bands, blue (at pI of 5.2), and purple (at pI of 5.3), believed to correspond to the alpha and beta subunits, respectively. The native protein gave a single precipitin band when tested against the homologous antiserum by the Ouchterlony double diffusion technique. No cross-reaction was observed with antiserum to the allophycocyanin from the same organism. The absorption spectrum of native trimeric R-physocyanin at pH 7.0 exhibited epsilomN (555 nm) of 1.51 x 10(5) M(-1) cm(-1), epsilonM (618 nm) 2.55 x 10(5) M(-1) cm(-1), and A 1% 1cm (618 nm) of 70.0. The circular dichroism spectrum of the native protein was characterized by the following molecular ellipticity maxima in deg cm2 per dmol x 10(-5): [theta]311 = -2.36, [theta]343 = -3.27, [theta]552 = 4.67, and [theta]627 = 6.27. All of these values were based on an alphabeta molecular weight of 36,3000, calculated from the amino acid composition. To permit quantitative estimation of the chromophore composition of R-phycocyanin, the absorption properties of Aphanocapsa sp. C-phycoerythrin were determined. At pH 7.0, native C-phycoerythrin exhibited epsilonM (562 nm) of 4.88 x 10(5) M(-1) cm(-1), and A 1% 1cm of 127, based on an alphabeta molecular weight of 38,400 calculated from the amino acid composition. The molar extinction coefficients for polypeptide-bound phycoerythrobilin were calculated from the spectrum of denatured C-phycoerythrin in 8 M urea at pH 1.9, on the assumption that each alphabeta unit contains six such chromophores. The analogous data for phycocyanobilin was available from an earlier study (Glazer, A.N., and Fang, S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 659-662). The absorption curve of denatured R-phycocyanin was fitted with high precision by a theoretical curve calculated for a mixture of two phycocyanobilin and one phycoerythrobilin chromophore. The amino acid analyses of R-phycocyanin and of its separated alpha and beta subunits demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry for the subunits in the native protein. The absorption spectra of the isolated subunits were consistent with the conclusion that the alpha subunit carries a single phycocyanobilin chromophore, while one phycoerythrobilin and one phycocyanobilin chromophore are bound to the beta subunit..."
https://openalex.org/W2035862350,"SEVERAL cases of allelic variation have been reported in the mouse that are presumably determined by genes for the variable region of the heavy chain of immunoglobulins1–8. These genes control qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the immune response to particular antigens, and exhibit close linkage to the cluster of genes (Ig-1, Ig-2, Ig-3, Ig-4) that determine the allotypic differences residing in the constant portion of the heavy chains of several immunoglobulin classes9–11. (No recombinants have been observed among the latter in over 2,000 backcross mice.) Significantly, several presumptive recombinants have been recovered that seem to separate some variable region genes from the allotype loci, and some variable region genes from each other1,12. Outside genetic markers would be very valuable in identifying and interpreting these presumptive recombinants. Unfortunately, efforts to place the heavy chain allotype locus in the mouse linkage map have been unsuccessful9,10,13. We report here the discovery of close linkage between Ig-1 and the serum prealbumin locus of the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2139435715,"We have studied synthesis of specific proteins in two permanent lines of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia cells (Friend line 745 and Ostertag line FSD-1, both derived from DBA/2 mice). By 96 hr following treatment with 1-2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), up to 25% of the protein being synthesized by both these cultures is hemoglobin. At that time, hemoglobin constitutes up to 10% of the cellular soluble protein. Both lines synthesize heme and globin coordinately, and alpha and beta globin chains in a nearly balanced 1:1 ratio. However, the ratio of betaMajor:betaMinor chains synthesized by these induced Friend leukemia (FL) cells is approximately 9 in the FSD-1 line and 1.3 in the Friend Clone 745 line, whereas it is 4 in normal adult DBA/2 mouse erythrocytes. Evidence for the latter conclusion was obtained by electrophoresis of FL hemoglobins on cellulose acetate membranes, and also by chromatographic separation of alpha, betaMajor, and betaMinor globins on carboxymethylcellulose in 8 M urea at 20 degrees C. Carbonic anhydrase activity per mg protein is 3 times higher in induced than in control cultures. 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid is not found in induced FL cells. Induced and control FL cells agglutinate strongly and equally with Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The developmental process in these cultured leukemia cells appears to be an aberrant erythropoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W323023611,"Nonsulfated, partially N-deacetylated, 14C-labeled polysaccharide was formed by incubation of a mouse mastocytoma microsomal fraction with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. After 60 min at 37 degrees the incorporation of radioactivity was interrupted, and sulfation was initiated, by the addition of unlabeled UDP-glucuronic acid and 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate, respectively. After varying periods of incubation with the nucleotide sulfate, polysaccharide was isolated and analyzed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. During incubation with 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate, sulfated 14C-polysaccharides were formed, while the nonsulfated 14C-polysaccharide was eliminated, each type of component retaining the same elution position throughout the entire sulfation period (60 min). No accumulation of low sulfated material was observed. Fully sulfated heparin was detected after only 0.5 min of sulfation. These results suggest that the sulfation of heparin is a rapid process, involving a limited number of polysaccharide molecules at a time. Besides heparin-like products, having both N- and O-sulfate groups, and [14C]iduronic acid as predominant uronic acid constituent, an additional sulfated component was detected, having N-sulfate but no O-sulfate groups. This novel polysaccharide contained [14C]glucuronic acid but little or no [14C]iduronic acid. Previous studies have shown that L-iduronic acid residues in heparin are formed by C-5 inversion of D-glucuronic acid units, previously incorporated into the polymer; the inversion reaction requires concomitant sulfation of the polymer. The present results demonstrate that the formation of iduronic acid residues is related to the sulfation of hydroxyl groups. Pulse-chase experiments with 3-phosphoadenylyl[35S]sulfate indicated that the N-sulfated polymer, lacking O-sulfate groups, could be converted into heparin-like products by further sulfation of hydroxyl groups only. The biosynthesis of heparin may thus involve a pathway, in which the formation of N-sulfated intermediates precedes the introduction of O-sulfate groups."

https://openalex.org/W1530668109,"The relationship between the rate of endogenous respiration and the energy-dependent accumulation of iron and calcium was studied in rat liver mitochondria energized by external ATP and inhibited to a variable extent by rotenone. In contrast to the uptake of calcium, that of iron revealed an absolute requirement for reducing equivalents supported by the respiratory chain, which indicates that iron crosses the inner membrane only in the ferrous form. Experimental evidence is presented that a primary event of the energy-linked uptake of iron is that Fe(III) is bound to ligands on the C-side of the inner membrane, ligands which have a unique microenvironment giving the metal a half-reduction potential which is sufficiently high to establish a oxidation-reduction equilibrium with the respiratory chain at the level of cytochrome c. In addition, evidence is presented that this accumulation represents a unidirectional flux of Fe(II) from the C-side to the M-side of the inner membrane and the matrix where it is tightly bound to ligands (proteins?) not yet characterized. As expected, the energy-dependent accumulation of iron is accompanied by an internal alkalinization of the mitochondria analogous to that observed for calcium. A schematic model of the energized accumulation of iron by rat liver mitochondria is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1546225450,"Sucrase-isomaltase complex and its functional subunits have been identified in homogenates of human small intestinal mucosa by use of Sephadex G-200 (superfine) chromatography aided by affinity of the isomaltase moiety for the dextran gel. The isomaltase subunit binds strongly to the gel at 4 degrees, and is eluted only after 2 column volumes; earlier recovery as a sharp peak can be achieved by raising column temperature to 37 degrees after elution of other proteins. Bio-Gel P-300 chromatography, density gradient, and equilibrium centrifugation demonstrated that the sucrase subunit (Stokes radius = 45 A, frictional ratio = 1.32, s20,w = 6.9, MW = 130,000) and the isomaltase subunit (Stokes radius = 45 A, frictional ratio = 1.30, s20,w = 6.6, MW = 120,000) are similar but unequal in size. The sucrase-isomaltase complex (Stokes radius = 70 A, frictional ratio = 1.61, s20,w = 9.8, MW = 280,000), appears to be an elongated hybrid molecule that is less symmetrical than either of itt subunits. Apparent Km and pH activity curves were indistinguishable for each enzyme whether present in the hybrid or in the free state. The sucrase-isomaltase complex, accounting for approximately 90 percent of native intestinal sucrase and isomaltase activities, was isolated and cleaved by 0.01 M beta-mercaptoethanol/6 M urea treatment into active sucrase and isomaltase subunits having biochemical characteristics identical with those of the free native moieties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gell electrophoresis of the complex also produced subunits having molecular weights very close to those for the active free sucrase and isomaltase moieties, indicating that each alpha-glucosidase appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. Immunization of rabbits with pure sucrase-isomaltase complex yielded a monospecific precipitating antibody that reacted with the hybrid and the sucrase subunit, but had minimal affinity for the isomaltase subunit, providing further evidence that the sucrase-isomaltase molecule is a hybrid consisting of two distinct alpha-glucosidases."
https://openalex.org/W1543155678,"Bovine spermatozoa accumulated a small amount of 32Pi during aerobic incubation in vitro. At least 50% of the acquired isotope rapidly entered cellular nucleotides. Both adenosine and guanosine di- and triphosphates were labeled, but contrary to expectations, the specific activity of ADP exceeded that of ATP. The uptake of phosphate and its incorporation into nucleotides were suppressed by respiratory inhibitors and were abolished by treatment with sulfhydryl-directed reagents at 10 to 20 nmol/mg of sperm protein. With fructose as an energy source for motility, glycolysis did not support phosphate uptake. Nucleotide labeling was increased 60 to 80-fold when the cells were treated with the polyene antibiotic filipin, and filipin was able to reverse the inhibition of phosphate (and succinate) entry produced by N-ethylmaleimide or mersalyl. Since filipin interacts specifically with the cholesterol-containing plasma membrane of bovine spermatozoa and increases its permeability, it is probable that the plasma membrane normally limits phosphate and succinate transport into these cells. This contention is further supported by the observation that high concentrations of extracellular Pi, the penetration of which was extremely limited under these conditions, protected against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. Phosphate uptake was increased 10 to 20-fold, but nucleotide labeling was inhibited, when calcium was present in the incubation medium. Ruthenium red, presumably acting extracellularly, prevented these effects of calcium. Thus, the entry of phosphate and succinate into spermatozoa is controlled by plasma membrane components that resemble the phosphate and succinate exchangers and calcium carrier found in mitochondria isolated from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W1501409108,"The reaction of deoxyuridylate with Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthetase (methylenetetrahydrofolate: deoxyuridylate C-methyltransferase) in the absence of folate or thiols can be followed by changes in the circular dichroic spectra at 267 nm. These changes at the maximum absorption wavelength of the pyrimidine suggest that on binding the interaction of the pyrimidine ring and the deoxyribose moiety is altered. The binding curve follows the form expected for single site binding. There was no change in the ultraviolet absorption spectra. The dissociation constant of the deoxyuridylate enzyme complex was calculated to be 4 x 10-minus 7 M. Iodoacetamide also reacts stoichiometrically with one of the two subunits of thymidylate synthetase and inactivates the enzyme. This reaction is blocked by the presence of deoxyuridylate or chloromercuribenzoate. Complement fixation and immunodiffusion studies gave no indication that iodoacetamide treatment caused conformational changes or breakdown of the enzyme into subunits. Treatment with 0.1 M mercaptoethanol restored activity to one-half the value obtained with native enzyme, suggesting that mercaptoethanol enabled the unreacted subunit to become functional."

https://openalex.org/W1511019684,"A bacterial mutagenesis assay and genetic differences in microsomal CO-binding cytochromes were combined in vitro to evaluate the metabolic activation of several known carcinogens to frameshift mutagens. With the use of liver fractions from C57BL/6N and DBA/2N control mice and mice treated in vivo with 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoglavone, phenobarbital, or 2,3,7,,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the in vitro mutagenicity of 3-methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene --but not benzo[a]pyrene==is closely associated with the genetically mediated difference in both aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase activity and new cytochrome P1-450 formation; such an association between 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene or benz[a]anthracene activation to mutagens in vitro and these genetic differences between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mouse strains in uncertain. The Salmonella typhimurium histidine mutant TA1538 is more effective than tester strains TA1537 and TA1535 in the determination of 3-methylcholanthrene mutagenesis in vitro. The relationships between the histidine revertant rate as a function of both liver protein concentration per plate and mutagen concentration per plate are illustrated for 3-methylcholanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene. With the use of offspring from the appropriate genetic crosses, the aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible hydroxylase activity appears to be expressed as an autosomal dominant trait, whereas the mutagenesis of 3-methylcholanthrene in vitro appears to be expressed additively; this apparent discrepancy probably reflects different proportional amounts of phenolic benzo[a]pyrene, compared with mutagenic 3-methylcholanthrene metabolites, formed by the monooxygenase(s). 3-Methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene--but not benzo[a]pyrene--are each more mutagenic in vitro per molecule of cytochrome P1-450 than per molecule of CO-binding cytochrome other than P1450. Diethylmaleate, a compound which depletes flutathione content in liver, and 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide, an inhibitor of epoxide hydrase (EC 4.2.1.63), were also studied in vitro. Diethylmaleate, and especially 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide, increases the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene, whereas no increases occur with 3-methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, or 2-acetylaminofluorene activation to mutagens in vitro. Both diethylmaleate and 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide cause decreases in 2-acetylaminofluorene mutagenesis in vitro when liver fractions from phenobarbital-treated mice are used."
https://openalex.org/W1637446645,"Nucleic acid-free extracts of Escherichia coli have been analyzed by chromatography on columns of cellulose, to which poly(A), poly(U), or poly(C) have been attached by ultraviolet irradiation. Proteins are released from the columns by stepwise elution with increasingly higher concentrations of salt, followed by washing with urea to remove very tightly bound molecules. The pattern of protein elution is reproducibly different for each of the homopolymer RNA-cellulose columns used: some proteins bind very tightly to one column, but poorly to others. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, by immunological cross-reactivity in double diffusion tests, and by enzymological assays, has allowed the identification of a number of these proteins. The RNA polymerase core enzyme binds to poly(C)- and to poly(U)-cellulose columns, and can be purified to 20 to 30 percent homogeneity in a single step. Ribosomal protein S1 and the termination factor rho bind very tightly to poly(C)-cellulose, and both can be purified to homogeneity rapidly, in much higher yields than previously reported. Poly(A)-cellulose chromatography allows the isolation of large amounts of an 80,000 molecular weight protein having an as yet unassigned cellular function. The host factor required for RNA phage Qbeta RNA replication in vitro can also be obtained from poly(A)-cellulose, and chromatography of extracts of phage Qbeta-infected E. coli on RNA-cellulose columns results in very rapid isolation of the Qbeta replicase enzyme. Homopolymer RNA-cellulose chromatography thus appears to be a simple, general technique, useful for the efficient isolation of a variety of RNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520035893,"Rat liver microsomes have previously been shown to contain hemoproteins having molecular weights of 53,000, 50,000, and 45,000. The 45,000-dalton hemoprotein, which is induced in rat liver microsomes by pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital, is resistant to proteolysis by trypsin. This characteristic was used to purify it from the other microsomal hemoproteins. In the procedure used, a sodium cholate-solubilized microsomal fraction from phenobarbital-pretreated rats was treated with trypsin and chromatographed on Sephadex G-100 to separate the hemoprotein from preolytic degradation products. The hemoprotein thus isolated was homogenous on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was identified spectrally as a cytochrome P-420 hemoprotein. This hemoprotein was free of cytochrome b5 and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity. Antibody prepared against the protease-treated cytochrome P-420 hemoprotein will not cross-react with the 53,000- and 50,000-dalton hemoproteins. This was assessed by three criteria. First, immunoprecipitation studies were conducted with detergent-solubilized partially purified cytochrome P-450 preparations isolated from the liver microsomes of control and phenobarbital- and 3-methylcholathrene-retreated rats. The antibody immunoprecipitated only the 45,000-dalton hemoprotein from these partially purified cytochrome P-450 preparations, each of which contains all three hemoproteins. Second, the antibody demonstrated specificity with regard to the microsomal hydroxylation reactions it would inhibit in a reconstituted hydroxylation system containing partially purified cytochrome P-450 (448) fractions isolated from the liver microsomes from phenobarbital- or 3-methylcholathrene-pretreated rats. The antibody would inhibit benzphetamine-N-demethylation catalyzed by both cytochrome P-450 fractions but would not inhibit benzpyrene hydroxylation catalyzed by either. Third, agglutination and complement fixation assays were performed to assess the binding of the antibody to liver microsomes isolated from control and phenobarbital- or 3- methylcholanthrene-pretreated rats. These studies demonstrated that the antibody binds preferentially to the liver microsomes isolated from phenobarbital-pretreated rats, in which the 45,000-dalton hemoprotein has been shown to be induced. It is hypothesized that there are very significant structural and catalytic differences among the cytochrome P-450 hemoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1568907442,"The orientation of human erythrocyte membrane protein was examined by enzymic iodination using lactoperoxidase with the glucose-oxidase system for generating peroxide, followed by proteolytic digestion. The outer surface of intact cells was labeled with 125I and the cytoplasmic surface of either resealed ghosts containing lactoperoxidase or of inside-out vesicles was labeled with 131I. Following iodination, the outer surface (resealed ghosts) or the cytoplasmic surface (outer surface of inside-out vesicles) was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or pronase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the isolated membranes revealed three major and several minor peaks of radioactivity. Their surface orientation, defined within the limits of the specificity of the probes used, was as follows: the three major peaks consist of: (a) a 90,000 to 100,000 molecular weight component labeled on both surfaces; its proteolytic digestion profile indicated that it spans the membrane in an asymmetric manner and that it is composed of more than one peptide; (b) the major red cell membrane glycoprotein (apparent molecular weight 60,000) which is labeled and digested at only the outer surface; and (c) peptide(s) of high molecular weight (approximately 200,000), labeled and digested at only the cytoplasmic surface. The minor components include a glycoprotein of approximately 25,000 (apparent molecular weight) accessible to both surfaces and peptides of 60,000 to 70,000, 45,000, and 20,000 molecular weight labeled only on the inner surface."
https://openalex.org/W1598108946,"The addition of ergosterol to cultures of Tetrahymena pyriformis results in (a) the accumulation of the sterol by the cells; (b) the inhibition of the synthesis of the pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, tetrahymanol; (c) the replacement of tetrahymanol by ergosterol in the ciliate membranes. The dry weight and lipid content of sterol-supplemented ciliates did not differ from the controls. Examination of the lipid classes revealed no change in composition except for a higher content of ergosterol in supplemented cells than tetrahymanol in control cultures. The relative proportions of triglycerides, the major classes of polar lipids, 1-alkyl phospholipids and phosphonolipids, appeared unaltered. A complex array of fatty acids is found in this ciliate. Several acids not reported previously in this organism were isolated and identified, and the novel fatty acid 18:2 delta 6, 11, was found in substantial amounts. Ergosterol supplementation altered the proportions of the fatty acids, although not all lipid classes were affected to the same extent. The changes noted were of three general types: (a) a shortening of the fatty acyl chain length in the acids of the normal series; (b) a lowering in the degree of unsaturation; (c) a discrimination between two isomers of lionoleate, 18:2 delta 6, 11 and 18:2 delta 9, 12. The former is elevated in the presence of ergosterol while the latter is depressed. Each class of polar lipids has a distinctive fatty acid composition. Among the glycerophospholipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine were least affected, while the mixture of 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-(2-aminoethyl)-phosphonate and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-(2-aminoethyl)-phosphonate was most markedly altered. Sphingolipid fatty acid composition was influenced by ergosterol supplementation. Two changes were noted: (a) a reduction in the length of the hydrocarbon chain; (b) an increase in the proportion of alpha-hydroxy acids. The impact of ergosterol on the fatty acid composition of the polar lipids may be on fatty acid biosynthesis, on incorporation of fatty acids, or on the turnover rates of the fatty acyl groups. Ergosterol is concentrated in the ciliary (limiting) membrane, as are the polar lipids most affected. This localization allows the speculation that the change in fatty acid composition may be related to the maintenance of optimal membrane properties upon the introduction of the sterol."
https://openalex.org/W1605939661,"Empirical analysis of the primary structures of 10 mammalian C-peptides has indicated a conservation of conformation. The positioning of the C-peptide in the proinsulin molecule is essentially defined by the proposed secondary structure, the covalent connection to the A1 and B30 residues of insulin and the requirement that C-peptide lies against the exposed surface of the insulin hexamer, allowing a three-dimensional structure for proinsulin to be predicted. Conserved residues in the C-peptide are proximate to residues in insulin that are also conserved, suggesting that interactions between these residues are highly probable. Residues in insulin thought to be important for biological activity are principally those that interact with the C-peptide residues. The role of the C-peptide region in proinsulin in preventing expression of insulin activity and for nucleation of the folding of the prohormone are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1976113694,"When DNA of Drosophila melanogaster is digested to completion with Hemophilus aegyptius restriction endonuclease, the majority of the products are DNA segments whose lengths fits a random distribution with an average of 350 base pairs. However, some 10% of the DNA is recovered as various segments of discrete lengths, ranging from 30,000 to 365 base pairs. These segments arise from the regular spacing of the enzyme restriction sites in limited portions of the Drosophila genome. Three segments have been shown to originate from mitochondrial DNA, while all the others can be assigned to one or more isopycnic density classes of nuclear DNA. Five of the discrete fragments display modular lengths, each being an integral multiple of a 365 base pairs subunit. The relative frequencies of these multiple segments suggest that they are derived from DNA originally containing restriction sites every 365 base pairs, and that approximately 25% of these sites have been randomly inactivated."

https://openalex.org/W1506694813,"Polylysine stimulates the activity of ferredoxin-NADP reductase. The stimulation is observed with three different catalytic activities of this enzyme. The stoichiometry of interaction of polylysine and enzyme is a function of the size of the polylysine molecule. Polylysine alters the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the enzyme with the same stoichiometry as that affecting catalytic activity. Steady state initial velocity kinetics indicates that polylysine is a noncompetitive hyperbolic activator of the enzyme and is able to prevent substrate inhibition by NADPH. In the absence of polylysine, the specific activity of the enzyme increases upon dilution, and this effect is magnified in the presence of polylysine. These results suggest that the soluble enzyme is an aggregate, and gel filtration measurements indicate a molecular weight of 85,000 for the purified enzyme, which appears to consist of two subunits. This confirms the observations of Fredricks and Gehl (FREDRICKS, W. W., AND GEHL, J. M. (1973) Fed. Proc. 32, 477). Indirect evidence is presented suggesting the enzyme is bound to a cationic region on the chloroplast membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1543734146,"The incubation of mitochondria in mixtures that contain phosphate, NaCl, oxidizable substrate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate induces the efflux of K-+. This process depends on electron transport and on the cyclic movement of phosphate across the membrane. Sodium ions, Li-+, or Cs-+ to a smaller extent, are required for maximal release of K-+. Potassium ions do not induce net efflux of internal K-+, but instead prevent the Na-+-induced release of K-+. Significant K-+ influx takes place in K-+-depleted mitochondria through a process with characteristics which are almost identical with those in which K-+ release takes place. As Na-+ inhibits the uptake of K-+, it is suggested that the movement of K-+ across the membrane is controlled by the cationic environment. Thallous ion, at concentrations that do not affect oxidative phosphorylation, was found to be an effective inhibitor of the influx and the efflux of K-+. The inhibitory effect of Tl-+ seems to be specific for K-+ since it does not affect the movement of Na-+. Mitochondria bind 10 to 15 nmol of 204-Tl-+ per mg of protein through an energy-independent process."

https://openalex.org/W2090733878,"Fixation with glutaraldehyde (GA) and paraformaldehyde (PFA) preserved measles virus hemagglutinin at the surface of chronically infected cells. Cells fixed with PFA but not with GA exhibited hemadsorption with green monkey cells. PFA fixation, in contrast to GA fixation, also preserved the immunogenicity of measles virus hemolysin. These fixatives and the removal of the measles virus hemagglutinin from the cell surface by trypsin enabled studies of the appearance of the hemagglutinin at the surface membrane. Results obtained by immunofluorescence technique and by hemadsorption indicated that measles virus hemagglutinin appeared polarly at the cell membrane and then spread around the surface. This was substantiated by measurements of the immunofluorescence intensity at the single cell level per membrane unit and per cell, and by measuring the binding of iodinated immunoglobulins per 10(6) cells. The appearance was inhibited by sodium azide and cytochalasin B. The spreading was not inhibited by sodium azide, but was influenced by cytochalasin B. The spreading did not proceed at 4 degrees C. On the basis of these findings, a hypothetical model for appearance and spreading of measles virus hemagglutinin was proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1506204740,"A method was developed to label specifically the glycan chains of the cell wall peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 with [14C]acetate. The formation of peptide cross-links (a) during exponential growth, (b) after valine starvation and wall thickening, and (c) during regrowth after 2 hours of valine starvation, was studied using continuous, pulse and pulse-chase labeling of the peptidoglycan with both [14C]acetate and [3H]lysine. After labeling, walls were isolated, digested with the muramidase of Chalaropsis B, and the free peptidoglycan fragments (75 to 90% of the total peptidoglycan) were then fractionated on columns of Sephadex G-50, G-50, and G-25 in series into disaccharide-peptide monomer and peptide cross-linked bisdisaccharide-peptide dimer, trisdisaccharide-peptide trimer, and higher oligomer fractions. Peptidoglycan made during valine starvation and wall thickening was found to be slightly more cross-linked than peptidoglycan made during exponential growth. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments indicated that peptide cross-linking continued for an unexpectedly long time after incorporation of precursors into insoluble peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1570642868,"Horse spleen ferritin was fractionated into its constituent isoferritins by isoelectric focusing. Separated isoferritins were stable and showed no tendency to redistribute when re-examined by analytical gel focusing. All of the isoferritins were immunologically indistinguishable when tested with antibodies raised against unfractionated horse spleen ferritin. The separated isoferritins also had similar conformations as determined by circular dichroism. Iron distribution studies, however, revealed a wide disparity among the isoferritins. The most acidic components had the lowest iron content but the iron content did not vary systematically throughout the isoferritin spectrum. Natural apoferritin, isolated from the ferritin by density gradient centrifugation, focused exclusively as the acidic moieties, whereas apoferritin prepared by reduction of native ferritin exhibited a banding pattern similar to that of unfractionated ferritin. The subunit structure of the isoferritins was examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate or acidic urea systems. Multiple subunit types were demonstrated by both methods. The relative proportion of these subunit types varied progressively through the isoferritin spectrum. This difference in subunit population appears to be the basis for much of the structural heterogeneity in the apoferritin shells."
https://openalex.org/W321291114,"The intraccellular proteins of animal cells are continuously turning over; therefore, the concentration of a given protein is regulated both at the level of protein synthesis and at the level of protein degradation. Studies on the relative rates of turnover of isoenzymes, such as those of aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase, may help to clarify the mechanisms involved in protein turnover. The isoenzymes and subunit types are very similar proteins, and are located within the same intracellular compartments; yet, the concentrations of these proteins are independently regulated. The present paper describes the roles of synthesis and degradation in regulating aldolase isoenzyme concentrations in avian brain..."
https://openalex.org/W1557467093,"The quantitative and qualitative changes in fructose-P2 aldolase isoenzyme concentrations during development of red (leg) and white (breast) skeletal muscles of the chick were investigated. (a) The aldolase C to A subunit transition associated with muscle development is accompanied by large increases in aldolase activity (units/g, wet weight) and in specific catalytic activity (units/mg of protein). The accumulations in both muscle types follow pseudo-first order kinetics with doubling times of 2 to 3 days. The steady state level of aldolase activity in breast muscle (about 150 units/g) is approximately 4-fold higher than that in leg muscle (about 40 units/g). In contrast to leg muscle, the major increase in aldolase activity in breast muscle occurs during postembryonic development. (b) Immunotitration studies demonstrated a direct correlation between increases in enzyme activity and aldolase A subunits during postembryonic muscle development. It was calculated that under steady state conditions, aldolase A4 comprises about 1 percent and 0.26 percent, respectively, of the total wet weight of breast and leg muscle. (c) regulation at the level of protein synthesis in effecting the postembryonic accumulation of aldolase A4 in the muscle types was investigated in short term amino acid incorporation experiments. After a 1-hour pulse with [3H]leucine, aldolase from breast and leg muscle was isolated in a single step by affinity chromatography on phosphocellulose. Incorporation of tritum into aldolase A4 and into soluble or total protein was compared. Between 4 and 38 days after hatching, the rate of aldolase synthesis relative to the synthesis of soluble muscle protein increased about 7- and 3-fold, respectively, in breast and leg muscle. Relative to total protein, incorporation of [3H]leucine into A4 increased about 3-fold in breast muscle, and decreased slightly in leg muscle between 5 and 25 days after hatching. By 3 weeks after hatching, incorporation of [3H]leucine into aldolase A4 relative to incorporation into total protein was about 6-fold higher in breast muscle than it was in leg muscle. The present work, as well as other recent studies, are discussed in relation to the mechanism involved in controlling tissue-specific and stage-specific levels of aldolase isoenzymes in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591881594,"Tryptic hydrolysis after reduction and carboxamidomethylation of staphylococcal enterotoxin B cleaved the single susceptible bond located between the 2 half-cystines of the molecule, Lys-Thr at positions 97 and 98 (Spero, L., Warren, J. R., and Metzger, J. F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7289-7294). The product remained as a single particle but was separated into the two constituent peptides by denaturants, and purification of the two fragments was accomplished by chromatography on CM-cellulose in 8 M urea. Antigenic activity was exhibited by the separated peptides after dialysis of urea solutions against dilute buffer, but was very labile. No emetic activity in rhesus monkeys was found for either separated peptide. The derivative behaved as two random coil peptides in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride but upon removal of guanidine refolded to a single molecular entity. Viscosity and unfolding kinetics in 1.5 M guanidine indicated physical identity of the recombined peptides with the derivative prior to treatment with guanidine. Three biological measures (serological, mitogenic, and emetic activity) were also essentially unaltered for the recombined material. Since these biological activities are dependent upon different aspects of enterotoxin structure, it is concluded that the recombined derivative was restored to its original conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1551646613,"The regulatory effect of alpha-lactalbumin in the lactose synthase system has been ascribed to its reversible association with a complex of galactosyltransferase with Mn2+ and UDP-galactose, prior to the binding of monosaccharides; the resulting complex has a higher affinity for various monosaccharides. Two steps in the postulated catalytic cycle have been investigated; UDP-galactose binding to enzyme-Mn2+ by equilibrium dialysis and alpha-lactalbumin binding to enzyme-Mn2+-UDP-galactose by sedimentation velocity and kinetics. There is a single binding site for UDP-galactose on the enzyme-Mn2+ complex, and the dissociation constant for UDP-galactose from enzyme-Mn2+-UDP-galactose was found to be 72 muM at 37 degrees. The formation of a complex between galactosyltransferase and alpha-lactalbumin in the presence of Mn2+ and UDP-galactose was observed as an increase in sedimentation coefficient of enzyme activity So20,w from 3.25 +/- 0.03 in the absence of alpha-lactalbumin to 4.22 +/- 0.03 at saturating concentrations of alpha-lactalbumin, a value closely similar to that of a cross-linked 1:1 complex of the proteins under the same conditions (4.35 +/- 0.03). No interaction was observed in the absence of substrates or with UDP-galactose and EDTA. From the ultracentrifuge data and steady state kinetics, dissociation constants for alpha-lactalbumin from the enzyme-Mn2+-UDP-galactose-alpha-lactalbumin complex were determined at several temperatures and salt concentrations. These showed good internal agreement. The free energy change delta G degrees for the association of the two proteins is calculated, and the results are discussed in relation to the nature of the interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2150131232,"Rat fibrinogen has been purified and compared with bovine and human fibrinogen with respect to a number of chemical characteristics, including molecular size, charge distribution, NH2-terminal amino acids, total amino acid composition, and interspecies immunological cross-reactivity. Although human and bovine fibrinogen demonstrated three nonidentical polypeptide chains by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel separations and by CM-cellulose separations, rat fibrinogen Aalpha and Bbeta chains exhibited identical molecular weight sizes as well as identical charges. The presence of two nonidentical chains in these preparations was shown by qualitative NH2-terminal sequence analyses. The gamma chain of rat fibrinogen was also shown to be quite distinct from the gamma chains of human and bovine fibrinogen in its elevated content of cysteinyl and methionyl residues. Rat fibrinogen possesses the first reported blocked gamma chain NH2-terminal amino acid of any species. It is concluded that, although many chemical properties of rat fibrinogen are unique, the basic molecular structure has remained consistent when compared with that of fibrinogen from the vertebrates studied thus far. Moreover, the inducibility of this system, together with the partial chemical characterization of the fibrinogen molecule, provides important information for the use of rat fibrinogen as a model system in studying the biosynthesis and assembly of this complex molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1596641013,"A detailed model of intermediary metabolism has been constructed which is consistent with all known information on the compartmental structure of metabolism in Tetrahymena, on the enzyme complement of this cell, and on the localization of the enzymes. The model allows computation of the specific activity of every carbon atom of all metabolites and thus of the flux of carbon along the major pathways of metabolism under steady state conditions. To test the model, data were required from cells grown under standard conditions and then suspended in a dilute salt solution and incubated for 1 hour in a mixture of acetate, pyruvate, hexanoate, bicarbonate, and glutamate labeled in a total of 10 positions, but with only one substrate labeled in any given flask. Twenty-seven measurements of label incorporation into CO2, lipids, glycogen, glutamate, and alanine were made, plus measurements of label distribution into fatty acid and glycerol moieties for 4 of the substrates and of oxygen consumption and of glycogenolysis, yielding 33 independent measurements. These, plus about 18 limit measurements which also constrain any possible solutions, were in sufficient excess of the 23 independent parameters to permit a stringent assessment of the model. Equations derived directly from the structure of the model and from the known stereochemistry of the reactions were programmed on a PDP-15 computer and values of the Qo2 and of label expected to be incorporated into the various products actually measured were computed for any given set of flux rates. A set of flux rates was found which yielded an excellent fit to the observed data. The ability to achieve a fit to the data for an overdetermined system constitutes strong support for this structural model of intermediary metabolism and the computed flux rates therefore provide a quantitative description of metabolite flow in the intact cell. Despite the redundancy of measurements relative to parameters to be determined, it was not possible to define a unique set of values for the flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, although the relationship between these fluxes is specified by the model. The analysis allows estimation of the recycling of phosphoenopyruvate through pyruvate kinase under conditions of net glyconeogenesis and an apparently futile exchange of acetyl-CoA between the inner and outer mitochondrial compartments. Carbon flow through the glyoxylate bypass under these conditions is about one-third of that through the Krebs cycle. The analysis also shows a net transport of malate from the peroxisomes to the mitochondria, consistent with the anaplerotic role of the peroxisomal glyoxylate bypass in Tetrahymena."

https://openalex.org/W1527751884,"Elongation Factor G (EF-G) from Escherichia coli was purified to homogenity by a previously published method (Rohrbach, M. S., Dempsey, M. E., and Bodley, J. W. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5094). The protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 74,000 under native conditions and 71,000 under denatured conditions as determined by high speed equilibrium centrifugation. An apparent molecular weight of 73,000 was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The protein has an apparent alpha helix content of 34% as determined from its circular dichroism spectrum. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was found to be 62,200 M-1 cm-1. Lysine is the COOH-terminal residue and the sequence at the NH2 terminus is alanylarginine. No evidence of terminal heterogeneity was observed. The amino acid composition of EF-G revealed no unusual amino acids or prosthetic groups, but was notable in that the protein contains only 6 cysteine residues. The maintenance of at least one of these cysteines in the reduced form is essential for activity, since the protein is rapidly inactivated upon removal of protecting thiol. Under some conditions, activity can be partly restored by re-addition of a thiol. The per cent activity of the protein was examined by an active site titration, the formation of the EF-G-ribosome-GDP-fusidic acid complex. The formation of 1 mol of complex/mol of EF-G showed that the protein is 100% active."
https://openalex.org/W2150059880,"A method was developed which permitted determination of the [14C]benzylpenicillin and [14C]Cephapirin binding capacity of rapidly growing Bacillus subtilis cells in liquid culture. Over the concentration range of the binding plateau (0.1 to 0.8 mug/ml), [14C]benzylpenicillin significantly inhibited formation of functional penicillin-binding proteins, but had comparatively little effect on total bacterial protein synthesis. The data suggest that penicillin covalently bound to the cells in a chemically stable manner alone is not sufficient to inhibit formation of functional binding proteins and that unbound penicillin in the growth medium is necessary. The concentration of unbound antibiotic in the culture medium, in turn, is a function of the cell-bound penicillinase activity whose significance increases with cell density. [14C]Cephapirin, a cephalosporin resistant to this cell-bound penicillinase almost completely inhibited the formation of functional Cephapirin-binding proteins, but had relatively little effect on total protein synthesis. At concentrations 250-fold higher than that required to inhibit formation of functional binding proteins. Cephapirin did not inhibit particulate D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity and presumably did not bind covalently to this penicillin-binding protein."
