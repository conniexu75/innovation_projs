https://openalex.org/W2025063713,"Cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. In insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. From human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (Hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. Two predominant forms, Hepc20 and Hepc25, contained 20 and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cDNAs in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. The full cDNA by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mRNA size on Northern blots. The liver was the predominant site of mRNA expression. The encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20–25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. Hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans,Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus nigerand antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus.

Among them are the abundant and widely distributed disulfide-linked cationic antimicrobial peptides found in both the plant and animal kingdoms. Generally, these peptides exhibit a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Plants produce many cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides including thionins, plant defensins, and the cysteine rich Ib-AMP 1–4 (1Zhang Y. Lewis K. FEMS Microbiol.

In insects, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are produced in the fat body (functional homologue of the mammalian liver) and transcriptionally induced and released into the hemolymph in response to infection or injury. These include insect defensins, heliomicin, drosomycin, and thanatin (4Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Mollusks also produce cationic and cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides such as mytilin, mytimicin, and myticin (8Mitta G. Vandenbulcke F. Noel T. Romestand B. Beauvillain J.C. Salzet M. Roch P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2759-2769PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, similar antimicrobial peptides include α- and β-defensins and protegrins (9Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Like the insect fat body, the vertebrate liver is also centrally involved in innate immune response to infection. The “acute phase” response to infection or inflammation is a pattern of increased hepatic synthesis of many secreted proteins involved in host defense and the selective suppression of synthesis of other secreted proteins. In contrast to the abundant fat body-derived antimicrobial peptides of insects, no vertebrate antimicrobial peptides originating in the liver have been described to date. In this work, we report the discovery of a novel hepatic antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin, whose processed form is found in urine. Cationic peptides were extracted from pooled urine of one to five healthy donors using methods that we described previously for the isolation of human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, urine was filtered to remove cells and extracted with the weak cation exchange matrix CM Macroprep (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Cationic peptides were eluted with 5% acetic acid and further purified by RP-HPLC1 (Waters Model 626; Waters, Milford, MA) on a Vydac C18 column (218TP510) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile (ACN) gradient of 4% ACN increment/min for 5 min and washed with 20% ACN for 5 min, followed by a 0.5% ACN increment/min for the last 30 min (12Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HPLC peak fractions were analyzed by acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and peptide masses were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS (UCLA Mass Spectrometry Facility (Los Angeles, CA) or Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA)). Purified hepcidin was modified by reduction and carboxymethylation before amino acid sequencing. Lyophilized peptide was resuspended in reduction and alkylation buffer (0.5 m Tris buffer, pH 8, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 20 mm EDTA) to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reduction was accomplished by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT), and the solution was overlaid with N2 gas and then incubated at 52 °C for 2.5 h. Fresh DTT (500-molar excess) was added and incubated for an additional hour at 52 °C. The solution was cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and iodoacetamide freshly dissolved in reduction and alkylation buffer was added to a final concentration of 3-fold molar excess over DTT and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DTT (1500-fold molar excess of the peptide). The peptide was then purified on a C18 RP-HPLC column equilibrated in 0.1% h-heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v). Peptides were eluted using linear ACN gradients at a flow rate of 3 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 230 and 280 nm as follows: 1% ACN increment/min for 20 min, followed by a 0.5% increment/min for the last 60 min. HPLC fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 5% acetic acid, and the peak fraction (32–35% ACN) was submitted for amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation at the UCLA Peptide Sequencing Facility. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dissolved either in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, alone or in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of trifluoroethylene:phosphate buffer. Peptide solutions were scanned in 0.1 mm light path demountable cells over a 270 nm to 185 nm wavelength range at 10 nm/min and a sample interval of 0.2 nm. An initial search of the protein data base showed no homology of hepcidin to any known protein. Therefore, the primary amino acid sequence was reverse translated and searched against the GenBankTM human EST data base using the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60239) Google Scholar). A matching cDNA clone (American Type Culture Collection yb44e08.r1, clone 74054; GenBankTM accession number T48277) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The plasmid clone was transformed and amplified in Bluescript Escherichia coli(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Valencia, CA). The sequence of the 5′ end of the cDNA was determined using Marathon-Ready cDNA from a liver library (CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers for hepcidin are antisense (for 5′-RACE) 5′-CCCAAGACCTATGTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCTGGCTGTCCCACTGCTGG-3′ and sense (for 3′ RACE) 5′-CATGTTCCAGAGGCGAAGG-3′. PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced using an ABI Prism DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the UCLA Sequencing Facility. The Omiga program (Oxford Molecular Co.) was used to analyze and search for potential consensus sites within the gene. The hepcidin cDNA clone and the gene-specific primers above were used in the PCR reaction to generate a 173-base pair product from a segment of the coding region. The PCR product was used to probeCLONTECH organ blot membranes as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The organ blots contained poly(A) selected human mRNA from spleen, thymus, appendix, peripheral blood leukocyte, bone marrow, fetal liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, adult liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, stomach, thyroid, spinal cord, lymph node, trachea, adrenal gland, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon. Frozen normal human liver blocks obtained from the UCLA Human Tissue Resource Center (Los Angeles, CA) were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 0.1 g of tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was separated from the total RNA preparation using a Qiagen Oligotex mRNA isolation kit. Purified poly(A) RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel (Bio-Rad) containing 3.3% formalin in 10 mm NaPO4, transferred onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and hybridized with a radioactive probe as described above. The 20- and 25-amino acid forms of hepcidin (Hepc20 and Hepc25), each of which was homogeneous by electrophoretic and mass spectrum analysis, were quantified by UV absorbance at 215 and 220 nm using the formula concentration (mg/ml) = (A 215 −A 225) × 0.144, and they were tested for antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains (E. coliML35p, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus) and yeast (Candida albicans) in a CFU assay as described previously (11Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Culture densities were measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm for bacterial strains and at 450 nm for yeast and then resuspended to a final concentration of 106 CFU/ml. AnA 620 reading of 0.2 corresponds to 107 CFU/ml for the staphylococcal and streptococcal strains and 5 × 107 CFU/ml for E. coli. AnA 450 reading of 1.0 is equivalent to 2.86 × 107 CFU/ml for C. albicans. The organisms were incubated with various concentrations of peptide at 37 °C with constant shaking for 1, 3, and 24 h. Surviving microbes were plated in triplicate on trypticase soy broth plates (Microdiagnostic Products Inc., Lombard, IL) using a spiral plating system (Spiral Biotech, Bethesda, MD). In some experiments, the assay medium was supplemented with 100 mm NaCl to mimic higher salt conditions characteristic of blood plasma. The two human clinical isolates of filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus andAspergillus niger used in this assay were a generous gift from Dr. Dexter Howard (UCLA Department of Microbiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Spores were harvested as described previously (15Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar). The glycerol stocks of spores from each strain were utilized in a spectrophotometric germination assay as follows: spores were diluted to a concentration of 1.25 × 104 /ml in culture medium (half-strength potato dextrose broth (BBL), 10 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml cefotaxime (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eighty μl of each spore suspension was placed in sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY), and 20 μl of peptide or peptide diluent (water) was added to yield a final spore concentration of 104 /ml. The plate was incubated at 30 °C in a humidified chamber in the dark. Germination was microscopically monitored for the appearance of hyphae using a light microscope. After 48 h, the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a SpectraMAX250 EIA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To test for activity in high salt conditions, the assay medium was supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. To determine whether the effect of hepcidin was fungicidal or fungistatic, spores were incubated in the presence of Hepc20 and Hepc25 at the highest concentrations necessary to inhibit germination as described above. After 48 h at 30 °C, the well contents were transferred to sterile microfuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant containing the peptides was removed, and the spore pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fresh media and transferred into a new 96-well plate. The spores were incubated for an additional 48 h at 30 °C and then analyzed for germination as described above. If no hyphae were observed, then the effect of hepcidin was judged to be fungicidal. K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection leukemic cell line CCL-243) were cultured in RPMI 1640 withl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 48 h and then washed and resuspended to 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 media. A volume of 50 μl of cells was aliquoted into sterile flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY). Various concentrations of 10× peptide stocks were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 12–16 h. Viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Peptide synthesis reagents including Fmoc amino acids (AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA) and coupling solvents (PE Biosystems, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to synthesize Hepc20 peptide on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using double coupling for all residues. The scale of synthesis was 0.25 mmol using a FastMocTM strategy (16Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) with PS-PEG resin (PE Perceptive Biosystems, Connecticut Path, MA). After cleavage, the crude synthetic peptide (sHEP) was resuspended in reducing buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.02 mEDTA, and 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.07) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (w/v), homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated in a 50 °C sonicating water bath for 30 min. The resuspended peptide was reduced by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.01 m, overlaying with N2gas, and then incubating in a 50 °C water bath overnight. The reduced peptide was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted with 15% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 40% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 40% ACN fraction was lyophilized and then further purified by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using the same gradient program as described above in purification of the native peptide from urine. The major peak was lyophilized, resuspended to 0.03 mg/ml with distilled H2O, adjusted to pH 7.5 with ammonium hydroxide, and then air-oxidized in an open vessel at room temperature with stirring for 18 h. The refolded peptide was then purified on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge followed by RP-HPLC as described for the reduced peptide. Cationic proteins were extracted from urine using a weak cation exchange resin and then further purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1), and hepcidin peaks were identified by characteristically migrating bands in Coomassie Blue-stained acid-urea PAGE. The fractions corresponding to the hepcidin peptides eluted between 24% and 30% acetonitrile. The identity of each peptide in peaks A andB of Fig. 1 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and amino acid sequencing. The peptides were 20 and 25 amino acids long (Hepc20 and Hepc25, respectively) and differed by amino-terminal truncation but preserved the cysteine-rich domain (Fig.2). Mass analysis identified the peptide in peak C of Fig. 1 as the 22-amino acid form (Hepc22). The mass data (Table I) indicate that all 8 cysteine residues are connected by disulfide bonds. In urine, Hepc20 and Hepc25 are the major forms, whereas Hepc22 is a minor species. Collectively, the concentration of hepcidin ranges between 10 and 30 μg/liter (4–12 nm) in urine from normal donors. The remaining large peaks visible in Fig. 1 had previously been identified as variably amino-terminal-truncated forms of another antimicrobial peptide, human β-defensin-1 (11Valore E.V. Park C.H.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).Figure 2Amino acid sequence of hepcidin and proposed cysteine connectivity. Purified hepcidin was carboxymethylated and then sequenced by Edman degradation. The three processed forms differ by amino-terminal truncation as denoted by arrows. The proposed cysteine linkage pattern is 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, and 5-6, as shown.

Membranes preloaded with human organ tissue poly(A) selected mRNA were probed with a 173-base pair probe generated by PCR from the cDNA clone. mRNA was found to be highly expressed in fetal and adult liver, with a much lower signal detected in the heart and spinal cord (Fig.4). A fourth membrane loaded with prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon was also probed, but no signal was detected (data not shown). A weak mRNA signal corresponding to 2.37 kilobases was seen in fetal and adult liver and spinal cord but was not further analyzed. Although the peptide was found in the urine, the mRNA was not detectable in the kidney or the bladder. A search of the protein data base revealed no sequence homology to any known peptides. Using the primary sequence of the peptide, the BLAST (tblastn) nucleic acid search program of the human EST data base identified a cDNA clone that spans the region of the peptide from Asp40 to Thr84(I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 74054; DNA GenBankTMaccession number T48277; EST yb44e08) (17Hillier L.D. Lennon G. Becker M. Bonaldo M.F. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N. DuBuque T. Favello A. Gish W. Hawkins M. Hultman M. Kucaba T. Lacy M. Le M. Le N. Mardis E. Moore B. Morris M. Parsons J. Prange C. Rifkin L. Rohlfing T. Schellenberg K. Marra M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). An identical genomic sequence match was found on human chromosome 19 (GenBankTMaccession number AD000684; locus CH19R30879). In addition, a search of EST data bases found matches to cDNA sequences from the liver of pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig.5). All of the matches are to peptides that have yet to be isolated and characterized. The similarity is strongest in the region that corresponds to the peptides isolated from urine, namely, residues Arg55 to Thr84. The PCR products of the 5′ RACE reaction were sequenced and compared with the genomic sequence (Fig.6). The mRNA, 0.4 kilobase in length (GenBankTM accession numbers AAG23966 for cDNA and P81172 for the corresponding hepcidin precursor), matched the estimated size on the Northern blot. The gene consists of three exons and two introns, and the third exon encodes the sequence of the peptides found in urine. The putative unprocessed peptide encoded by all three exons would be 84 amino acid residues long. A potential signal-peptide cleavage site between Gly24 and Ser25 would generate a 60-amino acid propeptide species. Consensus sites for myristylation sites and phosphorylation sites occur on Gly44 and Thr24, respectively. In addition, a potential furin cleavage site is found at Arg59 (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J.

Since our initial studies, additional human EST sequences have appeared in the GenBankTM data bases (GenBankTMaccession numbers AI937227, AI829866, and AI797446) with minor sequence variations in the noncoding regions. The colony-forming unit assay (19Porter E.M. van Dam E. Valore E.V. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of purified hepcidin forms against various microbial strains. In the initial screen, all the strains were tested against 30 μm Hepc20 and Hepc25 (Hepc22 was not tested because it is present in small concentrations in the urine). Both peptides were antimicrobial against E. coliML35p and, to a lesser extent, against S. epidermidis,S. aureus, C. albicans, and group BStreptococcus, but both were inactive againstPseudomonas aeruginosa (Fig.7). A dose-response CFU assay performed against E. coli and S. epidermidis showed that both hepcidin peptides were microbicidal at the highest concentration of 30 μm against both strains (data not shown). In this assay and in the initial screen, Hepc20 was more active than Hepc25; however, both peptides were inhibited by the addition of 100 mm NaCl to the assay mixture. Spores of two human pathogenic strains of A. fumigatus and A. niger were subjected to a germination assay (Fig.8). Hepc20 was more potent than Hepc25 against both strains. Hepc20 was antifungal against A. niger, where no hyphae were detected after 48 h at 20 μm, but 40 μm was required against the more resistant strain, A. fumigatus. Hepc25 only retarded spore germination in A. niger at the highest concentration of 40 μm and was ineffective against A. fumigatus at the same concentration. Neither peptide was active in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. We assessed fungicidal activity by following germination after removal of the antifungal peptides and additional incubation in fresh media. No germination was observed after 48 h. At the highest concentrations, Hepc20 was fungicidal against both strains, as indicated by the lack of spore germination in fresh medium. Hepc25 did not exhibit fungicidal activity at any concentration used in this assay. To test for cytotoxic effects of hepcidin, K562 cells were assessed for viability after incubation with Hepc20 and Hepc25, using trypan blue as an indicator of membrane integrity. At the highest concentration of 30 μm, cells incubated for 15 h in the presence of Hepc20 or Hepc25 were 88% and 74% viable, respectively. When cells were treated with 30 μmhuman α-defensin HNP-1, only 9% viable cells remained at the end of the incubation period. Thus, hepcidin is not cytotoxic at a concentration that is ∼3000-fold higher than that found in the urine. Crude synthetic material was completely reduced with DTT and purified by RP-HPLC. The major HPLC peaks were analyzed by AU-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. As expected, the peptide migrated more slowly upon reduction. The gain of 8 Da corresponding to eight additional hydrogen atoms in MALDI-MS confirmed that the synthetic peptide was completely reduced. The reduced peptide was refolded by air oxidation and compared with the native peptide. The synthetic Hepc20 had identical AU-PAGE migration, eluted identically in C18 RP-HPLC, and had an identical electrospray mass and antimicrobial activity against E. coliin a CFU assay compared with native Hepc20. We report here the first member of a new vertebrate family of small antimicrobial peptides that contain 8 cysteine residues and are active against both bacteria and fungi. Hepcidin mRNA encodes a larger precursor and is found primarily in the liver, but the peptides were first discovered in and isolated from urine. The native peptide was purified from human urine by cation exchange chromatography and RP-HPLC and characterized by amino acid sequencing, MALDI-TOF-MS, and CD spectroscopy. The human hepcidin forms, 2–3 kDa in size, have an overall charge of +3 at neutral pH and are only 20–25 amino acids in length (8 of these amino acids are cysteine residues (∼30% cysteine)). Mass spectrometry data confirm all 8 cysteines to be engaged in four intramolecular disulfide bonds. The symmetric arrangement of pairs of cysteines around a cationic segment (HRSK) resembles that of antimicrobial protegrins and tachyplesins, peptides that have a two-strand β-sheet structure stabilized by interstrand disulfide bonds. Based on this similarity and on preliminary molecular models, we propose the following cysteine connectivity pattern: 1-4, 2-8, 3-7, and 5-6 (Fig. 2). This arrangement of disulfide bonds exhibits three possible β-turns and provides a fold with the least steric hindrance among the side chains. The proposed disulfide connectivity pattern makes the hepcidin structure similar to the “cystine knot” class of antimicrobial peptides (20Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cDNA structure suggests that the peptide is translated as an 84-amino acid prepropeptide that is amino-terminally processed to the 20- to 25-amino acid peptide (Fig. 6). A strong consensus sequence (score = 16.45 using the PC Gene program) for a signal sequence cleavage site is located between Gly24 and Ser25 that would produce a 60-residue propeptide. Another likely processing site is carboxyl-terminal to Arg59, a consensus site for the subtilisin/kexin family of mammalian propeptide processing enzymes (propeptide convertases) with a preference for cleavage after the paired basic residues Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg. Among other functions, the propeptide convertases cleave propeptides to generate one or more bioactive peptides from a single precursor (18Wise R.J. Barr P.J. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J.

The abundance of propeptide convertases in the liver may explain our inability to isolate the larger propeptide from native sources (liver tissue, bile, and blood serum). The small size of hepcidin, its conservation between animal species, and its compact folding pattern may account for our difficulties in producing a useful antibody. A search of the protein data base revealed no homology to hepcidin in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, searching the EST data base revealed liver cDNA homologues in pig, rat, mouse, flounder, and the long-jawed mudsucker (Fig. 5). All 8 cysteine residues are conserved with particularly strong sequence similarity in residues 60–84 that encompass the processed forms isolated from the urine. It is noteworthy that the putative propeptide convertase cleavage sites are also conserved. In humans, the paired basic residues are Arg-Arg, whereas the other homologues have the same recognition sequence or an alternative recognition sequence of Lys-Arg. It is possible that if the proregion is cleaved from the precursor as a single peptide, it could also have a biological function. To test this possibility, the proregion (Ser25-Arg59) was synthesized, and an antibody reactive with the synthetic peptide was produced (Research Genetics). Preliminary data utilizing the synthetic propiece peptide have shown that it exhibits an antibacterial activity equally potent to that of Hepc20 and Hepc25 (data not shown). However, a Western blot analysis capable of detecting 500 ng of the synthetic peptide did not detect the propiece peptide in cationic extracts of urine, serum, liver extract, and bile (data not shown), making it unlikely that this form is stable and abundant. Acid liver extracts did contain a peptide with a mass identical to Hepc25 that eluted at the same acetonitrile concentration as Hepc25 from urine. While this study was under review, we noted an interim report that an antimicrobial peptide identical to Hepc25, LEAP-1, was isolated from human plasma ultrafiltrate (22Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The presence of Hepc25 in ultrafiltrate suggests that the peptide originating in the liver reaches the kidney in blood plasma. Hepcidin may be the functional homologue of the insect defensin-like peptide drosomycin. Hepcidin is expressed in human liver, whereas drosomycin is found in the fat body (the liver equivalent) ofDrosophila; both peptides have four disulfide bonds, and both are potent antifungal peptides. In parallel studies, Pigeonet al. 2Pigeon, C., Ilyin, G., Courselaud, B., Leroyer, P., Turlin, B., Brissot, P., and Loreal, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,7811–7819 identified a murine hepcidin as a hepatic mRNA inducible in vivo by iron overload and lipopolysaccharide. The ability of lipopolysaccharide to increase hepcidin mRNA in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes is consistent with the proposed role of hepcidin in inflammation and host defense. Like hepcidin, drosomycin is expressed constitutively but is also inducible upon microbial challenge. Like drosomycin, both Hepc20 and Hepc25 forms inhibit spore germination in the two pathogenic strains of Aspergillus tested. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether hepcidin, like the cysteine-rich antimicrobial defensins (23Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M.

By suppressive subtractive hybridization performed between livers from carbonyl iron-overloaded and control mice, we isolated a 225-base pair cDNA. By Northern blot analysis, the corresponding mRNA was confirmed to be overexpressed in livers of experimentally (carbonyl iron and iron-dextran-treated mice) and spontaneously (β2-microglobulin knockout mice) iron-overloaded mice. In addition, β2-microglobulin knockout mice fed with a low iron content diet exhibited a decrease of hepatic mRNA expression. The murine full-length cDNA was isolated and was found to encode an 83-amino acid protein presenting a strong homology in its C-terminal region to the human antimicrobial peptide hepcidin. In addition, we cloned the corresponding rat and human orthologue cDNAs. Both mouse and human genes named HEPC are constituted of 3 exons and 2 introns and are located on chromosome 7 and 19, respectively, in close proximity toUSF2 gene. In mouse and human, HEPC mRNA was predominantly expressed in the liver. During both in vivo and in vitro studies, HEPC mRNA expression was enhanced in mouse hepatocytes under the effect of lipopolysaccharide. Finally, to analyze the intracellular localization of the predicted protein, we used the green fluorescent protein chimera expression vectors. The murine green fluorescent protein-prohepcidin protein was exclusively localized in the nucleus. When the putative nuclear localization signal was deleted, the resulting protein was addressed to the cytoplasm. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the product of the new liver-specific gene HEPCmight play a specific role during iron overload and exhibit additional functions distinct from its antimicrobial activity.AF297664AF309489AF344185 Considering that the development of hepatic lesions related to iron overload diseases might be a result of abnormally expressed hepatic genes, we searched for new genes up-regulated under the condition of iron excess.

Genetic hemochromatosis is characterized by digestive hyperabsorption of iron. In 1996, Feder et al. (1Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo Jr., R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A. Hinton L.M. Jones N.L. Kimmel B.E. Kronmal G.S. Lauer P. Lee V.K. Loeb D.B. Mapa F.A. McClelland E. Meyer N.C. Mintier G.A. Moeller N. Moore T. Morikang E. Stranes S.M.

Genet. 1996; 13: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar) reported that the C282Y mutation of HFE gene was responsible for this disease. Other iron overload diseases include β-thalassemias, genetic diseases characterized by hemolytic anemia, in which iron overload results both from digestive hyperabsorption of iron and blood transfusions (2Risdon R.A. Barry M. Flynn D.M. J. Pathol. 1975; 116: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Olivieri N.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that iron excess may occur in chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic liver diseases (4Fletcher L.M. Halliday J.W. Powell L.W. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1999; 14: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or hepatitis B and C infections (5Olynyk J.K. Reddy K.R. Di, Bisceglie A.M. Jeffers L.J. Parker T.I. Radick J.L. Schiff E.R.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For these various diseases, clinical data suggest that iron excess favors the development of hepatic lesions likely due to the preponderant role of the liver in iron storage. This is particularly true in untreated genetic hemochromatosis in which many authors demonstrated a relationship between the increase in liver iron concentration and the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (7Niederau C.

Hepatol. 1999; 30: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, additional elements involved in iron metabolism have been characterized as follows: (i) HFE potentially modulating iron absorption by its interaction with transferrin receptor (13Eisenstein R.S. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Feder J.N. Penny D.M. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Lebron J.A. Watson N. Tsuchihashi Z. Sigal E. Bjorkman P.J. Schatzman R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar); (ii) Nramp2 (also named DCT1 or DMT1) involved in iron uptake at the apex of the enterocyte (15Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar, 16Canonne-Hergaux F. Gruenheid S. Ponka P. Gros P. Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) transferrin receptor 2 involved in hepatic iron uptake (17Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar); (iv) hephaestin, implicated in iron transfer from enterocyte to the plasma (18Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), and frataxin which play a role in the mitochondrial iron metabolism (19Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, molecular mechanisms leading to hepatic iron overload remain poorly understood. In addition, molecular mechanisms involved in the development of iron-related lesions of the liver are not well known. However, it is clear that modulation of hepatic gene expression, related directly or indirectly to iron excess, takes place during the development of hepatic lesions. Several specific mRNAs are known to be modulated by the iron amount of the liver. Thus, transferrin receptor mRNA, presenting an iron-responsive element (IRE),1 is repressed during iron overload. Moreover, even if not yet fully demonstrated, genes containing an IRE in their 3′-untranslated region may be good candidates to be repressed by iron excess in the liver. This is especially the case for Nramp2 (15Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar) and glycolate oxidase (20Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 1997; 26: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), encoding two proteins potentially involved in the development of liver fibrosis, are both induced by hepatic iron excess. Other mRNAs, such as γ-glutamyltransferase (27Brown K.E. Kinter M.T. Oberley T.D. Freeman M.L. Frierson H.F. Ridnour L.A. Tao Y. Oberley L.W. Spitz D.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and heme oxygenase 1 (28Montosi G. Garuti C. Martinelli S. Pietrangelo A. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which are involved in oxidative stress, were also found to be up-regulated in the liver by high amounts of iron. Since only a few genes have been reported to be abnormally expressed in the liver when iron is in excess, it became evident that identification of new hepatic genes up-regulated by iron would be helpful for a better understanding of mechanisms leading to iron overload and/or liver injury. The aim of our work was to identify new genes positively regulated by iron. For this purpose, we used the previously described carbonyl iron overload mouse model (29Pigeon C. Turlin B. Iancu T.C. Leroyer P. Le Lan J. Deugnier Y. Brissot P. Loréal O. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 926-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We performed a suppressive subtractive hybridization between cDNAs obtained from the liver of 3% carbonyl iron-overloaded and control mice. This methodology allows for the analysis of differential gene expression in two different conditions (30Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). It has already been shown to be useful for identifying the up-regulation of complement C4 in hepatic stellate cells issued from rats overloaded by carbonyl iron (31Fimmel C.J. Brown K.E. O'Neill R. Kladney R.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2601-2609PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, this technology enabled the characterization and the identification of IREG1, an iron transporter for which expression was up-regulated under the conditions of increased iron absorption in the duodenum (32McKie A.T. Marciani P. Rolfs A. Brennan K. Wehr K. Barrow D. Miret S. Bomford A. Peters T.J. Farzaneh F. Hediger M.A. Hentze M.W. Simpson R.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). By using this method, we were able to isolate and characterize a novel gene strongly induced in the liver of iron overloaded mice. 5-Week-old BALB/cJ male mice purchased from CERJ (Le Genet St. Ile, France) were used for experimental iron overload (carbonyl iron and iron-dextran). For liver perfusion, BALB/cJ mice and 10-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were used. C57 BL/6 β2-microglobulin (−/−) male mice, 8 weeks old, developing spontaneous iron overload (33De, Sousa M. Reimao R. Lacerda R. Hugo P. Kaufmann S.H.E. Porto G. Immunology. 1994; 39: 105-111Google Scholar, 34Santos M. Clevers H. de Sousa M. Marx J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from CDTA (Orleans, France). Wild type mice C57 BL/6 littermates were used as controls. Another group of C57 BL/6 β2-microglobulin (−/−) male mice from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) was used for performing the iron deprivation experiment. All these animals were maintained in accordance to French law and regulations in a temperature- and light-controlled environment. They were given free access to tap water and food. Iron overload was performed as described previously (29Pigeon C. Turlin B. Iancu T.C. Leroyer P. Le Lan J. Deugnier Y. Brissot P. Loréal O. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 926-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were iron-overloaded by 0.5, 1.5, and 3% carbonyl iron supplemented in the diet (AO3, UAR, France) for 8 months. Control mice have a carbonyl iron-free diet. For 3% carbonyl iron-overloaded mice, liver iron concentration was on average 10-fold higher than the control value (115 μmol of iron/g of dry weight liver versus 10 μmol, respectively). Liver iron concentration increased 4- and 2-fold, respectively, over the control values for 1.5 and 0.5% carbonyl iron-overloaded mice after 8 months. To study mRNA expression during early stages of iron overload, 3% carbonyl iron was given for only 2 months. Results were compared with mice overloaded by 3% carbonyl iron for 8 months. A single subcutaneous injection of iron-dextran was performed at the dose of 1 g of iron/kg of body weight (Sigma, France) according to Carthew et al. (35Carthew P. Edwards E.R. Smith A.G. Dorman B. Francis J.E. Hepatology. 1990; 13: 534-539Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Control mice were injected with a mixture containing dextran and phenol at the same concentration as in iron-dextran solution. Animals, fed with an AO3 diet (UAR, France), were sacrificed 2 months later. In another experiment, a time-dependent iron overload was performed, and animals were sacrificed 1–4 and 8 weeks after the iron-dextran injection. β2-Microglobulin-deficient and the corresponding control mice, 8 weeks old, were fed with 113 diet (UAR, France) for 12 months and then sacrificed. Ten β2-microglobulin-deficient mice, 11 weeks old, were used to study the effect of iron depletion on HEPC mRNA expression. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given a low iron diet (UAR, France; 13 mg/kg). The control group was given a similar food containing 230 mg of iron/kg. Mice were sacrificed 2 months later. Liver iron concentration (LIC) was evaluated biochemically according to the method of Barry and Sherlock (36Barry M. Sherlock S. Lancet. 1971; 2: 100-103Abstract PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) on liver specimens that have been previously fixed in 4% formalin. Total RNAs were extracted from liquid nitrogen-frozen tissue specimens using SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). For suppressive subtractive hybridization, poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated separately from livers of 4 mice overloaded with 3% of carbonyl iron for 8 months and from 4 control mice using Invitrogen's FastTract kit (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). mRNAs were then pooled per each group of mice. Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed between control and iron-overloaded group mice according to the manufacturer's instructions using “PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit” (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (30Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The subtractive product, corresponding to overexpressed genes in condition of iron excess, was recovered by PCR. Iron-induced cDNAs were cloned into pCRII vector using a T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). Each cDNA was sequenced using Thermosequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with α-33P-radiolabeled dideoxynucleotides (1500 Ci/mmol). Samples were analyzed on a 5% urea-polyacrylamide gel. Nucleic and amino acid homology searches were performed using the BLAST program (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were loaded on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized with the cDNA of interest labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (RediprimeTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal mRNA loading was estimated by methylene blue staining or hybridization with 553-bp mouse cytoskeletal β-actin cDNA probe generated by RT-PCR using following oligonucleotides: 5′-TGTGCTGTCCCTGTATGCCT-3′ and 5′-TAGGAGCCAGAGCAGTAATC-3′. Mouse albumin cDNA probe was a 297-bp fragment obtained by SSH. A 5′ stretch cDNA library (CLONTECH) derived from BALB/cJ liver was screened with the [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled 225-bp cDNA obtained by SSH to isolate the full-length murine cDNA. The final isolated 410-bp cDNA was sequenced in both strands. Rat and human orthologue cDNAs were generated, respectively, by RT-PCR from rat liver and human hepatoma HepG2 mRNAs using the following primers: 5′-CACGAGGGCAGGACAGAAGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CAAGGTCATTGCTGGGGTAGGACAG-3′ for rat cDNA and 5′-GACTGTCACTCGGTCCCAGACACCAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCAGGAATAAATAAGGAAGGG-3′ for the human cDNA. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, PCRs were set out as follow: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. All cDNAs were then cloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and were sequenced. The mouse genomic clone CT7-8N15 and the human genomic cloneR30879 (GenBankTM accession numbers AC020841 and AD000684, respectively) were used to elucidate the genomic organization of the mouse and human HEPC genes by sequence comparison with the mouse and human cDNAs. Search for transcription binding sites was performed using MatInspector (38Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Total mRNA was isolated from the following 8-week old BALB/cJ mice tissues: liver, stomach, duodenum, intestine, ileum, colon, lungs, kidneys, brain, heart, testis, ovaries, thymus, pancreas, bladder, muscle, uterus, and bone marrow, and subjected to Northern blot analysis using the murine 225-bp cDNA as a probe. The expression pattern of the human mRNA was analyzed by RNA blot assay using multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH), a membrane to which poly(A)+ RNAs from different fetal and adult human tissues and cell lines have been immobilized in separate dots. Hybridization was carried out in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) in the presence of32P-labeled human-specific cDNA probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hepatocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation from the liver of normal BALB/cJ mice or Sprague-Dawley rat according to Guguenet al. (39Guguen C. Guillouzo A. Boisnard M. Le Cam A. Bourel M. Biol. Gastroenterol. 1975; 8: 223-231PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after cannulation of the portal vein, the liver was perfused with calcium-free Hepes buffer (0.33 mm, pH 7.6) for 5 min for the mouse and 15 min for the rat. Then the liver was perfused with Hepes buffer (0.33 mm, pH 7.6) containing collagenase 0.025% and calcium chloride (0.075%) for 8 min and delivered at 10 ml/min for the mouse and 30 ml/min for the rat. After enzymatic digestion, hepatocytes were obtained by sedimentation (20 min) and then by centrifugation (700 rpm; 1 min) in a Leibovitz medium (Eurobio, France). The supernatant corresponding to the sedimentation step of rat or mouse hepatocytes was centrifuged (1400 rpm; 4 min) to obtain enriched hepatic non-parenchymal cell fraction as adapted from Doolittle and Richter (40Doolittle R.L. Richter G.W. Lab. Invest. 1981; 45: 558-566PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of contaminating hepatocytes evaluated by light microscopy (hepatocytes are bigger cells than non-parenchymal cells) was lower than 5%. Freshly isolated non-parenchymal cells and hepatocytes were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen before total RNA extraction. Mouse hepatocytes have been seeded in a mixture of minimum essential medium (75%) and M199 (25%) (Eurobio, France) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 30 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mg/ml bovine albumin serum, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Four hours later, medium was renewed by an identical medium containing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, 5 × 10−5 or 1 × 10−6m. The day after, hepatocytes have been maintained in the same medium supplemented or not with 10% FCS. Thereafter, hepatocytes were maintained in culture for 2 or 4 days. The medium was renewed every day. In addition, we used human HepG2 (41Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) rat FAO (42Wiebel F.J.

Brinster J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 139: 599-609Google Scholar). During the first 24 h, hepatocytes were maintained under conditions identical to those described previously. The next day, the culture medium was changed by a similar medium devoid of FCS and supplemented with 1 × 10−6mhydrocortisone hemisuccinate. Iron exposure was performed by the addition of citrate-iron (5 and 10 μm of iron) in the medium according to the procedure of Azari and Baugh (44Azari P. Baugh R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 118: 128-144Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We chose iron-citrate for performing iron exposure because it is a physiologic form of iron that is found in the serum of hemochromatic patients (45Grootveld M. Bell J.D. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Sadler P.J. J. Biol.

The ratio was 1/10 for iron as compared with citrate. Control cultures were incubated in the absence or in the presence of citrate alone (50 and 100 μm). Iron depletion was performed by addition of desferrioxamine (DFO, Ciba Geigy) at the concentration of 10 μm (48Trinder D. Batey R.G. Morgan E.H. Baker E. Am. J.

All the cultures were maintained for 2 days. A similar experiment was performed except that the culture medium was supplemented with 10% FCS. For in vivo experiments, 5-week-old mice BALB/cJ mice were used. LPS (Westphal preparation from Escherichia coli055:B5; Sigma) was given intraperitoneally in 0.2 ml of sterile, pyrogen-free saline (0.9% NaCl) at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg to mice fasted overnight (50Rizzardini M. Zappone M. Villa P. Gnocchi P. Sironi M. Diomede L. Meazza C. Monshouwer M. Cantoni L. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed 90 min later, and their livers were frozen in liquid nitrogen. For in vitroexperiments, the primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes, maintained in absence of FCS, were exposed to LPS (20 μg/ml diluted in pyrogen-free saline, 0.9% NaCl) for 24 h according to Griffonet al. (51Griffon B. Cillard J. Chevanne M. Morel I. Cillard P. Sergent O. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cDNA containing the entire open reading frame of prohepcidin was generated by PCR using the following primers 5′-CGGGATCCGATGATGGCACTCAGCACT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTATGTTTTGCAACAGAT-3′ and full-length mouse prohepcidin cDNA as template. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) deletion mutants was constructed by two-step PCR method as described by Le Seyec et al. (52Le Seyec J. Chouteau P. Cannie I. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Gripon P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in a first step, two parallel reactions were performed using the following two sets of primers: P1, 5′-CGGGATCCGATGATGGCACTCAGCACT-3′, and P2, 5′-GATGGGGAAGTTGGTGTCTCTCTGCATTGGTATCGCAATGT-3′, for the first reaction and P3, 5′-ACATTGCGATACCAATGCAGAGAGACACCAACTTCCCCATC-3′, and P4, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTATGTTTTGCAACAGAT-3′, for the second reaction. In a second step, the two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as template for PCR amplification using P1 and P4 primers. These two PCR products corresponding to wild type and NLS-deleted mutant forms of prohepcidin were digested with BamHI andHindIII and subcloned into withBglII-HindIII digested pEGFP-C3 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The human osteosarcoma cell line U-2OS (53Ponten J. Saksela E. Int. J. Cancer. 1967; 2: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. Then these cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of protein localization was performed by fluorescence microscopy. Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Mann-Whitney test was used for estimation of statistical significance when appropriate. Ap value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SSH was performed between livers of mice overloaded by 3% of carbonyl iron during 8 months and control mice. Among clones obtained, we isolated a 225-bp cDNA presumably overexpressed under the condition of iron overload. By using this cDNA as a probe, we studied the expression of the corresponding mRNA in the liver of mice overloaded with carbonyl iron during 8 months and in the liver of control mice. As presented in Fig. 1, the size of mRNA hybridizing with the cDNA probe was about 500 bp. The amount of this mRNA was increased in a dose-dependent manner by the carbonyl iron treatment. Its expression was 9.8-fold higher (p< 0.01) in the liver of 3% carbonyl iron-overloaded mice compared with the control mice. This overexpression was confirmed in a second independent experiment where mice have been overloaded with 3% carbonyl iron for 8 months (8.6 times; p < 0.05) (data not shown). To obtain a full-length clone, we screened a mouse liver cDNA library with the 225-bp probe obtained by SSH. The isolated cDNA fragment was 410 bp in len"

The most common manifestation of borreliosis is erythema migrans near the initial site of a tick bite. This can be followed by a complex of cardiac, neurological, or arthritic disorders (1Burgdorfer W. Barbour A.G. Hayes S.F. Benach J.L. Grunwaldt E. Davis J.P.

The three main genospecies of B. burgdorferi can present with somewhat different clinical manifestations: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto often causes arthritis, Borrelia gariniineuroborreliosis, and Borrelia afzelii has been preferentially associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (3Nadelman R.B.

Neurol. 1998; 245: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A striking feature of B. burgdorferi is that it persists for long periods in its mammal host as well as in several species of ticks of the genus Ixodes, which transmit the bacteria between the different mammals. The prolonged survival indicates that the spirochetes are capable of effectively evading the host immune mechanisms. During the different stages of its life cycle,Borrelia shows dramatic changes in the expression of its surface proteins (5Batsford S. Rust C. Neubert U. J. Infect.

It has been shown that many of the of borrelial surface proteins raise an antibody response in the human host and in animal models (7Akin E. McHugh G.L. Flavell R.A. Fikrig E. Steere A.C. Infect.

Recently developed Lyme disease vaccines use either the outer surface protein A (OspA) (10Sigal L.H. Zahradnik J.M. Lavin P. Patella S.J. Bryant G. Haselby R. Hilton E. Kunkel M. Adler-Klein D.

OspA is mainly expressed while the spirochetes persist in the tick and the expression of OspA is already down-regulated when the pathogen is transmitted to the human host. The OspA vaccine leads to a 70–90% protection (10Sigal L.H. Zahradnik J.M. Lavin P. Patella S.J. Bryant G. Haselby R. Hilton E. Kunkel M. Adler-Klein D. Doherty T. Evans J. Molloy P.J. Seidner A.L.

In an optimal situation, antibodies against vaccine proteins would neutralize important virulence factors on the surface of the spirochetes. The physiological roles of most of the borrelial antigens are yet unknown. However, the recently deciphered genome sequence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto serves as a basis also for functional studies (14Fraser C.M. Casjens S. Huang W.M. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. Lathigra R. White O. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R. Hickey E.K. Gwinn M. Dougherty B. Tomb J.F. Fleischmann R.D. Richardson D. Peterson J. Kerlavage A.R. Quackenbush J. Salzberg S. Hanson M. van Vugt R. Palmer N.

The complement (C)1 system is an important effector system of the innate immunity in the first line of defense against invading microbes. C activation is a major mechanism whereby the spirochetes become coated by opsonizing molecules (C1q, C3b, iC3b) after entering the human host. This may be initiated by antibodies or antibody-independently via direct activation of the classical or the alternative C pathway. Assembly of the C membrane attack complex usually leads to lysis of Gram-negative bacteria, unless the microbes have a means to escape the attack. Several factors may be involved in the interplay betweenBorrelia bacteria and their different hosts. Recent studies support the importance of the C system before and during the infection. The tick Ixodes scapularis expresses a complement-regulatory protein in its saliva, which down-regulates C activation at an early stage in the midgut of the tick (16Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18717-18723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The spirochetes may benefit from the protective effect of this protein, first, after the tick's blood meal when the spirochetes are still in the tick but already in contact with human plasma, and second, when the pathogens in the tick saliva enter the human body. However, at least after the transmission of the pathogen to the human host and dissemination of Borreliaefrom the site of infection, the spirochetes must cope with the powerful effects of the human C system. The three main subspecies of theB. burgdorferi sensu lato complex have been tested for their sensitivity to serum complement-mediated bacteriolysis. AlthoughB. garinii strains were considered serum-sensitive, theB. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains were resistant or partially resistant with no effective deposition of the terminal complement complexes on the pathogen surface (17Breitner-Ruddock S. Würzner R. Schulze J. Brade V. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 185: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18van Dam A.P. Oei A. Jaspars R. Fijen C. Wilske B. Spanjaard L. Dankert J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogously, differences in complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis of the different Borrelia subspecies have been observed. In an assay dependent on an interaction between iC3b and the integrin CD11b/CD18 (CR3, Mac-1), neutrophils showed a strong response to serum-opsonized B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (19Suhonen J. Hartiala K. Tuominen-Gustafsson H. Viljanen M.K. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An important mechanism of complement activation is the alternative pathway (AP). The AP is unique in its spontaneous initiation and the random nature of C3b deposition on target structures. The latter leads to an attack against all particles, membranes, and cells that are not specifically protected against AP activation (20Pangburn M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to direct activation, the AP can enhance C activation initiated by the classical or the lectin pathway. Complement activation via AP is strictly controlled by a number of membrane-bound proteins on host cell surfaces and by the fluid phase regulators factor H and its truncated form factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) (21Liszewski M.K. Farries T.C. Lublin D.M. Rooney I.A. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 201-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Factor H is composed of 20 and FHL-1 of seven short consensus repeat (SCR) domains. Factor H and FHL-1 control AP activation in three ways. They (i) act as cofactors for the serine protease factor I in the cleavage of C3b; (ii) accelerate the decay of the AP C3 convertase, C3bBb, which promotes the amplification of complement activation by cleaving C3 into its active form C3b; and (iii) compete with factor B for binding to C3b and thus prevent formation of the AP C3 convertase (23Whaley K. Ruddy S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1147-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 24Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp.

Zipfel P.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, increasing interest has been focused on the interactions between microbial surface proteins and human complement regulators. Exploitation of C inhibitors of the host could be an efficient mechanism whereby the microbes could avoid both direct C attack and C-mediated enhancement of the adaptive immune response (27Rautemaa R. Meri S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Lindahl G. Sjobring U. Johnsson E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether B. burgdorferi spirochetes can protect themselves against complement attack by direct binding of the complement regulator factor H to a ligand on their outer surface. We analyzed the binding of factor H to different subspecies of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. After observing factor H binding to the outer membrane ofB. burgdorferi sensu stricto, we identified the outer surface protein E (OspE) as a specific ligand for factor H. The addition of soluble OspE inhibited the binding of factor H toBorrelia and promoted killing of Borrelia in human serum. The binding site of factor H for Borrelia was located on the C-terminal part of the molecule. Binding of factor H to OspE may help Borreliae to evade C-mediated opsonophagocytosis and direct killing. Plasma proteins factor H and C3b were purified from human plasma as described previously (29Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human C5 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant proteins FHL-1 (representing the N-terminal seven SCRs of factor H plus four unique additional amino acids), SCRs 8–20 and SCR 15–20 of factor H, factor H-related proteins FHR-3 and FHR-4, and a construct SCR 1–4 of FHR-3 were expressed with the baculovirus expression system as described previously (31Kühn S.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Borrelial strains B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbia), isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a Finnish neuroborreliosis patient, B. afzelii(BaA91, 1082) and B. garinii (Bg13, -28, -40, -46, and -50), isolated from skin biopsies of Finnish patients with erythema migrans, were kindly provided by Matti Viljanen (National Public Health Institute, Turku, Finland). The B. afzelii strain 570 was isolated from a tick in the Helsinki park area. The strains were identified to the species level by sequencing the PCR-amplified fragment of the flagellin gene of B. burgdorferi (36Junttila J. Peltomaa M. Soini H. Marjamaki M. Viljanen M.K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 277-base pair segment of the flagellin gene was obtained by PCR using primers FL7 (biotinylated) and FL59 (37Schmidt B. Muellegger R.R. Stockenhuber C. Soyer H.P. Hoedl S. Luger A. Kerl H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated PCR products were rendered single-stranded using streptavidin-coated Dynabeads according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin; Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway). Manual sequencing was performed by using Sanger's dideoxynucleotide chain termination method and Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) as described previously (38Soini H. Bottger E.C. Viljanen M.K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1994; 32: 2944-2947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained sequences were compared with the flagellin gene sequences of the type strains of B. afzelii Bo23 and B. garinii 387. All isolates were grown in BSK-H medium (Sigma) at 33 °C in 5% CO2atmosphere until the cultures reached the late exponential phase. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and diluted to a final bacterium concentration of 2 × 107/ml in veronal-buffered saline (VBS) or 1/3 GVB (1/3× VBS with 0.1% gelatin), and subsequently used in complement component binding experiments. The recombinant OspE protein was generated by PCR amplification of the DNA encoding the OspE protein from the AmericanB. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain N40 (39Lam T.T. Nguyen T.P. Montgomery R.R. Kantor F.S. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 290-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OspE gene was cloned into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Michael Norgard's laboratory (Dallas, TX). The recombinant GST-OspE fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5-α host cells. Briefly, a primary culture was started by inoculating a single colony from a fresh transformant plate to 50 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking overnight. The culture was diluted 1:50 to 1500 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h (until the growth reached the mid-log phase with an optical density of ∼0.6 at 600 nm). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. After an additional incubation of 3 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and sonicated. The GST-OspE fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose matrix according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant OspE was cleaved from GST with bovine thrombin (Sigma) in thrombin cleavage buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) for 3 h and then eluted with thrombin cleavage buffer. The cleaved OspE was dialyzed against 10 mm diaminopropane, pH 8.6, for 20 h. The dialyzed OspE was applied on a MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column in the same buffer and eluted by adding a gradient of NaCl to the starting buffer. The purity of the OspE protein after MonoQ purification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. OspA, OspD, and decorin-binding protein A (DbpA) were from the AmericanB. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains 297, N40, and N40, respectively. They were cloned originally in Michael Norgard's laboratory. The GST-OspD and GST-OspA fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli XL1Blue host cells. Their expression and purification were done as described for OspE. The recombinant DbpA was a hexa-His fusion protein construct expressed in E. coliDH5-α host cells, and expression was done as with OspE. DbpA, OspC, and P35/BBK32 recombinant proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the DNA encoding the predicted mature portion of these proteins from the Finnish B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain ia (Bbia). DbpA, OspC, and P35/BBK32 coding sequences were cloned into pQE-30 vectors according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). These hexa-His fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli M15 host cells. They were expressed similar to OspE. Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a chelating Sepharose Fast Flow matrix containing Ni2+ ions. The proteins were eluted from the column by increasing the amount of imidazole. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. TheBorrelia spirochetes were cultured as described above. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. garinii, or Staphylococcus aureus (used as a negative control) were used at a concentration of 2 × 107cells/ml in 1/3 × VBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin (GVB). In the binding assay, the indicated amounts of bacteria were incubated (20 min at 37 °C) with the radiolabeled factor H or FHL-1 (60,000 cpm) in a total volume of 100 μl of 1/3 GVB (33Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Koistinen V. Vaarala O. Meri S. Zipfel P.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Particle-associated factor H/FHL-1 was separated from unbound ligand by centrifuging the mixtures through 20% sucrose in 1/3 GVB. The tube was then frozen at −80 °C to avoid mixing the supernatant with the pellet. After cutting off the pellets, the binding of the factor H/FHL-1 proteins was calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity input. All experiments were performed a least in duplicate and repeated twice. For the heparin inhibition assay, the indicated amounts of low molecular weight heparin (Sigma) were added to the reaction mixture simultaneously with factor H/FHL-1. The inhibitory effects of increasing amounts of OspE (ranging from 0 to 300 μg/ml) or 300 μg of OspA (control protein) on the binding of factor H to whole B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was assayed similarly by adding the competing proteins together with125I-labeled factor H. The B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (strain ia),B. afzelii (A91), and B. garinii (46Kotarsky H. Hellwage J. Johnsson E. Skerka C. Svensson H.G. Lindahl G. Sjobring U. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3349-3354PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured as described above. Freshly harvested or frozen bacteria (6.4 × 107) were washed with GVB and incubated with serum for 2 h at 37 °C in heat-inactivated serum (control); NHS (nonimmune serum, no IgG or IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ref.40Wahlberg P. Granlund H. Nyman D. Panelius J. Seppälä I. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); or NHS supplemented with 0, 20, or 200 μg/ml (final concentration) of soluble OspE protein. Serum was added after 30 and 60 min to avoid depletion of complement components caused by blocking factor H. The final serum concentration shifted from 20% to 33% during the experiment. The surviving bacteria were counted microscopically after 2 h, and the percentage of live spirochetes was calculated. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (strain ia), B. afzelii (strain 1082), and B. garinii (strain 46) were cultured as described above. Freshly harvested (sensu stricto ia (6.4 × 107)) or frozen bacteria (B. garinii (5.4 × 109) and B. afzelii (6.4 × 109)) were washed with GVB and incubated 1:2 with nonimmune NHS or EDTA-plasma from the same donor for 60 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were washed three times with GVB and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the iC3b neoepitope (Quidel Corp., La Jolla, CA). For detection of factor H, the monoclonal antibody VIG8 (kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang Prodinger, University of Innsbruck, Austria; Refs. 32Prodinger W.M. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for specific detection of the C terminus (SCRs 19–20) of factor H was used. An unrelated B-cell lymphoma idiotype-specific AF1 antibody served as a control. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) and washed three times with GVB before adding a polyclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Alexa 488, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) used at a 1:200 dilution. The stained samples were mounted with Mowiol (42Heimer G.V. Taylor C.E. J. Clin. Pathol. 1974; 27: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and examined on an Olympus BX50 standard microscope equipped with a filter specific for fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence. The samples were photographed with a Spot RT Slider digital camera and processed with Spot RT Software 3.0 (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Protein-protein interactions were analyzed in real time by the surface plasmon resonance technique using the Biacore 2000 instrument as described recently (33Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Koistinen V.

Briefly, factor H or the recombinant borrelial surface proteins OspA, OspC, OspD, OspE, P35/BBK32, and DbpA were immobilized via a standard amine-coupling procedure to flow cells of a sensor chip (carboxylated dextran chip CM5; Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Two flow cells were activated with 35 μl of a mixture of 0.2m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide (Biacore AB). The protein to be immobilized was dialyzed against 10 mmacetate buffer (pH 4.8–5.5) and 20 μg portions (>150 μg/ml) of the proteins were injected into one of the flow cells until an appropriate level of coupling for the binding experiments (>4,000 resonance units) was reached. The other flow cell without any protein was used as a control. Unreacted groups in both flow cells were inactivated by a standard ethanolamine-HCl injection (35 μl). After the coupling procedure, the flow cells were washed thoroughly with sequential injection of 1/3 VBS, pH 7.4, and 3 m NaCl in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.6. First, the binding of a panel of Borrelia surface proteins (OspA, OspC, OspD, OspE, P35/BBK32, DbpA) to factor H was tested. The proteins were dialyzed against 1/3 VBS, and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Each ligand was injected separately to a blank control flow cell and the flow cell with factor H using a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 22 °C. The final concentrations of the fluid-phase ligands in the binding assay ranged from 125 to 200 μg/ml. In a second set of experiments, a reverse setting was used. The Borrelia surface proteins were immobilized to the sensor chip surface as described above. Factor H, recombinant deletion constructs of factor H, or factor H-related proteins (proteins which are similar but not identical to factor H; Ref. 43Zipfel P.F. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Meri S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were injected to a flow cell coated with a borrelial surface protein and to a blank channel. Binding was assayed at least in duplicate using independently prepared sensor chips. The binding of human complement regulatory proteins as one mechanism to evade complement attack and phagocytosis has been reported recently for some pathogenic organisms, likeStreptococcus pyogenes (44Horstmann R.D.

Our first aim was to investigate whether the 150-kDa factor H protein and/or its truncated 42-kDa form FHL-1, the main soluble inhibitors of the alternative pathway of complement, bind to the surfaces of the spirochete bacteria of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. To examine complement deposition and regulation on the borrelial surface, we incubated spirochetes of the three subspecies with nonimmune human serum or EDTA plasma. Complement C3 activation and inactivation to iC3b and factor H binding were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antibodies (Fig.1). With an antibody directed against an iC3b neoepitope, strong complement deposition was detected on all the three strains. This indicated that incubation of Borrelia in NHS led to complement activation on the borrelial surface. An antibody specific for the C-terminal domain SCR 19–20 of factor H (VIG8) showed strong signals for the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and forB. afzelii strains but a weaker staining for the B. garinii strain. Factor H from serum may bind to C3b deposited on the borrelial surface. In addition, the binding might have been enhanced by a specific ligand on the"
https://openalex.org/W2048398774,"Mammalian cellular responses to hypoxia include adaptive metabolic changes and a G1 cell cycle arrest. Although transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes by the hypoxia-induced transcription factor (HIF-1) has been established, the mechanism for the hypoxia-induced G1 arrest is not known. By using genetically defined primary wild-type murine embryo fibroblasts and those nullizygous for regulators of the G1/S checkpoint, we observed that the retinoblastoma protein is essential for the G1/S hypoxia-induced checkpoint, whereas p53 and p21 are not required. In addition, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is induced by hypoxia, thereby inhibiting CDK2 activity and forestalling S phase entry through retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation. Reduction or absence of p27 abrogated the hypoxia-induced G1 checkpoint, suggesting that it is a key regulator of G1/S transition in hypoxic cells. Intriguingly, hypoxic induction of p27 appears to be transcriptional and through an HIF-1-independent region of its proximal promoter. This demonstration of the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-induced G1/S regulation provides insight into a fundamental response of mammalian cells to low oxygen tension."
https://openalex.org/W2052291773,"Recent literature suggests that tetraspanin proteins (transmembrane 4 superfamily; TM4SF proteins) may associate with each other and with many other transmembrane proteins to form large complexes that sometimes may be found in lipid rafts. Here we show that prototype complexes of CD9 or CD81 (TM4SF proteins) with α3β1 (an integrin) and complexes of CD63 (a TM4SF protein) with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-K) may indeed localize within lipid raft-like microdomains, as seen by three different criteria. First, these complexes localize to low density light membrane fractions in sucrose gradients. Second, CD9 and α3 integrin colocalized with ganglioside GM1 as seen by double staining of fixed cells. Third, CD9-α3β1 and CD81-α3β1 complexes were shifted to a higher density upon cholesterol depletion from intact cells or cell lysate. However, CD9-α3β1, CD81-α3β1, and CD63-PtdIns 4-K complex formation itself was not dependent on localization into raftlike lipid microdomains. These complexes did not require cholesterol for stabilization, were maintained within well solubilized dense fractions from sucrose gradients, were stable at 37 °C, and were small enough to be included within CL6B gel filtration columns. In summary, prototype TM4SF protein complexes (CD9-α3β1, CD81-α3β1, and CD63-PtdIns 4-K) can be solubilized as discrete units, independent of lipid microdomains, although they do associate with microdomains resembling lipid rafts.

Although TM4SF molecules often associate with integrins, TM4SF proteins themselves have little influence on cell adhesion (4Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and these proteins do not localize into focal adhesion complexes (5Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The capability of TM4SF molecules to associate with each other and with a multitude of other molecules suggests that TM4SF proteins may serve as adaptors involved in the assembly of protein complexes in the membrane (2Maecker H.T.

Rubinstein E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A particularly striking example of TM4SF protein complexes is the highly organized arrangement of uroplakins 1A and 1B with other proteins in the urothelial membrane (7Wu X.R. Lin J.H. Walz T.

Level 1 consists of very robust associations, stable in Triton X-100 detergent, and likely to be direct. Perhaps the best example is the α3β1-CD151 complex (8Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B.

Level 2 associations are more numerous but nonetheless highly specific. These are disrupted by 1% Triton X-100 but are retained in 1% Brij 96 or Brij 97 detergent and other less hydrophobic detergents.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3909-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) proteins associate with TM4SF proteins and/or integrins. Thus, we hypothesize that TM4SF-integrin plasma membrane complexes may, at least to some extent, resemble rafts. Rafts differ from other parts of the plasma membrane by their high content of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and phospholipids with long, saturated fatty acyl side chains. This unique composition causes lipids in these microdomains to form a liquid-ordered phase rather than the conventional liquid-crystalline phase in the rest of the membrane (34Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Thus, many raft-localized molecules are resistant to extraction with cold nonionic detergents. These insoluble membrane microdomains are also called detergent-resistant membranes or detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membranes. The ratio of lipid to protein in these domains is higher than in surrounding parts of the membrane, enabling their segregation into the low density (light membrane) fractions of isopycnic sucrose gradients. The tendency of TM4SF proteins to associate with each other and with so many other proteins has created enormous problems in evaluating the specific biochemical properties of these proteins. The possible location of these complexes in raft-type microdomains, coupled with the appearance of level 2 and level 3 complexes only under mild detergent conditions, suggests that possibly these complexes may exist only in the context of large and poorly solubilized membrane vesicles. In this regard, the integrin αLβ2-CD63 complex was excluded from a Sepharose CL4B column, suggesting a size equal to or greater than 20 million daltons (49Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Skubitz A.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we examine TM4SF complexes in terms of their densities, relative sizes, and possible relationship to lipid rafts. As prototype level 2 complexes, we have analyzed CD9-α3β1 (12Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,14Nakamura K.

As a prototype level 3 complex, we analyzed CD63-PtdIns 4-K association (30Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

In each case, we asked whether these complexes only exist in the context of large raftlike vesicles or whether they may exist in a truly soluble form of a reasonable size. These studies have been carried out using A431 and HT1080 cell lines because they express significant levels of α3β1, CD9, and/or CD81. Also, A431 cells were selected for study because they were used previously to establish that PtdIns 4-K may localize into lipid rafts (42Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol.

Also utilized was a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α3A (54Dipersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at 0.1 mg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with cold PBS containing 200 mm glycine, and lysed with buffer containing 1% detergent (Triton X-100, CHAPS, Brij 99, or Brij 96), 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm Na3VO4. After 1 h at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was cleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, specific antibodies were added for 2 h, and then protein G-Sepharose was added for another 2 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. For immunoblotting, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and then incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) as described (9Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or with ExtrAvidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) to detect biotinylated proteins. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence, using the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PtdIns 4-K assays were performed as described (55Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples from immunoprecipitates or sucrose gradients were analyzed in a 100-μl final volume containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 50 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and 5–20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For time and temperature, see legends. Assays were stopped by adding 5 nHCl (25 μl), and the lipids were extracted with 160 μl 1:1 chloroform/methanol (v/v). The organic phase was collected and separated by thin layer chromatography. TLC plates were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and the pixel intensities of spots corresponding to radiolabeled PtdIns 4-P were determined with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were lysed as described for immunoprecipitations, except that 25 mm MES (pH 6.5) replaced HEPES. Lysates were then sheared by successive passage through hypodermic needles (5 × 16G11/2, 10 × 26G1/2). 1 ml of lysate (derived from 2 × 107 cells) was then mixed with an equal volume of 90% sucrose. This 45% layer was overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose (prepared in MES buffer without detergent). Samples were centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 16–18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55 rotor, and fractions of 400 μl each were collected from the top of the gradient. Also, the pellet was suspended in 400 μl of 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, detergent, and inhibitors. As an alternative, the detergent-free method of Songet al. (56Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) was utilized. Briefly, cells were suspended in buffer (pH 11) containing Na2CO3 (see figure legends for concentration) plus inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF, sodium pyrophosphate, and Na3VO4) and lysed by applying 20 strokes in a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were then sonicated (3 × 20 s), and particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Gradients were then carried out as above, except that sucrose layers contained Na2CO3 and lacked MgCl2. All lysis and gradient procedures were carried out at 4 °C. To specifically remove cholesterol, intact cells were washed three times in PBS to remove serum and then were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 or 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) for 30–60 min at 37 °C. The sample was then successively centrifuged at 200, 2000, and 16,000 × g to remove cells and cellular debris from the sample. For treatment of immunoprecipitated samples, immune complexes on Sepharose beads were incubated in lysis buffer without detergent but containing 10 mm MβCD for up to 60 min at 4 or 37 °C. Levels of cholesterol in lysates and cell-free supernatants of MβCD-treated cells were determined using the “Cholesterol 20” kit (Sigma). This kit utilizes cholesterol oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide, which is then detected in a coupled colorimetric peroxidase assay. Ganglioside GM1 was measured in a dot blot assay, utilizing cholera toxin B subunit, anti-cholera toxin polyclonal antibody, and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (all reagents from Sigma). Sepharose CL6B columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 × 18 cm) were equilibrated with lysis buffer at 4 °C (Brij 99-containing buffers) or at room temperature (Brij 96 lysis), and 0.7 ml of cell lysate (from ∼5 × 107cells) was applied to the top of the column. The column was eluted with the respective buffer used for cell lysis, and 0.3–0.6-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated with blue dextran and phenol red to define the void volume and small molecule elution volume. A431 cells were cultured overnight on glass coverslips, washed with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS/MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody (at 10 μg/ml, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mmHEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS/MgCl2, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (30 min at room temperature), washed three times again, and then incubated with secondary antibody (5 μg/ml AlexaFluor488 goat anti-mouse IgG; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes, GM1 ganglioside was detected by adding biotinylated B-subunit of cholera toxin (CT-B, 10 μg/ml; Sigma) and then NeutrAvidin-Texas Red (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). After another washing step, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using the ProLong Antifade Kit from Molecular Probes. In a separate experiment, the sequence of incubations was changed such that cells were first incubated with biotinylated CT-B and fixed, and then NeutrAvidin-Texas Red and primary and secondary antibodies were added. Slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioskop, with an HBO 100-watt mercury lamp. Photographs were obtained using a Dage-MTI CCD camera, and processed with Scion Image software and Adobe Photoshop. The AlexaFluor488 dye emitted essentially no fluorescence when samples were irradiated with the Texas Red excitation wavelength and vice versa. Incubation with secondary antibody or NeutrAvidin-Texas Red alone led to negligible cell staining. A key feature of lipid rafts is their relative resistance to detergents (33Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 34Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). To examine the detergent resistance of TM4SF-integrin protein complexes, A431 human carcinoma cells were surface labeled with biotin and lysed using four different detergent conditions, and then immunoprecipitations were carried out. In 1% Brij 99 detergent, immunoprecipitation of α3β1 integrin yielded a protein comigrating with CD9, and immunoprecipitation of CD9 yielded α3β1 integrin. Both proteins appeared at nearly the same level regardless of which antibody was utilized, consistent with a high stoichiometry of complex formation. In 1% CHAPS, similar results were obtained, except that less α3β1 was associated with CD9 and less CD9 was associated with the immunoprecipitated α3β1. In contrast, under conditions of 1% Triton X-100 or RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), essentially no CD9-α3β1 complex was observed. The identity of α3β1 in CD9 immunoprecipitations and CD9 in α3 immunoprecipitations has been demonstrated numerous times by reimmunoprecipitation and/or by immunoblotting (Refs. 12Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and 14Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and data not shown). Several additional proteins, not identified here, were also present in both the CD9 and α3β1 immunoprecipitated complexes. The levels of these other proteins progressively diminished as conditions were shifted from 1% Brij 99 to 1% CHAPS to 1% Triton X-100 to RIPA. The prominent ∼85-kDa protein and more weakly labeled 70-kDa protein seen in α3 immunoprecipitations (especially in Triton and RIPA conditions) probably arise from α3 proteolysis as characterized elsewhere (57Bishop L.A. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Watt F.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the α2β1 integrin was immunoprecipitated in the absence of any apparent CD9 association, and E-cadherin immunoprecipitates showed no evidence for either CD9 or integrin association, regardless of detergent conditions. Because of the types of proteins sometimes found to associate with TM4SF proteins and integrins (see Introduction), and from results such as those shown in Fig.1, we hypothesized that α3β1-CD9 complexes might occur in raftlike microdomains that would be maintained in Brij or CHAPS conditions but disrupted in 1% Triton. Indeed, sucrose density gradient analysis of a 1% Triton lysate revealed that only a trace of CD9 or α3integrin (<1%) was present in the low density, lipid-enriched, light membrane fractions (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3–5). As expected, the majority of total cell surface biotin-labeled proteins (top panel) and E-cadherin (bottom panel) were in the dense fractions (lanes 7–12), while caveolin-1 (well known to appear in Triton-insolu"

However, by inspecting the DNA sequences of the genes dhbE, dhbB, anddhbF as annotated by the B. subtilis genome project to encode the synthetase complex for the siderophore assembly, various sequence errors within the dhbF gene were predicted and confirmed by re-sequencing. According to the corrected sequence, dhbF encodes a dimodular instead of a monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase. We have heterologously expressed, purified, and assayed the substrate selectivity of the recombinant proteins DhbB, DhbE, and DhbF. DhbE, a stand-alone adenylation domain of 59.9 kDa, activates, in an ATP-dependent reaction, DHB, which is subsequently transferred to the free thiol group of the cofactor phosphopantetheine of the bifunctional isochorismate lyase/aryl carrier protein DhbB. The third synthetase, DhbF, is a dimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase of 264 kDa that specifically adenylates threonine and, to a lesser extent, glycine and that covalently loads both amino acids onto their corresponding peptidyl carrier domains. To functionally link the dhb gene cluster to siderophore synthesis, we have disrupted the dhbF gene.

In organisms, most iron is bound intracellularly in heme, iron storage compounds such as ferritin, or iron-sulfur compounds. It can also be complexed to extracellular carrier glycoproteins in the form of transferrin in serum or lactoferrin in mussel surfaces (1Griffiths E. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 3Payne S.M. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 66-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, the level of physiologically available iron in terrestrial as well as in aquatic environments can drop by oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron (2Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 4Neilands J.B. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1983; 5: 137-166PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to concentrations far below 1 μm iron and becomes growth-limiting for bacteria. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems to retract ferric iron ions by utilizing low molecular mass iron-chelating compounds termed siderophores, which also play a crucial role in successful infection of pathogens in their host (5Quadri L.E.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The most common siderophores can be classified traditionally into two major groups, catecholic and hydroxamate siderophores, which have recently been extended to a third main class of carboxylate siderophores. Other important subgroups are heterocyclic and mixed-type siderophores (6Winkelmann G, C.C.J. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Amsterdam BV, The Netherlands1998: 1-49Google Scholar). Many of the siderophores are produced nonribosomally by large multidomain enzymes termed nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS)1 that can assemble peptides of wide structural diversity and broad biological activity (7Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 8Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Chem.

Rev. 1997; 97: 2675-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). NRPS have a distinct modular structure in which each module is responsible for the recognition, activation, and, in some cases, modification of a single amino acid residue of the final peptide product. The modules are aligned in a sequence that is collinear with the sequence of the product (10Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 561-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and can be subdivided into domains that catalyze specific biochemical reactions (7Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 8Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R39-R48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The adenylation (A) domain recognizes a specific substrate (amino or hydroxy acid) and activates it as (amino) acyl adenylate by hydrolysis of ATP. The activated acyl moiety is then covalently thioesterified to the enzyme-bound cofactor 4′-phosphopantetheine of a peptidyl carrier protein domain (11Laland S.G. Zimmer T.L. Essays Biochem. 1973; 9: 31-57PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol.

This reaction is followed by the direct transfer of the aminoacyl-S-Ppant-PCP intermediate onto the adjacent downstream module, a peptide bond formation mediated by the condensation (C) domain (13Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A terminal thioesterase (Te) attached to the C-terminal module releases the peptide from the enzyme by cyclization or hydrolysis. For post-translational modification of all PCP domains in NRPS, a dedicated 4′-phosphopantetheinyltransferase (Ppant-transferase) is needed. It converts all PCP domains from their inactive apo form to the active holo form by covalently linking a phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme A to a highly conserved serine residue (14Lambalot R.H.

In the case of the catechol-type siderophore enterobactin fromEscherichia coli, biochemical data proved the current model of the NRPS assembly line mechanism.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6827-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) transferring the activated aryl moiety onto the aryl carrier protein (ArCP) encoded by entB (19Rusnak F. Liu J. Quinn N. Berchtold G.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,20Gehring A.M. Bradley K.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Amide bond formation with serine is catalyzed by EntF, a four-domain protein exhibiting the domain organization C-A-PCP-Te (see Fig. 1 C) (21Gehring A.M. Mori I. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2648-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Drueckhammer D. Reichert J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2916-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Te domain has been shown to be responsible for trimerization and release of the trilactone enterobactin ((DHB-Ser)3) (23Shaw-Reid C.A. Kelleher N.L. Losey H.C. Gehring A.M. Berg C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 385-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The only catecholic siderophore that has been described so far inBacillus subtilis is the itoic acid (DHB-glycine) encoded by the dhb operon (24Ito T. Neilands J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 4645-4647Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Ito T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2343-2345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the dhboperon was found to be controlled by a single ςA-dependent promoter that comprises afur box-binding site, an iron regulatory element (26Rowland B.M. Taber H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the published data derived from B. subtilisgenome strain 168, DhbF would end within a C domain. Consequently, no terminal Te domain that is normally fused to the C-terminal NRPS module had been annotated, indicating a nonfunctional enzyme. This unusual truncation of dhbF led us to take a closer look at the neighboring sequences and the entire biosynthetic operon for this siderophore. In this study, we re-sequenced the dhbF gene from severalB. subtilis strains, including B. subtilis genome project strain 168, and have identified several sequence errors within the dhbF gene. We expressed the three NRPS genesdhbB, dhbE, and dhbF and purified and characterized the synthetases DhbB, DhbE, and DhbF in vitro. By comparing the culture broth extracts of a dhbF knockout mutant and several B. subtilis strains, the siderophore could be identified and characterized. PCR amplifications were carried out using the Expand Long Range PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Chromosomal DNA of B. subtilisATCC 21332 that had been prepared using a DNA preparation kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used as a template. Primers (listed in Table I) were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) and used for the generation of terminal restriction sites for subsequent cloning. All PCR products were purified and cloned into the pQE vector system (QIAGEN) using standard techniques (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After ligation and transformation in E. coli XL1-Blue, plasmids were prepared by the method of Birnboim and Doly (28Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar) and checked by restriction digest. For the heterologous expression of cloned gene fragments, plasmids were transformed inE. coli. Strain M15(pREP4) was used to isolate apo-PCP proteins, whereas BL21(pREP4-gsp) produces holo-PCP proteins. The strains used in this study are listed in Table II (13Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D.

Expression of dhb gene fragments was carried out under aerobic conditions in 2× yeast tryptone medium supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2. E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C untilA 600 = 0.7. Subsequently, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were cultured for an additional 2–3 h. For E. coli strain JJM304, the protocol was slightly modified. Cells were grown at 25 °C, and 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at A 600 = 0.4. Following expression, cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.8)). Cells were lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell (1100 p.s.i.), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,500 rpm. Supernatants were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN) and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. Concentration of proteins was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). To test various B. subtilis strains under iron deprivation, cells were grown in Spitzien's minimal medium (39Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods in Bacillus subtilis. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1990: 548-549Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2 (w/v) casamino acids and 0.5% (w/v) glucose. Iron was added at various concentrations (0.1–1000 μm) from a freshly prepared solution of FeCl3, and 10 ml of cells were incubated at 250 rpm for 48 h at 37 °C in 50-ml polyethylene tubes. To avoid cross-contamination with iron, all glassware was rinsed with concentrated HCl, and solutions were stored in bottles made of polycarbonate or polyethylene. For siderophore extraction, 200 ml of cells from B. subtilis strains ATCC 21332, 168, and JH642 were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in Spitzien's minimal medium supplemented with 50 μm FeCl3. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 20 min), the cultured broth was extracted three times with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. Subsequently, the volume of the pooled organic extracts was reduced to ∼100 ml in a rotary evaporator at 37 °C, and the remainder was washed two times with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) and water, respectively. The organic layers were dried, and the pellets were resuspended in a small volume (200 μl) of methanol. The resulting suspensions were cleared by centrifugation (21 °C at 13,000 rpm for 5 min), and the supernatants were further analyzed. For the detection of siderophore-producing B. subtilis strains, organic extracts of their cultured broth were applied to a CAS solution assay as described by Schwyn and Neilands (40Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). Additionally, theB. subtilis strains were stroked out on CAS plates and tested for growth and the ability to breakdown the CAS complex. The corresponding plates were prepared as described (40Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids. Extracts of siderophore-producing strains were further analyzed by ESI-MS on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series mass spectrometric detector. 5-μl samples were flow-injected through an autosampler at 0.3 ml/min. Scans were taken in negative-ion mode over the m/z range of 100–1200 at a capillary voltage of 5000 V, a fragmenter voltage of 240 V, drying gas (N2) at 250 °C, and a flow rate of 8 liters/min. A solution of 100% acetonitrile and 0.04% (v/v) formic acid was used as carrier solvent for the detection of the peak at m/z 881 ([M-H]−1). For the detection of fragment ions, a carrier solvent of 50% methanol, water, and 0.04% (v/v) formic acid; a capillary voltage of 4000 V, and varying fragmenter voltages (up to 350 V) were used. The ATP-PPi exchange reaction was performed as described (41Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and reaction mixtures (100-μl final volume) normally contained 2 mm amino acid, 2 mm ATP, and 500 nm enzyme in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) and 20 mm MgCl2). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.15 μCi of sodium [32P]pyrophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.1 mm PPi at pH 7.8. ATP-PPi exchange reactions with DhbF1-A-PCP were carried out at a slightly higher pH value of 8.8. For DhbE, the amino acid concentration had to be lowered to 0.5 mm to avoid nonspecific reactions. For the determination of kinetic parameters, amino acid concentrations were varied between 1 μm and 5 mm. The apo-to-holo form conversion was carried out as described by Lambalot and Walsh (42Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 25 pmol of [3H]coenzyme A, 225 pmol of coenzyme A, 25 pmol of DhbB, and 10 pmol of Sfp in CoA assay buffer (14Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 800 μl of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, pelleted and dissolved in 200 μl of formic acid, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting (Packard TriCarb Model 2300TR). To test for covalent aminoacylation of holo-DhbB, 50 pmol of carrier protein were incubated with 10 pmol of DhbE, 2 nmol of [14C]salicylate, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C under moderate shaking and quenched by the addition of 800 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed once with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 200 μl of formic acid. The acid-stable label was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For generation of a dhb knockout mutant, an integration plasmid was generated by replacement of the coding region of the second A-PCP module in dhbF by a kanamycin (kan) resistance cassette in plasmid pJJM305 (Table II). For this purpose, thekan gene was amplified from pDG782 (36Guerout-Fleury A.M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) using primers Kan_EagI and Kan_ApaI. The kangene fragment was cut with EagI and ApaI and cloned into EagI/ApaI-digested pJJM305, resulting in plasmid pJJM201. Subsequently, a lincomycin/erythromycin resistance-conferring gene (erm) (36Guerout-Fleury A.M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) was cloned at the 3′-end of dhbFin pJJM201 to facilitate a differentiation between single and double crossover events after integration into the B. subtilischromosome. The erm cassette was prepared by cutting pDG780 (36Guerout-Fleury A.M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) with BamHI, and it was cloned intoBamHI-digested pJJM201. The resulting plasmid (pJJM202) was used to disrupt the dhbF gene in B. subtilis ATCC 21332 (srfA +) following the protocol of Kleinet al. (44Klein C. Kaletta C. Schnell N. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 132-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integration was checked by Southern blot analysis (45Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar) using the PCR fragment of dhbF2-A-PCP and thekan gene as probes (data not shown). We first thought that the truncated sequence ofdhbF is the reason for the failure of some B. subtilis strains to produce a siderophore. Analysis of the neighboring sequences in B. subtilis strain 168 (46Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V. Carter N.M. Choi S.K. Codani J.J. Connerton I.F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar) prompted us to assure that two other reading frames, i.e. yukL and yukM (Fig.1 A), resulted from sequencing errors and might originally be part of a larger dhbFgene. We therefore sequenced this region from different Bacillusstrains. Despite a minor sequence divergence, we found three major sequence errors; these critical regions of the published sequence ofB. subtilis strain 168 are aligned in Fig.2 against our sequence data. For the first error region, we found that one thymidine base was missing at position 3828 (the ATG start codon of dhbF refers to position 1), whereas two adenosine base insertions were annotated at positions 3831 and 3834. This leads to a premature TGA stop codon ofdhbF at position 3838. The second error consists of a missing thymidine at position 3921, which leads to a stop codon (TGA) at position 3927. The third error is a C → T transition at position 4406, resulting in the end of yukM. The corrected sequence results in one larger gene (7146 base pairs) (Fig. 1 B) that comprises the entire former dhbF,yukL, and yukM genes as well as the intergenic regions and that encodes a dimodular peptide synthetase of 2378 amino acids (264 kDa). We propose to maintain the designationdhbF for this gene. The sequence has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession number AF184977. From of this corrected sequence, we postulate a new dhb operon organization. The genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis would now be more similar to those of the ent cluster from E. coli, as shown in Fig. 1 (B and C).dhbE and dhbB are similar to entE andentB, respectively; but dhbF now encodes a dimodular peptide synthetase with two modules composed of C, A, and PCP domains and a terminal Te domain. A BLAST search (47Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) with DhbE revealed the greatest similarity to the stand-alone DHB-AMP ligases EntE from E. coli (47% identity), VibE from Vibrio cholerae (68% identity), PchD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (52% identity), and YbtE fromYersinia pestis (49% identity). DhbB shows the greatest similarity to the bifunctional isochorismate lyase/ArCP EntB fromE. coli (48% identity). This similarity is also extended to other ArCP domain-containing proteins such as VibB from V. cholerae (46% identity), PchE from P. aeruginosa (38% identity), and VenB from Vibrio vulnificus (45% identity). DhbF shares the highest similarity with the dimodular actinomycin synthetase II from Streptomyces chrysomallus (45% identity) and the two last modules of the tetramodular pristinamycin I synthetase III from Streptomyces pristinae spiralis (41% identity). To analyze the activity and substrate selectivity of the proteins encoded bydhbB, dhbE, and dhbF, the genes were amplified with the primers listed in Table I and cloned into C-terminal His6-tagged vectors pQE60 and pQE70 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression of dhbE, dhbB, anddhbF was carried out in E. coli, and all proteins were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3). The overproduction of the 264-kDa DhbF protein substantiates the newly determined sequence ofdhbF (Fig. 3 D). The two A-PCP modules encoded bydhbF were also cloned as single modules (DhbF1-A-PCP and DhbF2-A-PCP) to unambiguously assign their substrate selectivity. All proteogenic amino acids as well as DHB and salicylate were tested as substrates for DhbE in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction. The protein was highly specific for DHB and salicylate, and no side specificity was detected (Fig. 4). TheK m and k cat values of 7.6 μm and 167 min−1 (Table III) (18Rusnak F. Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T.

These data are in accordance with those reported for EntE and VibE for enterobactin and vibriobactin, respectively (18Rusnak F. Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T.

https://openalex.org/W2045447884,"We have recently shown that the adhesive defect observed in dermal fibroblasts derived from thrombospondin 2 (TSP2)-null mice results from an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) levels (Yang, Z., Kyriakides, T. R., and Bornstein, P. (2000) <i>Mol. Biol. Cell</i> 11, 3353–3364). Adhesion was restored by replacement of TSP2 and by inhibitors of MMP2 activity. In pursuing the observation that TSP2 and MMP2 interact, we now demonstrate that this interaction is required for optimal clearance of extracellular MMP2 by fibroblasts. Since TSP2 is known to be endocytosed by the scavenger receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), we determined whether interference with LRP function affected fibroblast adhesion and/or extracellular MMP2 levels. Addition of heparin, which competes for the binding of TSP2 to LRP coreceptor proteoglycans, inhibited adhesion of control but not TSP2-null cells, and a blocking antibody to LRP as well as the LRP inhibitor, receptor-associated protein, also inhibited adhesion and increased MMP2 levels only in control fibroblasts. TSP2 did not inhibit active MMP2 directly and did not inhibit the activation of pro-MMP2. Finally, the internalization of <sup>125</sup>I-MMP2 was reduced in TSP2-null compared with control fibroblasts. We propose that clearance of MMP2-TSP2 complexes by LRP is an important mechanism for the regulation of extracellular MMP2 levels in fibroblasts, and perhaps in other cells. Thus, some features of the phenotype of TSP2-null mice, such as abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis, accelerated wound healing, and increased angiogenesis, could result in part from increased MMP2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2027490065,"Herp is a 54-kDa membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mRNA expression level of Herp is increased by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Transcriptional changes designed to deal with this type of ER stress is called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Most mammalian UPR-target genes encode ER-resident molecular chaperones: GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin. The promoter regions of these genes contain acis-acting ER stress response element, ERSE, with the consensus sequence of CCAAT-N9-CCACG. Under conditions of ER stress, p50ATF6 (the active form of the transcription factor, ATF6) binds to CCACG when CCAAT is bound by the general transcription factor, NF-Y/CBF. Here, we report the genomic structure of human Herp and the presence of a new ER stress response element, ERSE-II, in its promoter region. The gene for Herp consists of eight exons, localized to chromosome 16q12.2–13. The promoter region contains a single ERSE-like sequence. In reporter gene assays, disruption of thiscis-element resulted in a partial reduction of the transcriptional response to ER stress, suggesting that the element is functional for the UPR. These results also suggest the involvement of additional elements in the UPR. Further analysis, using an optimized plasmid containing an mRNA-destabilizing sequence, revealed ERSE-II (ATTGG-N-CCACG) as the second ER stress response element. Interestingly, ERSE-II was also dependent on p50ATF6, in a manner similar to that of ERSE, despite the disparate structure. The strong induction of Herp mRNA by ER stress would be achieved by the cooperation of ERSE and ERSE-II.AB034990 Herp is a 54-kDa membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Under conditions of ER stress, p50ATF6 (the active form of the transcription factor, ATF6) binds to CCACG when CCAAT is bound by the general transcription factor, NF-Y/CBF. Here, we report the genomic structure of human Herp and the presence of a new ER stress response element, ERSE-II, in its promoter region. The gene for Herp consists of eight exons, localized to chromosome 16q12.2–13. The promoter region contains a single ERSE-like sequence. In reporter gene assays, disruption of thiscis-element resulted in a partial reduction of the transcriptional response to ER stress, suggesting that the element is functional for the UPR. These results also suggest the involvement of additional elements in the UPR. Further analysis, using an optimized plasmid containing an mRNA-destabilizing sequence, revealed ERSE-II (ATTGG-N-CCACG) as the second ER stress response element. Interestingly, ERSE-II was also dependent on p50ATF6, in a manner similar to that of ERSE, despite the disparate structure. The strong induction of Herp mRNA by ER stress would be achieved by the cooperation of ERSE and ERSE-II.

Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The UPR is a transcriptional response to remedy the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Most previously identified UPR-target genes encode ER-resident molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, such as GRP78/BiP, GRP94, protein-disulfide isomerase, and calreticulin. In contrast to these ER luminal proteins, Herp is an integral membrane protein, both N and C termini of which face the cytoplasmic side of the ER. This membrane topology makes it unlikely that Herp acts as a molecular chaperone for proteins in the ER. Herp plays an unknown role in the cellular survival response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. The ER provides an optimal environment for the synthesis, folding, and assembly of membrane and secreted proteins. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER under conditions of “ER stress” threatens the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells. Although the physiological conditions inducing ER stress are not fully understood, the cellular response to the stress is essential for homeostasis (comprehensively reviewed by Kaufman (Ref. 2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar)). The ER-stress responses are currently categorized to three mechanisms: transcriptional induction, translational attenuation, and degradation (reviewed by Mori (Ref. 3Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar)). In addition, ER stress activates c-Jun N-terminal kinases (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar) and induces caspase-12-mediated apoptosis (5Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the UPR is extensively defined in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ER luminal domain of Ire1p, an ER-resident type I transmembrane protein, senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, activating its cytoplasmic endoribonuclease domain through homo-oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation (6Cox J.S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), although the substrates of their endoribonuclease activities are unknown. ATF6 has been identified as the transcription factor responsible for the UPR (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The quiescent form of ATF6 (p90ATF6), a type II-transmembrane protein, is embedded in the ER membrane and proteolyzed in an ER stress-dependent manner (16Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). The liberated N-terminal fragment (p50ATF6) translocates to the nucleus, binding to the mammalian UPR-dependentcis-acting element, designated the ER stress response element (ERSE) (15Yoshida H.

ERSE, possessing a consensus sequence of CCAAT-N9-CCACG, is necessary and sufficient for the induction of at least three major ER chaperones (GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin) (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). This sequence is present in the proximal promoter regions of many ER stress-responsive proteins (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

Multiple ER stress-responsive genes, however, possess proximal promoter regions without an ERSE sequence, such as FKBP13 (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RTP/NDRG1. 2K. Kokame, H. Kato, and T. Miyata, unpublished data. In the present paper, we demonstrate the existence of a new ER stress response element, ERSE-II, found in the Herp promoter region. In a manner similar to ERSE, ERSE-II mediates the ATF6-dependent UPR. A human whole blood, λ genomic library (Stratagene) was screened to obtain genomic clones encoding Herp using the PCR-based screening method described previously (23Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Positive phages were cloned utilizing theEscherichia coli XL1-Blue MRA strain as host. PCR was performed using 5′-TGGTTTCTCCGGTTACAC-3′ and 5′-AGAGACCACAGGTATCTC-3′ as primers with the plate lysates as templates. Two positive phages were cloned by limiting serial dilution. The insert DNAs isolated from these clones (∼17 kilobases each) were sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The P1-derived artificial chromosome clone containing the Herp gene was isolated from a human PAC DNA library (GenomeSystems) using Herp cDNA as a probe. DNA from the clone, labeled by nick translation with digoxigenin dUTP, was hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Specific hybridization signals were detected using fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloriden-hydrate. Progressive deletion fragments of the Herp gene 5′-flanking region were PCR-amplified using sense primers containing an additional 5′-BglII site and an antisense primer containing an original NcoI site at the initial Met of Herp (5′-TTCGGTCTCGGACTCCATGGC-3′). After digestion withBglII and NcoI, the fragments were inserted between the BglII and NcoI sites of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-Basic (Promega). Site-directed mutations were introduced into the inserts by using oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations, according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene). All inserts were sequenced to confirm the desired sequence. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Clonetics) were cultured on 24-well plates coated with type I collagen (Sumitomo Bakelite) in MCDB131 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems). Using 1.05 μl/well FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), we transfected HUVECs with 0.5 μg/well amounts of either the pGL3-Basic-derived plasmid described above or control plasmid (pGL3-Control, firefly luciferase vector with SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, Promega) together with 0.025 μg/well of the internal control plasmid (pRL-SV40, Renilla reniformis luciferase vector with SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, Promega). Following a 23-h incubation, cells were incubated for 6 h in either 1 μmthapsigargin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma), or 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Nacalai Tesque). Cells were then washed with Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested in 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). We measured the firefly andRenilla luciferase activities of 20 μl of each lysate using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Bioluminescence was detected using a LUMINOUS CT-9000 luminometer (Dia-Iatron). After dividing luminescence intensity of firefly luciferase by that of Renilla luciferase, we determined the “relative luciferase activity” to be the ratio of the value obtained from each test plasmid to that of the pGL3-Control. In each assay, the values were averaged from four independent wells. To make the luciferase mRNA unstable, we inserted a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-TAATATTTATATATTTATATTTTTAAAATATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTAA-3′, into the XbaI sites of both the pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Control plasmids. This AT-rich sequence was derived from 3′-UTR of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The cDNA encoding human ATF6 was the kind gift of Dr. Hiderou Yoshida and Dr. Kazutoshi Mori (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The partial open reading frame corresponding to Met1–Asn366 was PCR-amplified; the product was inserted into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). To express ATF6(366) transiently, the resultant plasmid pcDNA3ATF6(366) (0.01 μg/well) was transfected to HUVECs together with the luciferase plasmids (0.5 μg/well). As a negative control, the mock vector pcDNA3.1(+) (0.01 μg/well) was cotransfected in place of pcDNA3ATF6(366). We constructed an expression plasmid coding for a FLAG-tagged version of ATF6 Met1–Asn366 and transfected this plasmid into HUVECs. After a 21-h incubation, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Following an incubation in 5% normal goat serum and 5% fish gelatin for 30 min, we detected endogenous Herp and transiently expressed FLAG-ATF6(366) simultaneously in 1-h incubation of 20 μg/ml anti-Herp rabbit polyclonal antibody (1Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were then incubated with Oregon Green 514-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, fluorescence was visualized using a confocal laser-scanning microscope with FLUOVIEW (Olympus). We obtained a complete sequence of the human Herp gene (GenBank™ accession no. AB034990) by comparison of two partially overlapping clones, isolated from the human genomic DNA library, to the Herp cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AB034989). The gene was officially designatedHERPUD1 by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. The schematic structure, sequences across the exon-intron junctions, and the sizes of exons and introns are shown in Fig.1 (A and B). The Herp gene contains eight exons and spans 11,738 bp in length. The identified exon-intron junctions agreed with the intron 5′-GT and 3′-AG consensus sequences. The 5′-terminal transcription start site had been previously determined by cap-site hunting (1Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Exon 1 encoded the 5′-UTR and the first 49 N-terminal residues including the initial Met codon. The stop codon and the 3′-UTR were encoded by exon 8. To localize the Herp gene on human chromosomes, we performed FISH analysis utilizing DNA from the P1-derived artificial chromosome clone containing the Herp gene. Labeled Herp DNA was hybridized to chromosomes derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Eighty metaphase cells were analyzed; 73 exhibited specific labeling of the 16q12.2–13 region (Fig. 1 C). We sequenced the ∼6-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region of the Herp gene. Computer analysis by TFSEARCH using the TRANSFAC data base (24Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) revealed many potential transcription factor-binding sites within the sequence. The proximal 200-bp sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site, including several putative cis-acting regulatory elements, is shown in Fig. 1 D. The canonical TATA box, specifying the transcriptional start site, is found in close proximity to exon 1. Two CAAT boxes were also identified. The 5′-flanking region contained several GC boxes (GGCG), suggesting multiple Sp1-binding sites. The Herp promoter region contains one ERSE-like sequence,−88CCAATGGGCGGCAGCCACA−70, located upstream of the TATA box (Fig. 1 D). ERSE is a cis-acting regulatory element identified in the promoters of mammalian UPR target genes (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). ERSE, with a consensus of CCAAT-N9-CCACG, is necessary and sufficient for the induction of the ER-resident molecular chaperones, GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin. Although the G nucleotide at the 3′ end of the consensus sequence is replaced by an A in the Herp ERSE, we predict this sequence functions in the UPR-dependent induction of Herp expression at the transcriptional level. A series of reporter plasmids containing sense fragments of the Herp 5′-flanking region (from nucleotide −5000 to −200) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene were transfected into HUVECs. The firefly luciferase activity in each assay was normalized to a cotransfected Renillaluciferase plasmid, pRL-SV40, to compensate for a varied efficiency of transfection. The basal luciferase activity of plasmid containing the longest 5′-flanking sequence (−5000/+98) exhibited approximately half the activity of an SV40 promoter control (Fig.2). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of ER-resident Ca2+-ATPase, is used experimentally to activate the UPR. Following a 6-h treatment with 1 μmthapsigargin, luciferase activity increased significantly (∼4.3-fold) over basal activity, consistent with previous results demonstrating the induction of Herp mRNA by thapsigargin (1Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The SV40 promoter encoded by the pGL3-Control vector did not respond to thapsigargin treatment. Removal of the −5000 to −1800 region of Herp resulted in an increase of basal activity, suggesting the existence of silencing element in the region; little effect, however, was observed in the response to thapsigargin. Both the basal and thapsigargin-treated activities of plasmids containing −1000/+98, −800/+98, −600/+98, and −400/+98 were similar in magnitude to −1800/+98. Although removal of the −400 to −200 region resulted in a reduction of basal activity, the strong induction of luciferase activity in response to thapsigargin remained intact. We, therefore, concluded that thecis-elements responsible for the response to thapsigargin treatment would lie within the region 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In the following experiments, we used a plasmid containing the −200/+98 region to analyze this hypothesis in detail. One ERSE-like sequence, −88CCAATgggcggcagCCACA−70, is contained within the Herp 5′-flanking region. As the A nucleotide at the 3′ end was different from a G in the ERSE consensus, CCAAT-N9-CCACG, we examined the transcriptional effect of this nucleotide difference. Both basal and thapsigargin-treated activities of the plasmid containing CCACg (Fig. 3 A,line 2) were similar to those of the original plasmid (line 1), suggesting that the A nucleotide functions similarly to a G nucleotide in the response to thapsigargin. We performed site-directed mutagenesis on two motifs of ERSE and examined the effects on the transcriptional induction following thapsigargin treatment. Throughout this paper, the term “mutation” is defined as the substitution of A, C, G, and T for C, A, T, and G, respectively. Disruptive mutation of either of the two motifs, CCAAT or CCACA, resulted in a partial reduction of the thapsigargin-dependent induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 3 A, lines 3 and 4), indicating their involvement in the induction. Mutation of both motifs, however, did not completely abrogate the response to thapsigargin (line 5). These results suggest that other cis-elements are involved in thapsigargin-dependent transcriptional induction. Under these experimental conditions, however, the observed inducibilities were not high enough to define the elements. We, therefore, modified the plasmid DNAs to effectively monitor the difference in activity with or without thapsigargin treatment. Observation of the effects of stimulants on transcriptional induction in reporter gene assays is contingent on a faster turnover of mRNA produced from the test plasmid DNA. We, therefore, introduced an AT-rich sequence into the 3′-UTR of the firefly luciferase plasmids. The 51-nucleotide stretch (TAATATTTATATATTTATATTTTTAAAATATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTAA), known to selectively destabilize mRNA, was identified from the 3′-UTR of GM-CSF cDNA (25Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). Insertion of this sequence into the luciferase 3′-UTR of the plasmid containing the Herp −200/+98 region resulted in dramatic reduction of the basal activity; the activity in the presence of thapsigargin was relatively unchanged (compare lines 1and 2 in Fig. 3 B). As a result, the induction rate of thapsigargin treatment increased from 2.8 to 7.7 in this assay. Insertion of the AT-rich sequence into the control pGL3-Control plasmid, containing the SV40 promoter, had little effect on the ratio of basal to thapsigargin-treated activities (1.1 to 1.4, lines 3 and 4), although the luciferase activities were reduced in both cases. We utilized this optimized plasmid to identify additional transcriptional control elements in the Herp promoter region. To identify additionalcis-elements involved in thapsigargin-induction, we made a series of mutant plasmids that also contained the disrupted ERSE. First, we searched the region from nucleotide −196 to −89, making 11 sets of consecutive 10-bp mutations. After measuring the resulting luciferase activities (Fig.4 A), we found that basal activities were reduced when two regions,−186GCGGGTTGCA−177 and−176TCAGCCCGTG−167 were mutated, although the induction by thapsigargin treatment remained intact (lines 4and 5). Mutation of−126GCCGATTGGG−117 or−116CCACGTTGGG−107, however, resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity upon thapsigargin treatment, despite little effect on basal activity (lines 10and 11). To identify the nucleotides involved in the thapsigargin response, we assessed the effects of 14 nucleotide mutations crossing these two regions on luciferase activity (Fig.4 B). Mutations at −122, −121, −120, −119, −118, −116, −115, −114, −113, and −112 demonstrated inhibitory effects on the thapsigargin-induced response of luciferase activity (lines 3–13 except line 8). These results indicate that the 11-bp stretch, −122ATTGGgCCACG−112, in the Herp promoter region is responsible for the transcriptional response to thapsigargin. This 11-bp sequence contains two motifs forming the ERSE consensus, CCAAT (complementary to ATTGG) and CCACG, although the orientation of the first sequence is inverted. We termed thiscis-element, ERSE-II. To compare the activity of ERSE and ERSE-II, we measured the luciferase activity of plasmids containing combination of mutations in these twocis-elements. We utilized not only thapsigargin but also tunicamycin (N-glycosylation inhibitor) and mercaptoethanol (reducing agent) as ER-stress inducers to see specific induction by the UPR. Plasmid DNA containing the 5′-flanking region (−200/+98) of the Herp gene demonstrated enhanced activity in the presence of all the reagents used (Fig. 5, line 1), in contrast to the control plasmid containing the SV40 promoter (line 5). Disruption of the original ERSE resulted in decrease of the response to the ER-stress inducers but not in a complete loss (line 2). In a similar way, disruption of the novel ERSE-II also exhibited a weakened response (line 3). When both elements were disrupted, the transcriptional induction by ER stress was abrogated (line 4). These results suggest that ERSE and ERSE-II would function independently as cis-acting elements, contributing equally to the UPR-dependent induction of Herp mRNA. The general transcription factor, NF-Y, constitutively binds the CCAAT motif of ERSE (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 18Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The transcription factor, ATF6 (p90ATF6), on the ER membrane is activated by proteolysis in response to ER stress; the resultant N-terminal soluble form (p50ATF6) moves into nuclei to bind directly to the CCACG motif (16Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of p50ATF6 overexpression on the induction of Herp expression. As the cleavage site involved in conversion from p90ATF6 to p50ATF6 is unknown, we utilized ATF6(366), an N-terminal soluble fragment containing the entire basic region and majority of the leucine zipper region of ATF6. ATF6(366) translocates to the nucleus to enhance the levels of GRP78 mRNA (16Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Upon transfection of the expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged ATF6(366) into HUVECs, a fraction of transfected cells possessed nuclei recognized by an anti-FLAG-tag antibody, indicating that the expressed ATF6(366) was present in nuclei (Fig.6 A, red signal). Cells with immunonegative nuclei were also observed, likely due to a failure of transfection. Following staining of cells with an anti-Herp antibody, immunopositive signals of the ER in ATF6(366)-expressing cells were stronger than those in cells without ATF6(366) (Fig.6 A, green signal). This suggests that overexpressed ATF6(366) functions in vivo to induce the expression of Herp in the ER. To demonstrate that p50ATF6 induces the transcriptional activity of the Herp promoter, the plasmid containing the −200/+98 region of Herp was cotransfected into HUVECs in conjunction with the ATF6(366)-expression plasmid. As expected, coexpression of ATF6(366) resulted in an enhancement of luciferase activity (Fig. 6 B, line 1). The induction was partially reduced when the two motifs, CCAAT and CCACA, of ERSE were disrupted (line 2), indicating both that the effect of ATF6(366) is dependent on the cis-element and that other elements are involved in this induction. Disruption of both motifs, ATTGG (complementary to CCAAT) and CCACA, of ERSE-II also demonstrated a partial reduction in induction (line 3). Disruption of both elements, ERSE and ERSE-II, resulted in a complete loss of the ATF6 effect (line 4). These data suggest that both ERSE and ERSE-II are involved in the ATF6-dependent UPR. p50ATF6 binds directly to the CCACG portion of ERSE to exert its ability as a trans-factor (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Mutation of CCACA/G motifs of both ERSE and ERSE-II in the Herp promoter abrogated the inducible effect of ATF6(366) (Fig. 6 B, line 5), suggesting that the enhancer activity of p50ATF6 requires the CCACG sequences of both ERSE-II and ERSE. p50ATF6 binds to CCACG only when CCAAT is bound by NF-Y, exactly 9 bp upstream of CCACG (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CCAAT motifs of both ERSE and ERSE-II abrogated the ATF6 effect as well (line 6). The indispensability of NF-Y binding is also applicable to ERSE-II as well as ERSE, despite the differences in both the direction and interval of CCAAT and CCACG in ERSE-II from those in ERSE. We identified two cis-acting elements responsible for the UPR-dependent transcriptional induction in the proximal promoter region of the Herp gene. CCAATgggcggcagCCACA is almost identical to the 19-nucleotide consensus sequence of ERSE, CCAAT-N9-CCACG (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The other, ATTGG-N-CCACG, is a new element, termed ERSE-II. ERSE-II also contains two motifs, CCAAT (complementary to ATTGG) and CCACG, although the orientation and the interval between them are different from ERSE. Moreover, ERSE-II functions as an ER stress response element in an ATF6-dependent fashion, in the same manner as the original ERSE. The A nucleotide at position 19 in ERSE of the Herp promoter differs from a G of the ERSE consensus. Our data, however, could not demonstrate a significant functional difference in response to thapsigargin treatment between A and G at this position (Fig.3 A). Yoshida et al. (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) demonstrated that substitution of the nucleotide G to T was a crucial mutation, impairing the UPR; they did not, however, examine the effect of substitution to A. Furthermore, ERSE-like sequences also appear in the human ER stress-responsive genes, GRP58 (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and SERCA2(26Caspersen C. Pedersen P.S. Treiman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22363-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with a sequence of CCAAT-N9-CCACA. Therefore, the ERSE consensus should be described as containing the sequence: CCAAT-N9-CCACG/A. It has been reported that the transcription factors, NF-Y and ATF6, simultaneously bind to the CCAAT and CCACG portions of ERSE, respectively (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The former is considered to bind in a constitutive manner, independent of the UPR. The latter binds only when it is converted from the ER membrane-embedded p90ATF6 to the soluble p50ATF6 by processing induced by ER stress (16Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Binding of ATF6 to CCACG requires the binding of NF-Y to the CCAAT sequence at a position exactly 9 bp upstream of CCACG (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). This 9-bp distance is critical; neither 8 nor 10 bp is acceptable (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The unidirectional necessity, however, of CCAAT and CCACG was not investigated. Our data indicate that the role of ERSE-II as a cis-acting element was exerted by ATF6 as was the case with that of ERSE (Fig. 6). Both the CCACG and the ATTGG (complementary to CCAAT) sequences of ERSE-II were critical for ATF6-mediated transcription. Although direct evidence is not available, it is likely that both NF-Y and p50ATF6 bind to ERSE-II to enhance transcription (Fig. 7). We observed specific binding of NF-Y to the CCACG sequence of ERSE-IIin vitro (data not shown). If our model is correct, the inverse direction of two motifs may be necessary when the distance between them is 1 bp, not 9. A study of the steric structure of protein-DNA interaction will help determine the validity of this argument. By analogy to ERSE, other transcription factors, such as CREB-RP (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and XBP-1 (17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), may bind to the CCACG sequence of ERSE-II. Most UPR-target genes, such as GRP78, GRP94, and the gene for calreticulin, are fully activated by multiple copies of ERSE (15Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 18Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Despite a single ERSE, however, Herp mRNA induction by the UPR is very strong as compared with other ER chaperones (1Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). ERSE-II may cooperate with ERSE to facilitate the strong induction of Herp in response to ER stress. We searched for ERSE-II in other ER stress-responsive genes to demonstrate the function of this sequence in the response to cellular stress. ORP150 is an ER-resident protein whose expression is induced by hypoxia; three distinct mRNA species are produced by alternative promoters (27Kaneda S. Yura T. Yanagi H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 128: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One of them was preferentially induced by hypoxia and ER stress, in a manner dependent on a single ERSE-like sequence (−93CCAATgagcgcccgCCgCG−75) in the promoter region (27Kaneda S. Yura T. Yanagi H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 128: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found two ERSE-II-like sequences,−267ATTGGaCCACG−277 and−160ATTGGaCCACG−170, upstream of the ERSE. They also might be involved in the UPR. Recently, van Laar et al. (28van Laar T. Schouten T. Hoogervorst E. van Eck M. van der Eb A.J. Terleth C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) identified a human methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-inducible gene, Mif1, identical to Herp. The mRNA is also induced by tunicamycin, osmotic shock, and UV irradiation. Although they demonstrated that onecis-element, ERSE, was involved in the response to tunicamycin, ERSE-II was not mentioned. The induction ofMif1 by MMS was mediated by neither ERSE nor ERSE-II but by a 122-bp fragment (−257 to −136). As MMS also induces the mRNA expression of GRP78 (28van Laar T. Schouten T.

The function of Herp is still unknown. It was believed that all proteins encoded by UPR-target genes functioned as molecular chaperones and folding enzymes to relieve the disturbance of the ER. As the majority of the molecule is exposed to the cytoplasm, Herp may play a role independent of molecular chaperones (1Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). ER stress also up-regulates the mRNA expression of the transcription factors, CHOP (29Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), ATF3 (22Cai Y.

Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In addition, a large number of UPR-target genes have been identified in yeast using microarray techniques that are not limited to proteins involved in ER folding (30Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Further research from a wide viewpoint will be required to determine the physiological function of Herp. To facilitate our study, we modified the plasmid DNA for reporter gene assays. We reduced basal luciferase activity in cells by preventing the accumulation of superfluous mRNA and enzyme prior to stimulation by destabilizing the luciferase mRNA. This technique allowed us to identify a new cis-element responsible for stimulation of gene expression. Although we used this technique to detect response to ER stress, the destabilization of reporter gene plasmids will be widely applicable to the search for cis-elements responsible for other conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1970457673,"The use of mass spectrometry to characterize the phosphorylome, i.e. the constituents of the proteome that become phosphorylated, was demonstrated using the reversible phosphorylation of chloroplast thylakoid proteins as an example. From the analysis of tryptic peptides released from the surface ofArabidopsis thylakoids, the principal phosphoproteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These studies revealed that the D1, D2, and CP43 proteins of the photosystem II core are phosphorylated at their N-terminal threonines (Thr), the peripheral PsbH protein is phosphorylated at Thr-2, and the mature light-harvesting polypeptides LCHII are phosphorylated at Thr-3. In addition, a doubly phosphorylated form of PsbH modified at both Thr-2 and Thr-4 was detected. By comparing the levels of phospho- and nonphosphopeptides, the in vivo phosphorylation states of these proteins were analyzed under different physiological conditions. None of these thylakoid proteins were completely phosphorylated in the steady state conditions of continuous light or completely dephosphorylated after a long dark adaptation. However, rapid reversible hyperphosphorylation of PsbH at Thr-4 in response to growth in light/dark transitions and a pronounced specific dephosphorylation of the D1, D2, and CP43 proteins during heat shock was detected. Collectively, our data indicate that changes in the phosphorylation of photosynthetic proteins are more rapid during heat stress than during normal light/dark transitions.

The extent of its importance is illustrated by the hundreds of conventional protein kinases and phosphatases detected in various eukaryotic genomes (1Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Plowman G.D. Sudarsanam S. Bingham J. Whyte D. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues are the typical targets of these kinases, phosphorylation of at least six other amino acids is feasible, potentially expanding even further the dimensions of this post-translational modification (reviewed in Ref. 4Vener A.V. Biosystems. 1990; 24: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this pool of phosphorylated proteins, our understanding of its depth and breadth remains sketchy. One barrier has been the lack of methods to define en masse the “phosphorylome,”i.e. the subset of proteins in the proteome that become modified in vivo by phosphorylation. Precise characterization of the phosphorylome will be essential to fully understand how proteins are activated or inhibited, encouraged to interact with other components in the cell, and selected for rapid degradation. Certainly, the dynamic and transient nature of many protein phosphorylation reactions underscores the difficulties of resolving the complete phosphorylome for a given organism. Nevertheless, the identification of even just the principal cellular phosphoproteins under distinct physiological conditions should bring significant biological insights. The most common method for analysis of the phosphorylome involves the use of radioactive labeling either in vivo or in vitro. However, uneven uptake of the label in complex multicellular organisms, the large pools of endogenous free phosphate, and the presence of pre-existing bound phosphate often limit conclusions. Phosphoamino acid antibodies have been exploited recently but their use is restricted to tailor-made immunological applications and because these antibodies cannot detect the nonphosphorylated form they are unable to determine stoichiometry. More recently, mass spectrometry (MS)1 has been applied to analyses of protein phosphorylation (5Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Annan R.S. Carr S.A. J.

Moreover with appropriate considerations, we show here that MS can also be used to provide estimates of the phosphorylation state of specific proteins. To demonstrate the utility of MS, we have applied this technique to the analysis of the major phosphoproteins in the chloroplast thylakoid, the membrane containing the photosynthetic light reactions of photosystem (PS) I and II, light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins (LHCII), cytochrome b·f complex, and the ATP synthase (11Bennett J.

Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Multiprotein complexes within the thylakoids are responsible for light-driven oxidation of water with concomitant release of oxygen and the production of energy and reducing potentials. During these reactions, reversible phosphorylation is thought to play critical roles in (i) the redistribution of excitation energy between PSI and II via modification of LHCII (11Bennett J.

Studies in spinach and pea using 32P labeling and phosphoamino acid antibodies showed that a number of proteins are phosphorylated, including threonine residues at or near the N termini of LHCII (19Michel H. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17584-17591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PSII polypeptides, the D1 and D2 reaction center proteins, chlorophyll-binding protein CP43 (20Michel H. Hunt D.F.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 103-108Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, given the limitations of 32P labeling and immunoassays, it remains unclear how important chloroplast protein phosphorylation is to the normal function and regulation of the photosynthetic light reactions. In vitro studies using32P labeling have suggested that a number of thylakoid proteins are extensively phosphorylated in the light (22Bennett J. Nature. 1977; 269: 344-346Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar) by a kinase controlled by the photosynthetic electron transport chain (12Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys.

More recent studies using phosphothreonine antibodies questioned the magnitude of this phosphorylation by showing that some thylakoid phosphoproteins remain phosphorylated even in dark-adapted plants (26Rintamaki E. Salonen M. Suoranta U.M. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Aro E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30476-30482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Rokka A. Aro E.M. Herrmann R.G.

(2000) Photosynth. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Furthermore, the maximal phosphorylation of LHCII only occurs at low light and is drastically decreased at higher irradiations (26Rintamaki E. Salonen M. Suoranta U.M. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Aro E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30476-30482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of spinach LHCII was also found to increase in darkness upon exposure of leaves to heat shock (27Rokka A. Aro E.M. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Vener A.V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification of the major phosphoproteins in the thylakoid membranes from Arabidopsis thaliana and map their phosphorylation sites using both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS. Measurements of the phosphorylation level of each protein revealed that changes in the steady state phosphorylation during normal light/dark growth cycles may be less extensive and slower than previously thought and may be more significant and rapid during a response to stress (e.g. heat shock). The MS techniques described here should be applicable for many analyses involving complex mixtures of phosphoproteins. A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was grown at 21 °C either in soil or on 0.7% (w/v) agar containing one-half strength MS media (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plants were irradiated with 100 μmol m−2 s−1 of white light provided by fluorescent lights with a photoperiod of 16-h light/8-h dark. Chloroplasts and thylakoids were prepared from 3-week-old plants. Chloroplasts were extracted from the leaves and purified by Percol gradient centrifugation according to Ref. 29Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar. To isolate thylakoids, the chloroplasts were resuspended in 7 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, and homogenized 10 times in a Potter grinder. The homogenate was diluted to 30 ml with the same buffer and thylakoids were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 ×g. For direct preparation of thylakoids, 5 g of leaves were homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann PT 10/35) in 25 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer, containing 300 mm sorbitol, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF. The suspension was filtrated through four layers of Miracloth and centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 7 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 0 mm NaF) and homogenized 10 times in a Potter grinder. The suspension was diluted to 30 ml with the lysis buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of the extraction buffer with the Potter grinder and layered on the top of a sucrose step gradient, containing (bottom to top): 10 ml of 1.8 m, 10 ml of 1.3m, and 10 ml of 0.5 m sucrose in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 10 mm NaF. After centrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor for 15 min at 5000 × g, the thylakoid fraction was collected from the 1.3m, 1.8 m sucrose interface. Thylakoids were diluted to 25 ml with extraction buffer and collected by a 5-min centrifugation at 4000 × g. The thylakoid pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 25 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF, and pelleted again using a microcentrifuge. Chloroplasts (0.2 mg of chlorophyll) were gently resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mmTricine (pH 8.0), 330 mm sorbitol, 6.6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4 and incubated at 22 °C. Phosphorylation was induced by a 10–20 min irradiation with 100 μmol m−2 s−1 of white light and terminated by addition of 10 ml of ice-cold 20 mmTricine (pH 8.0), 5 mm Na4EDTA, 10 mm NaF. Thylakoids were prepared from chloroplasts as described above. When isolated thylakoids were used, they were resuspended in 20 mm Tricine (pH 8.0), 100 mmsorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP and irradiated as described above. Isolated thylakoids were washed twice with 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF by centrifugation and resuspension in the same buffer to a concentration of 1.3–1.5 mg of chlorophyll/ml. The suspension was incubated with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) (8 μg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll) at 22 °C for 90 min. The digestion products were frozen, thawed, and clarified at 14,000 ofg. The supernatant containing released thylakoid peptides was collected. Similar peptides were collected from spinach thylakoids as described (30Vener A.V. Rokka A. Fulgosi H. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14955-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were affinity enriched from the thylakoid peptide fraction by chromatography with immobilized Fe(III) or Ga(III) columns (31Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 32Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Typically, columns containing 50 μl of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads were washed with 0.3 ml of water, 0.3 ml of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, charged with 0.3 ml of 0.1m FeCl3 or GaCl3, and washed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid. Thylakoid peptides (0.2–0.3 ml) were mixed with an equal volume of 20% acetic acid and loaded onto the columns. After washing twice with 0.2 ml of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, bound phosphopeptides were eluted with 300 μl of either 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (for Fe(III) (31Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar)), or 20 mm of nonbuffered Na2HPO4 (for Ga(III) (32Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar)). Synthetic phosphopeptides included: APRTpPGGRR; CDGVTTKTpTAGTPD, CDGVTTKTpFAGTPD, LIPQQSpINEAIK, DRHDSGLDSpNKDE, DRHDSpGLDSpNKDE, CDRHDSpGLDSpNKDE, and GRPRTTSpFAE (where Tp and Sp indicate phosphothreonine and phosphoserine, respectively). To obtain the corresponding dephosphopeptides, 0.25 nmol of each phosphopeptide were dissolved in the phosphatase buffer (25 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 2 to 24 h at 37 °C with the addition of 1 to 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The extent of dephosphorylation was monitored by MALDI-TOF MS. Samples were prepared by mixing 1–2 μl of each mixture with 1–2 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile with 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. One μl of final mixture was spotted on the target. Linear and reflector mass spectra were recorded using Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) operated in delayed extraction mode using an accelerating voltage of 19 kV. Spectra were calibrated externally. Post-source decay (PSD) spectra were recorded using Bruker's FAST procedure. Peptide mixtures were separated on 5 μm of C18 MetaChem 150 × 1.0-mm column at a flow rate 20 μl/min. A gradient of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B) was distributed as follow: 0% B in first 3 min; 0–20% B in 3 to 20 min; 20–70% B in 20 to 105 min; 70–99% B in 105 to 115 min. The online detection with positive/negative-ion mode switching was performed using an API 365 triple quadrupole MS with a standard ionspray source (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA). Each 5.2-s positive-ion scan in the m/z range from 320 to 1800 was followed by a 0.7-s pause for polarity switching and 1.5-s single ion-monitoring of negative 79 and another 0.7-s pause to return to positive-ion mode. In the positive-ion mode, ion source, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 5 kV, 12 V, and 140 V, respectively, to minimize fragmentation. However, in some cases a small amount of nonphosphorylated ion species was generated from the phosphopeptide by partial skimmer-induced fragmentation (see Fig. 3 C, for example). In the negative-ion mode, the ion source, orifice and ring voltages were set at −4.5 kV, −200 V, and −300 V, respectively, to maximize the phosphoryl-79 signal. For skimmer collision-induced dissociation (CID), the ion source, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 5 kV, 95 V, and 200 V, respectively, to maximize peptide fragmentation. Sequencing of high performance liquid chromatography-purified peptides was performed by tandem MS/MS using conditions recommended by Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex (Foster City, CA). Previous studies with spinach and pea chloroplast thylakoids showed that the primary sites for phosphorylation involve polypeptide regions exposed to the outer surface of the membranes (30Vener A.V. Rokka A. Fulgosi H. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14955-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Bennett J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To enrich for these regions, thylakoid membranes were purified from chloroplasts isolated from Arabidopsis leaves and then “shaved” with trypsin to release surface-exposed peptides from the various constituent proteins (Fig.1 A). Although a variety of proteins were digested, several proteins and/or protein domains that we presume were protected by the membrane remained intact. LC-ESI MS analyses of the released fraction revealed approximately a thousand major peptides liberated by this protease treatment. By using the characteristic decomposition products of phosphopeptides following the breakdown of phosphoryl-peptide linkages as a signature (5Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), numerous phosphopeptides were identified. We enriched for phosphopeptides by immobilized metal [Fe(III) and/or Ga(III)] affinity chromatography (IMAC) (31Andersson L. Porath J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 32Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Because the binding specificity and elution properties of Fe(III) and Ga(III) IMAC differ, both were used to isolate a range of phosphopeptides (see Table I). Although nonphosphorylated peptides were also present in the eluted fractions, the partial purification of phosphopeptides by IMAC greatly simplified their identification and initial analysis.Table IPhosphorylation sites of the major phosphopeptides from Arabidopsis thylakoidsPeptide sequencePeptide massEnriched by IMAC withParent proteinFe(III)Ga(III)amuAc-TpAILER823.4++D1Ac-TpIALGK723.4+−D2Ac-TpLFNGTLALAGR1354.6++CP43Ac-TpLFDGTLALAGR1355.6++CP431-aCPH43 represents the N-terminal peptide of CP43 protein with deamidated Asn-4.TpVAKPK722.4+−LHCIIAc-RKTpVAKPK1048.8+−LHCII1-aCPH43 represents the N-terminal peptide of CP43 protein with deamidated Asn-4.ATpQTVEDSSR1172.8+−PsbHATpQTpVEDSSR1252.6+−PsbH1-bPsbH represents the doubly phosphorylated N-terminal peptide of PsbH protein bearing a phosphate at both Thr-2 and Thr-4.The + and − indicate the type of IMAC that allowed enrichment of the phosphopeptide as determined by subsequent MS sequencing.1-a CPH43 represents the N-terminal peptide of CP43 protein with deamidated Asn-4.1-b PsbH represents the doubly phosphorylated N-terminal peptide of PsbH protein bearing a phosphate at both Thr-2 and Thr-4. Open table in a new tab The + and − indicate the type of IMAC that allowed enrichment of the phosphopeptide as determined by subsequent MS sequencing. During MALDI-TOF-MS, phosphopeptides lose phosphoric acid as H3PO4 (98 Da) and HPO3 (80 Da) with the concomitant production of metastable ions (6Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Whereas both the metastable and parent phosphopeptide ions arrive at the detector simultaneously and thus produce one coherent signal in the linear mode, they generate separate signals in the reflector mode, with the metastable ions arriving sooner than the parent ion. The appearance of this metastable ion is especially evident for peptides containing phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, which generate intense daughter signals upon losing H3PO4 (98 Da) (6Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In our experimental settings, these metastable ions actually appeared as ions 86 m/z rather than 98 m/zsmaller than the parent ions (Fig. 1 B). This difference was a result of the metastable ion flying out of focus from the ion mirror, a phenomenon that also led to a broad ion signal that is characteristic of an ion lacking isotope resolution (Fig. 1 B). From the analysis of a series of synthetic phosphopeptides (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found that all generated this metastable ion peak in the reflector mode regardless of the amino acid sequence or position of the phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residue. 2A. V. Vener, A. Harms, and R. D. Vierstra, unpublished data. In fact, doubly phosphorylated peptides produced two metastable ions in the reflector mode, 86 m/z and 172 m/zsmaller than the parent ion. We could reliably detect these metastable ions with as little as femtomole amounts of these synthetic phosphopeptides, indicating that they could be detected with high sensitivity. Thus, we exploited the presence of metastable signal in the reflector mode at −86 m/z and its unique shape as a reliable indicator for phosphopeptides. Using this metastable ion signature, numerous phosphopeptides were detected by MALDI-TOF MS in the IMAC-enriched fractions of peptides released from thylakoids of light-adapted plants. As an example, Fig. 1shows the MALDI-TOF MS detection of a single ion cluster at 1355.6m/z in the linear mode (Fig. 1 C) that behaved as two ion clusters in the reflector mode, one for the parent ion at 1355.6 m/z and another for the metastable ion at 1269.6 m/z, which was 86m/z smaller and devoid of isotope resolution (Fig. 1 B). By this approach we detected eight phosphopeptides abundant in the IMAC-enriched fractions (Table I). In several cases, we also detected these phosphopeptides in the crude trypsin hydrolysates before IMAC enrichment. As shown in Fig. 1,D and E, the metastable 1269.6m/z ion for the 1355.6 parent ion was readily detected in the reflector mode but absent in the linear mode. The thylakoid phosphopeptides identified by MALDI-TOF MS were sequenced using MALDI-TOF PSD, ESI MS/MS, and LC with online ESI-skimmer CID MS. MALDI-PSD MS of the 1355.6 m/z phosphopeptide identified its sequence as Ac-TLFNGTLALAGR (Fig.2 A). A search of theArabidopsis protein sequence data base revealed that this sequence belonged to the chloroplast-encoded CP43 subunit of PSII, assuming that the first 14 amino acids of the initial translation product were removed and the resulting N-terminal threonine residue was acetylated. Because the phosphate moiety is readily lost from phosphopeptides during MALDI-TOF-MS, we used complementary ESI-CID MS sequencing to unambiguously identify the phosphorylation site(s). The most efficient method was the ESI-skimmer CID MS when used online with LC separation of IMAC-enriched peptides. Fig. 2 B shows the mass spectrum containing mostly y (C-terminal) andb (N-terminal) ion fragments of the N-terminal phosphopeptide from CP43. The fragmentation pattern was consistent with the N-terminal threonine being both N-acetylated andO-phosphorylated. The LC with online ESI-skimmer CID MS also revealed the presence of an unexpected isoform of CP43 in which the amino acid at position 4 was aspartic acid not asparagine (Fig. 2 C). This aspartate isoform was found in all thylakoid preparations isolated from plants under a variety of conditions and comprised ∼15% of the total CP43 pool. Given that the Arabidopsis CP43 gene encodes asparagine at this position (34Sato S. Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Asamizu E. Tanaka S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), it is likely that this isoform was created by a deamidation reaction, the nature of which is currently unknown. By similar analysis, we determined the sequence of the seven other phosphopeptides and identified the corresponding proteins in theArabidopsis sequence data bases (Table I). Besides CP43, the D1 and D2 proteins of the PSII reaction center were identified and found to also contain an N-terminal threonine that was bothN-acetylated and O-phosphorylated. We identified two phosphopeptides that corresponded to the mature LHCII polypeptides phosphorylated at the Thr-3 (Table I). One represented the expected tryptic fragment (TPVAKPK) whereas the other was two amino acids longer and N-acetylated (Ac-RKTPVAKPK). The second form likely represented an incomplete digestion product caused by the phosphate at Thr-3 blocking trypsin cleavage after Lys-2. The PsbH protein of PSII was phosphorylated at Thr-2. Notably, we also found a doubly phosphorylated form of this peptide containing a second phosphate bound to Thr-4 (Fig. 2 D and Table I). The doubly phosphorylated form of PsbH was also detected in spinach thylakoids, suggesting that its presence is widespread in higher plants.2 To study the phosphorylation state of these principalArabidopsis thylakoid proteins in different physiological conditions, we developed an ESI MS method to compare the levels of the phospho and nonphospho forms for each. First, we determined the LC elution positions of the eight phosphopeptides present in the complete tryptic peptide mixtures without IMAC enrichment. This LC separation did not completely resolve these complex mixtures but did make spectrometric identification of separate peptide ions in each fraction possible (Fig. 3 A). Following LC, the peptides were detected online by ESI-MS and their masses were determined from full scan data in the positive-ion mode. Phosphopeptides were concurrently identified by switching to the negative-ion mode every 6 s; this mode led to peptide fragmentation and production of ions of −79 m/z, which are diagno"

These proteins contain a nucleotide-binding (NB) self-oligomerization domain and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). A novel human protein was identified, NAC, that contains anNB domain and CARD. The CARD of NAC interacts selectively with the CARD domain of Apaf1, a caspase-activating protein that couples mitochondria-released cytochrome c (cyt-c) to activation of cytosolic caspases. Cyt-c-mediated activation of caspases in cytosolic extracts and in cells is enhanced by overexpressing NAC and inhibited by reducing NAC using antisense/DNAzymes. Furthermore, association of NAC with Apaf1 is cyt c-inducible, resulting in a mega-complex (>1 MDa) containing both NAC and Apaf1 and correlating with enhanced recruitment and proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-9. NAC also collaborates with Apaf1 in inducing caspase activation and apoptosis in intact cells, whereas fragments of NAC representing only the CARD or NB domain suppress Apaf1-dependent apoptosis induction.

The founding member of this family, CED4, was discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in screens for genes that are essential for developmental programmed cell death (1Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). CED4 contains an N-terminal CARD1 followed by an NB domain, the later containing classical Walker A and B box motifs recognized as important in binding nucleotide triphosphates. CED4 functions as an activator of the caspase, CED3, in vitro andin vivo (2Seshagiri S. Miller L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 455-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chinnaiyan A. Chaudhary D. O'Rourke K. Koonin E. Dixit V. Nature. 1997; 388: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The NB domain of CED4 oligomerizes in an ATP-dependent manner (4Yang X. Chang H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Reed J.C. Godzik A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas the CARD binds a complementary N-terminal CARD found in the zymogen proform of CED3 (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Protease activation is thought to result from the induced proximity of CED3 zymogens bound to oligomerized CED4, where the weak intrinsic protease activity of the proenzymes is sufficient for trans-proteolysis of closely juxtaposed pro-caspases (4Yang X. Chang H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of pro-CED3 then produces the large and small subunits of the heterotetrameric, autonomously active enzyme. The closest homologue of CED4 identified in humans and other mammals thus far is Apaf1 (apoptosis protease-activating factor-1) (8Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Similar to CED4, the Apaf1 protein contains a CARD, followed by an NB domain that shares significant amino acid sequence identity with the NB domains of CED4 and a family of ATPases associated with pathogen resistance (R genes) in plants (3Chinnaiyan A. Chaudhary D. O'Rourke K. Koonin E. Dixit V. Nature. 1997; 388: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Reed J.C. Godzik A.

Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), thus constituting the NB-ARC (Apaf-1/R gene/CED4) domain family (also known as NACHT domain). Unlike CED4, however, the NB-ARC domain of Apaf1 is followed by multiple WD repeats. These WD domains participate in auto-repression of Apaf1, locking it into an inactive, unoligomerized state until bound by cyt-c. In response to multiple cell death stimuli, changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability result in release of cyt-c into the cytosol, where it binds and activates Apaf-1, thus coupling mitochondrial damage to a mechanism for caspase activation (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Cyt-c, in conjunction with dATP or ATP, induces formation of a large Apaf1 oligomer (estimated to be an octamer), via its NB-ARC domain, and exposes the CARD of Apaf1 for interactions with a complementary CARD found in the N-terminal prodomain of pro-caspase-9 (11Srinivasula S.M.

By the induced proximity method, juxtaposed pro-caspase-9 (pro-Casp9) zymogens then trans-proteolyze each other, generating the characteristic large and small subunits typical of activated caspases. Active caspase-9 bound to oligomerized Apaf1 then directly cleaves and activates pro-caspase-3, an effector caspase that is responsible both for cleavage and activation of additional downstream caspases and for direct cleavage of a variety of substrate proteins that commit the cell to an apoptotic demise. A close homologue of Apaf1 has recently been identified in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, apparently operating as a caspase-activator via a similar cyt-c-inducible mechanism (15Rodriguez A. Oliver H. Zou H. Chen P. Wang X. Abrams J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 16Zhou L. Song Z. Tittel J. Steller H. Mol.

Gene ablation studies in mice and flies indicate that Apaf1 plays a critical role in programmed cell death in certain tissues and in response to many types of cell death stimuli in vivo (18Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification and initial functional characterization of a novel regulator of Apaf1, which we have termed NAC. The NAC cDNA sequence was found using PSI-BLAST and the CARD sequence of CARD4/Nod1 as query. This search revealed homology with a predicted protein of EST clone KIAA0926 in the Kazusa DNA Research Institute brain genomic data base. Jurkat total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNAs with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and random hexanucleotide primers. Three overlapping cDNA fragments of NAC were amplified using Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and three sets of oligonucleotide primers as follows: set 1, 5′-CCGAATTCACCATGGCTGGCGGAGCCTGGGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAACAGAGGGTTGTGGTGGTCTTG-3′ (reverse); set 2, 5′-CCCGAATTCGAACCTCGCATAGTCATACTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCCCACAACAGAATTCAATCTCAACGGTC-3′ (reverse);, and set 3, 5′-TGTGATGAGAGAAGCGGTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCAAAGAAGGGTCAGCCAAAGC-3′ (reverse). The resultant cDNA fragments were ligated into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-Myc. From these overlapping cDNA fragments, full-length NAC cDNA was assembled in pcDNA3-Myc and pcDNA3-HA at EcoRI and XhoI cloning sites. The nucleotide sequence of the assembled full-length NAC was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The regions encoding the CARD or the NB domain (amino acids 329–547) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from Jurkat cDNA using primer set 3 and the primers 5′- CCCGAATTCGAACCTCGCATAGTCATACTGC-3′ (forward) and CCGCTCGAGTCAACAGAGGGTTGTGGTGGTCTTG-3′ (reverse), respectively. The resultant polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA3-Myc and into vector pGEX-4T1 for GST fusion protein production. Polyclonal antisera were generated in rabbits using keyhole limpet hemocyanin- and ovalbumin-conjugated (Pierce) synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to residues aa 161–180 (Bur241) or aa 1058–1077 (Bur242) of NAC. Mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing human APAF1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Epitope-specific antibodies for FLAG, HA, or Myc tag were obtained from Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. An anti-NAC DNAzyme oligonucleotide was designed by the method of Joyce (19Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), targeting the translation initiation region of NAC mRNA and containing 2-O-methylnucleosides at the 5′-end and an inverted thymidine at the 3′-end for nuclease resistance. The sequences of the catalytic (AS) and control (C) noncatalytic oligonucleotides are as follows: AS, 5′-(2-O-MeC2-O-MeCAGCCAGGCTAGCTA-CAACGACTCTGTCC-InvT)-3′, and (C, 5′-(2-O-MeC2-O-MeCAGCCAGGCTACCTACAACGACTCTGTCC-InvT)-3′, respectively (Operon Technologies). Normal human tissues for immunohistochemistry analysis were obtained from biopsy and autopsy specimens, fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma), and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were immunostained using a diaminobenzidine-based detection method employing the Envision-Plus-horseradish peroxide system (Dako). Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses, cells were lysed in either buffer A (142.4 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for cytoplasmic extracts), buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, for hypotonic lysis), or ELB (50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40, for whole cell extracts), all supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies and protein G or A beads. Immune complexes were resolved in SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodies followed by detection using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (20Cardone M.

GST fusion proteins were expressed from pGEX-4T1 in XL-1-blue Escherichia colicells (Stratagene) and affinity-purified using GSH-Sepharose. Purified GST fusion proteins (0.1–0.5 μg) immobilized on 10–15 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 100 μl of buffer A for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT-lysate; Promega) containing 35S-labeled, IVT proteins in 100 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Proteins on beads were washed four times in 500 μl of buffer A, followed by boiling in 20 μl of Laemmli-SDS sample buffer, SDS-PAGE and detection by fluorography. Cytosolic extracts were prepared using buffer B (above) as described (21Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) and incubated (1.5 mg) with cyt-c (10 μm) and dATP (1 mm) for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 100 μm ZVAD-fmk was added. The treated protein lysates were immediately fractionated by using a Superose-6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column in elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Column fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed for NAC and Apaf1 by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Cytosolic extracts were prepared in hypotonic buffer B as described (21Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) and incubated (10 μg) with various concentrations of cyt-c and 1 mm dATP in Caspase buffer (21Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 30 °C. Caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (100 μm) (Calbiochem) was then added, and protease activity was measured continuously by monitoring the release of fluorigenic AFC at 37 °C. Alternatively, transfected cells were directly lysed in Caspase Lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA), normalized for protein content, and monitored for cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AFC as described (21Deveraux Q.L.

Processing of IVT35S-labeled pro-caspase-9 in cytosolic extracts was monitored by SDS-PAGE (20Cardone M. Roy N. Stennicke H. Salvesen G. Franke T. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pEGFP (CLONTECH) and effector plasmids using SuperFect transfection reagents (Qiagen) as indicated. After culturing 1.5 days in media containing reduced serum (0.1% fetal bovine serum), floating and adherent cells (recovered by trypsinization) were pooled, and cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS, stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the percentage of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic morphology (nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation) was determined by fluorescence microscopy (20Cardone M.

Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of the CARD domain of NAC was generated using the MODELLER program, essentially as described (22Schendel S. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B. Reed J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), based on the structures of the CARDs of Apaf1, pro-Casp9, and Raidd (23Chou J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Qin H. Srinivasula S. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NAC-encoding cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, revealing a continuous open reading frame encoding a 1473-amino acid protein (Fig.1). The predicted NAC protein contains an NB domain, followed by leucine-rich repeats (LRR), and a CARD domain. Thus, unlike Apaf1/CED4 family proteins that also contain CARD and NB domains, the CARD domain of NAC is located at its C rather than N terminus. The NB domain of NAC contains classical Walker A and B boxes indicative of ATP-binding proteins and is most similar in amino acid sequence to the NB domain of Nod1/CARD4 (29%) (25Bertin J. Nir W.-J. Fischer C. Tayber O. Errada P. Grant J. Keilty J. Gosselin M. Robison K. Wong G. Glucksmann M. DiStefano P. J. Biol.

Moreover, recombinant NAC NB domain was observed to bind ATP and to self-associate in an ATP-dependent mannerin vitro (not shown). The CARD domain of NAC shares 21, 19, and 8% amino acid identity with the CARD domains of Nod1/CARD4, huApaf1, and CED4, respectively (Fig. 1 D). The NAC CARD sequence was readily threaded onto the structures of other CARDs using the MODELLER program (Fig. 1 E), suggesting conservation of the 6 α-helical fold typical of these domains (23Chou J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The LRRs of NAC are reminiscent of Nod1/CARD4 and plant stress-response (R) proteins, which also contain LRRs. In NB-containing plant R proteins, the LRRs function as interaction motifs for pathogen responses (9Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of these structures in linking NAC to specific signaling pathways. Additional NAC cDNAs were obtained that presumably represent alternative mRNA splicing products that encode shorter proteins lacking 31- or 45-amino acid segments (or both) located between the LLR and CARD (Fig. 1). NAC mRNAs were widely expressed in human tissues, with highest levels found in blood leukocytes, thymus, spleen, and heart (Fig.2 A). Antisera were raised against synthetic NAC peptides and confirmed to bind specifically the NAC protein by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig.2 B, and not shown). NAC protein was detected in several adult human tissues, with highest levels in kidney, brain, and epidermis among the tissues examined (Fig. 2 C). A smaller anti-NAC immunoreactive band was detected in thymus lysates, which remains to be characterized (Fig. 2 C). Differences in NAC mRNA and protein expression in some tissues suggest the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation (Fig. 2, A andC). Immunohistochemical analysis of the in vivo patterns of NAC expression in adult human tissues demonstrated association with differentiation in stratified epithelia of the skin, esophagus, intestine, and cervix, as well as in the prostate gland where differentiated luminal secretory cells were NAC-immunopositive and undifferentiated basal cells were immunonegative (Fig. 2 Dand not shown). Differentiated macrophages and granulocytes were also strongly NAC-immunopositive (3–4 intensity/on 0–4 scale), whereas their bone marrow precursors were immunonegative (not shown). In the testis, NAC immunointensity also increased in concert with the differentiation program from spermatocytes (negative), to spermatids (0–1 intensity/on 0–4 scale), to spermatozoa (1–2 intensity), reaching highest intensity in the residual bodies that represent cellular remnants (2–3 intensity) (not shown). Thus, NAC expression is associated with differentiation of some types of short lived cellsin vivo. In vitro binding experiments were performed using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the CARD of NAC. The CARD of NAC bound efficiently to itself and also interacted selectively in vitro with the CARDs of Apaf1, Nod1, and CED4 but not with the CARDs of Bcl10, pro-Casp9, pro-caspase-1, pro-caspase-2, pro-caspase-11, Raidd, or Cardiak (RIP2) (Fig. 2 A and not shown). The ability of NAC to interact with itself, Apaf1, Nod1, and CED4 in cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins from transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 B and not shown). The endogenous ∼160-kDa NAC protein could also be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Apaf1 (but not Nod1) from cells that intrinsically express NAC, using anti-NAC antisera (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, compared with full-length Apaf1, NAC coimmunoprecipitated more efficiently with a truncation mutant of Apaf1 which lacks the WD repeats that normally maintain this protein in an auto-repressed state (14Adrain C. Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20855-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that “activated” Apaf1 interacts preferentially with NAC (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with this observation, association of full-length Apaf1 with NAC was inducible by stimuli such as staurosporine, which trigger cyt-c release and result in Apaf1 activation (27Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng I.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). Before exposure to death stimuli, relatively little NAC was coimmunoprecipitated with Apaf1, but within 10 min NAC/Apaf1 complexes were readily detected (Fig.3 E). Since Apaf1 is known to form complexes with pro-Casp9 (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of NAC on Apaf1/pro-Casp9 interactions by coimmunoprecipitation. Overexpression of NAC by transient transfection in HEK293 cells increased the relative amount of Apaf1 that coimmunoprecipitated with pro-Casp9 (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that NAC enhances rather than inhibits interactions of these proteins. These coimmunoprecipitation experiments also hinted that NAC may exist in a complex simultaneously with Apaf1 and pro-Casp9, since NAC was recovered in anti-Casp9 immunoprecipitates when Apaf1 was coexpressed (Fig. 3 C), even though NAC cannot directly bind pro-Casp9 (Fig. 3 A and not shown) and was not recovered in anti-Casp9 immune complexes when Apaf1 was not coexpressed (Fig.3 B). Cyt-c induces formation of a large holoenzyme complex (apoptosome) containing multiple Apaf1 and Casp9 molecules in an estimated 8:8 stoichiometry (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The apoptosome can be monitored by gel-sieve chromatography of cyt-c-stimulated cytosolic extracts and typically migrates at ∼700 kDa (28Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, a larger apoptosome of >1 MDa has been reported in some types of cells, suggesting that other proteins may associate with the Apaf1-Casp9 complex (29Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In cyt-c-stimulated extracts from HEK293 cells, which contain relative little endogenous NAC, as determined by immunoblotting (not shown), a single Apaf1-containing apoptosome of ∼700 kDa was observed by gel-sieve chromatography (Fig. 2 F). However, in extracts from NAC-transfected HEK293 cells, two Apaf1-containing apoptosomes were evident, including a large >1 MDa complex that contained both Apaf1 and NAC (as determined by coimmunoprecipitation analysis of the column fractions in which Apaf1 and NAC coeluted) (Fig. 2 F). Similarly, in cells that contain relative high levels of endogenous NAC, such as Jurkat T-cells, the endogenous NAC and Apaf1 molecules coeluted in gel-sieve experiments, revealing two apoptosomes where greater amounts of NAC were present in the larger of these multiprotein complexes (Fig. 2 F, top). In extracts lacking cyt-c treatment, Apaf1 eluted as a monomer, whereas NAC was spread over multiple fractions without a clear elution peak (not shown). Also, NAC did not coelute in gel-sieve chromatography experiments with Nod1 using untreated or cyt-c-stimulated extracts, 2Z.-L. Chu, F. Pio, Z. Xie, K. Welsh, M. Krajewska, S. Krajewski, A. Godzik, and J. C. Reed, unpublished observations. confirming that NAC associates selectively with the Apaf1 apoptosome. To explore whether the Apaf1-containing apoptosome with which NAC associates displays caspase activity, endogenous NAC was immunoprecipitated from control- and cyt-c-stimulated Jurkat cell extracts, and associated caspase activity was measured based on cleavage of the fluorigenic caspase-substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (21Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that NAC is associated with active caspases after but not before cyt-c stimulation (Fig.4 A). Control immunoprecipitates lacked significant caspase activity, confirming the specificity of these results. Although activities of different size apoptosomes can vary depending on salt concentrations, use of detergents, and the presence of endogenous inhibitors (X-chromosone-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and second mitochondrial activator of caspases) (29Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar),2 these findings argue that the larger apoptosome containing NAC is active. In HEK293 cells, which contain little endogenous NAC, overexpression of NAC by transient transfection promotes formation predominantly of the larger >1-MDa apoptosome upon cyt-c stimulation, with relatively little of the smaller ∼700-kDa apoptosome present (Fig.3 F). To contrast the function of Apaf1 in the presence and absence of NAC, therefore, we compared cyt-c-induced proteolytic processing of pro-Casp9 and activation of downstream caspases (Ac-DEVD-AFC cleavage) in extracts prepared from control- and NAC-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 B). Extracts containing elevated NAC displayed increased processing of pro-Casp9 and greater cyt-c-induced activation of downstream caspases, suggesting that NAC enhances Apaf1 activity. Conversely, reducing NAC protein levels using antisense expression plasmids (not shown) or antisense/DNAzyme oligonucleotides decreased the ability of cyt-c to activate caspases in cell extracts in vitro. Fig. 4 C, for example, shows experiments performed using Jurkat cells, which contain relatively higher levels of endogenous NAC, demonstrating DNAzyme-mediated ablation of NAC protein without concomitant changes in the levels of Apaf1. Extracts prepared from anti-NAC DNAzyme-treated Jurkat cells were less sensitive to cyt-c compared with control oligonucleotide-treated cells, in terms of caspase activation. In contrast, sensitivity to granzyme B-mediated caspase activation was not affected, confirming a specific defect in the cyt-c pathway which depends on Apaf1 for caspase activation. Further evidence that NAC regulates the cyt-c/Apaf1-dependent activation of caspases in cell extracts was obtained by affinity preabsorption of NAC from extracts using a GST fusion protein containing the CARD of NAC and by expression in cells of a dominant-negative fragment of NAC consisting of only the CARD domain (not shown). Consistent with experiments involving cell extracts, NAC also collaborated with Apaf1 in inducing caspase activation and apoptosis in intact cells. In transient transfection experiments using HEK293 (Fig.4, D and E) or other cell lines (not shown), overexpression of NAC by itself (not shown) or in combination with pro-Casp9 had little effect on caspase activation or apoptosis. In contrast, overexpressing NAC together with Apaf1 and pro-Casp9 resulted in synergistic increases in activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis, as determined from cotransfections that employed suboptimal amounts of Apaf1-encoding plasmid (Fig. 4, D andE). Overexpression of NAC also sensitized cells to suboptimal concentrations of apoptosis inducers such as staurosporine, which triggers apoptosis through an Apaf1-dependent mechanism (30Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), but not by anti-Fas antibody which utilizes an Apaf1-independent pathway (Fig. 4 E and not shown). Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that the enhanced sensitivity of NAC-transfected cells to staurosporine was not due to differences in the levels of Apaf1 or pro-Casp9 proteins produced in cells (not shown). Whereas full-length NAC enhanced apoptosis and caspase activation induced by overexpressing Apaf1 or by treatment of cells with Apaf1-dependent apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 4, D andE), fragments of NAC containing only the CARD or NB domain had the opposite effect, interfering with apoptosis induced by coexpression of Apaf1/pro-Casp9 and by Apaf1-dependent stimuli such as staurosporine without affecting Apaf1-independent pathways activated by Fas (Fig. 4 F). Again, immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that these reductions in Apaf1-dependent apoptosis caused by these dominant-negative fragments of NAC were not secondary to effects on levels of the Apaf1 or pro-Casp9 proteins (not shown). Although some CARD-containing proteins, including Nod1/CARD-4 (25Bertin J. Nir W.-J. Fischer C. Tayber O. Errada P. Grant J. Keilty J. Gosselin M. Robison K. Wong G. Glucksmann M. DiStefano P. J.

Cells of various tissues vary in their sensitivity to cyt-c-induced activation of caspases, a finding that cannot be accounted for by differences in the levels of Apaf1 protein or downstream caspases (33Burgess D.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The discovery of NAC suggests a mechanism for fine-tuning Apaf1 function, based on whether NAC is expressed and perhaps on whether NAC interacts with unidentified proteins via its LRR or other domains. Apaf1/CED4 family proteins directly bind CARD-containing caspases, promoting protease activation upon oligomerization by bringing the suboptimally active pro-enzymes into close proximity, allowing them to trans-process each other (4Yang X.

Although NAC enhances cyt-c-mediated pro-Casp9 processing, it does not directly bind this caspase (nor caspases-1, -2, -6, -7, -8, -10, or -11).2Rather, interactions of NAC with Apaf1 facilitate Apaf1-mediated activation of pro-Casp9, thus revealing a new paradigm for apoptosis regulation. The precise mechanism by which NAC enhances Apaf1 function remains to be elucidated. We thank E. Alnemri for caspase-9 and Apaf1 cDNAs; G. Joyce for DNAzyme design; H.

ABC transporter trafficking induced by cAMP or taurocholate is a physiologic response to a temporal demand for increased bile secretion. Administration of cAMP or taurocholate to rats increased amounts of SPGP, MDR1, and MDR2 in the bile canalicular membrane by 3-fold; these effects abated after 6 h and were insensitive to prior treatment of rats with cycloheximide. Half-lives of ABC transporters were 5 days, which suggests cycling of ABC transporters between canalicular membrane and intrahepatic sites before degradation. In vivo [35S]methionine labeling of rats followed by immunoprecipitation of (sister of P-glycoprotein) (SPGP) from subcellular liver fractions revealed a steady state distribution after 20 h of SPGP between canalicular membrane and a combined endosomal fraction. After mobilization of transporters from intrahepatic sites with cAMP or taurocholate, a significant increase in the amount of ABC transporters in canalicular membrane vesicles was observed, whereas the decrease in the combined endosomal fraction remained below detection limits in Western blots. This observation is in accordance with relatively large intracellular ABC transporter pools compared with the amount present in the bile canalicular membrane. Furthermore, trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP through intrahepatic sites was accelerated by additional administration of cAMP but not by taurocholate, indicating two distinct intrahepatic pools. Our data indicate that ABC transporters cycle between the bile canaliculus and at least two large intrahepatic ABC transporter pools, one of which is mobilized to the canalicular membrane by cAMP and the other, by taurocholate. In parallel to regulation of other membrane transporters, we propose that the “cAMP-pool” in hepatocytes corresponds to a recycling endosome, whereas recruitment from the “taurocholate-pool” involves a hepatocyte-specific mechanism.

Recent studies indicate that the amount of each ABC transporter in the canalicular membrane is regulated by the physiological demand to secrete bile acids. Intravenous administration to rats of dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) or taurocholate (TC) rapidly and selectively increased the functional activity and amount of each ABC transporter in the canalicular membrane; these effects were inhibited by prior administration of colchicine, which disrupts microtubules (11Gatmaitan Z.C.

ATP-dependent transport activity of SPGP and MRP2 within the bile canalicular membrane requires active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and is regulated by 3′-phosphorinositide products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (13Misra S. Ujhazy P. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5814-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are essential for biliary secretion in mammalian liver, and their amounts and activities in the canalicular membrane are tightly regulated. Inherited defects in SPGP and MRP2 proteins result in familial intrahepatic cholestasis (for review, see Ref. 14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Paumgartner G. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 3-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, defects in trafficking and regulation of ABC transporters may result in insufficient amounts or activity of ABC transporters in the bile canalicular membrane, the consequences of which are impaired bile secretion and cholestasis (15Kipp H. Arias I.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The increase in the content of ABC transporters in the canalicular membrane after administration of Bt2cAMP or TC in vivo (11Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar) and in isolated perfused rat liver (12Misra S. Ujhazy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 5814-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) occurred within minutes after the administration of the effectors. These observations suggest that the increment in canalicular ABC transporters is likely to represent recruitment from pre-existing intrahepatic pools rather than from enhanced transcription or translation. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of Bt2cAMP and TC resulted in additive rather than alternative effects (11Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Bt2cAMP and TC recruit ABC transporters to the canalicular membrane from different intrahepatic pools. Moreover, investigations of Golgi-to-bile canaliculus pathways of newly synthesized ABC transporters (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Sai Y Nies A.T. Arias I.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also suggest that SPGP, in particular, is sequestered in intrahepatic pools before reaching the bile canalicular plasma membrane. The present report concerns biochemical identification and characterization of these intrahepatic ABC transporter pools and identification of possible mechanisms by which ABC transporters are made available to the canalicular membrane. Expre35S35S protein label was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were of highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody C219 (anti-MDR1/MDR2) was from Centocor (Malvern, PA). Polyclonal anti-SPGP antibody LVT90 was developed in our laboratory (15Kipp H. Arias I.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-cCAM105 antibody was a gift from S. H. Lin (Houston, TX). Antibodies against Rab proteins were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Young adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) kept on a standard diet were used for preparation of liver subcellular fractions. In some experiments, rats were pretreated by intravenous injection with Bt2cAMP (20 μmol/kg) or TC (50 μmol/kg) dissolved in 1 ml of PBS for the indicated time periods. In control experiments, rats received 1 ml of PBS. Further experimental details are stated in the figure legends. Preparation and characteristics of rat liver canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV), sinusoidal/basolateral membrane vesicles (SMV), and Golgi membranes were described previously (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J.

A combined endosomal fraction (CEF) from rat liver was prepared using the protocol of Khan et al. (20Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation from subcellular rat liver fractions were performed as described earlier (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, polypeptides were electrotransferred (22Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar) on nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Milipore) for the Rab proteins. Antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection with an enhanced chemiluminescence system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for protein measurements with bovine serum albumin as standard. Gatmaitan et al. (11Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that intravenous injection of rats with Bt2cAMP or TC increased the amount of canalicular proteins in the bile canalicular membrane. To determine the duration and magnitude of the response to Bt2cAMP and TC administration, we investigated the time courses of these effects. Groups of rats were injected with either Bt2cAMP (20 μmol/kg) or TC (50 μmol/kg) for various time periods, and canalicular amounts of ABC transporters were determined in CMVs by Western blotting (Fig.1). We demonstrated earlier that monoclonal C219 antibody is specific for rat MDR1 and MDR2 and that polyclonal LVT90 antibody is specific for SPGP (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After treatment with Bt2cAMP, an increase in MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP in CMVs was observed after 15 min; the effect peaked at 45 min to 4 h and disappeared after 6 h. TC treatment resulted in a significant increase in MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP after 15 min; the effect peaked at 45 to 90 min and then declined to the basal level after 4 h. From three sets of independent experiments, the maximal increase in the amount of ABC transporters in the canalicular membrane was 3.6 ± 0.9-fold after stimulation with Bt2cAMP and 2.7 ± 0.7-fold after treatment with TC. Onset and duration of the Bt2cAMP and TC effects probably depend on the dose of the injected drug, which has not been investigated in detail. However, the increase in ABC transporter amounts in the bile canaliculus caused by Bt2cAMP or TC is transient, which prompts two questions: Where do the additional ABC transporters originate from? Where do they go after the effects have abated? Additional ABC transporters in the bile canaliculus upon stimulation with Bt2cAMP or TC could theoretically result from enhanced protein biosynthesis and/or recruitment of transporters from pre-existing intracellular pools. To discriminate between these possibilities, we determined whether the increase in ABC transporters in the bile canaliculus remained when protein synthesis was inhibited. Protein biosynthesis was efficiently blocked by intraperitoneal injection of rats with cycloheximide (5 mg/kg) for 30 min. Pretreatment with cycloheximide completely abolished metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine of proteins in CMVs. This was demonstrated by detection of 35S-labeled proteins in CMVs with a scintillation counter and of radiolabeled proteins using PhosphorImager after separation of CMV proteins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Rats were injected intraperitonally with cycloheximide for 30 min followed by intravenous injection of either Bt2cAMP or TC for 1 h. CMVs were then prepared, and proteins from rat liver homogenate and CMVs were separated by SDS-PAGE. The amount of ABC transporters in both preparations was quantified by Western blotting with C219 (MDR1, MDR2) and LVT90 (SPGP) antibodies and compared with control experiments (Fig. 3). Cycloheximide inhibits protein biosynthesis; however, in some instances cycloheximide can also cause superinduction of proteins (24Cochran B.H. Zullo J. Verma I.M. Stiles C.D. Science. 1984; 226: 1080-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Ma Q. Renzelli A.J. Baldwin K.T. Antonini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12676-12683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In rat liver homogenate no significant change in the amount of ABC transporters was observed after pretreatment of rats with cycloheximide, Bt2cAMP, and TC in various combinations (Figs. 3, A and B). These data indicate that superinduction of proteins by cycloheximide is not a concern in our study regarding ABC transporters. The total amount of SPGP, MDR1, and MDR2 in rat liver remained constant after administration of cycloheximide, Bt2cAMP, and TC. Pretreatment of rats with cycloheximide for 30 min had no effect on the basal protein amount of MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP in CMVs. Cycloheximide pretreatment did not reduce the increase in ABC transporters in the bile canaliculus in response to Bt2cAMP or TC. Regardless of prior cycloheximide administration, Bt2cAMP or TC significantly increased the canalicular content of MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP when compared with control animals (Figs. 3, C andD). These experiments demonstrate that additional ABC transporters in the bile canalicular membrane after stimulation with Bt2cAMP or TC do not result from enhanced translation but from a redistribution between intrahepatic ABC transporter pools and the bile canalicular membrane. Where do the canalicular ABC transporters go after peak stimulation by Bt2cAMP or TC and their amounts in the bile canalicular membrane return to basal levels? Two possible scenarios were considered as follows. ABC transporters either return to intrahepatic sites, or in parallel with other canalicular protein receptors, they are degraded. The latter presumably should be manifested by relatively short half-lives for canalicular ABC transporters. Therefore, we determined the half-lives of the canalicular ABC transporters and compared the results to previously established half-lives of other hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins. A group of rats was labeled by intravenous injection with [35S]methionine for 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 days (without chase), and the content of newly synthesized MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP was determined by immunoprecipitation from CMVs and homogenate. The half-life of cCAM105 was also determined as a control. Protein half-lives were determined from semi-logarithmic plots of35S intensity versus labeling time (Fig.4). As observed earlier (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), MDR1 and MDR2 could not be immunoprecipitated with C219 antibody from liver homogenate, probably due to low abundance of the antigens. Assuming first order decay, cCAM105 had an apparent half-life of 5 days as measured in homogenates and CMVs, which corresponds to an earlier published report (26Scott L.J. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5-day half-life was also determined for MDR1 and MDR2 in CMVs. For SPGP, a half-life of 4 days was measured from CMVs and 6 days from homogenate. It is not clear why the apparent half-lives differ when determined from the two preparations. However, it has been observed before that the apparent half-lives of hepatic proteins are shorter when determined from plasma membranes as compared with results in homogenates (26Scott L.J. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-lives of several hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins are presented in Table I and were obtained from metabolic studies using radiolabeled amino acids. Except for nucleotide pyrophosphatase and the polymeric IgA receptor, which have short half-lives, all other hepatic plasma membrane proteins previously investigated have half-lives of 2–9 days. The short half-life of the polymeric IgA receptor is accounted for by extensive loss into the bile (26Scott L.J. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is difficult to prevent long term label reincorporation in vivo (26Scott L.J. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Elovson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5816-5825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data probably represent upper limits. Similar to other hepatic plasma membrane proteins (Table I), canalicular SPGP, MDR1, and MDR2 have relatively long half-lives (t 12 > 1 day) and are likely to undergo lysosomal degradation (31Mortimore G.E. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosomes: Their Role in Protein Breakdown.

Trafficking of ABC transporters from intrahepatic sites to the bile canalicular membrane is physiologic and results from increased need to secrete bile. Therefore, we postulate that canalicular ABC transporters cycle between the apical membrane and intrahepatic sites prior to undergoing degradation. A CEF from rat liver was prepared (20Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate the dynamics and steady state levels of SPGP in intrahepatic pools. CEFs, prepared by centrifugation of a microsomal fraction of rat liver on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, are highly enriched in endosomal markers Rab5 (early endosomes) and Rab11 (apical recycling endosomes) (32Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar) as compared with homogenates and CMV and SMV plasma membrane subfractions (Fig.5). In a recent paper (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we described trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP by investigating the kinetics of [35S]methionine-labeled SPGP in liver homogenate, Golgi membranes, CMVs, and SMVs. SPGP was never observed in SMVs, indicating nontranscytotic targeting. Furthermore, in study of SPGP trafficking, there was a 1.5-h lag between passage through Golgi and arrival at the canalicular membrane, which suggests transient sequestration in intrahepatic sites. We expanded this experiment to include CEF. Trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP after pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine through Golgi membranes, CEF, and CMVs is shown in Fig. 6. Radiolabeled SPGP peaked in Golgi membranes after a chase time of 30 min and thereafter was virtually absent from the Golgi, indicating that processing and passage of SPGP through Golgi is complete after 30–60 min. SPGP peaked in CEF at 1 h and, after a chase time of 2 h, first appeared in CMVs. These experiments demonstrate that newly synthesized SPGP is targeted through an endosomal compartment before reaching the bile canalicular membrane. Furthermore, SPGP is not completely transferred from CEF, and a significant amount of SPGP remains in the endosomal fraction. These results suggest a distribution of SPGP between canalicular membrane and intracellular pools (2- and 3-h chase). This was also observed after a chase time of 20 h, which presumably represents steady state distribution of SPGP between the bile canaliculus and intracellular pools under basal conditions. Immunoblots were used to determine the distribution of SPGP and MDR1/MDR2 between CMVs and CEF under steady state conditions and after induction of trafficking with Bt2cAMP or TC (Fig.7). Administration to rats of Bt2cAMP or TC for 1 h significantly increased the amounts of SPGP and MDR1/MDR2 in the canalicular membrane, whereas the amounts in liver homogenate remained constant. These data suggest a redistribution of existing ABC transporters between intracellular pools and the canalicular membrane upon stimulation with Bt2cAMP and TC. Surprisingly, no decrease in the ABC transporter amount could be detected in CEF; the amount of SPGP, MDR1, and MDR2 remained constant after stimulation with Bt2cAMP and TC. These observations can be best explained by a large intrahepatic pool of ABC transporters, only a small portion of which is present in the bile canalicular membrane. In this scenario, a small portion of ABC transporters trafficking from a large endosomal pool to a small bile canalicular pool results in significantly increased amount of ABC transporters in CMVs, whereas any decrease in ABC transporter amount in CEF remained below the detection limit. Newly synthesized SPGP is targeted through intrahepatic sites before reaching the bile canalicular membrane. This was concluded from the 1.5-h lag time between passage through Golgi and arrival at the hepatocyte apical pole (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by [35S]methionine metabolic pulse-chase labeling of a CEF from rat liver (Fig. 6). The pattern of ABC transporter trafficking after injection of rats with Bt2cAMP or TC also suggests the existence of intrahepatic pools. The two approaches were combined to determine whether intrahepatic SPGP pools, in which newly synthesized SPGP is sequestered before reaching the bile canaliculus, is also mobilized by Bt2cAMP and/or TC. Typically [35S]SPGP is first detected in CMVs after 2 h in metabolic labeling studies. Therefore, we determined whether [35S]SPGP can be detected in CMVs after 1 h of labeling after additional administration of Bt2cAMP or TC (Fig.8). As demonstrated before, treatment of rats with Bt2cAMP or TC for 30 min significantly increased the steady state amount of SPGP in CMVs. However, accelerated trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP to the bile canalicular membrane after 1 h was observed only when rats were pretreated with Bt2cAMP. Pretreatment with TC did not accelerate Golgi-to-bile canaliculus trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP. Altered schedules for TC administration 15 or 45 min after metabolic labeling also did not accelerate [35S]SPGP trafficking to the canalicular membrane (data not shown). Thus, trafficking of newly synthesized SPGP through intrahepatic pools to the bile canalicular membrane was accelerated by cAMP but not by TC. Previous morphological studies in rats rendered cholestatic by bile duct ligation (33Paulusma C.C. Kothe M.J. Bakker C.T. Bosma P.J. van Bokhoven I. van Marle J. Bolder U. Tytgat G.N. Oude Elferink R.P. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), phalloidin (34Rost D. Karterbeck J. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), or lipopolysaccharide (35Dombrowski F. Kubitz R. Chittattu A. Wettstein M. Saha N. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggest that MRP2 and SPGP may traffic from the bile canaliculus to intracellular sites. In addition, MRP2 (35Dombrowski F. Kubitz R. Chittattu A. Wettstein M. Saha N. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and SPGP (9Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) were observed by immunogold staining and electron microscopy in undefined vesicular structures that were distinct from the bile canaliculus. The present study demonstrates that selective increase in ABC transporters in the canalicular membrane after stimulation with cAMP or TC is independent of protein de novo synthesis, indicating that additional transporters, upon stimulation, are recruited from pre-existing intrahepatic pools. Stimulation by the second messenger, cAMP, and the SPGP substrate, TC, probably mimic naturally occurring processes. The cAMP and TC effects are transient, and the half-lives of SPGP, MDR1, and MDR2 are not significantly shorter than those of other hepatic plasma membrane proteins, which suggests that ABC transporters cycle between intrahepatic pools and the canalicular membrane. The steady state distribution of SPGP between intrahepatic pools and canalicular membrane is probably regulated by cAMP and TC depending on the physiological demand to secrete bile. Previous studies (11Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the increasing effects of Bt2cAMP and TC in bile canalicular ABC transporter amount are additive rather than alternative, which suggests the presence of at least two distinct intrahepatic pools of ABC transporters, one of which is mobilized to the canalicular membrane by Bt2cAMP (cAMP pool) and the other by TC (TC-pool). We here demonstrate that targeting of newly synthesized SPGP through intrahepatic sites to the bile canalicular membrane is accelerated by Bt2cAMP but not by TC. This observation supports the hypothesis of two distinct intrahepatic pools of SPGP. After passage through Golgi, SPGP accumulates in an intrahepatic cAMP pool and later equilibrates with the TC pool. Whether equilibration of newly synthesized SPGP with the TC pool occurs from the bile canalicular membrane or the cAMP pool remains unclear. A tentative model for intrahepatic pathways of ABC transporters is shown in Fig. 9. Newly synthesized MDR1 and MDR2 bypass the intracellular pools on their journey to the bile canaliculus (16Kipp H Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Sai Y Nies A.T. Arias I.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at steady state levels, MDR1 and MDR2 are also mobilized to the bile canalicular membrane by Bt2cAMP and TC, indicating that these ABC transporters also equilibrate with intrahepatic pools after reaching the bile canalicular membrane. Using metabolic pulse-chase [35S]methionine labeling, a CEF was identified to be the site at which newly synthesized SPGP accumulates before being targeted to the bile canalicular membrane. After newly synthesized SPGP reached the bile canalicular membrane, a significant amount remained in CEF 20 h after labeling, suggesting steady state distribution of SPGP between canalicular membrane and intrahepatic pools. Since absolute amounts of ABC transporters in the prepared membrane fractions are not known nor how much of the total amount in the rat hepatocyte they represent, precise calculation of the intrahepatic/canalicular ratio exceeds the limits of these experiments. For MRP2, this ratio has been calculated to be ∼1:1 by quantitation of immunogold-stained MRP2 in electron microscopy (35Dombrowski F. Kubitz R. Chittattu A. Wettstein M. Saha N. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in rat liver under basal conditions. Investigation of ABC transporters by immunoblots at steady state levels revealed that, after stimulation with Bt2cAMP or TC, the amounts of MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP significantly increased in CMVs, but no change was observed in CEF prepared from the same rat liver. This observation is in accordance with the presence of “large” intrahepatic pools. Under basal conditions, most MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP appears to reside in intrahepatic pools rather than in the canalicular membrane. However, the increase in the amount of ABC transporter in CMVs after stimulation with Bt2cAMP or TC is ∼3-fold for each effector. Taking into account that Bt2cAMP and TC recruit transporters from different intracellular sources, the intrahepatic pool of ABC transporters is at least 6-times more than the amount present in the bile canalicular membrane. Since this calculation presumes that all intracellular ABC proteins are translocated to the bile canalicular membrane upon stimulation, this number represents a lower limit. Thus, the intrahepatic/canalicular ratio of MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP probably exceeds 6:1. Upon stimulation with cAMP, trafficking of membrane transporters from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane has been described in several systems, i.e. (i) cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) channel into the apical surface of rat duodenal villous epithelia (36Ameen N.A. Martensson B. Bourguinon L. Marino C. Isenberg J. McLaughlin G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 887-894PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) sodium taurocholate cotransport protein (ntcp) in the basolateral membrane of rat hepatocytes (37Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) aquaporin-2 water channel into the apical membrane of LLC-PK1 cells, a polarized renal cell line (38Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14800-14804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar); (iv) H+/K+-ATPase into the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells (39Yao X. Karim S.M. Ramilo M. Rong Q. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C61-C73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (v) insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 into the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes (40Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S.

In each of these examples, recruitment of transporters to the plasma membrane from a recycling endosome has been suggested. In particular, trafficking of glucose transporter 4 in rat adipocytes has parallels to that of ABC transporter trafficking in rat hepatocytes. Glucose transporter 4 traffics from distinct intracellular sites to the plasma membrane in response to cAMP and insulin (40Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In analogy to these other systems, we propose that cAMP recruits ABC transporters to the bile canalicular membrane from a recycling endosome, whereas the effect of TC appears to be hepatocyte-specific and involves a different mechanism. The present study demonstrates that a substantial portion of canalicular ABC transporters resides in intracellular pools in hepatocytes and that the transporters can be transiently recruited from different intrahepatic pools to the bile canalicular membrane in response to cAMP and TC. Since ABC transporters are critical for bile formation, the present studies prompt revision of current concepts of bile secretion and raise a question with regard to the mechanism. Do intrahepatic pools of ABC transporters supply additional transporters to the bile canaliculus only to cope with temporarily higher metabolic demand to secrete bile, or are these intracellular ABC transporter pools part of an unidentified more sophisticated bile secretion mechanism? The latter possibility is supported by the finding that intrahepatic pools of MRP2, which also colocalize with SPGP, secrete a MRP2 substrate into intracellular structures (33Paulusma C.C. Kothe M.J.

A further challenge is the correlation of biochemically observed intrahepatic ABC transporter pools with morphological structures. In this regard, studies in Wif-B cells, a tissue culture model for functionally active, polarized hepatocytes (17Sai Y Nies A.T. Arias I.M. J.

Wif-B cells infected with an adenoviral construct containing SPGP tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein showed cycling of SPGP between the canalicular membrane and an intracellular compartment that colocalized with anti-Rab11 (recycling endosomes) antibody immunostaining (43Wakabayashi Y.

Full activation of the human iNOS (hiNOS) promoter by cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)) required downstream and upstream nuclear factor-κB (−115, −8283) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) (−5115, −5301) transcription factor binding sites.

Neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3) are constitutively present in a variety of cell types, with their activities sensitive to changes in intracellular calcium. Much larger amounts of NO are produced in response to numerous extracellular stimuli after induction of the calcium-insensitive iNOS (NOS2) (2Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). The transient burst of NO production by iNOS has been implicated in numerous biological processes (e.g. immune modulation, control of vascular tone) (3Nathan C. J. Clin.

Clues to the role of iNOS in physiologic and pathophysiologic states resulted from studies of its cellular and subcellular localization as well as the stimulatory elements and signaling pathways required for its induction (6Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, many of these studies were performed in animal models, which clearly do not reflect human physiology. For instance, NO production by iNOS in macrophages appears to be more important in mice than humans (7Morris S.M.J. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E829-E839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences among species in NO production and NOS expression in response to a given inflammatory stimulus may reflect differences in the cell signaling mechanisms that lead to iNOS gene transcription and/or in promoter structure. Transcriptional regulation is a crucial checkpoint in the initiation of cytokine-stimulated NO production by human iNOS (hiNOS) (8de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L.

JunD and Fra-2 were identified in the heterodimers that bound to upstream and downstream AP-1 sites in the 8.3-kb hiNOS promoter.

Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) represents a potential signaling mechanism for NO production during the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), and p38 MAPK pathways have been implicated in the activation of AP-1 (22Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar), which is involved in hiNOS promoter activation by cytokines (10Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). LPS, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which are present in human airways during Gram-negative infection, cause inflammation in part by initiating NO production by iNOS (23Thiemermann C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Because AP-1 and NF-κB activation are major determinants of hiNOS induction in A549 cells, we hypothesized that MAPK proteins were upstream signaling effectors of hiNOS promoter activation in response to LPS and cytokines. Using both pharmacological and molecular approaches, the involvement of p38 MAPK and ERK pathways in hiNOS promoter activation by cytokines and LPS/IFN-γ via binding of AP-1 to specific promoter sequences was demonstrated. A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL 185), a human alveolar type II epithelial cell-like lung adenocarcinoma cell line, were grown at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 K medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biofluids). To initiate experiments, cells were washed with serum-free medium and treated with or without inhibitors for 1 h before incubation for 6 h with cytokine mixture (CM) containing 100 units/ml IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β (Genzyme), and 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or a mixture of 100 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) and 100 units/ml IFN-γ. Erbstatin, genistein, SB203580, and PD98059 (Calbiochem) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were added directly to the cells. A549 cells were transfected with hiNOS promoter constructs linked to luciferase cDNA (PGL3-hiNOS) (10Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) without or with mammalian expression vectors containing cDNAs for various forms of MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1), MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3), and MKK6. Expression vectors for dominant negative MEK1 (pcDNA3-MEK1 dn), MKK6 (pcEFLGST-MKK6 dn), MKK3 (pcDNA3-MKK3 dn), as well as those for wild-type and constitutively active MKK3 (pcDNA-MKK3 wt, pcDNA-MKK3 ca) were kind gifts from Dr. J. S. Gutkind, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. In separate experiments, expression of the above proteins in A549 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). After 36 h, cells were induced with cytokines for 6 h before harvest of cells for luciferase activity determination (Luciferase Assay System Kit, Promega). hiNOS promoter regional sequence requirements for LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated activation were assessed using deletion mutants as reported previously (24Chu S.C. Marks-Konczalik J. Wu H.P. Banks T.C. Moss J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Luminescence units were expressed relative to total lysate protein, determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Luciferase activities of both stimulated (CM or LPS/IFN-γ) and unstimulated cells are the means of values from at least two independent experiments with assays in triplicate. The fold induction was calculated by dividing the stimulated by the unstimulated luciferase activity. For pharmacological inhibition experiments, the percentage of control is the fold induction in the presence of inhibitor divided by that in the absence times 100. For MKK cotransfection experiments, the percentage of control is the hiNOS promoter activity of cells cotransfected with a mammalian expression vector containing MKK cDNA divided by that of cells cotransfected with the corresponding empty vector times 100. Me2SO (up to 1% final concentration) did not affect LPS/IFN-γ- or CM-stimulated promoter activity (data not shown). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells grown near confluence in 100-mm2dishes, incubated for 1 h without or with inhibitors, before stimulation with CM or LPS/IFN-γ for 3 h, and harvested as described (10Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 380B DNA Synthesizer. The positive strands of the double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the identical regions of the hiNOS promoter are as follows: wild-type NF-κBu (−8287 to −8270), 5′-CCCTGGGGAACTCCTGCA-3′; mutated NF-κBu, 5′-CCCTATAGAACTAATGCA-3′; wild-type NF-κBd (−102 to −119), 5′-GCTGGGGACACTCCCTTT-3′; mutated NF-κBd, 5′-GCTGATAACACTAACTTT-3′; wild-type AP-1u (−5307 to −5290), 5′-CCAGCTTGAGTCACACTC-3′; mutated AP-1u, 5′-CCAGCTTAATTAACACTC-3′; wild-type AP-1d (−5121 to −5104), 5′-TTTGTGTGACTCACGCCC-3′; mutated AP-1d, 5′-TTTGTGTAATTAACGCCC-3′. After purification on G-25 spin columns, (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), complementary strands in equal concentrations were mixed and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature after heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C at a concentration of 1.8 pmol/μl in 50 mm NaCl. For electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay, oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a T4 polynucleotide kinase kit and purified on G-25 spin columns (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity was determined by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay using the Promega Gel Shift Assay System. Samples (5 μg) of nuclear proteins were incubated with the indicated radiolabeled oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature (∼21 °C). Specificities of the binding reactions were tested in competition assays in which a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligonucleotide was added to extracts from stimulated cells 15 min before the labeled probe. In assays without nuclear protein, none of the probes caused any discernible band shift (data not shown). Protein-nucleotide complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a 6% DNA-retardation gel (Novex) with Tris borate/EDTA (50 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at constant current (30 mA) at room temperature. Photographic film was exposed to dried gels at −70 °C and scanned using an Epson Expression 636 scanner. Band densities were measured using Scion Image beta 3b software. Because of their variable nature, band density results are mean gray value for a given area minus a measured gray background value for each gel. Me2SO alone (up to 1% final concentration) did not affect LPS/IFN-γ- or CM-stimulated transcription factor binding (data not shown). Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (25Carmichael J. Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W.G. Gamson J. Gazdar A.F. Johnson B.E. Glatstein E. Minna J.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated in 96-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated for 1 day before addition of LPS/IFN-γ or CM with and without inhibitors or Me2SO alone (eight wells/group), and 6 h later, MTT (500 μg/ml). After 4 h in the dark, plates were centrifuged (450 × gfor 10 min); the precipitate was dissolved in Me2SO and shaken for 10 min. Absorbance at 540 nm was directly proportional to the number of cells plated (data not shown). Viability was assessed as the ratio of absorbances for inhibitor-treated and untreated cells. No differences in viability among differently treated cells were found (data not shown). After incubation of A549 cells with different concentrations of LPS without or with IFN-γ for 6 h, neither IFN-γ nor LPS alone significantly activated the hiNOS promoter. In the presence of IFN-γ, however, LPS increased promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner to a maximum of 28-fold the control value (Table I). Results were similar for 12-h incubations, with a 45-fold increase in hiNOS promoter activity attributable to LPS/IFN-γ (data not shown).Table IActivation of the hiNOS promoter by the combination of LPS and IFN-γIFN-γLPSActivityunits/mlμg/mlfold induction001 ± 0.001003 ± 0.410001 ± 0.11001010 ± 2.81003018 ± 4.510010028 ± 1.5A549 cells transfected with the hiNOS promoter were incubated without or with LPS and IFN-γ, as indicated, for 6 h.

Data are the means of values from two experiments with assays in triplicate (± half the range), with luciferase activity expressed relative to that of unstimulated cells without additions = 1.0. It had been shown that removal of the upstream NF-κB binding site reduced the promoter response to the cytokine mixture by 82% (24Chu S.C. Marks-Konczalik J. Wu H.P. Banks T.C. Moss J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); removal of promoter regions upstream of AP-1 binding sites (deletions −6796, −6534, and −5774 bp), had no further effect (Fig. 1 A). For the response to LPS/IFN-γ, the −7277-bp deletion mutant retained 50% of the native promoter activity (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that upstream NF-κB binding (RelA/RelA) was more important for CM activation than for that by LPS/IFN-γ. The region between −5774 bp and −7277 bp accounted for a 4.5-fold increase in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated promoter activity. In an attempt to identify a discrete binding site responsible for enhancement of hiNOS activation by LPS/IFN-γ, we constructed promoter fragments containing serial truncations at short intervals (−6796-bp, −6534-bp, −5774-bp). Reductions in promoter activity due to successive small deletions were incremental but small, suggesting heterogeneity in the unknown enhancer elements responsible for full hiNOS activation by LPS/IFN-γ and the absence of a discrete site (Fig. 1, B and C). In cells transfected with the hiNOS promoter construct lacking the region upstream from the two AP-1 sites (−5774 bp), CM caused a 7.6-fold stimulation, twice that caused by LPS-IFN-γ. Removal of the two AP-1 sites (−3665 bp) further decreased LPS/IFN-γ stimulation 3.5-fold. Because this region accounted for the largest discrete drop in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activation, and the presence of intact AP-1 binding sites was critical for CM stimulation, we examined the signaling pathways that might lead to hiNOS promoter activation via AP-1. The general tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and erbstatin each attenuated CM-induced hiNOS promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (TableII). The effects of the more specific tyrphostins, AG126 and AG1288, as well as the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, were then investigated. All three tyrphostins decreased CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-induced activation in concentration-dependent manner (Table III), suggesting that MAPK and JAK pathways are involved in hiNOS promoter induction.Table IITyrosine kinase activity is required for activation of the hiNOS promoterInhibitor and concentrationActivity of hiNOS promoter% Controlμmfold inductionErbstatin0114 ± 17100 ± 0.05073 ± 6.661 ± 1710041 ± 3.743 ± 6.25008 ± 0.17 ± 1.8Genistein097 ± 5.5100 ± 0.03095 ± 4.298 ± 1.27526 ± 1925 ± 181504 ± 0.84.0 ± 1.1A549 cells transiently transfected with the hiNOS promoter were incubated for 1 h without or with inhibitor before the addition of CM or serum-free medium and further incubation for 12 h.

To define better the MAPKs involved in activation of the hiNOS promoter, we used a molecular approach by coexpressing dominant negative, wild-type, and constitutively active forms of ERK and p38 MAPK kinases. Complementary results were obtained with pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1 (PD98059) and p38 MAPK (SB203580). PD98059 produced 25 and 42% reductions in CM-and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS induction, respectively (Fig.2 A). As was the case for PD98059, coexpression of dominant negative MEK1 lead to a significant reduction in basal as well as CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS activation (Fig. 2 B), indicating a role for ERK activation in hiNOS transcriptional activation. SB203580 caused 43 and 45% inhibition of CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activity, respectively (Fig.3 A). Cotransfection of dominant negative forms of MKK3, but not of MKK6, with the hiNOS promoter led to a significant reduction in CM- or LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). Coexpression of wild-type or constitutively active MKK3 enhanced basal hiNOS promoter activity, confirming the involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway (Fig. 4). hiNOS promoter activation by CM and LPS/IFN-γ was not enhanced further by the overexpression of wild-type and constitutively active MKK3. Administration of SB203580 reversed the hiNOS promoter activation attributed to expression of constitutively active MKK3, demonstrating specificity of SB203580 for p38 MAPK in the context of cytokine-stimulated hiNOS activation. Together the two pharmacological inhibitors reduced CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activity 86 and 89%, respectively (Fig.5). Apparently additive effects of the p38 and MEK1 inhibitors suggest that the two kinases contribute independently to the activation of the hiNOS promoter.Figure 4Effect of wild-type (wt) and constitutively active (ca) MKK3 overexpression on CM - and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activity.

Exposure to CM or LPS/IFN-γ for 3 h increased to similar extents the binding of NF-κB and AP-1 complexes (Fig.6, A and B). The gel migration distance of the DNA probe-transcription factor complex was the same for CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated cells, consistent with the binding of identical dimer complexes to the oligonucleotide probes regardless of the agonist used (data not shown). In unstimulated cells, SB203580 and PD98059 did not affect binding to NF-κB sites, whereas the combination of SB203580 and PD98059 increased binding to AP-1 sites. SB203580 and PD98059 inhibited LPS/IFN-γ- but not CM-stimulated NF-κB downstream (−115) binding. SB203580 and PD98059 augmented both LPS/IFN-γ- and CM-stimulated NF-κB upstream (−8283) binding. SB203580 or PD98059, singly or together, decreased CM- and LPS/IFN-γ- stimulated AP-1 binding. Of note, the inhibitory effects of PD98059 and SB203580 on the CM- and LPS/IFN-γ-induced increases in AP-1 downstream binding were additive. These data point to a crucial role for MAPKs in AP-1-dependent human iNOS induction. The production of NO by iNOS has a variety of important biological effects including oxidative stress and signaling (3Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 23Thiemermann C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Production of iNOS protein is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, and the signaling pathways by which human iNOS transcription is controlled in response to inflammatory stimuli are poorly understood. Here, we report that LPS, in combination with IFN-γ, activated specific NF-κB- and AP-1-binding elements in an 8.3-kb hiNOS promoter. The ERK and p38 MAPK pathways played a crucial role in human iNOS transcriptional activation via modulation of AP-1 binding to specific promoter sequences. The 8.3-kb hiNOS promoter construct has several distinct advantages over measures of NO production or NOS expression, most importantly, the ability to study the molecular determinants of transcriptional activation (i.e. NF-κB, AP-1 binding). Introduction of an exogenous iNOS promoter makes it possible to focus directly on transcriptional activation in intact cells, avoiding confounding factors that affect measures of iNOS production. Furthermore, in intact cells, promoter activation is amenable to molecular characterization, and iNOS transcription is the rate-limiting step in cytokine-induced NO production. However, the validity of conclusions regarding signaling pathways involved in iNOS induction clearly depends on the structural characteristics of the putative promoter sequence. Taylor et al. (9Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Morris Jr., S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. J. Biol.

The upstream region contained in the 8.3-kb promoter construct appears also to be important for full hiNOS transcriptional activation. In addition, MAPK-dependent hiNOS promoter activation was related to the enhancement of AP-1 bindin"
https://openalex.org/W1965842427,"A number of studies have demonstrated that cholera toxin (CT) is found in detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-enriched domains (rafts) in various cells, including neurons. We now demonstrate that even though CT is associated with these domains at the cell surface of cultured hippocampal neurons, it is internalized via a raft-independent mechanism, at both early and late stages of neuronal development. CT transport to the Golgi apparatus, and its subsequent degradation, is inhibited by hypertonic medium (sucrose), and by chlorpromazine; the former blocks clathrin recruitment, and the latter causes aberrant endosomal accumulation of clathrin. Moreover, both internalization of the transferrin receptor (Tf-R), which occurs via a clathrin-dependent mechanism, and CT internalization, are inhibited to a similar extent by sucrose. In contrast, the cholesterol-binding agents filipin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin have no effect on the rate of CT or Tf-R internalization. Finally, once internalized, CT becomes more detergent-soluble, and chlorpromazine treatment renders internalized CT completely detergent-soluble. We propose two models to explain how, despite being detergent-insoluble at the cell surface, CT is nevertheless internalized via a raft-independent mechanism in hippocampal neurons."

Two high molecular weight MLCK splice variants, EC MLCK-1 and EC MLCK-2 (210–214 kDa), in human endothelium are identical except for a deleted single exon in MLCK-2 encoding a 69-amino acid stretch (amino acids 436–505) that contains potentially important consensus sites for phosphorylation by p60Src kinase (Lazar, V., and Garcia, J.

We have now found that both recombinant EC MLCK splice variants exhibit comparable enzymatic activities but a 2-fold reduction ofV max, and a 2-fold increase inK 0.5 CaM when compared with the SM MLCK isoform, whereas K m was similar in the three isoforms. However, only EC MLCK-1 is readily phosphorylated by purified p60Src in vitro, resulting in a 2- to 3-fold increase in EC MLCK-1 enzymatic activity (compared with EC MLCK-2 and SM MLCK). This increased activity of phospho-MLCK-1 was observed over a broad range of submaximal [Ca2+] levels with comparable EC50 [Ca2+] for both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated EC MLCK-1. The sites of tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by p60Src are Tyr464 and Tyr471 within the 69-residue stretch deleted in the MLCK-2 splice variant.

Members of this MLCK family share structural similarity, with a catalytic core that binds Mg2+-ATP and MLC20 and a regulatory segment involved in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation. Comparisons of primary sequences deduced from cDNA clones demonstrate that skeletal and cardiac muscle MLCK isoforms represent gene products that differ from the gene encoding the smooth muscle and nonmuscle MLCK isoforms localized on human chromosome 3 (3Gallagher P.J.

Furthermore, the physiological role of the gene-specific MLCK isoforms differs significantly in the regulation of actomyosin contraction. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, Ca2+ binds to the regulatory thin filament protein complex containing troponin and tropomyosin and thus allows actin to activate sarcomeric myosin Mg2+-ATPase. Although MLCK does not initiate muscle contraction in these tissues, MLCK-mediated phosphorylation of MLC20 may potentiate the rate and extent of force development (7Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F.

The MLCK isoform abundantly expressed in smooth muscle (SM MLCK) generally exists as a 130- to 150-kDa protein that has been well characterized (for review see Refs. 3Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P.

Both the low molecular mass (130–150 kDa) and high molecular mass (208–214 kDa) MLCK isoforms share essentially identical actin binding, MLC binding, catalytic, and Ca2+/CaM-regulatory domains.

However, the exact biological function of the 922-amino acid N-terminal portion, which is unique to the high molecular weight MLCK isoform, is completely unknown. We have previously found that increased levels of endothelial cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by thrombin or diperoxovanadate are tightly linked to increased MLC20phosphorylation, activation of actomyosin contraction, and a dramatic decrease in endothelial cell barrier function (26Garcia J.G.

Patterson C.E. Irwin R.P. Natarajan V. Garcia J.G. Endothelium. 1998; 6: 153-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that the increased kinase activity in MLCK immunoprecipitates strongly correlated with increased EC MLCK phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (26Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Schaphorst K. Siddiqui R. Patterson C.E. Csortos C. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L989-L998PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cell MLCK was found to be stably associated with p60Src kinase after stimulation (26Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Schaphorst K. Siddiqui R. Patterson C.E. Csortos C. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L989-L998PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with potential direct regulation of endothelial MLCK activity by tyrosine phosphorylation. More recently, detailed analysis of MLCK transcripts expressed in human endothelial cells revealed several splice variants of the EC MLCK isoform with predominant expression of the full-length isoform (MLCK-1) and a variant, which is identical to MLCK-1 except for a deleted 69-residue stretch (amino acid residues 437–505) encoded by a single exon (MLCK-2) (28Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Within this deleted 69-amino acid stretch is an SH2-binding domain and consensus sites for phosphorylation by the Src family kinases (Tyr464, Tyr485). To better understand the role and significance of tyrosine phosphorylation and the function of the novel N terminus in EC MLCK regulation, we have expressed both EC MLCK-1 and EC MLCK-2 isoforms as well as smooth muscle MLCK in the baculovirus system and have characterized the biochemical properties of the purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, we have assessed the phosphorylation of MLCK-1, MLCK-2, and SM MLCK by p60Src kinase in vitro, mapped the p60Src-phosphorylation sites to Tyr464 and Tyr471 of MLCK-1, and investigated the effects of MLCK-1 phosphorylation by p60Src kinase on the MLCK enzymatic activity and regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin. Our studies indicate the novel up-regulation of high molecular weight endothelial MLCK-1 isoform activity by p60Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and demonstrate isoform-specific endothelial cell MLCK regulation. Chemicals used in these studies were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise specified. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL), Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD), and Promega (Madison, WI). Radioactive nucleotides, [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-33P]ATP, were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). MLCK inhibitor (ML-7) and the p60Srcinhibitor (PP2) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Purified p60C-src kinase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Sf9 and Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were grown in serum-free Sf-900 II SFM media obtained from Life Technologies. A rabbit uterine smooth muscle MLCK full-length cDNA in a pGEM vector (24Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Patricia Gallagher (Indiana University). The plasmid was cut at the Eco52I site, followed by blunt-ending with Klenow enzyme. The MLCK insert was then released by digesting plasmid with XbaI, separated from the vector by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified using a Prep-A-Gene (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) kit. The smooth muscle MLCK cDNA was ligated with the pFastBac Hta baculovirus donor plasmid (Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system, Life Technologies), which had been digested withStuI and XbaI enzymes. MLCK-2 cDNA was obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by RT-PCR, amplified, and subcloned as described earlier (28Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), using sense primer 5′-ACT GAA TTC ACC ATG GGG GAT GTG AAG CTG and antisense primer 5′-GTC AGA ATT CTT GTT TCA CTC TTC TTC CTC TTC C, both containing anEcoRI site. The EC MLCK-2 cDNA was inserted into pFastBac Hta vector at the EcoRI site. To generate MLCK-1 cDNA, an ∼1.85-kb 5′-end fragment of HUVEC MLCK was amplified by RT-PCR using a SuperScript preamplification system (Life Technologies). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from HUVEC total RNA with oligo-dT primer. The PCR primers were as follows, sense: 5′-ACT GCG GCC GCA CCA TGG GGG ATG TGA AGC TG (NotI restriction site followed by HUVEC MLCK-specific 5′-end sequence), and antisense: 5′-GTA CTC ACT CTT CCT GCT ACT C (∼1.85-kb downstream HUVEC MLCK sequence). The same region (with a 207-bp deletion compared with EC MLCK-1) of the nonmuscle MLCK-2/pFastBac Hta plasmid was excised and replaced with this PCR-amplified fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of MLCK-1. Briefly, the PCR product was digested with NotI, blunt-ended, and cut by BlpI. The respective ∼1.66-kb fragment from the nonmuscle MLCK-2/pFastBac Hta plasmid was excised with EheI and BlpI, and separated on agarose gel. The PCR-amplified 5′-end fragment of MLCK-1 and the 3′-end MLCK region previously subcloned into pFastBac Hta vector were ligated to create the recombinant donor plasmid of the whole EC MLCK-1 coding region reported previously (20Garcia J.G. Lazar V. Gilbert-McClain L.I. Gallagher P.J. Verin A.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). All three constructs (SM MLCK, EC MLCK-1, and EC MLCK-2) were verified by restriction analysis, PCR, and complete sequencing. A plasmid pET3-MLC encoding rabbit vascular smooth muscle regulatory MLC was generously provided by Dr. Patricia Gallagher (Indiana University) and amplified by PCR using primers with unique restriction sites for directional cloning, MLC-sense-EcoRI: 5′-TGC TTT GAA TTC ATG TCC AGC AAG CGG GCC AAA GCC AAG-3′, and MLC-antisense- XbaI: 5′-AAG GAC TCT AGA CTA GTC GTG TTT ATC CTT GGC GCC ATG-3′, and then ligated with the pFastBac Hta baculovirus donor plasmid (Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system), which had been digested with EcoRI and XbaI enzymes. Human endothelial cell MLCK-1 and MLCK-2, rabbit smooth muscle MLCK and MLC recombinant baculovirus stocks were prepared using the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. The system uses site-specific transposition of foreign genes into a baculovirus shuttle vector, bacmid, propagated in Escherichia coli. Sf9 and Hi5 insect cell suspension cultures at 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected with the respective viral stock at a multiplicity of infection range of 0.1–10, and after 1-h incubation, diluted 5-fold with fresh media and grown for 2–4 days at 28 °C with continuous shaking. The optimal conditions varied for the three different MLCK isoforms expressed (not shown). For large scale expression and purification, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 1), and the cells producing SM MLC, rabbit SM MLCK, or human endothelial MLCK-1 and -2 were harvested. The recombinant MLCK and MLC proteins contained a histidine tag at their N-terminal region introduced during subcloning MLCK cDNAs into the pFastBac Hta baculovirus donor vector. Expression of the MLCK isoforms was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blot (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using MLCK- specific D119 antiserum (31Verin A.D. Gilbert-McClain L.I. Patterson C.E. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or commercial anti-His tag antibodies. For the isolation of the recombinant MLCK isoforms or MLC, the infected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen insect cells were lysed (1:5 w/v ratio) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). After a wash step with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), the expressed MLCK isoforms were eluted with 100 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The yield of MLCK isoforms ranged from 1.5 to 4 mg of MLCK from a 10-g Sf9 cell pellet. The purified enzymes were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Human endothelial MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 splice variants as well as the rabbit smooth muscle MLCK isoform cDNAs were subcloned into baculovirus vector pFastBac Hta as described above. The alternatively spliced regions in MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 mRNAs were verified by PCR amplification (not shown) using primers located upstream and downstream of nucleotides 1428–1634 as well as by complete sequencing of the MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 cDNA inserts. Translation of completely sequenced cDNA inserts encoding EC MLCK splice variants revealed four amino acid residue differences between the unique N-terminal sequence of the EC MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 (Phe629, Cys681, Gly714, and Leu806) and the previously reported EC MLCK cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number U48959). These sequence differences, which may represent polymorphisms within the human MLCK gene, did not involve either the consensus sequence for potential tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by p60Src (Tyr464, Tyr471, Tyr485), the putative SH2-binding sites (Tyr59, Tyr464), the SH3 domains (Pro314-Arg318, Arg373-Pro379) previously proposed for EC MLCK (26Garcia J.G.

Rigorous analysis of the cDNA sequences encoding the C terminus of EC MLCK common to both high and low molecular weight MLCK isoforms, revealed three variances (Phe925/Leu, Ala1179/Val, and Lys1233/Glu) in the baculovirus-expressed recombinant MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 isoforms that do not correspond to GenBank™ accession number 48959 or to homologous regions of the reported human, rabbit, and bovine SM MLCK variants, respectively (6Potier M.C.

Leu925 resides within the putative actin-binding domain spanning residues 910–1036 of MLCK-1, whereas Val1179 and Glu1233 do not lie within functional domains described for smooth muscle MLCK (32Shoemaker M.O.

In addition, several types of recombinant Xenopus regulatory MLC, including wild type MLC (Ser19Thr18) and Ser19Ala18 and Ala19Thr18 mutants expressed in E. coli (33Bresnick A.R. Wolff-Long V.L. Baumann O. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12576-12583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were used as substrates in studies of EC MLCK substrate specificity. The purified MLCKs were diluted in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm Mg2+ acetate, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to a 1.25 × 10−11m final assay concentration. The MLCK activity was determined by measuring32P incorporation into the regulatory MLC used as substrate. The MLCK kinase assays were performed in 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm Mg2+-acetate, 0.025% 2-mercaptoethanol, in the presence 0.3 mmCaCl2, 10−6m calmodulin, 10−7m [γ-32P]ATP at 0.5 Ci/mmol specific activity, and 1.25–15 × 10−6m myosin light chain at 22 °C as previously described (31Verin A.D. Gilbert-McClain L.I. Patterson C.E. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The concentration of free [Ca2+] in kinase reactions was calculated as described by Imai and Okeda (34Imai S. Takeda K. Nature. 1967; 213: 1044-1045Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the equation: p[Ca2+] = 2 pH − 7.28 + log([EGTA]added/[CaCl2]added − 1). K m and V max values were determined from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Purified MLCKs were dialyzed and brought to 0.1 mg/ml concentration using reaction buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMg2+ acetate, 0.5 mm leupeptin. Phosphorylation of MLCK diluted in reaction buffer was started by adding 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP and 75 units/ml recombinant p60src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; final concentrations). Synthetic MLCK-1 peptides were used for p60src phosphorylation assays at 0.1 mg/ml final concentration. In certain experiments, a putative specific p60src inhibitor, PP-2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA), was added to reaction tubes at 500 nm final concentration. The phosphorylation reaction was performed at 22 °C, and 10-μl aliquots of reaction mixture were applied onto cellulose phosphate filters P81 (Whatman, UK) at specified periods of time. The filters were washed to remove unincorporated label, and specific incorporation of 32P into MLCK was determined by scintillation counting. The p60Src phosphorylation of the MLCK synthetic peptides as substrates was performed during 30 min at 22 °C under the same conditions. For scintillation counting, synthetic MLCK peptides were spotted onto nitrocellulose, and unbound radioactive label was washed out with solution containing 20% methanol and 2% disodium pyrophosphate. After completion of the phosphorylation reaction, phospho-MLCKs were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use in kinase assays. A 200-μl aliquot of MLCK-1 (0.3 mg/ml) phosphorylated by p60src in vitro was partially digested by incubation with trypsin (1:100 w/w) for 5 min at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was terminated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 2 mm final concentration. The reaction mixture was lysed in SDS-sample buffer, peptides were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphotyrosine peptides were identified by autoradiography and Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. A portion of the polyacrylamide gel containing a major 55-kDa MLCK-1 tryptic peptide, which incorporated 32P and cross-reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, was excised and further processed. After 3 × 30 min washes in distilled water, the gel piece was trimmed and the phosphopeptide incorporated into gel was subjected to destaining and complete trypsinolysis. Gel destaining required the addition of 100 μl of 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile:25 mmammonium bicarbonate for ∼30 min. The gel was then dried down completely using a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant), and further trypsinolysis was performed. The gel was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 1 μl of trypsin solution (0.1 μg/μl in 1% acetic acid) and 25 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. After trypsinolysis, the MLCK peptides were eluted from the gel with a 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile:water, 5% trifluoroacetic acid solution and concentrated to several microliters by Speed Vac. This peptide mixture was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were acquired on a Kratos Axima CFR (Manchester, United Kingdom) time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Briefly, an aliquot of the peptide digest (0.3 μl) was placed on the sample plate followed by the addition of 0.3 μl of saturated ammonium sulfate and 0.3 μl of matrix solution (saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1:1 (v/v) ethanol:water). The mixture was air-dried (∼10 min), and the sample plate was inserted into the mass spectrometer. The domain organization of the endothelial cell MLCK isoforms is schematically presented in Fig.1 A and demonstrates that the two endothelial isoforms: MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 are identical with the exception of the deletion of a 69-residue stretch encoded by a single exon in MLCK-2 (28Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The baculovirus-expressed and -purified MLCK isoforms (MLCK-1, MLCK-2, and SM MLCK) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and revealed protein bands with expected sizes 214, 206, and 150 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 B), which reacted on the Western blot with MLCK-specific D119 antiserum (Fig.1 C). After purification and rigorous sequencing analysis, the three recombinant MLCK isoforms were examined for their intrinsic enzymatic properties. Both EC MLCK-1 and EC MLCK-2 exhibited comparableV max values (11.9 ± 3.2 and 10.9 ± 1.8 μmol/min/mg, respectively), which were slightly reduced compared with the rabbit SM MLCK isoform (17.0 ± 2.5 μmol/min/mg) (TableI). The K m values reflecting substrate affinity were not significantly different among the three recombinant MLCK preparations, whereas theK 0.5 calmodulin was higher for the EC MLCK isoforms (0.49 and 0.42 nm) compared with the rabbit SM MLCK isoform (0.21 nm) (Table I). Overall, theK m, V max,K 0.5 calmodulin values for the baculovirus-expressed endothelial MLCK-1 and MLCK-2 splice variants are in good agreement with published values for MLCK activity derived from other tissues (24Gallagher P.J.

Both insulin and increased glucose metabolism have been proposed to be initiating signals for this process, but the pathways by which these effectors act to alter transcription have not been resolved. We have previously defined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay a factor in nuclear extracts from rat liver, designated the carbohydrate-responsive factor (Cho- RF), that binds to liver-type pyruvate kinase and S14 promoters at sites critical for regulation by carbohydrate. The sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has also emerged as a major transcription factor involved in this nutritional response. In this study, we examined the relationship between SREBP-1c and ChoRF in lipogenic gene induction. The two factors were found to possess distinct DNA binding specificities both in vitro and in hepatocytes. Reporter constructs containing binding sites for ChoRF were responsive to glucose but not directly to insulin. On the other hand, reporter constructs with an SREBP-1c site responded directly to insulin. The S14 gene possesses binding sites for both ChoRF and SREBP, and both sites were found to be functionally important for the response of this promoter to glucose and insulin in hepatocytes. Consequently, we propose that SREBP-1c and ChoRF are independent transcription factors that mediate signals generated by insulin and glucose, respectively.

Lipogenesis occurs predominantly in the liver and adipose tissue and its activation by carbohydrate diet is accompanied by the induction of many of the key enzymes involved in this metabolic conversion (for review see Refs.1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Annu. Rev.

Among these are enzymes of glycolysis, such as pyruvate kinase; of fatty acid synthesis, such as acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FAS)1; and of fatty acid maturation and packaging, such as stearoyl CoA desaturase. The increased production of these “lipogenic” enzymes results from induction of their specific mRNAs and in most cases correlates with increased transcription of the corresponding genes. Two potential signaling pathways elicited in response to dietary carbohydrate could play a role in lipogenic enzyme induction. Increased insulin secretion by the β cell in response to elevated blood glucose could act as the primary signal. Alternatively, increased glucose metabolism itself might lead to alterations in gene expression. Attempts to sort out the respective roles of these pathways have been most effectively carried out in cultured primary hepatocytes. Treatment of hepatocytes with insulin and high glucose levels mimics the lipogenic response seen in the animal following dietary carbohydrate (4Decaux J.-F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither signal alone is able to recapitulate the response. Treatment of hepatocytes with insulin alone (in low glucose conditions) does stimulate the expression of the glucokinase gene (5Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21824-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhancement of pyruvate kinase gene expression, on the other hand, is mainly dependent on increases in glucose concentration. When glucokinase is expressed constitutively, induction of pyruvate kinase mRNA occurs in the absence of insulin (6Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10213-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For most of the remaining lipogenic enzyme genes, however, both insulin and glucose are required for the induction process. The intracellular signaling pathway responsible for the induction of lipogenic gene expression in response to glucose metabolism remains unresolved (for reviews see Refs. 2Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar and 3Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Two genes, the liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) and S14 genes, have been extensively studied. The S14 gene product, a 17-kDa nuclear protein, is hypothesized to play a regulatory role in lipogenesis (for review see Ref. 7Cunningham B.A. Moncur J.T. Huntington J.T. Kinlaw W.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfection analyses of the S14 and L-PK promoters in primary hepatocytes led to the identification of a conserved carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) that is necessary and sufficient for control by glucose (8Bergot M.-O.

This sequence consists of two “half E box” motifs related to the sequence CACG (12Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Definition of the ChoRE allowed the detection of a novel protein complex by EMSA that formed with active ChoREs but not with mutant ChoREs that failed to respond to glucose (12Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The strong correlation between binding and function suggested that this complex, designated ChoRF, might be responsible for signaling through the ChoRE element. The identity of the protein(s) forming this complex is unknown. The presence of E box-like sequences in the ChoRE suggests that a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family binds this site to mediate transcriptional responses to glucose. Among this large family of factors, SREBP-1c has emerged as a candidate for ChoRF. SREBP was first identified as a transcription factor that regulates genes encoding enzymes involved in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis (for reviews see Refs. 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar and 14Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (430) Google Scholar). SREBP has three isoforms: SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2. SREBP-2 appears to be primarily involved in regulating genes of cholesterol metabolism (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c is predominant in tissues active in lipogenesis such as liver and adipose (15Tontonoz P.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The expression of SREBP-1c itself was found to be rapidly increased by dietary carbohydrate in the liver and adipose tissue, suggesting a role for this factor in lipogenesis (17Kim J.B. Sarraf P.

The effects of dietary carbohydrate were attributed to a direct action of insulin in hepatocytes (19Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Liepvre X.L. Berthelier-Lubrano C.

Overexpression of SREBP-1c induced lipogenic gene expression (e.g. FAS and acetyl CoA carboxylase) in mouse liver and in cultured cells (17Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G.

Furthermore, carbohydrate-induced lipogenic gene expression was severely impaired in either SREBP-1 knockout mice or in hepatocytes overexpressing a dominant negative form of SREBP-1 (22Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.-I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishihashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Together these data provide a strong case for the role of SREBP-1c in lipogenic enzyme induction; however, they do not directly demonstrate that SREBP-1c is the factor that also mediates the glucose signaling pathway. In fact, overexpression of a constitutively active form of SREBP-1c alone could not maximally induce lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes in low glucose conditions (19Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Liepvre X.L. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of constitutively active SREBP-1c was unable to activate constructs containing the L-PK ChoRE either in COS cells or in mhAT3F cells (24Moriizumi S. Gourdon L. Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although SREBP-1c might be implicated in mediating insulin signaling, its direct involvement in the regulation of ChoREs remains in question. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between ChoRF and SREBP-1c with respect to lipogenic gene induction. We present evidence indicating that ChoRF is distinct from SREBP-1c and acts through different response elements. These data lead to a model in which both ChoRF activation by glucose and SREBP activation by insulin play integral roles in carbohydrate stimulation of gene expression. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (180–260 g) using the collagenase perfusion method as described previously (25Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Following an attachment for 3–6 h, cells were transiently transfected using F1 reagent (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) in modified Williams' E medium with 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 50 unit/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mm glucose for 12–14 h. Cells were then cultured in medium containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose for 30 h and harvested for luciferase assay. For experiments in Figs. 6 and 8, cells were transfected with medium containing 1.5 mm glucose and no insulin and subsequently cultured with medium in varying glucose concentrations in the absence or in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml insulin. In these experiments, 0.33 mg/ml of Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was added to the medium after transfection. This treatment has been shown to enhance the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in cultured hepatocytes (26Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 813-816PubMed Google Scholar). Results of luciferase assays are expressed as relative light units measured per μg protein.Figure 8Role of the S14 ChoRE and SREBP-binding site in supporting responses to glucose and insulin in hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were transfected with the rat S14 (−1467/−1395)(−290/+18) Luc construct that was derived from either wild type S14 sequences (WT) or sequences harboring mutations in the ChoRE (ChoRE mut) or SREBP-binding site (SREBP mut). Cells were then cultured in either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose in the absence or in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml insulin for 30 h. Luciferase activity is shown as the percentage of relative light units measured with the value of wild type construct at 27.5 mm glucose with insulin set at 100%.

Oligonucleotides containing these sequences (except mut3/5) were synthesized with BamHI and BglII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Each oligonucleotide was ligated and treated with BamHI andBglII to isolate a DNA fragment with two copies in a head-to-tail orientation. Fragments containing two copies were then inserted into the BamHI site of a PK(−40) Luc construct. The PK(−40) Luc construct is based on the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with a modified polylinker region. The L-PK gene sequence from −40 to +12 that by itself exhibits basal promoter activity was inserted between PstI and XhoI sites.

The SREBP site mutation of the rat S14 gene was generated by inverse PCR as described previously (12Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, each oligonucleotide creating a unique NsiI site was synthesized and used to amplify the rat S14(−1601/+18)/pBluescript SK II (+) plasmid. PCR products were digested at the introduced restriction enzyme site, purified by gel electrophoresis, ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli. This procedure resulted in an 8-base pair mutation at positions −139 to −131 of the S14 promoter. Mutant constructs were isolated, and rat S14 sequences were excised with PstI andXhoI to clone into the modified pGL3 vector. The rat S14 sequences from −1467 to −1395 were PCR amplified either from the wild type rat S14 (−4316/+18) CAT or the Mut1 construct that contained a mutation in the ChoRE (25Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M.

The plasmid pFACMV/SREBP-1c contained the pFA-CMV expression vector encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) fused with human SREBP-1c transactivation domain (amino acids 1–81). A fragment containing five copies of the GAL4-binding site was excised from pFR-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) withKpnI and NheI and inserted into PK(−40) Luc construct. The cDNA encoding the human pancreatic glucokinase (30Miller S.P. Anand G.R. Karschnia E.J. Bell G.I. LaPorte D.C. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was inserted into XbaI site of CMV4 vector for expression in primary hepatocytes. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats that had been fed a high carbohydrate diet for 16 h as described previously (10Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyethylene glycol 8000 (Hampton Research, Boston, MA) fraction that precipitated between 0 and 6.7% was used for EMSA. Crude nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells containing nuclear SREBP-1c were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). For this purpose, COS-1 cells were transfected with CMV4/SREBP-1c (1) for 16 h using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then cultured for an additional 30 h prior to harvest. EMSA was performed as described previously (12Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 100,000 cpm (10–20 fmol) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide either with 15 μg of the polyethylene glycol fraction from liver nuclear extracts or 7.5 μg of COS-1 cell nuclear extracts. Nonspecific competitors used were 0.1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 1.9 μg of poly(dA·dT) for EMSA with liver nuclear extracts and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) with COS-1 cell nuclear extracts. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were subject to electrophoresis on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. Antibody to SREBP-1(H-160) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and was added to nuclear extract for 20 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of probe. For competition EMSA, a 10-, 25-, or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added together with radiolabeled probe into the sample prior to the incubation. As noted above, several lines of experimental evidence implicate SREBP-1c as the transcription factor responsible for mediating the nutritional response of lipogenic genes to carbohydrate feeding. SREBP-1c expression has been shown to respond rapidly to insulin treatment, providing a direct link between insulin signaling pathways and SREBP (17Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 19Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Liepvre X.L. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, induction of most lipogenic enzyme genes requires both insulin and elevated glucose metabolism in the hepatocyte, and no effects of glucose on SREBP expression have been found in hepatocytes (23Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 32Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that SREBP transactivation potential might be regulated by glucose, as suggested by Foretz et al. (23Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), the following transfection experiment was performed. A reporter construct containing two copies of a consensus SREBP-binding site, SRE-1, linked to a basal TATA box promoter from the pyruvate kinase gene was prepared. This construct was cotransfected into primary hepatocytes with a eucaryotic expression vector for the nuclear form of rat SREBP-1c (amino acids 1–403). Cells were then incubated with either low (5.5 mm) or high (27.5 mm) glucose for 30 h. These conditions are identical to those used for measuring glucose induction of L-PK or S14 promoters in hepatocytes. Cotransfection of SREBP-1c expression vector resulted in robust induction of luciferase activity from the SRE-1-containing reporter construct both in low and high glucose, as expected (Fig.1 A). However, no significant differences in the extent of induction were observed between samples from low and high glucose conditions, suggesting that the transactivation potential of SREBP-1c is not affected in the presence of high glucose. Because of the possibility that endogenous SREBPs might interfere with the binding of the transfected SREBP-1c, an additional experiment was performed using a recombinant SREBP-1c in which its DNA-binding domain was replaced with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. An expression vector for this recombinant protein was cotransfected into hepatocytes with a basal TATA box promoter construct containing five copies of the GAL4-binding site. Again, expression of the SREBP fusion protein activated promoter activity, but no significant differences were found between low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 1 B). These data argue against the possibility that SREBP-1c activity is enhanced by signals generated by glucose metabolism in primary hepatocytes. We recently showed by EMSA that a series of glucose-responsive ChoREs, but not glucose-unresponsive oligonucleotides, can form a novel protein complex, designated ChoRF, when incubated with partially purified rat liver nuclear proteins (12Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consequently, ChoRF was suggested to be responsible for mediating effects of glucose on genes containing the ChoRE site, such as S14 and L-PK. Among the glucose-unresponsive oligonucleotides used in that study was a consensus SRE-1, a strong binding site for SREBP. These data suggested that ChoRF is not identical with the well characterized SREBP dimer. To further verify this observation, competition EMSA was performed. In this experiment, liver nuclear proteins were incubated with a radiolabeled ChoRE probe from the L-PK promoter, and the abilities of various oligonucleotides to compete for the binding of the ChoRF were tested. As expected, all natural and modified oligonucleotides with functional ChoRE activity were able to compete for ChoRF binding with L-PK ChoRE with the degree of competition increasing as a greater excess of oligonucleotide was added (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, an oligonucleotide containing the consensus SRE-1 was unable to interfere with ChoRF binding when tested over the same range of concentrations. These data indicate that the ChoRF complex is not identical to the SREBP-1c homodimer. Because it was still possible that SREBP-1c might be a part of a larger ChoRF complex together with other components, the ability of an antibody to SREBP-1 to disrupt the formation of ChoRF was tested. As a control, the binding of SREBP-1c to an SRE-1 oligonucleotide was compared. Attempts to detect SREBP-1c binding using nuclear extracts were unsuccessful because of its low abundance, as noted by others (33Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells that were transfected with a vector overexpressing the nuclear form of SREBP-1c. Using the resultant nuclear extracts, formation of a specific band was observed with the consensus SRE-1 (Fig.2 B). Addition of anti-SREBP-1 antibody completely disrupted the band formed between SREBP-1c and the SRE-1 oligonucleotide and led to the appearance of a slower migrating supershifted band. However, the intensity of the ChoRF complex on the L-PK ChoRE was undiminished in the presence of anti-SREBP-1 antibody. Thus, SREBP-1c is not likely to be a component of the ChoRF complex. To complement this experiment, we were interested in testing whether oligonucleotides with ChoRE activity can compete with SREBP binding to its DNA recognition site. To test the binding affinity of various ChoREs to SREBP-1c, a competition EMSA was again performed. Although the SRE-1 oligonucleotide itself could compete for the binding of SREBP-1c to radiolabeled SRE-1 probe, several ChoREs were unable to disrupt the SREBP-1c band with SRE-1 over the same concentration range (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the wild type rat S14 ChoRE competes to some degree with SREBP-1c for binding. The rat S14 ChoRE contains one perfect CACGTG element, a common binding site for basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper factors including SREBP (28Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M.

The target protein of levosimendan is cardiac troponin C (cTnC). In the current work, we have studied the interaction of levosimendan with Ca2+-saturated cTnC by heteronuclear NMR and small angle x-ray scattering. A specific interaction between levosimendan and the Ca2+-loaded regulatory domain of recombinant cTnCC35S was observed. The changes in the NMR spectra of the N-domain of full-length cTnCC35S, due to the binding of levosimendan to the primary site, were indicative of a slow conformational exchange. In contrast, no binding of levosimendan to the regulatory domain of cTnCA-Cys, where all the cysteine residues are mutated to serine, was detected. Moreover, it was shown that levosimendan was in fast exchange on the NMR time scale with a secondary binding site in the C-domain of both cTnCC35S and cTnCA-Cys. The small angle x-ray scattering experiments confirm the binding of levosimendan to Ca2+-saturated cTnC but show no domain-domain closure. The experiments were run in the absence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol and the preservative sodium azide (NaN3), since we found that levosimendan reacts with these chemicals, commonly used for preparation of NMR protein samples.

Calcium sensitizers have been proposed as a treatment for congestive heart failure since they exert a positive inotropic effect without increasing the intracellular calcium concentration (1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Levosimendan, a potent calcium sensitizer that improves the force development of the muscle contraction without increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ ion concentration (2Hasenfuss G. Pieske B. Castell M. Kretschmann B. Maier L.S. Just H. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2141-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was discovered using troponin C as target protein. Troponin C (TnC)1 is responsible for the contraction trigger in the muscle. It belongs to the family of calcium binding EF-hand proteins and consists of two domains. The N-terminal half (NTnC) is responsible for the calcium-dependent regulation of the contraction, and the C-terminal half is a structural domain always loaded with divalent cations under physiological conditions. Troponin C interacts with troponin I (TnI), and this interaction is modulated by the binding of calcium. Studies of skeletal troponin C, a homologous protein, show that a hydrophobic patch is exposed in the open conformation of the calcium-loaded regulatory domain, which is a binding site for TnI (3Gagné S.M. Li M.X. McKay R.T. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This has also been proposed to be a potential binding site for calcium sensitizers (4Ovaska M. Taskinen J. Proteins. 1991; 11: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Pollesello P.

Contrary to skeletal troponin C, the binding of Ca2+ to cTnC does not induce an opening of the conformation. Consequently there is, in vitro, no exposure of a hydrophobic region (6Spyracopoulos L.

The simultaneous binding of cardiac troponin I and Ca2+ to cNTnC, however, opens the structure of the N-terminal domain (10Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D.

This structural and functional difference between TnC in skeletal and cardiac muscle is still to be clarified. Levosimendan has been reported to bind to the regulatory domain of cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner (5Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstöm K. Kalkkinen N.

(5Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstöm K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol.

A possible binding site for calcium sensitizers in the vicinity of Asp-88 was located by using point-mutated and dansylated human recombinant cTnC, NMR, and molecular modeling (4Ovaska M. Taskinen J. Proteins. 1991; 11: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstöm K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, very recently Kleerekoper and Putkey (13Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that levosimendan did not bind to cTnC. To clarify this controversial situation we studied the stability of levosimendan and levosimendan-cTnC under various solution conditions and the interaction of levosimendan with cTnC by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering. The results are also of general importance to studies of the structure-activity relationship by NMR. For every experiment with levosimendan, a fresh 30 mm stock solution was prepared by dissolving dry levosimendan powder into 30 mm potassium carbonate. The solution was gently shaken for ∼30 s at room temperature until a clear solution was obtained. The stock solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and by mass spectrometry to ensure that no degradation had occurred during the course of the sample preparation. Levosimendan solutions were thereafter diluted in the same buffer solution used for protein samples (20 mm Bis-Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8). In this study, we used three different cTnC molecules. Recombinant 15N-labeled N-terminal fragment of human cardiac troponin C (residues 1–91) was cloned, expressed, and purified as previously described (8Pääkkönen K. Annila A. Sorsa T. Pollesello P.

The cDNA for cTnCA-Cys was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the cTnCC35S cDNA previously subcloned into the pET23d+ expression vector (Novagen). The polymerase chain reaction-based gene splicing by overlap extension strategy was used to incorporated base changes encoding for Ser at codon 84 (14). The cTnCA-Cys cDNA was subsequently subcloned intoNcoI and BamHI sites in the pET23d+ expression vector. Isotopically enriched cTnCC35S and cTnCA-Cys were expressed and purified as previously described (15 and 16). Protein samples were initially prepared in the presence of DTT to avoid disulfide formation (17Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before the binding experiments, protein solutions containing DTT were washed with a large volume of DTT-free and NaN3-free buffer and concentrated by centrifuge ultrafiltration (3,000 Centricon, 5 °C, Sorvall SS-34 rotor, 7500 rpm). The washing buffer contained 20 mm Bis-Tris, 10 mm CaCl2 at pH 6.8. Protein concentrations, generally between 0.2 and 0.5 mm, were determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The NMR samples were prepared to the volume of 300 μl, containing 5% D2O, and the pH was adjusted to 6.8 at room temperature with a few microliters of dilute NaOH or HCl when necessary (pH was not corrected for deuteron effects). An aliquot from the levosimendan stock solution was instantly added after the preparation to the protein solution up to a 3-fold excess compared with the protein concentration, and pH was readjusted to 6.8 with dilute HCl. A small aliquot of the final Ca2+-saturated cTnC sample with levosimendan was kept at 40 °C and analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) at time points 0, 1, 4, 24, and 72 h. All spectra were acquired by a Varian Unity Inova 600- or 800-MHz spectrometers at 40 °C. One-dimensional proton spectra were collected to monitor the state of levosimendan under various experimental conditions. Two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra (15N-HSQC) of cTnC and cNTnC were recorded at 800 MHz using 256 time increments (ni) and 16 transients (nt) and spectral widths of 11,000 Hz in proton dimension and 2,200 Hz in nitrogen dimension in the presence and absence of levosimendan. In addition, constant time13C-HSQC spectra of the double-labeled cTnCC35Swere recorded to measure chemical shifts of methionine methyl groups in the presence and absence of levosimendan (nt = 16, ni = 135, spectral widths of 12,000 Hz in proton dimension and 5,000 Hz in carbon dimension, 800 MHz). The 13C-edited NOESY spectra (ni = 256, nt = 48, spectral widths for both dimensions 10,000 Hz, 800 MHz) of selectively labeled levosimendan were acquired for the drug and protein-drug samples. Triple resonance spectra HNCACB and CBCA[CO]NH were acquired from the sample of15N/13C-labeled cTnCC35S complexed with levosimendan for the sequence-specific backbone assignment (ni = 64 for 13C, ni = 44 for 15N, nt = 16, spectral widths of 10,000 Hz in proton dimension, 12,000 Hz in carbon dimension, and 2,200 Hz in nitrogen dimension, 600 MHz). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the water signal (4.62 ppm), and the 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate sodium salt (19Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed by Felix 97.0 software (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). For small angle x-ray scattering measurements, a fine focus copper x-ray tube in-line-focusing mode was utilized. Copper Kα radiation (1.54 Å) was monochromatized by using a Ni filter and a totally reflecting glass block (Huber small-angle chamber 701). The intensity curves were measured using a linear one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter (M. Braun OED50M). The distance between the sample and the detector was 152 mm, and the k range was from 0.03 to 0.7 1/Å. The magnitude of the scattering vector k is defined as k = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength. The instrumental function had a full width at half maximum of 0.35 and 0.005 1/Å in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. The protein solution (80 μl of 0.3 mm cTnCC35S solution) was placed in a steel-framed cell with thin polyimide windows. Measuring times of 2 h were used for cTnCC35S-levosimendan sample and 3 times 2 h for cTnCC35S sample. The background scattering due to solvent was measured separately and subtracted from the intensity curves. The distance distribution function was calculated by the indirect Fourier transform method using the program Gnom (20Svergun D.L. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The stability of levosimendan was monitored by recording one-dimensional proton NMR spectra in the presence and absence of a reducing agent DTT and a bacterial inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3). The effects of these substances on the stability of levosimendan were tested because they had been commonly used in the preparation of protein samples for NMR analysis. A freshly made levosimendan sample (Fig.1 A) showed the characteristic AA′BB′ 1H signal pattern of para-disubstituted phenyl ring in the aromatic region of the proton NMR spectrum. After a 20-h incubation in the absence of NaN3 and DTT at 40 °C, the signal pattern remained the same (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, just a few minutes after the addition of NaN3to a levosimendan solution, the 1H spectrum of the aromatic protons of levosimendan showed a reduction in intensity combined with the appearance of new resonances (Fig. 1 C) indicative of a formation of a new compound. In an NMR tube, this reaction proceeded to completeness, and a single product was obtained. We suspect that the cyano groups reacted with the azide group to form a cyclic adduct (Fig.1 F) by a 1,3-dipolar addition mechanism (21March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 743-744Google Scholar). In the presence of a large excess of DTT, sometimes a visible precipitate appeared in the levosimendan sample, and the 1H signals of the aromatic protons of levosimendan almost completely disappeared in a few minutes, as shown in Fig. 1 D. The cyano groups of levosimendan might react by a reductive addition mechanism with the reducing agent DTT. A possible reaction product with DTT is presented in Fig. 1 G. Notably, both levosimendan and DTT have two reactive groups, which can lead to formation of a polymer, causing the precipitation of the sample and the broad lines in the1H spectrum (Fig. 1 D). Two-dimensional15N-HSQC spectra were acquired to determine the interaction of levosimendan with the Ca2+-saturated form of cTnC. The15N-HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2) revealed changes in the chemical shifts of several cross-correlation peaks. Some cross-peaks were split into two signals upon the addition of levosimendan, whereas other cross-peaks experienced frequency shifts. All resonance doublings took place in the N-terminal half of the (Ca2+)3-cTnCC35S, whereas shift changes appeared also in the C-terminal half. The observed resonance doublings and chemical shift changes might have been due to at least two different processes. One process has slow kinetics with a residence time of levosimendan >0.1 s, since it does not result in any observable broadening of the two resonances. The other employs fast kinetics with a residence time of <0.001 s, resulting in shift changes of up to 20 Hz without any major line broadening. In the following we will assume that the binding site with the slow kinetics is the primary binding site and that the fast kinetics are caused by binding to one or more secondary binding sites. As can be seen from Fig.3 A, no resonance doublings were observed beyond residue 92, and therefore, we concluded that the primary binding site is in the N-terminal domain. A comparison of the data in Figs. 2, B and C, shows that the primary binding site did not exist in cTnCA-Cys. Evidently Cys-84, but not Cys-35, is important for levosimendan binding to the primary site. It is also important to note that even though there are no resonance doublings in the C-terminal half of cTnCC35S, this half of the molecule is essential for the binding to the primary site, since no resonance doubling is observed in the isolated N-terminal half (1–91) of cTnC (Fig. 2 D). These observations may explain the discrepancies in the results obtained earlier when studying the binding of levosimendan to cardiac troponin C. In the C-domain of cTnCC35S and cTnCA-Cys, there seems to be two secondary binding sites, judged by the relatively small chemical shift changes (Fig. 3 B and C). By mapping these chemical shift changes to the cTnC structure (1AJ4 from the Protein Data Bank), it appears that the two distinct interaction sites in the C-domain of cTnC are not spatially related to each other. The 13C signals of the methionine methyl groups are sensitive markers for binding of ligands to cTnC, and they have been used to study the interaction between cTnC and cardiac troponin I (15, 22, and 23) and between cTnC and various drugs (13Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Constant time13C-HSQC spectra were used to follow changes in these groups, as the methionine methyls can be easily distinguished from other methyls by their negative correlation peaks. Splitting of the methyl signals of N-terminal methionine residues Met-47, Met-81, and Met-85 (Fig. 4) were observed. This is in agreement with the result of the 15N-HSQC experiment, as the amide proton signals of both Met-81 and Met-85 split into doublets due to drug binding (Met-47 could not be assigned in the15N-HSQC). In the C-terminal domain, the methyl groups of Met-120 and Met-157 experience only small chemical shift changes (Met-120, δ1H 0.03 ppm; δ13C, 0.04 ppm; and Met-157, δ1H 0.02 ppm). To gain further insight into the binding of levosimendan with Ca2+ - saturated cardiac TnC, two-dimensional NOESY spectra of free levosimendan, (Ca2+)3-cTnCC35S, and the drug-protein complex were acquired (Fig.5). For a small ligand like levosimendan with a short rotational correlation time (τc), NOEs are weak and negative but become stronger and positive when the ligand binds to the target protein. In water, the intramolecular NOE signals of levosimendan change their signs when the drug is titrated to the protein solution. This shows that there is a pronounced change in the correlation time of levosimendan in the presence of cTnC and, thus, proves that levosimendan binds to cTnC. We also looked for cross-peaks between unlabeled (Ca2+)3-cTnCC35Sand levosimendan with a 13C-labeled aromatic ring. In the13C-edited two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, several NOE correlations between labeled drug molecules and unlabeled protein were observed (Fig. 5). However, due to the instability of the protein-levosimendan samples, these NOEs could not be assigned by a titration series. Nevertheless, they provide direct evidence of the specific interaction between levosimendan and Ca2+-saturated cTnCC35S. All drug/protein samples were freshly prepared before collecting the data of the levosimendan binding to cTnC. Mass spectrometric analyses (MALDI-TOF) of the drug/protein samples were run in parallel with our NMR experiments. According to the mass spectrometric data, no formation of covalent complex was observed that could explain resonance doublings in the 15N-1H correlation spectrum. After a prolonged exposure of the protein to levosimendan, we observed some modification of the sample as described by Kleerekoper and Putkey (13Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This modification prohibited longer NMR experiments required for the complete structure characterization. All the NMR data were collected immediately after the addition of levosimendan to troponin C. Interestingly, we noticed that the new signals and the shift changes induced by levosimendan binding disappeared when the sample was stored for several days at 40 °C (data not shown). Notably, the spectral changes reappeared upon the addition of fresh levosimendan to the sample. Small angle x-ray scattering of the Ca2+-saturated form of cTnCC35S and its complex with levosimendan are rather similar. The scattered intensity obeys Guinier law at the smallestk values, and there is no sign of protein aggregation (Fig.6 A) (26Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955Google Scholar). There is only a small change in the form of the distance distribution function,P(r), when levosimendan binds to cTnCC35S (Fig. 6 B). The maximum distance increases from 63 ± 5 to 70 ± 5 Å, and the radius of gyration increases from 20.2 ± 0.5 to 21.7 ± 0.6 Å. The determined radius of gyration, 20.2 ± 0.5 Å, for troponin C without levosimendan, is in a good agreement with a previous study on troponin C (27Fujisawa T. Ueki T. Inoko Y. Acta Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 349-355Google Scholar). Our present finding that levosimendan reacts with common additives in protein solutions used in NMR studies clearly shows the need for careful studies of the stability of molecules used in binding experiments. In the drug discovery strategy structure-activity relationship by NMR (28Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W.

The binding of levosimendan to cardiac troponin C has been under debate for some time. Previous studies (5Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstöm K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I.

Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 479-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) gave evidence for levosimendan binding. However, contradictory results that show no binding have also been reported (13Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In our hands, in the course of the titration of (Ca2+)3-cTnCC35Swith levosimendan, some odd behavior was observed. The pH of the protein-drug solution changed during the experiments, and sometimes levosimendan precipitated out of the protein solution as a bright yellow precipitate, making it difficult to reproduce the measurements (data not shown). We have now found that commonly used additives in protein samples, DTT and NaN3, react with levosimendan (Fig. 1). Sodium azide forms an adduct with levosimendan, and consequently it was no longer added to our protein samples. To prepare cTnC samples without DTT was of concern because of the possible formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, we observed no intermolecular disulfide bond formation in our DTT-free cTnCC35S samples after a couple of days of incubation, as analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Moreover, intramolecular disulfide bonds are not possible in cTnCC35S, with only one cysteine residue. The controversial results of levosimendan binding to cTnC are difficult to explain only by drug reactivity under different experimental conditions. We believe that the differences to some extent also originate from the fact that various protein sequences have been used. In fact, the recombinant N-terminal fragment of human cTnC contains two cysteine residues, Cys-35 and Cys-84. In full-length chicken cTnCC35S, Cys-35 is mutated to serine, and in full-length chicken cTnCA-Cys, both cysteine residues are changed to serines. The residues Cys-35 and Cys-84 of cTnC are conserved among various species, suggesting their importance for the function of the protein. However, it has been previously reported that the conversion of cysteines to serines does not alter calcium binding to cTnC but might modify the structure of cTnC, as indicated by changes in its dye binding properties (17Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 15N-HSQC spectra show that binding of levosimendan to Ca2+-saturated forms of cTnCC35S and cTnCA-Cys are different. The small chemical shift changes attributed to the secondary binding sites are similar, but the observed resonance doublings in the N-domain of cTnCC35S are completely missing from the15N-HSQC spectrum of the A-Cys form of cTnC. This observation proves that the C84S mutant makes a difference in levosimendan binding to the primary binding site. We therefore conclude that the primary binding site critically depends on Cys-84. The isolated N-terminal fragment of cTnC also shows interaction with levosimendan (Fig. 2 D). However, the binding seems to be different compared with the full-length cTnCC35S. The N-terminal fragment does not contain an intact primary binding site for levosimendan. This is reasonable because Cys-84 is only a few residues away from the chain end at Gly-91. It would naturally be very interesting to localize the primary binding site of levosimendan in the cTnC. This is, however, presently not possible since there are effects all over the N-terminal half of cTnC. The fact that most of the residues in the N-domain of cTnCC35S show resonance-doubling indicates that the binding of levosimendan to the primary site causes a conformational change involving most of cNTnC. The exchange rate for this conformational change is slow, k < 10 s−1, since we do not observe any line-broadening effects. (Ca2+)3-cTnC exists in two conformations,i.e. the open and closed states. The exchange between open and closed conformations is intermediate on the NMR time scale, and the equilibrium favors the closed form (8Pääkkönen K. Annila A. Sorsa T. Pollesello P. Tilgmann C.

An obvious explanation for peak doublings would be that levosimendan binds only to the open conformation, but there is a large difference between thekon and koff values, thekoff being significantly slower as compared withkon. Another possible explanation is that levosimendan binds to both forms, but preferably to the open one, since in the presence of levosimendan the equilibrium reaches about a 50:50 ratio for the two states. The exchange between the two states of cTnC is significantly slower in the presence of levosimendan. At the present stage of the work, we were not able to completely rule out either possibility. It is interesting to compare the levosimendan binding to troponin C with the binding of other molecules (e.g. bepridil, EMD57033, and trifluoperazine (24Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). Recently, it has been shown by x-ray crystallography that the structure of cNTnC opens in response to bepridil binding (33Li Y. Love M.L. Putkey J.A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5140-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Three bepridil molecules bind to one cTnCA-Cys molecule. One bepridil molecule binds to the N-terminal half and opens its structure, and the other two bepridil molecules mimic the TnI binding to the C-terminal half. The chemical shift changes induced by levosimendan binding are smaller than those caused by bepridil binding (data not shown). In contrast to the case of bepridil binding to cTnC, our small angle x-ray scattering data show no sign of a domain-domain closure in the presence of levosimendan (Fig.6). If anything, it seems that levosimendan binding to the primary binding site, located close to the end of N-domain, prevents the domains from moving closer to each other and might actually increase the maximal distance (rmax). Alternatively, this might be caused by a levosimendan induced structural change in the regulatory domain of cTnC. In vivo cTnC is not expected to experience a large spatial reorganization of domains within the troponin complex. This is in accordance with Ca2+sensitizers, affecting only the regulatory domain. However, the final evidence will be obtained once the structure of the levosimendan-(Ca2+)3-cTnCC35Scomplex in solution is determined. Our data unambiguously show several interaction sites for levosimendan on the Ca2+-loaded form of cardiac troponin C (cTnCC35S). Levosimendan does bind to cTnCC35S, but only in the absence of NaN3 and DTT, which cause degradation of levosimendan. Thus, the current observations explain the discrepancies between earlier studies of levosimendan binding to cTnC. Our results suggest that the primary binding site is located in the regulatory domain (cNTnC) of cTnC and that there are two secondary binding sites at the C-terminal half of cTnC possibly analogous to the case of three bepridil molecules binding to cTnCA-Cys (33Li Y. Love M.L. Putkey J.A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5140-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Likewise, levosimendan may contribute to the opening of the regulatory domain. However, levosimendan does not cause a domain-domain closure. At present, we are not able to determine the precise locus of the primary binding site on the N-terminal domain due to the numerous changes in the spectra upon levosimendan binding. However, results from experiments with cTnCA-Cys show that the presence of Cys-84 is of critical importance for levosimendan binding. The results presented give us a reason to believe that the binding of levosimendan to the calcium-saturated regulatory domain of cTnC is the mechanism behind its known Ca2+-sensitizing effect."

These reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, combined with 50 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose in buffer A, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed four times with 1 ml of buffer A, separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried to Whatman filter paper. Radioactive protein bands were detected by fluorography. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (18Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: 1 μm purified histone H1 (Roche) or amphiphysin fusion protein cleaved from the GST tag according to the manufacturer's instructions was included in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing either 10 μg of purified GST-cdk5 and 10 μg of purified GST-p25, anti-p35 immunoprecipitate from rat brain extract, or 1 μg of GST-tagged human cyclin B1/cdc2. [γ-32P]ATP was included at a final specific activity of 1–10 Ci/mol in a total concentration of 200 μm. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling for 1 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried to Whatman filter paper, and radioactive protein bands were detected by autoradiography. Radioactive bands were quantitated on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by scanning on a Gel Doc 2000 densitometer (Bio-Rad). For SDS-PAGE mobility assays, 1 μm amphiphysin 1 or mutant 2 was incubated with 200 μm ATP in the presence or absence of 1 μg of GST cyclin B1/cdc2 overnight at room temperature in a total volume of 50 μl. Proteins were then separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and probed by Western blot with monoclonal amphiphysin 1 antibody. 50 μg of recombinant amphiphysin 1 was32P-radiolabeled in vitro using p35 immunoprecipitates from rat brain as described above. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amphiphysin band was excised. In conjunction with the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, this sample was trypsin-digested, and peptides were eluted from the gel and separated by HPLC as described previously (19Stone K.L.

CHO cells stably transfected with amphiphysin 1 were synchronized with nocodazole as described previously (23Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Culture of primary rat cortical neurons was performed as described previously (24Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells.

An amphiphysin stable cell line was generated by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum with human amphiphysin cDNA in pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected by neomycin resistance, and serial dilutions were performed to obtain single clones. Cos7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using p35 or amphiphysin 1 in vector pcDNA3 and LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (15Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 extracts of whole rat brain were prepared as described previously (15Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recently, amphiphysin has been identified as a substrate and interactor of the cdk5 kinase complex (10Rosales J.L. Nodwell M.J. Johnston R.N. Lee K.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further investigate this interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain extracts. Anti-amphiphysin antibodies purified the amphiphysin 1–2 heterodimer and coprecipitated p35, the activating subunit of the cdk5 kinase complex. Likewise, anti-p35 antibodies coprecipitated amphiphysin (Fig. 1). cdk5 was not detected in anti-amphiphysin immunoprecipitates, indicating that amphiphysin does not interact directly with the kinase and that a ternary complex of amphiphysin, p35, and cdk5 is not present at significant levels (data not shown). We probed the interaction of amphiphysin with p35 by reconstituting it in a transfected cell system. To this end, a CHO cell line stably transfected with amphiphysin 1 was transiently transfected with either p35 or empty control vector. As shown in Fig.2, immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against either amphiphysin or p35 precipitated a complex containing both proteins. cdk5 was endogenously expressed in this cell line and could be immunoprecipitated by anti-p35 antibodies (Fig.2 B, bottom panel). However, in agreement with our observation in brain extracts, amphiphysin immunoprecipitates did not contain cdk5. Based on the results of coprecipitation experiments, we investigated whether p35 and amphiphysin colocalize in cells. Both p35/cdk5 and amphiphysin have been implicated in neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration (14Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H.

As shown by Fig. 3, Aand B, endogenous amphiphysin 1 and p35 colocalize in the growth cones of rat cortical neurons in culture, consistent with a possible role for their interaction in growth cone navigation. Similar observations were made in Cos7 cells cotransfected with amphiphysin 1 and p35 cDNAs. In these cells, a large fraction of both proteins had a diffuse cytosolic distribution. In addition, pools of amphiphysin 1 and p35 were colocalized in ruffles and lamellipodia at the cell periphery (Fig. 3, C and D). These structures were also positive for filamentous actin, as demonstrated by phalloidin immunostaining. These findings are consistent with previous observations that both amphiphysin and the p35/cdk5 complex are present at actin-rich lammellipodial structures in neuronal growth cones (14Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar,28Mundigl O. Ochoa G.C. David C. Slepnev V.I. Kabanov A. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To map the domain of amphiphysin 1 that binds to p35, we radiolabeled p35 by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation and performed in vitro binding experiments with glutathione S-transferase-tagged fragments of amphiphysin 1. As shown in Fig. 4, the first 306 amino acids of amphiphysin 1 were sufficient to retainin vitro translated p35 on glutathione-Sepharose beads. These data confirm the interaction of amphiphysin 1 with p35 and demonstrate that the binding site for p35 resides in the NH2-terminal domain of the molecule. We next investigated cdk5 phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1. To this end, we prepared immunoprecipitates of the p35/cdk5 complex from rat brain using anti-p35 antibodies. These immunoprecipitates were then used in in vitro kinase reactions with recombinant amphiphysin 1 or histone H1, a known cdk5 substrate. As shown in Fig. 5, lanes a–d, p35 immunoprecipitates, but not control IgG immunoprecipitates, incorporated radiolabeled phosphate into both histone H1 and amphiphysin 1. In vitro kinase reactions performed with bacterially expressed recombinant p35/cdk5 instead of immunoprecipitates gave similar results, indicating that amphiphysin 1 is phosphorylated by cdk5 and not by a contaminating kinase from brain extracts (data not shown). To determine what region of amphiphysin 1 is phosphorylated by cdk5, recombinant peptides corresponding to overlapping regions of the protein were tested in in vitro kinase reactions. This strategy demonstrated the presence of a major phosphorylation site or sites selectively in amphiphysin 1 fragments comprising amino acids 1–306 and 262–435 (Fig. 5). Strikingly, the region of overlap between these two peptide fragments, but not other regions of the two fragments, contains several potential consensus phosphorylation motifs for cdk5, as indicated in Fig.6 A. To confirm that the region between amino acids 262–306 contained the phosphorylation site for cdk5, tryptic digestion of in vitro 32P-phosphorylated amphiphysin 1 was performed, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated by HPLC chromatography. Chromatographic fractions were then assayed for radioactivity, and the radioactive peptides were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy and subsequent microsequence analysis. By this method, we identified a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 260–292 (arrowheads in Fig. 6 A), in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 5. We mapped which amino acid residues of amphiphysin 1 within this region are targets for phosphorylation by cdk5 by generating full-length amphiphysin 1 constructs in which threonine 260, serine 262, serine 268, serine 272, serine 276, and serine 285 were mutated to nonphosphorylatable residues. These recombinant proteins were then tested in in vitro kinase reactions using the p35/cdk5 complex immunoprecipitated from rat brain. This strategy demonstrated that mutation of threonine 260, serine 262, and serine 268 (Fig. 6,Mut 1) did not affect amphiphysin phosphorylation, whereas constructs harboring mutations of serine 272, serine 276, and serine 285 (Fig. 6, Mut 2 and 3) showed reduced phosphorylation. The cdk5 phosphorylation site or sites in amphiphysin therefore reside in one or more of these three amino acids. Members of the cyclin-dependent family of kinases require similar sequence motifs in their respective substrates (30Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Two other proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin function, epsin and eps15, are substrates for cyclin-dependent kinases in mitotic cells (23Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P.

Whereas amphiphysin 1 is expressed at high concentration in neurons, it is also expressed at lower levels in other cells, including dividing cells (11Floyd S.R. Butler M.H. Cremona O. David C.

In addition, it is overexpressed in some breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines and was identified as a paraneoplastic syndrome autoantigen in patients with breast cancer (2De Camilli P. Thomas A. Cofiell R. Folli F. Lichte B. Piccolo G. Meinck H.M. Austoni M. Fassetta G. Bottazzo G. Bates D. Cartlidge N. Solimena M. Kilimann M.W. J. Exp.

Med. 1993; 328: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These considerations prompted us to investigate whether amphiphysin undergoes mitotic phosphorylation. Based on substrate sequence preference similarities among cyclin-dependent kinases, we tested whether amphiphysin 1 is phosphorylated in vitro by the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2/cyclin B1. To this end, we used a purified recombinant cdc2/cyclin B1 complex in which cdc2 harbors an activating mutation (17Lowe M. Rabouille C. Nakamura N. Watson R. Jackman M. Jamsa E. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 94: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 A, full-length amphiphysin 1 was phosphorylated by this complex. Using amphiphysin fragments, we mapped the major cdc2/cyclin B1 phosphorylation site(s) to the region between amino acids 262 and 306, i.e. the same region that is phosphorylated by cdk5 (Fig. 7 A). Both cdc2/cyclin B1 and cdk5 showed reduced phosphorylation of the amphiphysin mutant (Mut 2) harboring serine to alanine substitutions at positions 272, 276, and 285, indicating that amphiphysin is phosphorylated at these residues by both of these kinases (Fig. 7 B). We next tested phosphorylation of amphiphysin in mitotic cells. CHO cells stably transfected with amphiphysin 1 were mitotically synchronized using nocodazole, and the electrophoretic mobility of amphiphysin 1 was analyzed by Western blotting in the mitotic and G1 stages. As shown by Fig. 7 C, amphiphysin 1 undergoes a mobility shift in mitotic cells. This slower mobility, which has been observed for several other mitotic phosphoproteins, could be reversed by alkaline phosphatase treatment of the mitotic extract, as expected for a shift due to phosphorylation (Fig.7 C, lane 2). Interestingly, cdc2/cyclin B1 could induce an electrophoretic shift in recombinant amphiphysin 1 inin vitro kinase reactions (Fig. 7 D). This shift was reduced in the Mut 2 amphiphysin construct harboring serine to alanine mutations at residues 272, 276, and 285. Note, however, that even the Mut 2 variant of amphiphysin runs slightly slower than wild type amphiphysin in SDS-PAGE after the in vitro kinase reaction with cdc2/cyclin B1 complex. This observation suggests that under these in vitro conditions, cdc2 can phosphorylate additional sites. In this study we report evidence for a functional link between amphiphysin 1 and the cdk5 kinase complex. We have demonstrated thein vivo occurrence of an interaction between amphiphysin and the cdk5 regulatory subunit p35 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. This interaction is analogous to the Pcl2-Rvs167 interaction in yeast. We have also shown that p35 binds to the evolutionary conserved NH2-terminal region of amphiphysin 1, in agreement with the reported binding of Pcl2 to the NH2-terminal moiety of Rvs167 (3Lee J. Colwill K. Aneliunas V. Tennyson C. Moore L. Ho Y. Andrews B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1310-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our findings point to a further similarity between the mammalian p35/cdk5/amphiphysin 1 and the yeast Pcl2/Pho85/Rvs167 protein networks. We also mapped the main cdk5 phosphorylation site to a small fragment containing three serine residues in the central region of amphiphysin 1, just upstream of the binding sites for clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2, although phosphorylation of this site did not appear to affect AP-2 or clathrin binding. 2S. R. Floyd, E. B. Porro, V. I. Slepnev, G.-C. Ochoa, L.-H. Tsai, and P. De Camilli, unpublished observations. Because Rvs167, like several other members of the amphiphysin family, does not contain recognizable clathrin or AP-2 binding sites (33Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that cdk5 phosphorylation may not represent a conserved mechanism to regulate these interactions. Studies of p35/cdk5 have revealed a key role of this complex in the regulation of actin function at the leading edge of neuronal processes with important functional implications for neuronal migration and growth cone navigation (14Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 26Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H.

Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Likewise, independent studies have suggested a role of amphi- physin and its binding partners in growth cone dynamics (28Mundigl O. Ochoa G.C. David C. Slepnev V.I. Kabanov A. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amphiphysin has also been implicated in endocytosis, a process for which a key role of actin is emerging (37Wendland B. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,38Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although a function of cdk5 phosphorylation in endocytosis has not been reported, in yeast, Pho85, Plc2, and Rvs167 mutations have strikingly similar effects on both actin function and endocytosis (3Lee J. Colwill K. Aneliunas V. Tennyson C. Moore L. Ho Y. Andrews B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1310-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest therefore that amphiphysin, p35, and cdk5 may be interrelated in their physiological functions in vivo. Our demonstration that amphiphysin 1 and p35 colocalize with each other and with actin in lamellipodia of transfected cells supports this possibility. We note that an interaction between amphiphysin 2 and the cAbl kinase has been reported (39Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12390-12395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). cAbl has recently been shown to phosphorylate and activate cdk5 and to bind cdk5 through the bridging protein cables (40Zukerberg L.R. Patrick G.N. Nikolic M. Humbert S. Wu C.L. Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Vidal M. Van Etten R.A. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition, cAbl is known to have regulatory actions on the actin cytoskeleton and participate in neuronal development (41Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 42Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1259-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Finally, we have shown that amphiphysin 1 undergoes mitotic phosphorylation. The same region that is a target for cdk5 phosphorylation can also be phosphorylated by the mitotic cdc2/cyclin B1 complex. Thus, phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1 in this region may have a similar conserved function in both neurons and dividing cells. One of the critical events that correlates with mitosis is the dramatic rearrangement of the peripheral cytoplasm that results in the partial dissociation of cells from the substratum. Cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of amphiphysin may help to produce local changes in the actin cytoskeleton that are crucial for the dynamic properties of dividing cells, neuronal growth cones, the leading edge of migrating cells, and the function of the mature synapse. We thank Drs. Graham Warren and Yanzhuang Wang for the generous provision of reagents and advice on cdc2 phosphorylation. We thank Warren T. Kim for aid with neuronal cultures and immunofluorescence."

We report here the identification of two new factors that associate with the CCR4-NOT proteins as follows: CAF4, a WD40-containing protein, and CAF16, a putative ABC ATPase.

Liu, Y.-C. Chiang, J. Chen, V. Badarinarayana, and C. L. Denis, unpublished observations. The smaller of the CCR4-NOT complexes contains CCR4, CAF1 (POP2), the five NOT proteins (NOT1–5), and two other proteins (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar). All of the components of the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex also comigrate at 1.9 MDa following gel filtration analysis (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar),1 and mutations in individual components of the CCR4-NOT complex destroy the ability of these components to migrate at 1.9 MDa (4Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar).1 Although antibody directed against the core CCR4-NOT proteins does not coimmunoprecipitate any other proteins, a number of other proteins that do not coimmunoprecipitate at their physiological concentrations with CCR4 antibody do interact with the CCR4-NOT complex genetically and can be coimmunoprecipitated when overexpressed. These proteins may possibly be components of the larger 1.9-MDa complex and include such proteins as DBF2, a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase (5Liu H.-Y Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), MOB1, a protein that binds DBF2 and is involved in cell cycle regulation (6Komarnitsky S.I.

Mitsui H. Liu H.-Y. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). Both DBF2 and MOB1 have also been observed to migrate at 1.9 MDa following gel filtration analysis.1 The internal arrangement of factors in the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex has been studied (4Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar). NOT1 appears to be the core component of the complex. CAF1 binds to the central region of NOT1 and links CCR4 to the rest of the NOT proteins. The C terminus of NOT1, in turn, contacts NOT2, NOT5, and NOT4. The physical separation of CCR4 and CAF1 from NOT2, NOT4, and NOT5 agrees with several phenotypic differences between these proteins (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar). Whereas CAF1 is absolutely required for CCR4 to associate with the 1-MDa complex (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar), CCR4 can still associate in the 1.9-MDa complex in the absence of CAF1 (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that within this larger complex CCR4 is making contacts to proteins other than ones found in the core 1-MDa complex. Based on the observation that CCR4 can only immunoprecipitate other components of the core 1-MDa complex, these other interactions in the 1.9-MDa complex may be more susceptible to disruption. The CCR4-NOT proteins have been found to affect gene expression both positively and negatively (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L.

Their action as repressors are likely to be the result of the NOT proteins restricting access of TBP2 to noncanonical TATAAs (8Collart M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6668-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). NOT1 has been shown to associate with TBP (14Lee T.I. Wyric J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); NOT5 interacts with TFIID (15Badarinarayana V. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L.

Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and NOT2 has been shown to associate with ADA2, a component of the SAGA complex (16Benson J.D. Benson M. Howley P.M. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6714-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, deletions of upstream sequences do not apparently affect the ability of CCR4 to affect ADH2 expression (17Denis C.L. Malvar T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 283-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that CCR4 acts at a post-chromatin remodeling step in affectingADH2 derepression (18Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di. Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The large sizes of the CCR4-NOT complexes and the possible mode of action of these proteins at or near the TATAA suggest that these complexes would be likely to interact with other proteins acting to control initiation of transcription. In this study we report the identification of two additional factors, CAF4 and CAF16, that interact with the CCR4-NOT proteins and that affect transcription both positively and negatively. Neither CAF16 nor CAF4 was a component of the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex, but both proteins were present in a 1.9-MDa complex, and their presence in this complex was dependent on CCR4. CAF16 and CAF4, in turn, were found to interact with SRB9, -10, and -11, components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (19Balciunas D. Ronne H.

SRB10 and -11 are a cyclin-dependent protein kinase/cyclin pair that are capable of phosphorylating the CTD of RNA polymerase II (21Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.-M.

Whereas none of these three SRB genes are essential, the SRB9–11 proteins have been found to play both positive and negative roles in transcription (20Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev.

We found that the SRB9, 10, and 11 proteins can coimmunoprecipitate the CCR4 and NOT proteins, and defects in these SRB proteins affect expression at the ADH2 locus in a manner similar to that observed for defects in CCR4 complex components. These results indicate a close physical and functional link between CCR4-NOT components and the SRB9, -10, and -11 proteins.

Alignments were performed by using the Clustal method available in the DNASTAR package (DNA Star Inc.). A Superose 6 column HR10/30 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two hundred μl of yeast extract at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml was placed over the column following clarification by centrifugation as described previously (1Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V.

Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (3Draper M.P. Liu H.-Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Antibody to CAF16 was raised against its C-terminal peptide, CCKRDNQIPDKEIGI, whereas antibody to CAF4 was against CAF4 tagged with three copies of the HA1 epitope at its C terminus and integrated at the CAF4 locus as described (46Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.-M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thecaf4::URA3 disruption plasmid was created by replacing the BclI fragment of CAF4 (base pairs 851–2162) with a BamHI fragment of URA3. TheCAF16 disruption plasmid was constructed by removing nucleotides 368–706 base pairs of CAF16 following cutting with NdeI, blunt ending with the large subunit ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase (Klenow), and replacing it with a HindIII fragment of URA3 (blunt-ended with Klenow). The resultant plasmid JP7 was cut with M1uI andSstI prior to transformation to replace the chromosomal copy of CAF16. LexA-CAF16 (pJp1) was constructed by placing an EcoRI fragment, 2 kilobase pairs, from pRS316-CAF16 into the EcoRI polylinker of pLexA87- (9Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). LexA-CAF4 was formed by ligating theEcoRI fragment of CAF4 from ML4-3 (2 kilobase pairs EcoRV piece of CAF4 cloned into theSmaI site of pSP72) into LexA-202-2 (9Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) cut withEcoRI. ADH and β-galactosidase activities were determined as previously described (29Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The screen for proteins interacting with LexA-CCR4 (full-length) was conducted as described previously using strain EGY188 containing the p34 reporter plasmid (8 LexA operators upstream of thelacZ gene). The B42 fusion proteins contain the HA1 epitope, the B42 E. coli-derived activation domain, a nuclear localization sequence, and fragments of the yeast genome fused to the C terminus of B42 (30Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 232-233Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The LexA activators were LexA-ADR1 containing full-length ADR1, LexA-ADR1-TADIV containing residues 642–704 of ADR1, LexA-B42 containing the E. coli-derived B42 activation domain fused to LexA-(1–202) (29Cook W.J.

A yeast two-hybrid screen using LexA-CCR4 as a bait was conducted with a library of yeast sequences fused to the B42 activator to identify additional components of the multisubunit CCR4-NOT complexes. In addition to identifying CAF1 and DBF2 (5Liu H.-Y Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Draper M.P.

Deletion analysis indicated that an intact leucine-rich repeat (residues 345–470) of CCR4 was required for its interaction with both CAF4 and CAF16 (Table II, lines 7 and 8) but not the N-terminal region of CCR4 (lines 5 and 6); the leucine-rich repeat was also required for CCR4 interaction with CAF1, NOT1, and DBF2 (1Liu H.-Y.

Sequencing of CAF4 revealed it to encode a novel protein (yeast protein YKR036c) containing seven WD40 repeats in its C terminus (residues 320–659). CAF16 when sequenced in its entirety was found to encode a protein (now designated YFL028c) that shares significant homology to the ABC ATPase family of proteins (31Dean M. Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Kistler A. Sharer B. Michaelis S. Strathern J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,32Poole R.K. Hatch L. Cleeter M.W. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Wu G. Mol.

Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). CAF16 differs from most of the eucaryotic ABC ATPase proteins in that it lacks the transmembrane domains characteristic of this family. One other eucaryotic ABC ATPase, EF3, involved in translational elongation also lacks these signature transmembrane domains (34Qin S. Xie A. Bonato C.M. McLaughlin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAF16 also contains only one ABC ATPase domain, whereas most other eucaryotic ABC ATPases contain two domains, suggesting that CAF16 may interact with itself, as was confirmed by two-hybrid analysis (Table II, line 14).Table IICCR4 interacts with CAF4 and CAF16LexA fusionB42 fusionβ-Galactosidase activityLineunits/mgLexA-CCR4-(1–837)B42301LexA-CCR4-(1–837)B42-CAF4542LexA-CCR4-(1–837)B42-CAF163703LexA-CCR4-(1–13/210–837)B4284LexA-CCR4-(1–13/210–837)B42-CAF4225LexA-CCR4-(1–13/210–837)B42-CAF166706LexA-CCR4-(1–395/420–837)B42-CAF4<27LexA-CCR4-(1–395/420–837)B42-CAF16<28LexAB42-CAF4<29LexAB42-CAF16<210LexA-CAF4B42-NOT1110011LexA-CAF4B42-DBF255012LexA-CAF4B422513LexA-CAF16B42-CAF166314LexA-CAF16B42<215LexA-CCR4-(1–837), B42-DBF2, and B42-NOT1 contain full-length versions of CCR4, DBF2, and NOT1 proteins, respectively.

Assays repressed the average of at least four transformants, and S.E. was less than 20%. In addition to two-hybrid interactions observed between CAF4 or CAF16 with CCR4, LexA-CAF4 was shown to interact specifically with B42-NOT1 and B42-DBF2 (Table II, lines 11 and 12). It should be noted that LexA-CAF4 was capable of activating transcription weakly by itself (line 13), a phenotype also observed with LexA-CCR4, LexA-CAF1, and several LexA-NOT proteins (3Draper M.P.

To determine if the observed two-hybrid interactions were the result of in vivo physical association of CCR4 with CAF16 and CAF4, coimmunoprecipitation analysis was conducted. Immunoprecipitating CCR4 with anti-CCR4 antibody failed, however, to coimmunoprecipitate specifically B42-CAF16 or B42-CAF4 or their cognate unfused proteins (data not shown). These data suggest that CAF16 and CAF4 are not components of the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex since all of the NOT proteins and CAF1 can be immunoprecipitated with CCR4 in this core complex (1Liu H.-Y.

Biol. 1995; 15: 487-495Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar).1 Moreover, neither CAF16 nor CAF4 was found to be present in a purified 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex.1 To determine whether the CAF16 and CAF4 proteins associated in the 1.9-MDa CCR4-NOT complex, gel filtration analysis was conducted. Following Superose 6 chromatography a subset of the CAF16 protein was found to migrate at 1.9 MDa, coincident with the size of the 1.9-MDa CCR4-NOT complex (Fig. 1, top panel). A similar analysis with CAF4 protein tagged with the HA1 epitope showed that CAF4-HA migrated at 1.9 MDa (Fig. 1, 2ndfrom top panel). Deletion of CCR4 was found to remove effectively CAF16 and CAF4 from the 1.9-MDa complex (Fig.1 , top two panels). A ccr4 deletion did not have this effect on CAF1 or CAF40 (another component of the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex) (Fig. 1, bottom two panels), nor did it have this effect on DBF2, which is also a presumed component of the 1.9-MDa CCR4-NOT complex (Fig. 1, middle panel). The effect of theccr4 deletion on CAF16 and CAF4 migration at 1.9 MDa supports the physical presence of CAF16 and CAF4 in the larger CCR4-NOT complex and that CCR4 is required for these proteins to associate in this complex. The observation that a majority of the CAF16 in the cell is not apparently in the 1.9-MDa complex suggests that CAF16 may have other functions than those dealing with CCR4 or that the CAF16 association with CCR4 is unstable. The above results suggest that CCR4 interacts with CAF16 and CAF4 but that CAF16 and CAF4 are external to the core 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex. Since CAF1 is absolutely required for CCR4 association in the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex, we subsequently tested whether CCR4 interaction with CAF16 and CAF4 was dependent on CAF1. In a caf1 deletion strain, LexA-CCR4-(1–837) interacted with B42-CAF16 (280 units/mg β-galactosidase) as well as it did in a CAF1 strain (TableII, line 3; 370 units/mg β-galactosidase). These data confirm that CCR4-CAF16 interactions are separate from those that link CCR4 to the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex. A similar two-hybrid analysis with CAF4 showed that B42-CAF4 interacted with LexA-CCR4 in a caf1 strain (150 units/mg β-galactosidase) (compare with 54 units/mg β-galactosidase in the wild-type strain, Table II, line 2). The fact that CAF4 interacted better with CCR4 in a caf1 background suggests that CAF1 interferes with CAF4 binding to CCR4. Although CAF4 was not in the 1-MDa CCR4-NOT complex, we analyzed whether CAF4 when overexpressed was capable of immunoprecipitating with DBF2 and NOT1 based on their strong two-hybrid interactions (Table II, lines 11 and 12). Immunoprecipitating LexA-CAF4 with anti-LexA antibody was capable of coimmunoprecipitating B42-DBF2 (Fig.2, lane"
https://openalex.org/W2037185437,"The thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor (TP) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, α (343 residues) and β (407 residues) that share the first 328 residues. We have previously shown that TPβ, but not TPα, undergoes agonist-induced internalization in a dynamin-, GRK-, and arrestin-dependent manner. In the present report, we demonstrate that TPβ, but not TPα, also undergoes tonic internalization. Tonic internalization of TPβ was temperature- and dynamin-dependent and was inhibited by sucrose and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment but unaffected by wild-type or dominant-negative GRKs or arrestins. Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a Y<i>X</i> <sub>3</sub>φ motif (where<i>X</i> is any residue and φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) found in the proximal portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of TPβ was critical for tonic internalization but had no role in agonist-induced internalization. Interestingly, introduction of either a Y<i>X</i> <sub>2</sub>φ or Y<i>X</i> <sub>3</sub>φ motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of TPα induced tonic internalization of this receptor. Additional analysis revealed that tonically internalized TPβ undergoes recycling back to the cell surface suggesting that tonic internalization may play a role in maintaining an intracellular pool of TPβ. Our data demonstrate the presence of distinct signals for tonic and agonist-induced internalization of TPβ and represent the first report of a Y<i>X</i> <sub>3</sub>φ motif involved in tonic internalization of a cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2024244991,"The protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin delivers the toxin's enzymatic moieties to the cytosol of mammalian cells by a mechanism associated with its ability to heptamerize and form a transmembrane pore. Here we report that mutations in Lys-397, Asp-425, or Phe-427 ablate killing of CHO-K1 cells by a cytotoxic PA ligand. These mutations blocked PA's ability to mediate pore formation and translocation in cells but had no effect on its receptor binding, proteolytic activation, or ability to oligomerize and bind the toxin's enzymatic moieties. The mutation-sensitive residues lie in the 2β7-2β8 and 2β10-2β11 loops of domain 2 and are distant both in primary structure and topography from the 2β2-2β3 loop, which is believed to participate in formation of a transmembrane β-barrel. These results suggest that Lys-397, Asp-425, and Phe-427 participate in conformational rearrangements of a heptameric pore precursor that are necessary for pore formation and translocation. Identification of these residues will aid in elucidating the mechanism of translocation and may be useful in developing therapeutic and prophylactic agents against anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W2074757035,"The melanoma growth stimulatory activity/growth-regulated protein, CXCL1, is constitutively expressed at high levels during inflammation and progression of melanocytes into malignant melanoma. It has been shown previously that CXCL1 overexpression in melanoma cells is due to increased transcription as well as stability of the CXCL1 message. The transcription ofCXCL1 is regulated through several cis-acting elements including Sp1, NF-κB, HMGI(Y), and the immediate upstream region (IUR) element (nucleotides −94 to −78), which lies immediately upstream to the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) element. Previously, it has been shown that the IUR is necessary for basal and cytokine-induced transcription of the CXCL1 gene. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses indicate that the IUR oligonucleotide probe selectively binds a 115-kDa protein. In this study, the IUR element has been further characterized. We show here that proximity of the IUR element to the adjacent NF-κB element is critical to its function as a positive regulatory element. Using binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography, we have selectively purified the 115-kDa IUR-F. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectroscopy and amino acid analysis as well as microcapillary reverse phase chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry identified this protein as the 114-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1).

Shattuck R.L. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 87-124Google Scholar). The CXCL1 gene is not constitutively expressed in normal retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) but can be induced by cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, Hs294T malignant melanoma cells exhibit high, constitutive levels ofCXCL1 mRNA. IL-1 treatment of Hs294T cells does not significantly increase the transcription of the gene, although it does appear to stabilize CXCL1 mRNA (2Shattuck R.L. Wood L.D. Jaffe G.J. Richmond A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 791-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the CXCL1 gene is regulated through a 306-bp minimal promoter comprising four cis-acting elements, which include the TATA box (−25 to −30 nt), a NF-κB binding site (−67 to −77 nt), an AT-rich HMGI(Y) binding element nested within the NF-κB site, an immediate upstream region (IUR; −78 to −93 nt), and a GC-rich SP1 binding site (−117 to −128 nt) (3Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In RPE cells, IL-1 increases nuclear levels of NF-κB p65 (RelA) and NF-κB p50 subunits (4Wang X.C. Jobin C. Allen J.B. Roberts W.L. Jaffe G.J. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 477-486PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to the IL-1-induced activation of the I-κB kinases (IKK1/IKK2) and subsequent phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of the IKK substrate, I-κB. In Hs294T cells, constitutively high nuclear levels of the p50 and p65/RelA proteins can be correlated with constitutive activity of IKK1/IKK2 and enhanced degradation of the I-κB protein. (5Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar, 6Devalaraja M.N. Wang D.Z. Ballard D.W. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1372-1377PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB element therefore represents a crucial, inducible component of the putativeCXCL1 enhanceosome. The IUR is an ∼20-bp sequence, which is located immediately upstream of the NF-κB site in the CXCL1 promoter. Previously, we demonstrated that this element is essential for basal as well as cytokine expression of the CXCL1 gene. In particular, point mutations within a putative TCGAT motif abolished basal and IL-1-induced transcription in reporter gene assays with RPE and Hs294T cells. Furthermore, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), these mutations blocked the ability of this element to compete with a constitutive, IUR-specific complex in RPE and Hs294T nuclear extracts (7Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses revealed that at least one protein having a relative molecular size of 115 kDa bound the IUR element in a sequence-specific (8Luan J. Shattuck-Brandt R. Haghnegahdar H. Owen J.D. Strieter R. Burdick M. Nirodi C. Beauchamp D. Johnson K.N. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study, the 115-kDa IUR-specific protein has been purified by binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Peptide sequence analysis identifies this protein as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP is a 114–115-kDa nuclear DNA-binding protein, which catalyzes the transfer of long, branched ADP-ribose chains to either itself or different classes of target proteins involved in chromatin decondensation, DNA replication, DNA repair, and gene expression (9Lindahl T. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1995; 19: 7-73Google Scholar,10Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) ADP-ribosylation by PARP affects such cellular processes as apoptosis, necrosis, cellular differentiation, and malignant transformation (11Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). PARP appears to have dual functions in the regulation of transcription. PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the transcription factors TATA-binding protein, Yin-Yang (YY1), Sp1 (12Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), NF-κB (13Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and p53 (14Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and alters the sequence-specific DNA binding of these protein and is thought to cause a reversible silencing of transcription. On the other hand, PARP has been shown to enhance activator-dependent transcription in vitro (15Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). More recently, PARP has been shown to activate muscle-specific gene expression by interacting with sequences in the MCAT element of the cardiac troponin T promoter and by ADP-ribosylating the MCAT-specific transcription enhancer factor 1 (16Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, PARP increases the on-rate binding of nuclear factors to the PAX-6 gene enhancer (17Plaza S. Aumercier M. Bailly M. Dozier C. Saule S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PARP has been shown to activate transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation in cooperation with the transcription factor, B-MYB (18Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and potentiates the transcriptional activation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein (19Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, the IUR element of the CXCL1 promoter has been further characterized. Evidence presented here indicates that the IUR is a positive cis-acting element and its activity is dependent on its contiguity with the adjacent NF-κB element. A 115-kDa IUR specific activity has been purified by binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography and identified as PARP. A specific PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, inhibits CXCL1 promoter activity and decreases the endogenous levels of CXCL1mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that PARP is a potential coactivator of CXCL1 gene transcription. Hs294T melanoma cells are a continuous cell line established from a human melanoma metastatic to the lymph node. These cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). RPE cells are normal retinal pigment epithelial cells that were cultured by Dr. Glenn Jaffe from the North Carolina Organ Donor and Eye Bank within 24 h of death. RPE and Hs294T cells were cultured as described previously (7Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, Hs294T cells were incubated at 37 °C in the absence of serum for 48 h, during which period, cells received the indicated doses of 3-aminobenzamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 24-h intervals. The wild-type IUR probe, 2xIUR, used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blot analyses had the upper strand sequence 5′-ccatcgatctggaactccggttcgatctggaactccggatgc-3′ and contained two copies of the IUR sequence, which are underscored. Sequences between the two IUR repeats and those flanking the probe were included to optimize binding. A mutant IUR oligonucleotide, 2xmIUR, which contained mutations in the TCGAT motif of the IUR element had the upper strand sequence, 5′-ccaAGTaCctggaactccggtAGTaCctggaactccggatgc-3′. Uppercase characters indicate nucleotide replacements in the TCGAT motif, and the underscored sequences define the two copies of IUR element. The oligonucleotide used to multimerize the IUR sequence for DNA affinity chromatography had the upper strand sequence 5′- gggatcgatctggaactccgggatcgatctggaactcc-3′ and the lower strand sequence 5′-cccggagttccagatcgatcccggagttccagatcgat-3′. The underscored characters represent the two copies of the IUR sequence. The two strands when annealed form cohesive ends and were ligated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the multimerized IUR DNA comprising up to 24 tandem repeats of the 2x IUR sequence. A similar strategy was employed to generate the multimerized mutant IUR (mIUR) DNA using the upper strand sequence 5′-gggaAGTaCctggaactccgggaAGTaCctggaactcc-3′. The uppercase characters represent nucleotide replacements in the TCGAT motif, and the underscored characters outline the IUR element repeats. The CXCL1 minimal promoter region (−306 to +45 nt) was inserted in the pGL2 Basic vector (Promega) either in the correct orientation (pWT.Luc) or in the opposite orientation (pREV.Luc) relative to the transcription start site. To separate the IUR element from the NF-κB site, pWT.Luc was modified to include an NcoI site between the two elements using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis sytem (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutagenic oligonucleotide employed for this purpose had the sequence: 5′-tcgggatcgatctggaactccATgggaatttccctggcc-3′. (The characters in uppercase represent the 2-nucleotide insertion that was necessary to create the NcoI site, which is underscored.) The modified construct was termed pIN:2 to represent a two nucleotide insertion between the the IUR and NF-κB sites. Similarly, mutant promoters containing a 6-bp (pIN:6) and 12-bp insertion (pIN:12) were generated using the mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-gggatcgatctggaactccGGATCCgggaatttccctggcc-3′ and 5′-tcgggatcgatctggaactccGGATCCTCTAGAgggaatttccctggcc-3′. (Characters in uppercase represent the BamHI site and theBamHI/XbaI sites introduced to create the 6- and 12-bp separations.) To generate the promoter with a 25-bp insertion (pIN: 25), a 25-bp oligonucleotide having the sequence 5′-catggcagtgagcgcaacgcaattac-3′ and flanked by NcoI sites, was inserted in the NcoI site of pIN:2. A clone pIN:50, in which the 25-bp insert had dimerized, was also selected. To generate the pGL2.mIUR construct, the TCGAT motif in the wild type promoter was mutated to AGTAC by using a mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-ttccttccggactcgggaAGTaCctggaactccgggaatt-3′. All constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and automated plasmid sequencing. Anti-PARP antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The PARP enzyme was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (7Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All extracts contained a 1× concentration of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 2xIUR or the 2xmIUR probes were radiolabeled by extension of an annealed primer, 5′-gcatccggagttcca-3′ with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and [α-32P]dCTP. A typical binding reaction involved a 15-min pre-incubation with 10 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC), 200 ng of single-stranded oligonucleotide, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, followed by a 20-min incubation with 50,000 cpm (40 fmol) of radiolabeled probe. In oligonucleotide competitions, 1000-fold molar excess of cold, double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the pre-incubation mix. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis for 2 h at 170 V on a 6% native, polyacrylamide gel, which was later dried and processed for autoradiography. EMSA with affinity-purified fractions contained 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 100 ng of cold, double-stranded 2mR oligonucleotide to ensure specificity of binding in the fractions. In cases where purified PARP was used, the reaction mixture contained 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) and about 5–10 fmol of pure enzyme (catalog no. 4667-50-01) obtained from R&D Systems. Nuclear extracts (25 μg) were heated at 90 °C for 3 min in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, resolved on 4% stacking/8% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were rocked for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked for 4 h at room temperature with buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mg/ml skim milk powder, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml native salmon sperm DNA), and incubated overnight at room temperature in up to 2 ml of Buffer A + 107 cpm (8–10 pmol) of radiolabeled 2xIUR or 2xmIUR probes. Membranes were subjected to three washes of 15 min each at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mmHepes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 g/liter skim milk powder, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, prior to drying and autoradiography. For Western analysis, membranes were probed with 800 μg/10 ml anti-PARP rabbit polyclonal antibody (catalog no. sc-7150) from Santa Cruz Antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA) using procedures recommended by the antibody manufacturer, and the signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA from Hs294T cells treated over a 48-h period with various doses of 3-aminobenzamide was isolated using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified RNA (20 μg/lane) was used in Northern analysis, which was performed exactly as described previously (2Shattuck R.L. Wood L.D. Jaffe G.J. Richmond A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 791-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After probing for levels of CXCL1 mRNA, blots were stripped by boiling for 10 min in water and re-probed with radiolabeled, cyclophilin cDNA. Bands corresponding to the CXCL1 and cyclophilin were analyzed by PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Values for CXCL1 mRNA were normalized against cyclophilin mRNA. The experiment was repeated three times in triplicate. Mean normalized values obtained from samples receiving the highest dose of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) were compared with values from samples that received Me2SO alone and were found to be statistically different as determined by Student'st test (paired). Hs294T were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105. The following day, cells at nearly 70% confluence were transfected using the LipofectAMINE/Plus method (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of the appropriate reporter construct containing either the wild type CXCL1 promoter (WT) or promoters containing insertions between the IUR and NF-κB elements or nucleotide replacements within the TCGAT motif of the IUR element (mIUR.Luc). In addition, all samples received 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). In transfection experiments where 3-aminobenzamide was used, cells were first transfected with 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal reporter as well as reporter constructs driven by either the wild type (CXCL1.Luc) or the mutant CXCL1 (mIUR.Luc) promoters. Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by medium containing either Me2SO or 3-aminobenzamide within a dose range of 1–5 m. A second change of Me2SO- or 3-AB-containing medium was given at 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and processed as described above. All values were normalized to β-galactosidase expression to correct for transfection efficiency. Each experiment was repeated three separate times in triplicate. In promoter mutagenesis experiments, mean normalized values from samples showing the highest inhibition of promoter activity were compared with those obtained from samples transfected with the wild type promoter and were found to be significantly different according to Student's paired ttest. Similarly, mean normalized values of the samples treated with the highest dose of 3-AB were compared with values obtained of the sample containing the wild type promoter treated with Me2SO alone and were found to be significantly different according to Student's paired t test (p < 0.01). Statistical measurements were performed using Microsoft Excel software. Binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography was performed using a modified protocol of Kadonaga et al. (20Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Briefly, multimers of the IUR were cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose to generate the IUR-agarose column. Similarly, a control column containing mIUR multimers (mIUR-agarose) was made. Cells equivalent to 60 liters of HeLa suspension culture were obtained from National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Approximately 2.5 g of nuclear extract was prepared from these cells. First, nonspecific DNA-binding proteins were competed with poly(dI-dC) at a protein:DNA ratio of 30:1, incubated at room temperature for 6 h, and eliminated by high speed centrifugation. Unbound proteins in the supernatant were subjected to binding site oligonucleotide chromatography, which involved two passages through a 3-ml settled bed volume of the mutant IUR-agarose column and an overnight incubation with a 3-ml bed volume of IUR-agarose resin, followed by two passes through the same column. After 5 washes of 3 ml each in a buffer containing 50 mmNaCl, fractions were eluted from the IUR-agarose column by a step gradient of buffers containing 0.2–1.0 m NaCl. In EMSA and Southwestern assays, the 400 mm NaCl fraction consistently tested positive for an activity with a relative molecular size of 115 kDa that specifically bound the 2xIUR probe. SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed selective enrichment of the 115-kDa protein. To further purify the 115-kDa protein, the 400 mm NaCl fraction was pooled, dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and reconstituted in the 1× SDS-PAGE loading dye. The sample was then subjected to continuous-elution SDS-PAGE on a 7% polyacrylamide gel using a model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). Electro-elution was performed at a flow-rate of 0.1 ml/min. Aliquots of electro-eluted fractions were screened by electrophoresis on 4% stacking/10% resolving SDS-PAGE gels, and polypeptides were detected by silver-staining. Fractions that contained the 115-kDa protein were pooled and lyophilized. Reconstituted sample was re-electrophoresed through a 4% stacking/8% resolving SDS-PAGE gel, and the band containing the 115-kDa protein was excised and sent for sequencing. Two different, nearly homogeneous, preparations of the 115-kDa protein were sequenced separately in two different laboratories: by microcapillary reverse phase chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ; Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) in the laboratory of Dr. R. Aebersold at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) and by mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectroscopy at the sequencing facility at the W. M. Keck Foundation (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The IUR element in theCXCL1 promoter plays an important role in the basal and cytokine induced expression of the CXCL1 gene. The IUR contains a TCGAT motif designated here as T1C2G3A4T5. Previously, we showed that a T5 → C point mutation inhibits basal and IL-1-induced CXCL1 promoter activity. To further characterize the IUR element, the effect of multiple replacements in the TCGAT motif on CXCL1 promoter activity was examined. In addition we investigated whether dislocating the IUR relative to the NF-κB site has any effect on transcriptional activity of the CXCL1 promoter. We created reporter gene constructs that either retained the 306-bp CXCL1 promoter in the wild type configuration (WT) or had a 2-, 6-, 12-, or 25-bp insertion between the IUR and NF-κB elements (IN:2, IN:6, IN:12, and IN:25, respectively). Two additional promoter mutants were also constructed, one which reversed the entire 350-bp CXCL1 promoter relative to the luciferase reporter (Rev) and a second, which had a T1C2G3A4T5to A1G2T3A4C5conversion in the IUR element (mIUR). These constructs were then transfected into Hs294T malignant melanoma cells and luciferase activity measured 48 h later. Results in Fig.1 A indicate that transcription from the CXCL1 promoter is inhibited by nearly 90% when the entire promoter is oriented in a direction opposite to the transcription start site (Rev). Furthermore, a 75% inhibition in promoter activity is observed when the T1C2G3A4T5motif in the IUR element is replaced by A1G2T3A4C5(mIUR). A similar inhibition of promoter activity is seen when the IUR and NF-κB elements are separated by insertions (Fig. 1 B). Although promoter activity appears to be unaffected when the IUR and NF-κB elements are separated by a 2-bp insert. However, inserts that dislocate the IUR element from the NF-κB site by 6, 12, and 25 bp strongly inhibit promoter activity in a distance dependent manner. This inhibition, however, is independent of helical phase of the two elements, because introduction of a half (IN:6) or two and a half helical turn (IN:25) has the same effect as a full helical turn (IN:12), ruling out the possibility that the insert-mediated inhibition of CXCL1 promoter activity is due to a change in the helical phase between the two elements. Together, the data suggest that the IUR is a positive cis-acting element and that the transcriptional activity of the CXCL1 promoter is strictly dependent on the distance of the IUR element relative to the NF-κB site. We have previously demonstrated that the IUR element binds a 115-kDa protein in Southwestern blot assays (8Luan J. Shattuck-Brandt R. Haghnegahdar H. Owen J.D. Strieter R. Burdick M. Nirodi C. Beauchamp D. Johnson K.N. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To identify the 115-kDa protein, which binds the IUR, we purified the IUR-specific factor by binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. HeLa nuclear extract proved to be a convenient and abundant source for both proteins. We obtained frozen pellets of HeLa cells from 63-liter suspension cultures from the National Tissue Culture Center. The yield of nuclear extract from a 63-liter suspension culture was about 1.5–2.0 g. The IUR-specific activities were reproducibly purified to near homogeneity in three separate experiments. Making use of the following protocol, nuclear extract from HeLa cells was first challenged with nonspecific competitor DNA and chromatographed through the mutant IUR-agarose column, which contained multimers of the double-stranded mIUR oligonucleotide. The unbound fraction was then chromatographed through an IUR-agarose column, which contained multimers of double-stranded IUR oligonucleotide. Bound fractions from both columns were washed and eluted by a step gradient of NaCl ranging from 50 mm to 1000 mm. Proteins specific to the IUR element emerged in the unbound (flow-through) fraction of the mutant IUR column and eluates from the bound fraction of this column consistently tested negative for IUR specific activity in EMSA (data not shown). Eluates from the IUR-agarose column were assayed for IUR specific activity by EMSA and Southwestern blot analysis. Fig.2 is a representative of three separate experiments. The results from an EMSA (Fig. 2 A) indicate that an IUR specific activity reproducibly eluted in the 400 mm fraction of the IUR-agarose column. This correlated well with results from Southwestern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B), where a 115-kDa protein in the 400 mm fraction bound the 2xIUR element in a sequence-specific manner. Proteins from bound and unbound fractions from the IUR-agarose column were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C) and detected by silver staining. SDS-PAGE analysis consistently showed that the 400 mm fraction of the IUR-agarose column essentially contains five bands with relative molecular sizes of 180, 115, 85, 42, and 29 kDa. Of these, the 115-kDa band was considerably enriched in this fraction.Figure 2Binding site oligonucleotide affinity purification of the 115-kDa IUR-specific protein. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (A), crude HeLa nuclear extract (2 μg) (lane 1) or 200 ng of bound fractions eluting at 0.2 m NaCl (lanes 2–5), 0.4 m NaCl (lanes 7–10), 0.6 m NaCl (lanes 11–14), or 1 m NaCl (lanes 16–18) from the IUR-agarose column, were tested for binding to the 2R probe in EMSA. All samples contained a 250-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide corresponding to the 2mR probe. B, Southwestern blot analysis: Polypeptides in crude HeLa nuclear extract (25 μg) (lanes 1 and 3) or the 0.4m NaCl fraction (100 ng) eluted from the IUR-agarose column were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transblotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to either the 2R (lanes 1 and 2) or the 2mR (lanes 3 and 4) probes. The relative molecular size is indicated on the left. C, silver-stained SDS-PAGE profile of the 0.4 mNaCl fraction.

In skinned fibers, I79N increased myofilamental calcium sensitivity (Miller, T., Szczesna, D., Housmans, P. R., Zhao, J., deFreitas, F., Gomes, A. V., Culbreath, L., McCue, J., Wang, Y., Xu, Y., Kerrick, W. G., and Potter, J. D. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3743–3755). To further study the functional consequences of this mutation, we compared the cardiac performance of transgenic mice expressing either human TnT-I79N or human wild-type TnT. In isolated hearts, cardiac function was different depending on the Ca2+ concentration of the perfusate; systolic function was significantly increased in Tg-I79N hearts at 0.5 and 1 mmol/liter. At higher Ca2+ concentrations, systolic function was not different, but diastolic dysfunction became manifest as increased end-diastolic pressure and time to 90% relaxation.In vivo measurements by echocardiography and Doppler confirmed that base-line systolic function was significantly higher in Tg-I79N mice without evidence for diastolic dysfunction. Inotropic stimulation with isoproterenol resulted only in a modest contractile response but caused significant mortality in Tg-I79N mice. Doppler studies ruled out aortic outflow obstruction and were consistent with increased chamber stiffness. We conclude that in vivo, the increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity due to the I79N mutation enhances base-line contractility but leads to cardiac dysfunction during inotropic stimulation.

Individuals with cardiac TnT mutations appear to have a high incidence of sudden cardiac death at a young age, although heterozygote individuals have either little or no cardiac hypertrophy (1Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J.

Heart. 1999; 82: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At present, there is no clear understanding as to why TnT mutations in particular pose a high risk for sudden death, as opposed to, for example, mutations in the myosin heavy chain, which usually cause a much greater degree of cardiac hypertrophy. Sudden cardiac death of FHC patients is often caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias (6Maron B.J. Shen W.K. Link M.S. Epstein A.E. Almquist A.K. Daubert J.P. Bardy G.H. Favale S. Rea R.F. Boriani G. Estes III, N.A. Spirito P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), but its cause remains unknown for patients with TnT mutations. In fact, the clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been established mostly without knowledge of the genotype and may not apply to patients carrying specific TnT mutations. Given the paucity of clinical information, a transgenic mouse model provides the opportunity to study the functional consequences of a TnT mutation in an in vivo system. To investigate the mechanisms of how a TnT mutation alters cardiac function and lead to sudden cardiac death, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the human cardiac TnT-I79N mutant (Tg-I79N). Similar to humans carrying this mutation, Tg-I79N mice show no cardiac hypertrophy (7Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. deFreitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3743-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We found a large increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the skinned cardiac fibers from Tg-I79N mice compared with fibers from transgenic mice expressing human wild-type TnT (Tg-WT), but maximal developed force was significantly lower in cardiac fibers from Tg-I79N mice (7Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. deFreitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3743-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effect of the I79N mutation on cardiac performance and electrophysiological properties of the whole heart,in vitro and in vivo. We found that the effect of the mutant protein was dependent on the inotropic state of the heart; under base-line conditions, systolic function was higher in Tg-I79N mice, with little effect on diastolic function. However, during inotropic stimulation with high extracellular Ca2+ or with isoproterenol, diastolic function was impaired, both in the isolated heart and in vivo. Based on these results, we conclude that the increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity due to the I79N mutation enhances base-line contractility but leads to cardiac dysfunction during inotropic stimulation. In humans carrying the TnT-I79N mutation, this mechanism may contribute to excess mortality during exercise or in pathophysiological states with high levels of endogenous catecholamines, even in the absence of significant cardiac hypertrophy. All studies were carried out according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. To examine the effect of the I79N mutation on cardiac performance and electrophysiology, we compared 3–4-month-old mice: transgenic mice expressing either human wild-type (Tg-WT, line 3) or mutant cardiac TnT (Tg-I79N, lines 8 and 9) and nontransgenic littermates (non-Tg). The generation and in vitro characterization of this transgenic model has been described (7Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. deFreitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3743-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All three transgenic lines had high expression levels of the transgenic protein, with 70, 52, and 34% replacement of endogenous mouse TnT (line 3, 8, and 9, respectively). Mice were anesthetized with 20 ml/kg 2% tribromoethanol (Avertin) via intraperitoneal injection. After a surgical level of anesthesia was confirmed, a thoracotomy performed, the heart was removed, and the animal was killed by exsanguination. Hearts of four non-Tg, five Tg-WT, and five Tg-I79N mice (line 9) were isolated and perfused in the Langendorff mode as described previously for mouse hearts (8Lim C.C. Liao R. Varma N. Apstein C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2083-H2090PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the chest was opened, the heart was rapidly excised, and the aorta was cannulated. Retrograde perfusion via the aorta was carried out at a constant perfusion pressure of 68 mm Hg at 37 °C. The flow of thebesian veins was drained via a thin polyethylene tube (PE-10) pierced through the apex of the left ventricle. Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm Na-EDTA, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 11 mmglucose was prepared at the time of the experiment. To maintain a constant heart rate, the atrioventricular node was ablated, and the hearts were epicardially paced at 420 min−1via a bipolar Ag-AgCl contact electrode placed on the base of the right ventricle. Hearts were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min before base-line left ventricular pressure recordings were obtained. To examine the effects of different inotropic states, the heart was then perfused with KH buffer containing free [Ca2+] of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm. Free [Ca2+]o was calculated using Fabiato's program (9Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Contractile measurements were obtained at the end of each 5 min at the respective [Ca2+]o. All perfusion buffers were equilibrated with 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 for at least 1 h prior to the experiment, yielding a pH of 7.4. A water-filled balloon custom-made of polyvinylchloride film was inserted through the mitral valve into the left ventricle via an incision in the left atrium as described (8Lim C.C. Liao R. Varma N. Apstein C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2083-H2090PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.0-French microtip transducer (Millar, Inc, Texas) was guided through the polyethylene tube and positioned inside the balloon. The balloon was inflated to adjust the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) at 6–8 mm Hg, and the balloon volume was held constant for the duration of the experiment. The left ventricular pressure was digitized at 1000 samples/s with the use of a commercially available data acquisition system (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Inc.). The fast sampling rate coupled with the use of a pressure catheter with a flat frequency response up to 10 kHz allowed us to do the detailed kinetic analysis of the pressure recordings outlined below. The following indices of cardiac performance were measured off-line using custom built software (National Instruments, Inc.) and averaged from three consecutive beats at base line and at the end of each Ca2+ concentration step: left ventricular systolic pressure, EDP, developed pressure (the difference between systolic pressure and EDP), the minimum and maximum values of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dt and −dP/dt), ratio of +dP/dt and −dP/dt, time to reach peak systolic pressure, time to reach peak +dP/dt, and time from peak systolic pressure to reach 90% relaxation. To determine the time constant of isovolumic pressure decay, the left ventricle (LV) pressure curve was fitted from the time of minimum dP/dt to a level 5 mm Hg above the EDP of the next beat using an monoexponential function as described (8Lim C.C. Liao R. Varma N. Apstein C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2083-H2090PubMed Google Scholar). For the ECG measurements, mice were anesthetized either with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) or with 20 ml/kg of 2% tribromoethanol (Avertin) via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were positioned prone in a shielded box, with all four extremities immersed in 3 m KCl-filled wells to reduce skin resistance. The bottom of the shielded box was heated to 37 °C using a circulating water bath to maintain a stable body temperature during the experiment. To accurately capture the ECG signals from mice, which have the high heart rates (500–600 beats) and a very short QRS duration, a custom-built ECG amplifier (Vibraspec, Bear Island, ME 04662) was used. This amplifier provided a high frequency response and large gain (1000 Hz and 10,000-fold gain) and was used to record bipolar limb leads in standard fashion as described (10Knollmann B.C. Knollmann-Ritschel B.E.C. Weissman N.J. Jones L.R. Morad M. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 483-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Signals were digitized at 1 kHz using a National Instruments, Inc. data acquisition system with custom built software. For each animal, PR and QRS intervals were measured from three consecutive beats in leads I and II and averaged. For QT interval measurements, the recordings were signal-averaged over a 30-s time interval using the peak of the R-wave as the fiduciary point as described (11Mitchell G.F. Jeron A. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H747-H751PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure reduced the effect of respiratory and motion artifacts on QT measurements. The heart rate was measured as the average over the 30-s interval, and the QT interval was measured in the lead with the longest and most prominent T-wave. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious and anesthetized mice using a commercially available, noninvasive computerized tail-cuff system (BP-2000, Visitech, Apex, NC). Mice were anesthetized as for the ECG measurements and positioned supine on a heated surface (37 °C) to maintain a stable body temperature during the experiment. Echocardiography and Doppler measurements were performed with a 1-cm gel standoff in a left lateral position similar to the technique used by Hoit et al. (12Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). An Acuson Sequoia C256 system with a linear transducer in 13-MHz mode was used to obtain high resolution two-dimensional and M-mode measurements (17Tardiff J.C. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Olsson C. Factor S.M. Moore R.L. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional guided M-mode of the LV was performed in short axis at the tip of the mitral leaflets and through the center of the LV cavity. The proper probe position was confirmed by rotating the probe 90° and obtaining two-dimensional guided long axis M-mode measurements in the same animal. Two-dimensional guided Doppler flow measurements of aortic outflow and mitral inflow were obtained. Mitral inflow velocities were recorded only after extensive scanning from multiple vantage points to ensure that the maximal velocity was obtained. In most situations, this was an apical window that corresponds to an “off-axis” apical window (displaced toward the parasternal window). A limb-lead ECG was simultaneously recorded during echocardiography and stored both on computer, for off-line analysis, and on the echocardiogram videotape. The echo images were digitized from videotape and measurements performed using a digital image analysis package (Nova Microsonics/Eastman Kodak Co.). LV end-systolic and end-diastolic internal dimensions (LVESO and LVEDD, respectively) and LV wall thickness were measured for each animal from the M-mode image. Aortic outflow velocity, aortic ejection time, aortic acceleration time to peak outflow, early and late mitral inflow velocity (E-wave and A-wave, respectively), and E-wave deceleration time were measured from the Doppler recordings in standard fashion, and the E to A ratio was calculated. To assess overall left ventricular systolic performance, LV shortening fraction (SF = (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD) and heart rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCFc = (SF)(RR0.5)/ejection time) were calculated. Isoproterenol was given as a bolus intraperitoneal injection after stable base-line ECG and echocardiography recordings had been obtained (5–10 min). Mice were initially challenged with a dose of 1.5 mg/kg (high dose) based on reports in the literature (12Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). After deaths occurred in the Tg-I79N group, we examined the effects of a lower dose (0.1 mg/kg), which was sufficient to produce a significant increase in heart rate in all four groups of mice. All ECG and echocardiographic assessments described above were repeated at 3–5 min after injection, when a significant increase in heart rate was present. A swimming protocol described by Geisterfer-Lowrance et al. (13Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Christe M. Conner D.A. Ingwall J.S. Schoen F.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1996; 272: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) was utilized to examine the effects of chronic aerobic exercise. Groups of four animals, 2 months old, representing the different lines, were exercised by swimming. Mice were adapted to the swimming program by beginning with 10-min sessions two times a day separated by 4 h. These were incremented by 10 min per day until reaching 90 min per session. The program was completed in 4 weeks. During each session, they were monitored for inability to sustain the exercise and/or sudden death. Every mouse that died during the isoproterenol challenge was autopsied to rule out other causes of death such as hemorrhage. This is especially important because drugs were administered via intraperitoneal injection. One death (a non-Tg mouse) was indeed due to a hemorrhage from the right iliac artery close to the injection site. This animal was excluded from further analysis. We did not find any evidence for bleeding in any of the other deaths. Three separate groups of mice (four non-Tg, four Tg-WT, six Tg-I79N line 9) were specifically sacrificed to examine the heart morphology and histology. Two mice of each group had undergone chronic exercise. After euthanasia, each mouse was autopsied with dissection of the heart. The heart was weighed, and any gross abnormalities (chamber enlargement, mural thrombi, etc.) were recorded. The 10% buffered formalin-fixed heart was sectioned along its transverse plane and embedded in paraffin. Microscopic sections were cut from the transected surface at 4–6 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for overall morphology and Mason's trichrome for collagen. The histologic slides were examined for the presence of asymmetric hypertrophy, fibrosis, or myocyte disarray without knowledge of genotype, degree of exercise training, or in vivo test results. Force generation in Tg-WT and Tg-I79N myocardium was simulated by computer based on a modification of the model of Robertson et al. (14Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 559-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and a two-state cross-bridge model (15Mikane T. Araki J. Kohno K. Nakayama Y. Suzuki S. Shimizu J. Matsubara H.

All experiments (left ventricular pressure, ECG, and echocardiography) were done in random sequence in respect to the genotype, and measurements were taken by a single observer who was blinded to the genotype. Differences between groups were assessed using a one-way analysis of variance. If statistically significant differences were found, individual groups were compared with Student's two-sided t test without correction for multiple comparisons. Incidence rates were compared using the χ2 test statistic. Results were considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Unless otherwise indicated, results are expressed as means and S.E. To examine the functional consequences of the I79N mutation in the whole heart, we measured indices of cardiac performance in the isolated perfused, isovolumically contracting heart. This experimental preparation permits exact control of the loading conditions and has been used to examine both systolic and diastolic function in other murine models (8Lim C.C. Liao R. Varma N.

Diastolic function was assessed from the maximum rate of pressure decay (−dP/dt) and from time to 90% relaxation and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation. When hearts were paced at 420 min−1 and end-diastolic pressure was set at 6–8 mm Hg, systolic performance was not statistically different between Tg-I79N, Tg-WT, and non-Tg hearts (TableI). However, the initial rise of pressure was faster in Tg-I79N hearts (Fig. 1,arrow). Thus, time to maximum +dP/dtwas significantly shorter in the Tg-I79N hearts (Table I). On the other hand, time to 90% relaxation and the relaxation time constant were significantly longer in the Tg-I79N hearts compared with both Tg-WT and non-Tg hearts (Table I). The pressure tracings of Fig. 1 illustrate the slower relaxation of the Tg-I79N hearts. The ratio of +dP/dt to −dP/dt, which can be used to assess diastolic function relative to systolic function (20Apstein C.S. Deckelbaum L. Hagopian L. Hood Jr., W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: H637-H648PubMed Google Scholar), was significantly increased in Tg-I79N mice (Table I). Furthermore, the LV balloon volume at an end-diastolic pressure of 8 mm Hg was lower in Tg-I79N mice (Tg-I79N: 13.0 ± 0.3 μl; Tg-WT: 15.1 ± 0.8 μl, p < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that Tg-I79N hearts had significantly impaired diastolic function.Table IBase-line contractile parameters of isovolumetrically contracting mouse hearts (mean ± S.E.)Non-Tg (n = 4)Tg-WT (n = 5)Tg-I79N (line 9) (n = 5)End-diastolic pressure(mm Hg)8.4 ± 0.57.6 ± 0.57.7 ± 0.3Systolic pressure (mm Hg)76 ± 6.770 ± 5.771 ± 6.1Developed pressure(mm Hg)68 ± 6.362 ± 5.363 ± 6.0Peak +dP/dt(mm Hg/s)3517 ± 2922973 ± 2223140 ± 302Time to peak pressure (ms)39 ± 0.540 ± 1.340 ± 0.3Time to peak +dP/dt(ms)12.5 ± 0.412.4 ± 0.210.6 ± 0.3**Peak −dP/dt(mm Hg/s)2587 ± 3052163 ± 1931867 ± 212Ratio (+dP/dtto −dP/dt)1.38 ± 0.081.39 ± 0.061.69 ± 0.07*Time to 90% relaxation (ms)38 ± 1.041 ± 0.449 ± 1.5***Tau (ms)15 ± 0.816 ± 0.821 ± 0.4****, p < 0.05;**, p < 0.01;***, p < 0.001, Tg-I79N versusnon-Tg or Tg-WT; one-way analysis of variance followed by unpaired Student's t test.

Force traces were simulated as would be observed during isometric twitch contractions of Tg-WT and Tg-I79N ventricular myocardium using variables (off-rate of Ca2+ from troponin C and cross-bridge dissociation constant) derived previously (7Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. deFreitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3743-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transgenic I79N myocardium relaxed more slowly than Tg-WT, which is consistent with the experimental observations in isovolumically beating heart. We also examined the changes in cardiac performance in response to changes in [Ca2+]o (Fig. 2). At [Ca2+]o of 0.5 and 1 mm, developed pressure was significantly higher in Tg-I79N than in Tg-WT hearts (Fig.2 A). At higher [Ca2+]o, however, developed pressure was not significantly different between the two groups. Thus, there was a leftward shift of the [Ca2+]o-pressure relationship in Tg-I79N hearts. Indices of diastolic function demonstrated a different [Ca2+]o dependence; at [Ca2+]o of 0.5 and 1 mm, EDP was significantly lower in I79N hearts (Fig. 2 B), while time to 90% relaxation was not significantly different from Tg-WT (Fig.2 C). At higher [Ca2+]o, EDP was significantly higher (Fig. 2 B), and time to 90% relaxation was significantly longer in I79N hearts than in Tg-WT hearts (Fig.2 C). Therefore, I79N hearts demonstrate increased systolic performance at low [Ca2+]o but performance comparable with that of Tg-WT at a [Ca2+]oof 2 mm or above. On the other hand, diastolic function is comparable with that of Tg-WT at low [Ca2+]o but significantly impaired at high [Ca2+]o. Echocardiography and Doppler measurements have been used extensively to characterize the cardiac phenotype of transgenic mouse models (21Christensen G. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2513-H2524PubMed Google Scholar). We measured cardiac dimensions, indices of systolic function, and diastolic ventricular filling by two-dimensional guided M-mode (Fig.3 A) and Doppler (Fig. 3 B). TableII summarizes the results. Indices of systolic contractile function (LV shortening fraction and VCFc) were significantly higher in both Tg-I79N lines compared with Tg-WT. Evidence for increased contractility was also present on flow measurements by Doppler. Tg-I79N mice had a significantly shorter time to peak outflow velocity (Fig. 3 B). Base-line diastolic filling parameters measured by Doppler (E-wave, A-wave, E-wave deceleration time, E/A ratio) were not statistically different between all four lines. Thus, unlike the isolated perfused heart, systolic function was increased in Tg-I79N mice, but diastolic function appeared to be normal. One reason for this apparent discrepancy may be related to the slow heart rates (∼250 min−1) induced by the ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. We therefore repeated the echocardiography and Doppler measurements using a different anesthetic, Avertin, which produces much less bradycardia. Since there were no large differences in the cardiac parameters between Tg-I79N lines 8 and 9, we compared Tg-I79N line 9 with Tg-WT mice and non-Tg mice. Heart rates indeed increased to a similar extent in all groups (Table II). Systolic function was significantly different between all three groups (LV shortening fraction: Tg-I79N 43 ± 1.2%, Tg-WT 27 ± 1.2%, non-Tg 33 ± 1.2%, p < 0.00001 by analysis of variance). Interestingly, at these faster heart rates, the end-diastolic dimension was significantly smaller in Tg-I79N mice (3.2 ± 0.1 mm, p < 0.0001 against both WT and non-Tg) than in Tg-WT mice (3.8 ± 0.1 mm) or in non-Tg mice (3.6 ± 0.2 mm). Nevertheless, Doppler indices of diastolic filling were not significantly different. Unfortunately, the A-wave could only be measured in less than 30% of the examined animals.Table IIEchocardiography and Doppler measurements under Avertin and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (mean ± S.E.)Base-line (ketamine/xylazine)Baseline (Avertin)Isoproterenol (ketamine/xylazine)Non-Tg (n = 7)Tg-WT (n = 11)Tg-I79N (line 9) (n = 7)Tg-I79N (line 8) (n = 6)Non-Tg (n = 34)Tg-WT (n = 26)Tg-I79N (line 9) (n = 37)Non-Tg (n = 7)Tg-WT (n = 12)Tg-I79N (line 9) (n = 7)Tg-I79N (line 8) (n = 6)HR (beats/min)223 ± 23233 ± 15206 ± 25275 ± 1464 ± 9451 ± 10442 ± 10474 ± 39480 ± 26481 ± 40494 ± 26Septum (mm)0.7 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.030.7 ± 0.050.65 ± 0.020.69 ± 0.020.61 ± 0.01**0.8 ± 0.050.7 ± 0.040.7 ± 0.030.6 ± 0.06LVEDD (mm)3.6 ± 0.1*4.2 ± 0.24.0 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.1**3.6 ± 0.073.8 ± 0.093.2 ± 0.07**3.0 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.1LVESD (mm)2.1 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.2*2.4 ± 0.08*2.8 ± 0.101.9 ± 0.07**1.2 ± 0.071.2 ± .11.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.2LVPW (mm)0.8 ± 0.040.7 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.010.63 ± 0.010.61 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.060.8 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.030.7 ± 0.03LVSF (%)41 ± 535 ± 348 ± 4**47 ± 5*33 ± 1**27 ± 143 ± 2**59 ± 462 ± 357 ± 355 ± 6VCFc (circ/s)3.0 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.4**3.0 ± 0.2*1.5 ± 0.1*1.1 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.1**4.3 ± 0.44.1 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.5LVOT (cm/s)60 ± 463 ± 274 ± 5*50 ± 5*60 ± 2**51 ± 260 ± 2**95 ± 498 ± 595 ± 571 ± 5**ET (ms)75 ± 678 ± 277 ± 673 ± 467 ± 171 ± 272 ± 151 ± 356 ± 258 ± 256 ± 1AT (ms)17 ±"

Recently we have demonstrated that Ku70 interacted with TRF2, a mammalian telomere-binding protein. Using the same yeast two-hybrid screening system, we now show that Ku70 also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), a protein known to be associated with telomeres as well as heterochromatin. HP1 is a suppressor of the position effect variegation inDrosophila and acts as a transcriptional suppressor in mammalian cells. The interaction with Ku70 in the two-hybrid system was confirmed by a glutathione S-transferase pull-down study using bacterial recombinant proteins in vitro. The interaction was also reproduced in vivo in HeLa cells, where endogenous Ku70 coimmunoprecipitated with HP1α. This interaction was more effective in acidic pH and weakened considerably as the pH of the reaction buffer was elevated up to 7.5. Ku80 did not interact with HP1α directly. The interaction domains of Ku70 and HP1α included the Leu-Ser repeat (amino acids 200–385) and the chromo shadow domain, respectively. Ku70 was largely colocalized with transfected HP1α but not with a C-terminal deletion mutant, HP1αΔC. In contrast to HP1α, Ku70 did not repress transcriptional activity of the reporter gene when tethered to DNA after transfection to mammalian cells. The implication of this interaction is discussed.

Mutations in either Ku subunit led to enhanced instability of telomeres by increasing their sensitivity to either degradation or recombination reactions (14Polotnianka R.M. Li J. Lustig A.J. Curr.

Ku is a relatively abundant protein and is present much more than the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit in the nuclei (5Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M.

Molecular Analysis of DNA Rearrangements in the Immune System. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1996: 91-112Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that Ku was present in the nuclear matrix as well as in the soluble fractions of human nucleus (19Yu E. Song K. Moon H. Maul G.G. Lee I. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the nuclear matrix, Ku70 appeared to be present in a greater amount than Ku80 (19Yu E. Song K. Moon H. Maul G.G. Lee I. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared that Ku70 might bind other proteins to perform diverse biological functions at least in certain cellular compartments. Such a possibility prompted us to look for additional interacting proteins of Ku70. A number of attempts have been made to identify proteins that interact with Ku70 using the yeast two-hybrid system. Human Ku70 was identified to be an interacting protein of GCN5/CBP/TAFII250 acetyltransferase (20Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell.

To avoid such a problem, we screened a HeLa cell library using a partial Ku70 cDNA bait, which did not overlap significantly with the proposed binding sites to Ku80 (23Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell.

It is of interest that the yeast Ku70 homologue Hdf1 has been shown to interact with a telomere-binding protein, Sir4, which is also a suppressor of the telomere position effect, in S. cerevisiae (33Tsukamoto Y.

A region corresponding to the amino acid residues 200–385 (186 aa) of Ku70 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LexA-Ku70/186) and used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. For control baits, LexA-Ku70/139, LexA-Ku80/185, LexA-DDX3, and LexA-thyroid receptor were generated. LexA-Ku70/139 contained residues 471–609 (139 aa) of Ku70 (35Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LexA-Ku80/185 contained the N-terminal 185 amino acid residues of Ku80 (36Yaneva M. Wen J. Ayala A. Cook R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13407-13411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LexA-DDX3 contained the full-length human DDX3 (37Park S.H. Lee S.G. Kim Y. Song K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 81: 178-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LexA-thyroid receptor was described previously (38Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and fused to the LexA DNA binding domain in pEG202. Plasmids were constructed similarly for the bait-prey interchange experiments. To further delineate the interaction domains of Ku70, two truncated versions of the original bait, LexA-Ku70/44 and LexA-Ku70/119, were constructed. LexA-ku70/44 included amino acid residues 200–243 (44 aa), which represented the Leu-Ser repeat (35Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LexA-Ku70/119 included amino acid residues 267–385 (119 aa), which corresponded to the flanking anionic domain. To delineate interacting domains of the selected HP1α/E11, three truncated versions of HP1α were cloned into the prey vector pJG4-5: HP1α/N (containing aa 1–58), HP1α/M (57), and HP1α/C (111). Deletion mutants were created by using convenient restriction sites and/or by PCR with appropriate primer pair combinations and verified by sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into EGY48-expressing LexA-Ku70/186 and/or LexA-Ku70/119 hybrid proteins. The baits were introduced into yeast S. cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATa, his3, trp1, ura3-52, leu2::pLeu2LexAop6/pSH18-34 (LexAop-lacZ reporter)) by a modified lithium acetate method. The transformants were selected on the yeast synthetic media (Ura− and His−) with 2% glucose and used as a host for transformation with HeLa cDNA library as described previously (38Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were cloned in pJG4-5 usingEcoRI and XhoI to generate B42 fusion proteins, and the expression of the fusion protein was designed to be induced by the presence of galactose. The cDNA was introduced into the competent yeast cells, and transformants were selected for tryptophan prototrophy (plasmid marker) on the synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, and Trp−) containing 2% glucose. All transformants were pooled and respread on the synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, and Leu−) containing 2% galactose to induce the introduced cDNA. Cells growing on the selection media were retested on the synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, and Leu−) containing 2% galactose (inducing condition) and 2% glucose (noninducing condition) to confirm the dependence of their growth on the presence of galactose. Cells growing only on the galactose media were selected and streaked on the synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, and Trp−) containing 2% galactose or 2% glucose with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside to test the β-galactosidase activity. The cells expressing both reporter genes only in the presence of galactose were finally chosen to isolate the plasmids. After identification of the interaction between Ku70 and library members, the reciprocal experiments between the bait and prey vectors were carried out. Three in-frame fusions of Ku70 were constructed with the pET28 vector (Novagen) as N-terminal (His)6-tagged proteins for bacterial expression. In-frame fusion of the LexA-Ku70/186 bait was constructed by cloning the EcoRI fragment of 575 bp from pEG202/Ku70/186 into the EcoRI site of pET28a. After transformation to E. coli strain DE3, the recombinant protein turned out to be insoluble. In-frame fusion of full-length Ku70 was constructed by ligating first the BamHI-HindIII fragment of 1476 bp from pET28a/Ku70/1–482 and then the HindIII-XhoI fragment of 468 bp from pET28a/Ku70/176–609, followed by cloning into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pET28a. When the recombinant full-length Ku70 was expressed in bacteria, its N terminus was cleaved. Thus, it was necessary to cleave off the N-terminal part of Ku70. To construct a plasmid expressing the N-terminal deleted Ku70 gene product, Ku70ΔN, pET28a/Ku70/200–609, a fragment of 1234 bp encompassing amino acids 200–609, was obtained by PCR using a sense primer (5′-CCTTGACTTGATGCACCTGA-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TCAGTCCTGGAAGTGCTTGG-3′). The PCR product was first cloned into a vector, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and then a 1250-bp EcoRI fragment from pCR2.1-Ku70/410 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pET28a. The Ku70ΔN fusion protein, which had amino acid residues 200–609 and 38 additional amino acids, was partly soluble. The fusion proteins were purified using a His-bind resin column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). In-frame fusions of full-length HP1α (aa 1–191), HP1αΔN (aa 111–191), and HP1αΔC (aa 1–137) were similarly cloned in pET28 as well as pGEX-4T-1 vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST tagging. To construct a plasmid expressing intact HP1α, a full-length cDNA was generated by EcoRI and XhoI liberation from the library prey vector E11, followed by cloning into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pET28 as well as pGEX-4T-1 vectors. HP1αΔN and HP1αΔC were constructed by a similar procedure, but the inserts were obtained by PCR with a full-length cDNA clone, E11, using appropriate primer combinations. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI followed by cloning into pET28 and pGEX-4T-1 vector that had been predigested with the same enzymes. GST-HP1α, GST-HP1αΔN, and GST-HP1αΔC fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For a negative control, GST without fusion was expressed and purified similarly. GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads using the elution buffer (10 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To 10 μg of GST-HP1α and comparable amounts of other GST fusion proteins, equimolar purified His-tagged Ku70ΔN was added in the reaction buffer (10 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 83 mm KCl, 17 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 3 m urea. After 1 h incubation, the mixtures were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the reaction buffer without urea. Then glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added and incubated for 4 h. Beads were washed five times in the reaction buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal anti-T7.tag antibody (Novagen), followed by goat anti-mouse second antibody (Sigma), and visualized using a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To figure out the influence of pH on the interaction, GST pull-down experiments were repeated in the reaction buffer at pH 6.2, 6.5, 6.8, 7.2, and 7.5, respectively. For whole-cell extracts, 5 × 105 HeLa cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged for 2 min in an Eppendorf microfuge at 4000 ×g. The cells were resuspended in 200 μl of reaction buffer and Dounced on ice thoroughly. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HP1α antibody. The affinity-purified anti-HP1α antibody was obtained from antisera of a rabbit, which was immunized using the purified HP1α-GST fusion protein as described previously (19Yu E. Song K. Moon H. Maul G.G. Lee I. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For a negative control, nonimmune rabbit serum was used at the same concentration. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times in PBS, resolved in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation of Ku proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku80 antibodies, respectively (19Yu E. Song K. Moon H. Maul G.G. Lee I. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were visualized using a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reaction and/or the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL detection system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The HP1α and HP1αΔC cDNAs with T7.tag were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), a mammalian expression plasmid that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. COS cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/30-mm dish using lipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected COS cells were grown on coverslips. At 48 h after transfection, coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min. Then primary antibodies were incubated with cells for 2 h at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HP1α and monoclonal anti-Ku70 antibodies were described above. Mouse polyclonal anti-HP1α antibody was a generous gift from Dr. William C. Earnshaw (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom). Monoclonal anti-T7.tag antibody (Novagen) and goat anti-Ku70 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased. For double immunofluorescence microscopy, proper combinations of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were applied simultaneously. After washing with PBS, Texas red-labeled anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-goat secondary antibodies (Sigma) were applied for 1 h. After washing with PBS three times, DNA staining was done with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml PBS) for 15 s (Sigma). Cells were viewed in a confocal laser microscope (Zeiss LSM510). As controls, cells were stained with primary or secondary antibody alone. Control slides did not display significant fluorescence in any case pM1 and pM1-HP1α effector plasmids and G5-SV40-CAT reporter plasmid were generous gifts from Dr. Nobert Lehming (Max Delbruck Laboratorium, Cologne, Germany). The GAL4 (1) fusion was made using pM1, a mammalian expression vector containing the DNA binding domain of GAL4 under the control of the early SV40 enhancer (39Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). pM1/Ku70 was constructed by cloning the full-length Ku70 obtained by PCR into the BamHI-linearized and blunted pM1. pM1/Ku70ΔN (aa 200–609) was similarly constructed using the PCR primers as described above. The pG5-SV40-CAT reporter had five GAL4 sites fused to the SV40 promoter upstream of the CAT reporter gene (40Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 41Lehming N. Le S.A. Schueller J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One μg of plasmids was transfected to HeLa cells, 3 × 105/30-mm dish, with proper combinations of pM1-HP1α, pM1-Ku70, or pM1 effector plasmid DNA and pG5-SV40-CAT reporter plasmid using lipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were analyzed for CAT activity using assay kits from Promega. CAT reporter activity was normalized for transfection efficiency to an internal β-galactosidase control and expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained with the vector alone. Every construct was tested in four different transfection experiments. cDNA corresponding to the amino acid residues 200–385 (186 aa) of Ku70 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LexA-Ku70/186) and used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. This region included the periodic repeat of leucine and serine (aa 215–243) in every seventh position and an anionic domain (35Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was chosen as bait because (i) it does not overlap significantly with the published Ku80 binding sites, and (ii) it contains a domain that is reminiscent of a leucine zipper (42Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) and therefore likely to interact with other molecules. Using the LexA-Ku70/186 bait, a HeLa cell cDNA library was screened as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The bait did not have any intrinsic activity of transcriptional activation for the reporters. Approximately 3 × 105 independent transformants were pooled and respread on the selection media (Ura−, His−, Trp−, and Leu−) containing 2% galactose to induce the expression of cDNAs. In the selection media, a total of 72 colonies showed galactose dependence. The plasmids were extracted by yeast miniprep, and the cDNAs were PCR-amplified with primers derived from the vector pJG4–5, followed by sequence determination. DNA sequencing and data base searches revealed that the nucleotide sequence of nine clones encoded human HP1α (32Fanti L. Giovinazzo G. Berloco M. Pimpinelli S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 527-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although 8 clones encoded the full-length HP1α, one contained a 5′-truncated cDNA encoding amino acids 32–191 of HP1α. Thus, the binding site to Ku70 did not appear to involve the N terminus. To confirm the specificity of the interaction, three additional baits containing similar leucine zipper-like domains were tested as well; they included LexA-Ku70/139, LexA-Ku80/185, and LexA-DDX3/260 (Fig.1). LexA-Ku70/139 encompassed amino acid residues 471–609 of Ku70, which included the second leucine zipper-like domain. LexA-Ku80/185 and LexA-DDX3/260 included the leucine zipper-like domains of Ku80 and the putative RNA helicase DDX3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, HP1α did not interact with any one of the control baits, indicating that the association of Ku70/HP1α was not mediated by nonspecific interaction of the leucine zipper-like α-helix domains To map the interaction domains of the Ku70 with HP1α, we did a deletion analysis of Ku70 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The truncated LexA-Ku70/44 (aa 200–243), which corresponded to the Leu-Ser repeat, could not be used because it showed intrinsic transcriptional activity. The second deletion, LexA-Ku70/119 (aa 267–385), completely abolished the interaction with HP1α (Fig. 1). Therefore, the Leu-Ser repeat appeared to be essential for the interaction with HP1α. The results were confirmed by reciprocal yeast-two hybrid experiments. To delineate the Ku70-interacting domain of HP1α, three deletion derivatives of HP1α were generated: HP1α/N (containing aa 1–58), HP1α/H (aa 57–137), and HP1α/C (aa 111–191), representing the chromo domain (43Paro R. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), “hinge” region (44Ainsztein A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Mackay A.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and chromo shadow domain (45Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) of HP1α, respectively. Mutant forms of HP1α were tested for their ability to bind to the LexA-Ku70/186 bait by yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1, HP1α/C was solely responsible for the interaction with Ku70. Thus, it appeared that the chromo shadow domain, which spanned amino acid residues 123–175, was the Ku70 binding site of HP1α. To validate the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction between recombinant Ku70 and HP1α proteins was studied in vitro. For the GST pull-down experiments, GST-HP1α, GST-HP1αΔN, and GST-HP1αΔC fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. As a binding partner, recombinant His-tagged Ku70ΔN was expressed and purified on His binding resin (see “Experimental Procedures”). To increase the solubility of recombinant His-tagged Ku70ΔN, 3 m urea was added to the reaction buffer. After the incubation, the mixtures were dialyzed in the reaction buffer without urea at 4 °C overnight and were pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Ku70ΔN was pulled down by the interaction with GST-HP1α and GST-HP1αΔN fusion proteins, whereas no interaction was noted with GST-HP1αΔC or GST alone. The result coincided with the yeast two-hybrid data indicating that the binding site of HP1α to Ku70 was at the C-terminal part. HP1α is an acidic protein the exp"

Moreover, human pol η lacks an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and its base substitution error rates when copying undamaged DNA are much higher than are those of most other eukaryotic polymerases, whether they have proofreading activity or not (9Matsuda T.

Current models suggest that pol η competes with other replicative polymerases for 3′-OH termini at a replication fork (reviewed in Refs.13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12224-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Friedberg E.C.

Given the intrinsically low fidelity of pol η, mechanisms may exist to prevent errors by pol η from reducing the accuracy of chromosomal replication. We previously suggested (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) two obvious error correction mechanisms, exonucleolytic proofreading of pol η mistakes by a separate exonuclease(s) and post-replication DNA repair of mismatches generated by pol η. To test the proofreading hypothesis, here we examine the effects of pol η on the accuracy of replication of double-stranded DNA catalyzed by the replication apparatus in extracts of human cells. For this we used the SV40 replication system, whose protein requirements are similar to those of human chromosomal replication (16Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We first establish replication conditions under which pol η reduces replication fidelity, suggesting that pol η can indeed compete with other polymerases during semiconservative DNA replication. We then demonstrate that pol η has two intrinsic biochemical properties, low processivity and slow mismatch extension, that could allow a separate exonuclease to compete for mismatched primer termini at the replication fork. Finally, we demonstrate that pol η-induced replication infidelity depends on the dNTP concentration and is increased in the presence of a deoxynucleoside monophosphate, both classical hallmarks of exonucleolytic proofreading.

Previous studies indicated that the fidelity of replication of undamaged M13mp2 DNA by extracts of human TK6 or HeLa cells is high (17Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, inclusion of human pol η in a replication reaction reduced fidelity, as indicated by the concentration-dependent increase in the frequency oflacZ mutants among the M13mp2 products of semiconservative replication (Table I, Experiment 1). No increase in mutant frequency was observed when excess human pol β was included or when pol η was incubated with the extract in the absence of the SV40 large T-antigen that is required for replication from the SV40 origin. In fact the mutant frequencies under both reaction conditions were within the range of frequencies (3–7 × 10−4) for control DNA that had not been replicated in the extract. DNA sequence analysis of 28 independent lacZ mutants from the reaction containing 100 nm pol η revealed the presence of 17 single-base substitutions, 11 of which were consistent with incorporation of dGTP opposite T. One clone had a tandem double-base substitution and seven contained a single nucleotide deletion. This error specificity is remarkably similar to that of pol η during gap-filling synthesis (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A 14-nucleotide insertion was also recovered and three of the lacZ mutants contained two widely separated sequence changes, circumstances not encountered in previous studies of replication fidelity. Single base substitution and frameshift error rates calculated from these data are higher than for replication in the absence of added pol η (TableII, Experiment 1). Overall, these data suggest that pol η is capable of competing with other DNA polymerases at the replication fork and generates both base substitution and frameshift mutations.Table IISpecificity of replication errors induced by human pol ηType of errorExtract only error rateExtract + 50 nm pol ηIncrease in error rateMutantsError rateExperiment 1: Equimolar 100 μm dNTP, 100 nm pol η All 12 base substitutions≤6.7 × 10−6 2-aFrom Ref. 17.1733 × 10−6≥5 T•dGTP≤3.4 × 10−6 2-bFrom Ref. 21.11100 × 10−6≥29 Single base deletion≤1.0 × 10−6 2-bFrom Ref. 21.716 × 10−6≥16Experiment 2: Excess dGTP, 50 nm pol η T•dGTP on lagging12 × 10−6 2-cThese results are for a 100-fold excess of dGTP, needed to obtain a mutant frequency above the control value (taken from Ref. 19).21340 × 10−628 T•dGTP on leading3.3 × 10−6 2-cThese results are for a 100-fold excess of dGTP, needed to obtain a mutant frequency above the control value (taken from Ref. 19).9220 × 10−666Error rates were calculated as described (17Roberts J.D.

We previously suggested that the mutagenic potential of pol η in human cells might be reduced if pol η-dependent errors were proofread (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Several experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. First, primer extension reactions were performed using thelacZ template and a 1000-fold molar excess of template-primer over enzyme, a condition that results in a single cycle of processive synthesis. Analysis of reaction products (Fig.1) demonstrated that pol η polymerizes one to ten nucleotides per cycle of enzyme binding dissociation and that the probability of termination of processive synthesis after each incorporation varies between about 40 and 70%. This result quantitatively confirms the earlier observation (8Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that human pol η has low processivity, a property that could provide an exonuclease access to a template-primer containing a mismatch. All DNA polymerases studied to date extend mismatched template-primers less efficiently than matched termini. To determine whether this is also the case with human pol η, we performed extension reactions to obtain steady-state kinetic constants from which extension efficiencies for matched and mismatched termini were calculated. The results (TableIII) indicate that pol η extended mismatched termini less efficiently than matched termini by factors of from 3-fold (T•G mismatch) to more than 100-fold (G•A mismatch). These data are consistent with the recent qualitative demonstration that human pol η extends mismatched termini less efficiently than matched termini with undamaged DNA and at sites of DNA damage (8Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with a recent report that yeast pol η also extends mismatched termini less efficiently than matched termini (22Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). For polymerases having intrinsic proofreading exonucleases, slow polymerization increases the opportunity for movement of the primer terminus to an exonuclease active site for excision of a misinserted nucleotide (recently reviewed in Ref. 23Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). While pol η lacks an intrinsic proofreading activity (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), it is possible that editing could be performed by a separate exonuclease that is physically associated with the replication machinery, as is the case in E. coli. To determine whether replication errors induced by exonuclease-deficient pol η could be edited by an extrinsic exonuclease, replication fidelity was examined in a human extract under conditions known to modulate proofreading activity. One hallmark of proofreading is the “next nucleotide effect” (reviewed in Ref. 24Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since the probability of polymerization from a mismatch (or a misalignment) depends on the concentration of the next correct nucleotides to be incorporated, at high dNTP concentrations polymerization is favored over editing, and fidelity is reduced. This approach has already been used successfully to detect proofreading of base substitution (18Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3465-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Izuta S. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2595-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and frameshift errors (19Izuta S. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2595-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Roberts J.D. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) produced by the human replication complex. However, in reactions containing equimolar dNTPs, a next nucleotide effect is difficult to detect with the M13mp2 forward mutation assay, because replication fidelity is very high (17Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, replication in an extract to which excess pol η was not added generated products with lacZ mutant frequencies that were similar to unreplicated DNA control values (TableI, Experiment 2). In contrast, when replication reactions were performed in the presence of pol η, fidelity decreased as the dNTP concentration was increased from 10 to 1000 μm (Table I, Experiment 2). The fact that the fidelity was higher in reactions lacking exogenous pol η indicates that the majority of errors being proofread were dependent on pol η. A second hallmark of proofreading activity is reduced replication fidelity in the presence of a high concentration of dNMP (18Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3465-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Izuta S. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2595-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar), the product of proofreading exonucleases. In the present study, inclusion of 2 mm dGMP in a replication reaction containing 100 μm dNTPs and to which pol η had been added (Table I, Experiment 3) also reduced replication fidelity (lacZ mutant frequency of 45 × 10−4 compared with 20 × 10−4 for the equivalent reaction without dGMP). Again, the lower fidelity was dependent on pol η. Both results imply that pol η-induced replication errors can be proofread. We also examined whether pol η competes for primer termini on the leading strand, the lagging strand, or both. Here we employed a strategy used previously (19Izuta S. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2595-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), in which excess dGTP is included in a replication reaction to monitor misincorporation of dGTP during lagging strand replication of the M13mp2 viral (+) strand or during leading strand replication of the complementary (−) strand. A reaction containing 50 nm pol η and a 50-fold molar excess of dGTP generated replication products whose lacZ mutant frequency was strongly elevated relative to control values (Table I, Experiment 4). Sequence analysis of 29 independent lacZ mutants recovered from this reaction revealed 33 single base substitutions, 31 of which reflected misincorporation of dGMP. Thirty were due to misincorporation opposite template T, the most frequent error generated by pol η during gap-filling DNA synthesis (9Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Of these, nine were consistent with pol η misincorporation during replication of the leading strand and 21 reflected pol η misincorporation during replication of the lagging strand (Table II). The error rates calculated from these data are much higher than those observed for replication with excess dGTP in the absence of excess pol η (TableII). Notably, seven independent lacZ mutants contained the same T to C substitution at template nucleotide 121. At this site, misinsertion of dGTP opposite this T is followed by correct incorporation of dGTP, which was present at 1000 μm. Thus, this hot spot may reflect misinsertion by pol η followed by suppression of proofreading due to the high dGTP concentration. Overall, these data imply that pol η competes with the enzymatic machinery that replicates both the leading and lagging strands. At first glance, the idea that pol η is intrinsically inaccurate seems paradoxical in light of its role in suppressing UV-induced mutagenesis (3Maher V.M. Ouellette L.M. Curren R.D. McCormick J.J. Nature. 1976; 261: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Myhr B.C. Turnbull D. DiPaolo J.A. Mutat. Res. 1979; 62: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y.C.

Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 2Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In fact, we believe that the properties of pol η are ideally suited for this critical role. We have suggested that the intrinsically low fidelity of pol η is a reflection of relaxed selectivity that facilitates highly efficient bypass of UV photoproducts that block other replicative polymerases. This implies that the low fidelity observed in vitro is not simply due to the lack of an accessory protein that might enhance pol η selectivity in vivo. We further suggest that a high probability of termination of processive synthesis (Fig. 1) and slow extension of mismatches (TableIII) facilitates proofreading (Table I). Proofreading could be performed by exonucleases intrinsic to replicative DNA polymerases δ and ε or by a separate exonuclease (26Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19655-19660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the former case, the exonuclease active site of pol δ or pol ε could directly bind the mismatch for immediate removal, as seen with the replicative T7 DNA polymerase (28Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Even if pol η extends a mismatch for a few nucleotides (note that discrimination for extension of a T•G mismatch in Table III is only 3-fold), pol δ or ε may still be able to edit a mismatch. This is suggested by studies (reviewed in Ref. 23Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) showing that some polymerases contact the DNA for five base pairs upstream of the polymerase active site, such that the presence of an embedded mismatch could still promote excision over polymerization. It is also possible that errors that escape proofreading could be corrected by mismatch repair (29Wang H. Lawrence C.W. Li G.M. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16894-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Liu H. Hewitt S.R. Hays J.B. Genetics. 2000; 154: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar), thereby further contributing to the fidelity of the overall bypass process. Finally, our data indicating that pol η can compete for 3′-OH termini during replication by leading and lagging strand replication proteins suggest that genome instability could result from conditions that promote this competition, such as a change in the ratio of pol η relative to other polymerases. This could result from overexpression of pol η, from a reduction in polymerization efficiency due to mutations, or from reduced expression of other polymerases. As one example of the latter, decreased cellular levels of pol δ have recently been shown (31Kokoska R.J. Stefanovic L. DeMai J. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2065831230,"Mammalian receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have over 85% sequence homology and similar ligand selectivity. Biological studies indicated that the chicken GnRH receptor has a distinct pharmacology, and certain antagonists of mammalian GnRH receptors function as agonists. To explore the structural determinants of this, we have cloned a chicken pituitary GnRH receptor and demonstrated that it has marked differences in primary amino acid sequence (59% homology) and in its interactions with GnRH analogs. The chicken GnRH receptor had high affinity for mammalian GnRH (K i 4.1 ± 1.2 nm) , similar to the human receptor (K i 4.8 ± 1.2 nm). But, in contrast to the human receptor, it also had high affinity for chicken GnRH ([Gln8]GnRH) and GnRH II ([His5,Trp7,Tyr8]GnRH) (K i 5.3 ± 0.5 and 0.6 ± 0.01 nm). Three mammalian receptor antagonists were also pure antagonists in the chicken GnRH receptor. Another three, characterized by d-Lys6 ord-isopropyl-Lys6 moieties, functioned as pure antagonists in the human receptor but were full or partial agonists in the chicken receptor. This suggests that the Lys side chain interacts with functional groups of the chicken GnRH receptor to stabilize it in the active conformation and that these groups are not available in the activated human GnRH receptor. Substitution of the human receptor extracellular loop two with the chicken extracellular loop two identified this domain as capable of conferring agonist activity to mammalian antagonists. Although functioning of antagonists as agonists has been shown to be species-dependent for several GPCRs, the dependence of this on an extracellular domain has not been described.AJ304414 Mammalian receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have over 85% sequence homology and similar ligand selectivity.

Consequently, GnRH analogs are extensively employed as therapeutic agents in sex hormone-dependent diseases (1Millar R.P. King J.A. Davidson J.S. Milton R.C. S. Afr. Med.

The interaction of Asn2.50(87), in transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), with Asp7.49(318) in TM7 of the mouse GnRH receptor appears to have a role in stabilizing the activated receptor conformation (7Flanagan C.A. Zhou W. Chi L. Yuen T. Rodic V. Robertson D. Johnson M. Holland P. Millar R.P. Weinstein H. Mitchell R. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

In common with other GPCRs, the highly conserved Asp-Arg (DR) sequence at the intracellular boundary of TM3 has an integral role in activation of the GnRH receptor (15Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the structural features that determine whether a ligand will interact with the GnRH receptor as an agonist or antagonist, stabilizing the active or inactive conformation of the receptor, are poorly understood. The high amino acid sequence homology of the mammalian GnRH receptors (over 85%) is paralleled by a similarity in pharmacological properties (4Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which has made comparative sequence analysis of conserved and altered amino acids uninformative in identifying functionally important residues. In contrast, nonmammalian GnRH receptors have distinctly different pharmacology, both in ligand selectivity and G protein coupling (4Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Biological assays indicate that the chicken GnRH receptor exhibits well defined differences in ligand selectivity compared with mammalian GnRH receptors (16Millar R.P. Flanagan C.A. Milton R.C. King J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, some antagonists of mammalian GnRH receptors act as agonists of the chicken GnRH receptor, stimulating luteinizing hormone (LH) release from chicken pituitary cells (20Jacobs G.F. Flanagan C.A. Roeske R.W. Millar R.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of the chicken gonadotrope GnRH receptor would, therefore, potentially provide the means for identifying domains and residues involved in ligand selectivity and underlying receptor activation. We report the cloning of a novel GnRH receptor from chicken pituitary that differs from the mammalian GnRH receptor in its primary structure, ligand selectivity, and in the agonistic behavior of certain mammalian GnRH receptor antagonists. Analysis of the functional properties of a range of antagonists of the mammalian GnRH receptors in the chicken GnRH receptor shows that agonism in the chicken receptor is conferred by a basic d-Lys or d-Ipr-Lys in position 6. Chicken-human chimeric receptors identified the receptor determinant of the agonist activity of the “antagonist” peptides as extracellular loop 2 (EC2) of the chicken GnRH receptor. The sequences of GnRH analogs used in the study are shown in Table I. Agonists were synthesized by conventional solid-phase methodology and purified to more than 95% homogeneity by preparative C-18 reversed-phase chromatography (16Millar R.P. Flanagan C.A. Milton R.C.

Open table in a new tab A numbering scheme, in which amino acids of GnRH receptors are numbered relative to the most conserved residues in the TM segments of the rhodopsin-like GPCRs, is used to facilitate comparison among different receptors (21Ballesteros J. Weinstein W. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). The amino acid identifier, which follows the name of the amino acid, consists of the TM number followed by the position of the amino acid relative to the most conserved residue in that TM, which is assigned the number 50, and the sequence number of the amino acid in its receptor, in parentheses. For example, the Asp residue that is located immediately amino-terminal to the most conserved residue, Pro7.50, in TM7 is designated Asp7.49(319) in the human GnRH receptor and Asp7.49(310) in the chicken GnRH receptor (see Fig. 2 for alignment of these receptor sequences). A 120-base pair product encoding EC3 was amplified from 1 μg of chicken genomic DNA using the degenerate primer pairs (JH5S/JH6A) to conserved regions in TM6 and TM7 of GnRH receptors (22Troskie B. Illing N. Rumbak E. Sun Y.M. Hapgood J. Sealfon S. Conklin D. Millar R. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1998; 112: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The 120-base pair product was cloned into the pMOS-blue vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), labeled with [α−32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming using the Megaprimer labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and used to screen a λ Charon 4A chicken genomic library (23Dodgson J.B. Strommer J. Engel J.D. Cell. 1979; 17: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Three positive clones were isolated after tertiary screening. λ DNA was purified from one of these clones (cGnRH-R.g-22). Southern blot analysis of a PstI digest of cGnRH-R.g-22 identified a 2.7-kb fragment that hybridized with the 120-base pair probe used to screen the library. The 2.7-kb fragment (pCH1) was cloned into pSK+ (Bluescript, Strategene, La Jolla, CA) and partially sequenced. The pCH1 clone contained the entire 3′-coding region of the GnRH receptor gene, including an intron within IC3 (Fig. 1). Partial nucleotide sequence analysis of PstI fragments cloned into the pSK+ vector from the GnRH-R.g-22 identified a clone (pCH2) encoding the region of the cGnRH-R from the 4th amino acid of the amino-terminal region to the middle of TM4. The pCH2 construct was verified to contain partial sequences of two introns at each end (Fig. 1). Four antisense primers were designed from the pCH1 nucleotide sequence (Fig. 1). Two of these primers YS6, 5′-TCTAGTCTCCTTTTGGGTACATCTCTTC-3′, and YS5, 5′-TGGGTACATCTCTTCAGCACACCGT-3′, were designed to hybridize to sequences of the 3′-untranslated region. Primers YS4, 5′-GGTGCATGTGTGCAGCAAACC-3′, and YS3, 5′-GGGCATCCTCTGGATCATGGC-3′, were designed on the basis of the EC3 sequences of the receptor. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA isolated from the pituitaries of castrated chickens (Marathon cDNA synthesis kit,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The YS6 primer was used to initiate first strand synthesis. Marathon cDNA adapters, which contain the AP1 and AP2 primers, were ligated to the ends of the cDNA. The 5′-end of the chicken GnRH receptor cDNA was amplified by three rounds of nested PCR with KlenTaq polymerase (CLONTECH), using the following combination of primers: round 1 (AP1/YS5), round 2 (AP2/YS4), and round 3 (AP2/YS3). Southern blot analysis of the PCR products identified three bands of 0.8, 0.9, and 1.2 kb that hybridized to α−32P-labeled pCH2. These bands were subcloned into the pMOS-blue vector. One clone, pCH3, was sequenced and shown to consist of the 5′-untranslated region of chicken GnRH receptor cDNA extending to the YS3 primer (Fig.1). Two sense primers were designed to the region 5′ to the start codon of the chicken receptor as follows: YS1, 5′-GCTGAGCACTTGTGCTGCCT-3′, and YS2, 5′-CACTTGTGCTGCCTGACTTGCTG-3′ (Fig. 1). Two rounds of nested PCR with primer combinations (YS1/YS6 and YS2/YS5) yielded a ∼1.2-kb band from the castrated chicken pituitary DNA. This band was subcloned into the pMOS vector. Two clones, pCH4 and pCH5, were isolated, and nucleotide sequencing confirmed that they contained the entire open reading frame of the chicken GnRH receptor. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these clones with those of the genomic clones identified a number of differences that might have arisen during the PCRs or represented polymorphisms. The pCH4 clone showed nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid substitutions of Gln for Lys1.30(40) and Tyr for His1.65(75) compared with the genomic sequences. The pCH5 clone contained Arg in place of Cys5.23(189) of the genomic clone. Both clones showed a substitution of Arg for Gln7.77(338). As it is uncertain whether these differences represent polymorphism or PCR errors, three different DNA fragments from the pCH4, pCH5, and pCH1 were ligated to reconstruct a chicken GnRH receptor (cGnRH-R) encoding amino acid sequences identical to those of the genomic clone. TheXbaI/SphI fragment from the pCH5 was ligated to the SphI/EcoRI fragment of the pCH4 and subcloned into the pSK+ vector, eliminating the amino acid substitutions at positions 40, 75, and 189 (the XbaI and EcoRI sites were in the pMOS vector). To eliminate the substitution at position 338, the NotI/AvaI fragment from this chimeric clone was ligated to the AvaI/PstI fragment from pCH1 (NotI and PstI sites were in the pSK+ vector) and subcloned into the pSK vector to yield the full-length cGnRH-R. The NotI/XhoI fragment of the cGnRH-R was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA I/AMP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing of the resulting chicken GnRH receptor clone verified that the encoded amino acid sequence was identical to that of the genomic clone. Silent restriction endonuclease sites for BsrGI, StuI,HpaI, and SnaBI were introduced at the extracellular ends of TM4 to TM7 of the human GnRH receptor by site-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The resulting receptor exhibited ligand binding and IP accumulation that were indistinguishable from those of the wild type human GnRH receptor. Chimeric GnRH receptors were constructed by excising the extracellular loops of the human receptor and replacing them with equivalent loops of the chicken GnRH receptor (Fig. 2), using appropriate restriction sites. EC2 and EC3 of the chicken GnRH receptor were generated by PCR amplification of the chicken GnRH receptor using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and primers flanked by the appropriate restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, were seeded into 12-well plates (Corning Glass) (0.6–1 × 105 cells/25-mm well), pre-coated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml). Cells were transfected for 3.5 h with plasmid DNA (0.5 to 1 μg/well), using a modified DEAE-dextran method (25Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). IP production was measured as described previously (26Millar R.P. Davidson J. Flanagan C. Wakefield I. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 145-162Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Medium 199, supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin for 16–22 h. Cells were washed twice with buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 8 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 mm LiCl and appropriate concentrations of GnRH agonist or with antagonist in the presence and absence of 1 or 10 nm [Gln8]GnRH (chicken GnRH receptor) or 1 nm mammalian GnRH (human GnRH receptor). Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Radioligand binding assays were performed on intact cells 48 h after transfection. Transfected cells in 12-well culture plates were washed and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 125I-GnRH-A (100,000 cpm) and various concentrations of unlabeled GnRH agonists or antagonists in buffer A as previously described (14Myburgh D.B. Millar R.P. Hapgood J.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Sun Y.M. Millar R.P. Ho H. Gershengorn M.C. Illing N. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3390-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled antagonist 27. After incubation, the cells were washed three times and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. K i, ED50(peptide concentration required for half-maximal IP formation), and IC50 (antagonist concentration required to half-maximally inhibit IP formation) values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the PRISM program (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). Screening of chicken pituitary cDNA libraries failed to identify any GnRH receptor clones. As the chicken thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor was cloned from the same libraries (27Sun Y.M. Millar R.P. Ho H. Gershengorn M.C. Illing N. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3390-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it appears that GnRH receptor mRNA is expressed at low levels in chicken pituitaries, as in some mammalian species (28Chi L. Zhou W. Prikhozhan A. Flanagan C. Davidson J.S. Golembo M. Illing N. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: R1-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 29Illing N.

The full-length chicken GnRH receptor cDNA was therefore isolated by the combined strategies of genomic library screening, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and PCR of total RNA prepared from pituitaries of castrated chickens (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Sequencing of genomic clones revealed that the chicken GnRH receptor has introns located in TM4 and IC3 (Fig.1) as in mammalian GnRH receptors (30Fan N.C. Jeung E.B. Peng C. Olofsson J.I. Krisinger J. Leung P.C.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 103: R1-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,31Reinhart J. Xiao S. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). But, unlike the mammalian receptors, an additional intron is present in the amino-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Full-length chicken GnRH receptor cDNA clones obtained by PCR varied in the coding of the amino acids Lys1.30(40), His1.65(75), Cys5.23(189), and Gln7.77(338) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since it was uncertain whether these were errors incorporated by PCR or polymorphisms, a “wild type” chicken GnRH receptor cDNA, which corresponded to the genomic sequence, was constructed (Fig. 1) and used for all of the experiments described. The cloned chicken GnRH receptor cDNA encodes a 375-amino acid polypeptide with the seven hydrophobic putative TM domains, connected by three cytosolic and three extracellular loops, extracellular amino-terminal and cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domains that are characteristic of GPCRs (Fig. 2). The chicken GnRH receptor has low amino acid sequence identity (41%) and homology (59%) with the human and other mammalian GnRH receptors, excluding the highly variable amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail that is absent from mammalian GnRH receptors (4Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) but present in other nonmammalian GnRH receptors (17Illing N. Troskie B.E. Nahorniak C.S.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain has been shown to regulate GnRH receptor desensitization and internalization (32Pawson A.J. Katz A. Sun Y.M. Lopes J. Illing N. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. J.

Also similar to other nonmammalian GnRH receptors, the chicken GnRH receptor has Asp in both loci of the conserved helix 2/helix 7 functional microdomain. This microdomain consists of Asn2.50(87)/Asp7.49(319) in the human GnRH receptor and Asp2.50/Asn7.49 in most other GPCRs, and it regulates GPCR coupling and expression (7Flanagan C.A. Zhou W. Chi L.

The presence of two Asp residues in the chicken GnRH receptor suggests that the nonmammalian GnRH receptors may represent an evolutionary intermediate between the Asp2.50/Asn7.49arrangement of the microdomain found in most GPCRs and the Asn2.50/Asp7.49 of the mammalian GnRH receptors. The presence of Asp2.50/Asn7.49 in the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the GnRH receptor (34Hauser F. Sondergaard L. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The cloned chicken GnRH receptor exhibited high affinity binding to a series of GnRH agonists (TableII). It had high affinity for both mammalian GnRH and the native chicken ligand [Gln8]GnRH (K i 4.1 ± 1.2 and 5.3 ± 0.5 nm, respectively), in contrast to the human GnRH receptor, which had similar high affinity for mammalian GnRH (K i 4.8 ± 1.2 nm) but low affinity for [Gln8]GnRH (K i174 ± 69 nm) (Table II). The chicken GnRH receptor had much higher affinity for GnRH II (0.60 ± 0.01 nm), also contrasting with low affinity in the human GnRH receptor (K i 39 ± 8.5 nm). The substitution of a d-amino acid for Gly6 in GnRH is thought to constrain the peptide in the biologically active β-II-turn conformation and enhance binding affinity for mammalian GnRH receptors (see Ref. 4Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the 3-fold enhancement of the affinities of [d-Arg6]GnRH II and GnRH-A compared with unconstrained ligands in the human GnRH receptor (Table II). In contrast, there was little or no enhancement in binding affinity of the d-amino acid-containing ligands for the chicken GnRH receptor (Table II). These direct receptor binding studies confirm previous bioassay data and support the suggestion that incorporation of d-amino acids in position 6 of GnRH does not enhance binding affinity for the chicken GnRH receptor and that GnRH binds the chicken GnRH receptor differently from the mammalian receptor (16Millar R.P.

To discern the intracellular loci of PIKfyve products' formation, we have examined the localization of PIKfyve protein versus enzymatic activity and a possible acutely regulated redistribution in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Subcellular fractions of resting cells that were positive for immunoreactive PIKfyve, such as cytosol (∼76%), internal structures (low density microsomal fraction (LDM), composed of recycling endosomes, GLUT4 storage compartment, Golgi, and cytoskeletal elements) (∼20%), and plasma membrane (∼4%), expressed enzymatically active PIKfyve. While the presence of a FYVE finger in PIKfyve predicts early endosome targeting, density gradient sedimentation, immunoadsorption, and fluorescence microscopy analyses segregated the LDM-associated PIKfyve from the membranes of the recycling endosomes and GLUT4.

We suggest the recruited PIKfyve specifies the site and timing of phosphoinositide signals that are relevant to the acute insulin action. The key function of phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns),1 called collectively PIs, in eukaryotic cell regulation has been recognized for more than 2 decades with the discovery that PtdIns 4,5-P2is converted by phospholipase C to two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. It has become increasingly clear, however, that PIs have a signaling role in their own right,i.e. they do not require hydrolysis to set in motion cellular processes. In most cases, PIs were found to serve as site-specific signals on membranes that recruit/activate effector protein complexes at the interface with the cytosol. Phosphoinositide signals are used in this way by eukaryotic cells to modulate a large number of responses, such as membrane ruffling, secretion, vesicular trafficking, insulin-regulated membrane translocation of the fat/muscle-specific GLUT4 glucose transporter, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle (1Anderson R.A.

The intracellular PIs identified to date stem from the same precursor, PtdIns, and differ by the degree and position of phosphorylation of PtdIns' head group. Out of the five candidate phosphorylation positions, only the hydroxyls at positions D-3, D-4, and D-5 are found phosphorylated intracellularly, separately or in all possible combinations, resulting in PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 5-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2, PtdIns 3,5-P2, and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (2Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Among the PI species, PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 have attracted increasing attention. They have been identified only recently mainly because PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 are poorly separated from PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2, respectively, under classical HPLC analysis (5Dove S.K.

An enzyme activity, thought responsible for the main pathway of their biosynthesis in mammalian cells, called PIKfyve (phosphoinositide kinase for five position containing a fyve finger), has been recently identified by molecular cloning (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PIKfyve is a large protein of 2052 amino acids, which displays an intrinsic, wortmannin-resistant (ID50, 600 nm) lipid kinase activity to generate PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 in vitro (8Shisheva A.

While PIKfyve intracellular distribution remains to be determined, of interest is that PIKfyve contains two evolutionarily conserved, plausible membrane-targeting, domains: a FYVE finger, found in other mammalian proteins as a major determinant for localization to early endosomes (10Ito K. Ishi N. Miyashita A. Tominaga K. Kuriyama H. Maruyama H. Shirai M. Naito M. Arakawa M. Kuwano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), reported sufficient for targeting to specific membrane compartments (14Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, only PtdIns 3,5-P2 and not PtdIns 5-P is documented (16Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis is the 2278-amino acid protein Fab1p (16Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1219-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, with the exception of the DEP region, shares similar domain architecture and is related in sequence to PIKfyve (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fab1p is found associated with fractions enriched for Golgi/endosome, lysosomal, or cytosolic marker proteins (16Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Yeast strains defective in Fab1p, concomitantly with a depletion of the PtdIns 3,5-P2 pool, display severe defects in cell growth, expanded vacuoles, which fail to acidify, and defects in MVB formation. Thus, through PtdIns 3,5-P2 production, Fab1p is thought to regulate several steps in yeast membrane trafficking such as internal vesicle formation or cargo selection within the MVB and the recycling/turnover of membranes from the vacuolar surface to earlier compartments (18Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). That PIKfyve may play a role in membrane trafficking events in mammals is suggested by the results of complementation experiments in fab1-deficient yeast mutants, demonstrating that PIKfyve exhibits the ability to suppress the vacuolar defect and restore the basal PtdIns 3,5-P2 pool (19McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Clearly, these studies underscore the importance of PIKfyve in cellular regulation and suggest that local generation of PtdIns 3,5-P2 and probably PtdIns 5-P may have an important role in signaling and/or execution of membrane trafficking in mammalian cells. Because PtdIns 5-P has never been detected in yeast, it is conceivable this PI derivative, produced presumably by PIKfyve enzymatic activity, has evolved over time to serve specific mammalian cell functions. A common feature among the cellular events regulated by PIs is that they are spatially and temporally restricted. Therefore, the key to our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the PI-regulated signals rests upon knowledge of the precise site and timing of the PI generation. Thus far, direct measurement of PI levels in situ meets several restrictions mainly related to the fact that PIs are in low abundance with a rapid turnover and therefore cannot be readily approached by conventional techniques (20Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An alternative approach involves following the enzyme activity's intracellular location with the premise that the latter will largely dictate where localized synthesis of the phosphoinositide products can occur. In this study, we undertook biochemical and morphological approaches to characterize the intracellular localization of PIKfyve protein and to relate it to PIKfyve enzymatic activity. We demonstrate here that subcellular fractions of resting 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were found positive for immunoreactive PIKfyve expressed an enzymatically active protein. PIKfyve largely colocalized with markers for Golgi-to-late-endosome traffic but was segregated away from recycling endosomal pathway markers. A subpopulation of the PIKfyve particulate pool was found to be detergent-resistant and cofractionated with structures, possibly cytoskeletal, recently reported positive for key elements of the insulin-signaling circuit relevant to GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We further demonstrate that acute insulin stimulation in this cell type induces spatially localized recruitment of PIKfyve to inner membranes, thus implying PIKfyve lipid products as regulated site-specific signals relevant to acute insulin action. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts into insulin-sensitive adipocytes on plates or glass coverslips was described previously (21Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used between 7 and 14 days after the onset of the differentiation program. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PIKfyve antiserum (R7069; East Acres) was directed against a recombinant GST fusion protein comprising the N terminus of PIKfyve (amino acids 1–100). Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against GLUT4 (R1288 and 1F8) and IRAP were gifts of Drs. M. Czech, P. Pilch and K. Kandror. Monoclonal anti-TfR (HTRH68.4), anti-β-COP (M3A5), and rabbit polyclonal anti-human CI-MPR antibodies were gifts of Drs. S. White, I. Trowbridge, T. Kreis, and B. Hoflack, respectively. Anti-PI 3-kinase p85 and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-GFP antibody was from CLONTECH; and human insulin was from Lilly. The EGFP-HA-PIKfyveS construct was generated by subcloning the XbaI/SalI digest of pBluescript II SK(+)-PIKfyveS cDNA (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) together with the double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding for HA epitope (designed withEcoRI/XbaI restriction sites) into theEcoRI/SalI digest of pEGFP C2(CLONTECH). 3T3-L1 adipocytes (100-mm dish) were serum-deprived for 14 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated with or without insulin (100 nm) or pervanadate (100 μm) for 7 and 20 min, respectively, at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS and once with HES buffer (20 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mm NaVO3)) at 25 °C, and then scraped at 4 °C in HES buffer, supplemented with the inhibitor mixtures. Cells were homogenized by passing the cell suspension six times through a 22½-gauge needle at 4 °C. Subcellular fractionation was performed following previous protocols (21Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall Instrument Division) in the first spin and Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) in the next spins to obtain HDM, LDM, PM, M/N, and cytosolic fractions. Pellets were resuspended in HES buffer containing the above inhibitors to a protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting or, following solubilization in 1% Nonidet, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, were subjected to lipid kinase assay (see below). LDM digestion with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) or λ-phosphatase (Calbiochem) was performed for 40 min at 25 °C. Evaluation of Triton X-100-soluble versus insoluble pools of PIKfyve was performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described previously (22Shisheva A. Doxsey S.J. Buxton J.M. Czech M.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 143-158PubMed Google Scholar) except for CSK buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mmsucrose, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100; Ref.23Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in place of PBS-Triton. Immunopurification of GLUT4-containing vesicles was achieved on anti-GLUT4 IgG as described previously (21Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LDM fractions derived from insulin-treated or untreated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were resuspended in PBS, supplemented with 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and then immunoadsorbed (18 h at 4 °C) on anti-GLUT4 IgG (R1288 antiserum, purified on protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or control rabbit IgG (25 μg each). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) was added for the final 2 h of the incubation. Following washings, the pellets along with aliquots of the supernatants were subjected either to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or to lipid kinase assay, as described below. The potency of anti-GLUT4 to quantitatively immunoadsorb GLUT4 vesicles was analyzed in a parallel experiment, in which the samples were mixed in Laemmli buffer (no boiling) for 30 min at 25 °C and processed further for immunoblotting. Anti-GLUT4 antibodies eliminated ∼80% of the GLUT4-vesicle pool in LDM. LDM fractions prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and resuspended in HES buffer supplemented with 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures were mixed with iodixanol (OptiPrep; Sigma) in a polyallomer Quick-Seal centrifuge tube (13 × 51 mm; Beckman) to either 14 or 30% iodixanol and 196 or 128 mmsucrose concentrations, respectively, resulting in isoosmotic solutions. A self-generating gradient was formed by centrifuging to equilibrium at 4 °C in a VTi 65.2 rotor (Beckman L8-M-55 centrifuge) for 4 h at 53,000 rpm as described (24Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fractions of ∼0.35 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and were analyzed for refractive index (Bausch and Lomb refractometer), protein concentration, and presence of PIKfyve or other proteins by immunoblotting. COS-7 cells seeded on 100-mm dishes (for biochemistry) or 22 × 22 cm coverslips (for microscopy) were transfected with cDNA constructs indicated in the figure legends by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (22Shisheva A. Doxsey S.J. Buxton J.M. Czech M.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 143-158PubMed Google Scholar) and then processed for immunoprecipitation (see below) or fluorescence microscopy. Twenty h post-transfection with pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveS by LipofectAMINE, the cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then incubated (3 or 15 min at 37 °C) with Texas red Tf (8 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) filtered through a 0.22-μm filter in DMEM (dye-free). The dishes were placed on ice, and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with formaldehyde (4%) in PBS prior to rewashing and mounting. The lysosomal compartment was labeled with Texas red-conjugated dextran (1 mg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.; size 10,000) in DMEM (dye-free) plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 20 h in COS cells, 24 h post-transfection by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were then chased (2 h) with a dextran-free medium and, after washes in PBS, were fixed in paraformaldehyde (3.7%), rewashed, and mounted. Double labeling with anti-CI-MPR or β-COP antibodies and detection by CY3-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) or Texas red-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), respectively, was performed in formaldehyde-fixed transfected COS-7 cells (20 h post-transfection with LipofectAMINE). Double staining with affinity-purified anti-GLUT4 monoclonal (1F8) and anti-PIKfyve polyclonal antibodies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was as previously described (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted on slides using the Slow Fade Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence analyses were performed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 310) using a 63/1.4 immersion lens. For immunoblotting, protein samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The blots were saturated with blocking buffer and probed (16 h at 4 °C) with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. After washes, bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-bound anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, the blots were stripped either for 16 h at 4 °C in 100 mm glycine buffer/HCl, pH 2.2, containing 20 mmmagnesium acetate and 50 mm KCl or for 30 min at 65 °C with 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. After blocking, blots were reprobed with antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, the RIPA (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) lysates, collected from transfected cells (calcium phosphate precipitation method) or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were precleared by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatants were then incubated (16 h at 4 °C) with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends or with preimmune serum. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added in the final 1.5 h of incubation. Immunoprecipitates were washed with RIPA buffer (unless otherwise stated), solubilized in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Following subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and subsequent solubilization of the membrane fractions (the final concentration of the detergents is as in the RIPA buffer), the fraction lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with anti-PIKfyve or preimmune sera under conditions described above. The immunoprecipitates immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads were washed as described elsewhere (9Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and subjected to lipid kinase assay in 25 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm lipid substrate (synthetic diC16 PtdIns 3-P as an ammonium salt; a gift from Echelon), 2.5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (12.5 μCi). Following incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC under previously specified conditions (9Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Generated radioactive PtdIns 3,5-P2 product was detected by autoradiography and quantified by radioactive counting. Its identity and purity was confirmed by HPLC analysis performed in the presence of appropriate internal standards, detailed elsewhere (9Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cytosol, LDM, or PM fractions were subjected directly to the lipid kinase assay without immunoprecipitation. In this case, following 3T3-L1 adipocyte fractionation, described under “Cell Treatment and Subcellular Fractionation,” aliquots of the fractions (20 μl) were mixed with 30 μl of the lipid kinase reaction mixture and processed as described above. Pervanadate was generated from vanadate and H2O2, mixed prior to experiments in a molar ratio of 1:2 as described (25Shisheva A. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fraction density was calculated from the refractive index (26Ford T. Graham J. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in all samples was determined by a bicinchoninic protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein levels on the immunoblots were quantified on a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) by area integration scanning. Several exposures of each blot were quantified to ensure the linearity of the chemiluminescence signal on the film. PIKfyve subcellular distribution was first analyzed by immunoblotting utilizing different cell fractionation techniques in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and using anti-PIKfyve antibodies directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the PIKfyve N-terminal 100 amino acids. The ability of anti-PIKfyve antibodies to specifically recognize endogenous PIKfyve in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and other cells by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation was characterized previously (8Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To determine the soluble versus particulate pools of PIKfyve, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, rat1 fibroblasts, or COS-7 cells were fractionated into cytosol, total membranes, and nuclear pellets. A significant fraction of the immunoreactive PIKfyve was found to reside in the cytosol under resting conditions (70–80%). The remaining PIKfyve was found associated with the total membrane fractions; no detectable levels were documented in the nuclear pellets of either cell type (not shown). To gain insight into the nature of the membranes/structures with which PIKfyve is associated, we took advantage of previously well defined protocols for differential centrifugation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This fractionation enables isolation of five fractions enriched in marker proteins for PM-enriched fraction; M/N; endosomes, Golgi elements, and endoplasmic reticulum (HDM); recycling endosomes, Golgi and cytoskeletal elements, and intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment (LDM); and soluble fraction (cytosol) (21Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive PIKfyve was detected predominantly in cytosol and LDM and at low levels in the PM-enriched fraction (Fig. 1), with an average relative distribution of 77, 20, and 3%, respectively, as expressed per equal number of cells. HDM and M/N fractions showed no detectable PIKfyve levels (Fig. 1). Lack of significant contamination of the PM-enriched fraction with intracellular membranes was evidenced by the absence of a signal for the endosomal marker protein Rab4 upon immunoblotting (not shown). The subcellular fractionation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes presented above implies that particulate PIKfyve mainly populates the intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment, Golgi/endosomes, and/or the cytoskeleton. To distinguish among these possibilities and to determine the relationship of the PIKfyve compartment to the other compartments, we performed a series of LDM fractionations using equilibrium sedimentation in self-formed iodixanol gradients, shown previously to effectively separate GLUT4 vesicles, endosomal membranes, the bulk of other membranes, and cytoskeletal elements (24Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Upon sedimentation in 14% iodixanol, the GLUT4 storage compartment is reportedly resolved into two distinct pools, containing different levels of the TfR recycling endosomal marker, TGN markers, or core proteins of the transport machinery (24Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we have obtained two peaks of GLUT4 vesicles, evidenced by the Western blotting of the fractions collected from LDM equilibrium sedimentation at a starting concentration of 14% iodixanol (Fig.2 A). Under these conditions, PIKfyve was found to slightly overlap with the fractions containing the immunoreactive GLUT4 (Fig. 2 A) or IRAP, which reside exclusively on GLUT4 vesicles, and TfR (see below). Intriguingly, PIKfyve almost fully cofractionated with the p85 subunit of class IA PI 3-kinase detected in the denser bottom part of the 14% iodixanol gradient (Fig. 2 A). Higher starting concentrations of iodixanol generate shallower gradients at a lower refractive index, resulting in a greater separation of the denser particles with small differences in density (26Ford T. Graham J. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Under a better resolution of the GLUT4/endosomal compartmentsversus the denser structures, we sought to examine first whether the observed slight overlap between the first GLUT4 peak and PIKfyve would persist and, second, the extent of overlap between p85 PI 3-kinase and PIKfyve. It is worth emphasizing that the combined phosphorylation of D-3 and D-5 in PtdIns is a result of a joint action of two lipid kinases; hence, a colocalization of PI 3-kinase and PIKfyve may facilitate the fidelity for the product's synthesis. Equilibrium sedimentation at 30% iodixanol distributed the LDM into three main protein peaks (Fig. 2 C). Immunoblotting of the collected fractions indicated that TfR"

In this study we have investigated the mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activation of the rat vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) promoter in gastric epithelial cells. Maintenance of basal levels of transcription was dependent on the presence of SP1, cAMP-response element (CRE), and overlapping AP2/SP1 consensus sequences within the region of promoter from −86 to +1 base pairs (bp). Gastrin stimulation increased transcriptional activity, and responsiveness was shown to be dependent on the CRE (−33 to −26 bp) and AP2/SP1 (−61 to −48 bp) consensus sites but independent of the SP1 site at −86 to −81 bp. Gastrin-induced transcription was dependent on the cooperative interaction of an uncharacterized nuclear factor of ∼23.3 kDa that bound to the putative AP2/SP1 site, CRE-binding protein (CREB), and CREB-binding protein/p300. Gastrin stimulation resulted in the increased binding of phosphorylated CREB to the promoter, but it did not result in the increased binding of the AP2/SP1-binding protein. The gastrin responsiveness of the promoter was shown to be dependent on both the protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-signaling pathways, which may converge on the AP2/SP1-binding protein.

VMAT2 is also likely to mediate histamine transport into the secretory vesicles of the enterochromaffin-like cell (ECL) of the gastric corpus (2, 4, 9- 11). In the rat stomach the ECL cell is tightly regulated by the peptide hormone gastrin, with gastrin stimulation leading to the release of histamine and the resultant production of gastric acid from the parietal cell (12Prinz C.

Evidence suggests that VMAT2 may be up-regulated to accommodate the increased histamine biosynthesis and secretion that accompanies ECL stimulation. Hypergastrinaemia-induced degranulation of the ECL cell is accompanied by a parallel secretion of histamine and CgA followed by enhanced production of both molecules, and in the pre-B cell line Ea3.123, the mRNA abundance for both VMAT2 and HDC is increased in a parallel fashion after mobilization of their intracellular calcium levels or by activation of protein kinase C (4Dimaline R.

In addition, increases in the abundance of mRNA for HDC, VMAT2, and CgA were observed in animal models of hypergastrinaemia, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of these genes could be regulated by gastrin in vivo (24Dimaline R. Sandvik A.K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Dimaline R. Evans D. Forster E.R. Sandvik A.K. Am. J.

Indeed, gastrin has been shown to transcriptionally activate both the HDC and CgA promoters (27Hocker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tagerud S. Chulak M. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G619-G633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhang Z. Hocker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

Regulation of the human HDC promoter by gastrin involves a protein kinase C-dependent, MAP kinase/ERK-dependent, and AP1-dependent pathway and involves the binding of distinct nuclear factors to twocis-acting overlapping binding sites (GAS-RE1, +1 to +19; and GAS-RE2 +11 to +27) (30Hocker M.

Gastrin transactivation of the mouse CgA promoter was found to be dependent on the binding of Sp1 to an Sp1/Egr motif located at −88 to −77 bp and a CRE-like element at −71 to −64 bp of the mCgA promoter (29Hocker M. Raychowdhury R. Plath T. Wu H. O'Conner D.T. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34000-34007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Gastrin stimulation resulted in an increased binding of both SP1 and CREB to their consensus sequences within the mCgA promoter, and overexpression of either SP1 or phosphorylated CREB transactivated the promoter. Coexpression of both transcription factors resulted in an additive mCgA promoter response, suggesting that the effect of gastrin was brought about by their cooperative action. In the present study we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of VMAT2 in the gastric epithelial cell line AGS-GR. This cell line has been permanently transfected with the CCKB-gastrin receptor (33Varro A. Wroblewski L. Noble P.J. Bishop L. Ashcroft F. Varro J. Thompson C. Dimaline R. Dockray G.J. Gut. 2000; 46 (abstr.): 56Google Scholar). It has been shown to express a functional CCKβ receptor and utilizes signaling pathways that are common to the ECL cell (33Varro A. Wroblewski L. Noble P.J. Bishop L. Ashcroft F. Varro J. Thompson C. Dimaline R. Dockray G.J. Gut. 2000; 46 (abstr.): 56Google Scholar, 13Prinz C. Zanner R. Gerhard M. Mahir S. Neumayer N. Hohne-Zell B. Gratzl M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C845-C855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has allowed us to examine the controls of both basal and gastrin-stimulated VMAT2 transcriptional activity in these gastric epithelial cells. Maintenance of the basal level of transcription was dependent on the presence of SP1, CRE, and overlapping AP2/SP1 consensus sequences within the region of promoter from −86 to +1 bp, whereas full gastrin responsiveness of the promoter depended on the presence of the intact CRE and AP2/SP1 consensus sequences. Regulation of the rat VMAT2 promoter was found to involve the protein kinase C-dependent and MAP kinase/ERK-dependent pathway, binding of a distinct nuclear factor of estimated molecular mass 23.3 kDa to the putative AP2/SP1 consensus site and the binding and phosphorylation of CREB to the CRE site within the promoter. Thus, our study demonstrates that the rat VMAT2 promoter can, like the HDC and mCgA promoters, be transcriptionally regulated by gastrin, but the mechanism of this regulation is distinct from that observed for these other gastrin-sensitive promoters. Ham's F-12, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Gastrin I (human) was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd., and BIOTAQ DNA polymerase was obtained from Bioline, London, UK. A gel shift assay system containing HeLa and AP2 nuclear extracts and consensus oligos for AP1, OCT1, CREB, NF-Kβ, and TFIID was obtained from Promega. Additional oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma- Genosys, and all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. apart from the phospho-CREB antibody, which was from Upstate Biotechnology and peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG from Sigma. Complete, mini-protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The inhibitors GF109303X and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The promoter region of the rat VMAT2 gene had been previously cloned, and a subclone pV2404-8 was generated in the pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega, Southampton, UK) as described previously (5Watson F. Deavall D.G. Macro J.A. Kiernan R. Dimaline R. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The subclone pV2404-8 was sequenced in both directions by an automated dideoxy method and used to make a series of VMAT2 promoter 5′-deletional constructs in the pGL3- Basic vector (Promega) that contained 1632, 1289, 943, 609, 223, 86, and 36 nucleotides upstream of the start site together with 55 bp of exon 1. Polymerase chain reaction products from pV2404-8 were directionally cloned between the SacI and XhoI sites of pGL3-Basic, and the resultant constructs were sequenced in both directions to confirm their integrity. In addition, polymerase chain reaction products from pV2404-8 that contained 86 and 36 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site together with 55 bp of exon 1 were directionally cloned between the BamHI andXhoI sites of the promoterless luciferase-reporter vector PXP2. Again, the integrity of these constructs and the sequences of mutated constructs generated by polymerase chain reaction were confirmed before their use in experiments. The mutations generated in these constructs are indicated in the appropriate figures and their legends. AGS-GRcells, which were permanently transfected with the human CCKB-gastrin receptor (33Varro A. Wroblewski L. Noble P.J. Bishop L. Ashcroft F. Varro J. Thompson C. Dimaline R. Dockray G.J. Gut. 2000; 46 (abstr.): 56Google Scholar) driven by the EF1-α promoter under puromycin selection, were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (fetal bovine serum) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out using TransfastTM transfection reagent from Promega. Cells were plated out at a density of 5 × 105 cells/65-mm well 24 h before transfection. During transfection, cells were incubated for 1.5 h in 2 ml of transfection mix in serum-free media. The transfection mix consisted typically of 3.4 μl of TransfastTM,1.5 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct, and 0.1 μg of Renillaluciferase (pRL-TK) control vector (Promega) per well. The quantity of firefly luciferase reporter was reduced to 1 μg/ml when additional expression constructs were added. These were typically added at 0.5 μg/well. Cells were stimulated 24 h post-transfection as described in the figure legends and harvested at appropriate time points after stimulation. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter system (Promega), and each individual transfection was assayed in duplicate. Nuclear extracts from AGS-GR cells and rat gastric corpus epithelium were prepared using the methodology described in Schreiber et al.(34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP, and EMSAs were performed with 10 μg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dA-dT), 10% glycerol, and 10 μm Zn2+. Mixtures were incubated with 10 fmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for 20 min at room temperature (29Hocker M. Raychowdhury R. Plath T. Wu H. O'Conner D.T. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S.

For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl of anti-phospho-CREB, anti-ATF, and anti-AP2 antibodies but 2 μl of anti-Sp family antibodies. In addition, the Sp supershifts required the addition of 4 μg of bovine serum albumin to the binding reactions. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphor storage screen, and the image was revealed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sevenoaks, Kent, UK). 20-μg aliquots of AGS-GRnuclear extract were incubated with 10 fmol of Klenow [α-32P]dATP end-labeled probes (A,B, and E, as described in the legend to Fig. 6) in EMSA binding buffer for 30 min on ice. The samples were exposed to UV light for 60 min before the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and heating to 99 °C for 5 min. 10 μg of each sample and prestained molecular weight markers were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine electrophoresis buffer. The gels were dried, and radioactivity associated with the proteins was visualized using a PhosphorImager. 5 × 105AGS-GR cells were plated in 65-mm culture dishes containing 5 ml of complete medium. 18 h later, the medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of gastrin (5 × 10−8m) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h before preparation of a total cell lysate. To prepare the cellular lysate AGS-GR, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 15 mg/ml benzamide, 8.8 mg/ml sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of lysis buffer. 40 μg of the lysates were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunodetection of the proteins was performed. The primary antibody used was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and is specific for mouse, rat, and human VMAT2 but is noncross-reactive with VMAT1. The secondary antibody was a peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate; Pierce) was used to identify the VMAT2 protein. Results were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t test for independent samples. The basal transcriptional activity of the rat VMAT2 promoter in the gastric environment was characterized by ligating polymerase chain reaction-generated segments of the 5′-flanking region of the VMAT2 gene upstream of the gene for firefly luciferase in the reporter vector pGL3-Basic and transfection of the resultant constructs together with a Renilla luciferase vector into AGS-GR cells. The AGS-GR cell line has been permanently transfected with the CCKB-gastrin receptor and has been demonstrated to show specific activation by gastrin (33Varro A. Wroblewski L. Noble P.J. Bishop L. Ashcroft F. Varro J. Thompson C. Dimaline R. Dockray G.J. Gut. 2000; 46 (abstr.): 56Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, transfection of all the constructs resulted in significant luciferase activity with the largest construct v1632pg (encompassing nucleotides −1632 to +55 bp) showing an approximate 10.3-fold increase in luciferase activity over that seen in the promoterless vector. Activity was maximal in the construct v223pg (−223 to +55 bp), which showed an average 44.7-fold increase in luciferase activity over promoterless vector. This level of expression was maintained in the construct v86pg (−86 to +55 bp). The increase in luciferase activity observed in the v223pg construct as compared with v609pg (−609 to +55 bp) suggests the presence of at least one negative regulatory element in the region from −609 to −223 bp. The schematic illustrated in Fig.2 a shows the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat VMAT2 gene from −86 to +55 bp, with bases numbered relative to the transcriptional start site. Within this region there is a SP1 consensus sequence spanning from −86 to −81 bp, a putative AP2/SP1 site spanning from −61 to −48 bp, and a CRE consensus sequence spanning from −33 to −26 bp. To assess the contribution of the cis-regulatory elements contained in this region to maintenance of basal transcriptional activity, constructs were made in which the SP1, AP2/SP1, or CRE consensus sequences were mutated. A schematic representation of these and other constructs used in this study is shown in Fig. 2 b. As Fig.3 shows, when the intact SP1 site starting at −86 bp was mutated, basal activity of the v86pg construct was reduced to 36.61 ± 5.91% (mean ± S.E.,n = 17) wild type. When the AP2 region of the AP2/SP1 composite site was mutated (Fig. 3), there was no effect on basal activity of the construct v86px. However mutation of the SP1 part of the site reduced basal activity to 37.4 ± 0.04% (mean ± S.E., n = 12) of the control level (Fig. 3). Mutation of the CRE also reduced the basal transcriptional activity of the construct v36pg to 39.9 ± 4.8% (mean ± S.E.,n = 18) of the control level (Fig. 3). Thus the SP1, putative AP2/SP1, and CRE consensus sequences are all important determinants of basal transcriptional activation in the AGS-GR cell line.Figure 2a, sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat VMAT2 gene. Bases are numbered relative to the transcriptional start site (+1), which was determined previously by primer extension analysis (5Watson F. Deavall D.G. Macro J.A. Kiernan R. Dimaline R. Biochem.

AGS-GR cells were transiently transfected with mutated VMAT2 promoter/luciferase constructs (v86sp1pg, v86sp1/2px, v86ap2px, and v36 mpg), and their luciferase activity was compared with that found for their parental controls.

Constructs that contained from 1632 to 86 bp of VMAT2 promoter in the vector pGL3b all showed significant increases in luciferase activity after stimulation with gastrin (Fig.4 a) compared with their basal levels of activity. The luciferase activity of the largest construct, v1632pg, was increased 8.2 ± 0.9-fold (mean ± S.E.,n = 9) over basal activity after stimulation with gastrin (5 × 10−8m) for a 24-h period. Truncation of the promoter region of this construct down to 86 bp did not lead to significant reductions in response. Gastrin stimulation led to a 7.1 ± 1.5-fold (mean ± S.E.,n = 9) increase in the luciferase activity of the construct v609pg, which was not significantly different from that of construct v86pg, which was on average increased 5.2 ± 0.4-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 9). Stimulation of the v86px construct with 5 × 10−8mgastrin increased the transcriptional activity of the promoter within 4 h of stimulation and was maximal at 24 h post-stimulation. Maximal responses were seen with 5 × 10−8m gastrin, but significant stimulation was seen with 5 × 10−9m gastrin (data not shown). Gastrin responsiveness was inhibited by the gastrin antagonist L740093, and Gly-extended gastrin was unable to increase the transcription of the v86px construct (data not shown). Western blot analysis demonstrated VMAT2 protein in the AGS-GR cell line, but its abundance was not significantly elevated after gastrin stimulation of the cells (data not shown). The luciferase activity of the promoterless pGL3b-empty vector was modestly increased after stimulation with 5 × 10−8m gastrin (2.67 ± 0.6-fold over basal levels, mean ± S.E., n = 9; Fig. 4 a). Although this increase was not comparable with those observed with constructs containing the rat VMAT2 promoter segments, new constructs were made in the PXP2 luciferase vector to confirm and extend the data on gastrin responsiveness of the promoter. Stimulation with gastrin did not increase the intrinsic luciferase activity of the promoterless PXP2 vector (Fig. 4 b). However the construct v86px showed a 4.44 ± 0.8 (mean ± S.E.,n = 11) fold increase in luciferase activity over basal levels after gastrin stimulation (Fig. 4 b), confirming our findings originally made using the pGL3b vector that the region of rat VMAT2 promoter from −86 to +55 bp was capable both of sustaining basal transcription and of increasing its transcriptional activity in response to gastrin. The gastrin responsiveness of constructs v48px (48 to +55 bp) and v36px was significantly reduced when compared with that of v86px (p < 0.05) but was significantly greater than that of the promoterless PXP2 empty vector (Fig. 4 b,p < 0.005). The region of promoter (from −86 to 49 bp) contains both the SP1 and AP2/SP1 composite sites, and gastrin responsiveness was reduced on its deletion. As shown by the similar responsiveness of the v48px and v36px constructs, the region from −48 to −37 bp did not appear to contribute to the gastrin responsiveness of the promoter. However, a significant level of gastrin responsiveness was maintained in the smallest construct v36px, which contains the CRE. These data therefore suggested the possibility that all three consensus sites, SP1, AP2/SP1, and CRE, might contribute to the gastrin responsiveness of the promoter. To dissect the gastrin responsiveness further, comprehensive mutagenesis of the constructs v36px and v86px was performed. When the intact SP1 site at position −86 to −81 bp was mutated in construct v86sp1px, the gastrin responsiveness of this construct was not different from its parental construct, v86px (101.9 ± 17.03% gastrin response; mean ± S.E., n = 9). This indicated that this site was not contributing to the gastrin responsiveness of the promoter (Fig. 5 a), and experiments performed with the construct v86pg and the mutated construct v86sp1pg confirmed this finding (data not shown). In contrast, when the CRE site was mutated in the construct v36mpx, the gastrin responsiveness of this construct was reduced to 51 ± 10% (mean ± S.E.,n = 7) of its parental construct, v36px, indicating the importance of the CRE consensus sequence. The importance of this CRE consensus sequence for gastrin responsiveness of the rat VMAT2 promoter was confirmed through its mutation from within the construct v86px (Fig. 5 b). Gastrin increased the luciferase activity of the resultant vcrepx construct by only 1.3 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 14) over basa"

However, use of this ligand is limited because it has high affinity for all known Bn receptors. In the present study we have attempted to identify BRS-3 selective ligands using a strategy of rational peptide design with the substitution of conformationally restricted amino acids into the prototype ligand [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) or its d-Phe6 analogue. Each of the 22 peptides synthesized had binding affinities determined for hBRS-3, hGRPR, and hNMBR, and hBRS-3 selective ligands were tested for their ability to activate phospholipase C and increase inositol phosphates ([3H]inositol phosphate).

These ligands functioned as receptor agonists and their binding affinities were reflected in their potencies for altering [3H]inositol phosphate. Two peptides with an (R)- or (S)-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid substitution for β-Ala11 in the prototype ligand had the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the mammalian Bn receptors and did not interact with receptors for other gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters.

Using this approach we have identified a number of hBRS-3 selective ligands which function as fully efficacious agonists and two have sufficient selectivity and potency for the hBRS that they could be useful for investigating its role in physiological and pathological processes.RESULTSPrevious studies demonstrated that the novel orphan receptor, hBRS-3, has a unique pharmacology from the other two well studied mammalian bombesin receptor subtypes, the hGRP-R and hNMB-R, with which it has 47–50% amino acid homology (1Fathi Z.

We investigated the ability of each of these peptides to interact with the hBRS-3 receptor and the other two mammalian Bn-related receptors by determining their binding affinities and biological activities in BALB 3T3 cells transfected with hBRS-3, hGRP-R, and hNMB-R.

Bn, NMB, and Bn-(6–14) had very low affinity (Ki >10,000 nm) for the hBRS-3 (Fig. 2,top panel; Table I) which was consistent with results from previous studies in other species (1Fathi Z. Corjay M.H.

The replacement of phenylalanine in position 13 of [d-Phe6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) by leucine (peptide 3, Table I), 4-chlorophenylalanine (peptide 4, Table I), or β-naphthylalanine (peptide 5, Table I) did not produce any hBRS-3 selective compounds. However, the selectivity for hGRP-R increased in the case of each of these position 13 substitutions, with the 4-chlorophenylalanine substitution resulting in a highly selective hGRP-R ligand. Specifically, peptide 4 (Table I) with the 4-chlorophenylalanine substitution in position 13 (Table I, Fig. 2) had almost a 200-fold selectivity for the hGRP-R over hBRS-3 and a 9200-fold selectivity for hGRP-R over hNMB-R (Table I, Fig. 2).We next explored the importance of position 11 by determining the ability of 12 [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) analogues with different conformationally restricted amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1) for the β-alanine in position 11, to interact with each of the human Bn-related receptors (Fig.3). Among these 12 peptides were four sets of (S)- and (R)-optical isomers (peptides 6 and 7; 8 and 9; 10 and 11; 14 and 15; Fig. 3, Table I). In general, there were not large differences in the effect on the affinity for the hBRS-3 receptor between the (S)- and (R)-optical isomers of these position 11 substituted analogues as shown by the ratio of the affinities of these peptides to those of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (Table I). Except for peptide 10, with a (R)-3-amino butyric acid substitution at position 11 that was equipotent with [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) at both the hBRS-3 and the hGRP-R, the rest of the peptides in this group were about 5–30 times less potent at the hGRP-R and 60–100-times less potent at the hNMB-R than [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14). With two of the four sets of optical isomers (peptides 8 and 9, 14 and 15; Table I) the decrease in affinity with the (R)-isomer was greater for the hGRP-R than for the hBRS-3 receptor and therefore, the (R)-isomer was more selective for the hBRS-3 receptor. Each of the 12-position 11-substituted analogues except for peptide 13 with a (R,S)-cis-2-amino-1-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid substitution and peptides 8 and 9 (Table I, Fig. 3) with an (R)- or (S)-trans-2-amino-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid substitution, retained relatively high affinity (Ki <30 nm) for the hBRS-3 receptor (Table I, Fig. 3). In this group of peptides with position 11 substitutions we found eight peptides with varying selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the hGRP-R and the hNMB-R (Table I). Specifically, peptides 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14–17 (Table I, Fig. 3) had selectivities ranging from 2- to 60-fold for the hBRS-3 over the hGRP-R and varying from 10- to 593-fold for the hBRS-3 over the hNMB-R. The two compounds that showed the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the hGRP-R and the hNMB-R were peptides 14 and 15 with an (R)- or (S)-3-amino-3-phenyl-propionic acid replacement at position 11 (Figs. 1 and 3, Table I), respectively. The (R)-isomer (peptide 14; Table I, Fig. 3) had the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the hGRP-R (60-fold) and the hNMB-R (116-fold). The (S)-isomer (peptide 15, Table I, Fig. 3) had the second highest hBRS-3 selectivity of 20-fold over the hGRP-R and 130-fold over the hNMB-R. The most selective hBRS-3 peptide, [d-Tyr6,(R)-Apa11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (peptide 14) (Table I, Fig. 3), retained high affinity for the hBRS-3, however, it was 10 times less potent than the original peptide, [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (peptide 1, Table I) at the hBRS-3 (Ki = 4.1 ± 0.3 nm versus 0.32 ± 0.08, respectively).Figure 3Ability of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14] Bn -(6–14) and various analogues with position 11 conformationally restricted substitutions to inhibit binding to hBRS-3- (top), hGRP-R- (middle), or hNMB-R- (bottom) transfected BALB 3T3 cells.

Therefore, the third group of peptides we made included five peptides containing alterations in the chain length with amino acid deletions and/or additions at positions 6, 7, 9, or 11 of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (Table I, Fig. 4). These types of alterations yielded peptides that were 300- to >1000-fold less potent (Table I, Fig. 4) than the initial peptide (peptide 1, Table I) [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14)), at each of the 3 mammalian Bn-related receptor subtypes, making these peptides (peptides 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22, Table I) generally not useful. An extension of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11, Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) at position 11 by the substitution of an alanine and glycine for the β-alanine (peptide 20, Table I) did not result in a more selective hBRS-3 ligand. Similarly, deletion of [d-Tyr6] and Gln7 from the amino terminus of [d-Tyr6,Aba11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (peptides 10 and 11, Table I) resulted in a 967-fold decrease in the affinity for hBRS-3 for the (R)-isomer (peptide 19, Table I, Fig. 4) and a 240-fold decrease for the (S)-isomer (peptide 18, Table I, Fig. 4). However, with the (S)-isomer (peptide 18, Table I, Fig. 4), a greater decrease in affinity occurred with the two mammalian Bn receptors than with the hBRS-3 receptor so that this compound was 6-fold more selective for the hBRS-3 (Table I, Fig. 4). Deletion of the alanine in position 9 and substitution of the constrained amino acid 3-aminobutyric acid in position 10 for valine in the (R)- or (S)-conformation did not result in more hBRS-3-selective ligands (peptides 21 and 22, Table I, Fig. 4).Figure 4Comparison of the ability of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11, Phe13,Nle14] Bn -(6–14) and various analogues with changes due to amino acid deletion, addition, or substitution at positions 6, 7, 9, and 11 to inhibit binding to the hBRS-3- (top), the hGRP-R- (middle), and the hNMB-R- (bottom) transfected BALB 3T3 cells.

Most are caused by the dysfunction of one or more of the enzyme complexes of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).1Isolated enzymatic deficiency of the first OXPHOS complex, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.3) or Complex I, is one of the most frequent causes of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders (2Loeffen J.L.

Complex I is the first multiprotein complex of the OXPHOS system (3Walker J.E. Q. Rev.

This proton gradient provides part of the proton-motive force used for ATP production. Complex I is the largest of the respiratory chain complexes, made up of seven different subunits encoded on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; ND1–6 and ND4L) and 35 or more different subunits encoded by nuclear genes (4Grigorieff N.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), opening up the possibility of genetic approaches for diagnosis. However, such an analysis would not identify Complex I deficiencies caused by mutations in assembly factors until these factors are identified and even then would not yield sufficient information to understand the genotype-phenotype relationships of the various mutations that can occur.

Immunopurified bovine heart Complex I was generated by solubilizing bovine heart mitochondria in 1% N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (LM; Calbiochem), centrifuging twice (10,000 × g, 12 min) to remove insoluble material, passing the supernatant over an immunoaffinity column generated as described previously (16Harlow E.

Patient fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of young children in whom an isolated Complex I deficiency has been confirmed in muscle tissue as well as in cultured fibroblasts, using the slightly modified method of Fischer et al.

Control fibroblasts were obtained from postcircumcision tissue from a child in the same age range in whom biochemical enzyme analyses revealed normal results. All patients included in this study were screened for the presence of DNA alterations in each of the known nuclear-encoded “structural” genes of Complex I as described previously (19Triepels R.

Open table in a new tab The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were developed at the University of Oregon (Eugene, OR). They were generated by immunizing mice with purified bovine Complex I as described previously (22Marusich M.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 114: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The newly generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were sequentially screened for 1) binding to purified bovine Complex I adsorbed to polystyrene; 2) binding specifically to a single subunit in denaturing Western blots of bovine Complex I; 3) binding to a single subunit in denaturing Western blots of the flavoprotein, iron-sulfur protein, or hydrophobic protein subfractions of bovine Complex I; 4) binding to a single subunit in denaturing Western blots of immunopurified bovine Complex I; 5) binding to a single subunit in denaturing Western blots of human mitochondria; and 6) reactivity and mitochondrial localization in immunohistochemistry of human mitochondria. Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (17Marusich M.F. Robinson B.H. Taanman J.W. Kim S.J. Schillace R. Smith J.L. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody concentrations used were: anti-Complex I-39 kDa, anti-Complex I-15 kDa, anti-Complex I-8 kDa, anti-Complex IV Va, and anti-Complex V-α at 2.0 μg/ml, anti-Complex II-70 kDa at 0.15 μg/ml (17Marusich M.F.

The commercially obtained anti-porin antibody (Calbiochem) was diluted 1:120,000. On the basis of estimated molecular weights and with which Complex I subfraction (flavoprotein, iron-sulfur protein, or hydrophobic protein) each antibody reacted, a list of possible Complex I antigens was compiled for each antibody. The cDNA of two selected Complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) was then amplified by PCR from a human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the forward and reverse primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) 5′-TAT ATC ATG AGC CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAC ATG GCG GCT GCC GCA CAA TCC-3′ and 5′-CAG CCG GAT CCT CGA GCA TAT GGC TCT AAA TGT TGA CGG TCT TGG CC-3′; and 5′-TAT ATA CCA TGG GCC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATG AGA GCG CCG GGG CCG ACA CGC-3′ and 5′-GCG CGC GCC ATA TGC TAC TTG GCA TCA GGC TTC TTG TCT-3′, respectively. The resultant PCR products were subcloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen) using BspHI-NdeI andNcoI-NdeI (New England Biolabs) restriction sites respectively. BL21-DE3 cells (Novagen) were transformed with the plasmids, and when the cells reached an absorbance of 0.6, they were induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells before and after induction were analyzed by Western blot.

Open table in a new tab Human control and patient fibroblasts were grown in M199 (Life Technologies), 5 mg/liter Tween 20 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Approximately 30 × 106 cells were harvested at 95% confluence after mild trypsinization (3–5 min) with 2–3 ml 0.25% trypsin solution/175-cm2 (5 × 106 cells) cell culture. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml 10% fetal calf serum-PBS. Cells were rinsed three times with 1% fetal calf serum-PBS as well as with PBS and finally frozen at −80 °C. For mitochondrial pellets, cells were solubilized in 5 ml homogenization buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were repeatedly (three times) homogenized with a motorized pestle (15–20 strokes), and the postnuclear supernatants were pooled after centrifugation (10 min, 1500 × g). Mitochondrial pellets were obtained by centrifugation of the collected postnuclear supernatants (15 min, 10,000 × g). The mitochondrial pellets were washed twice (15 min, 10,000 ×g) with 2 ml washing buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) including protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Finally, pellets were saved in 200 μl protease inhibitors/washing buffer and stored frozen at −80 °C. Protein amounts were estimated byAλ280 determination. Approximately 5 μg/lane mitochondrial protein, dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol (30 min, 37 °C), were separated on 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels in a Mini-Protein II Apparatus (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis (100-V stacking gel and 150-V running gel), proteins were transferred electrophoretically (2 h, 0.10 A) to 0.45-μm polyvinylidine difluoride membranes in transfer buffer (10% methanol in 10 mm 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 11) on ice. The polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dried milk powder in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS). Afterward the blots were treated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk CMF-PBS for 2 h. After rinsing the blot three times with CMF-PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + M (heavy and light chain) at 0.2 μg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in CMF-PBS. Specific detection of the secondary antibody was obtained with the chemiluminescent Western blotting detection reagent ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after rinsing the blots with CMF-PBS three times. Fluorescence was quantified using a Storm 860 chemifluorescence imager and the accompanying Molecular Dynamics Imagequant software. Ratios of individual proteins were calculated in relation to the porin signal. The ratios of the control fibroblast cell line were set to 100%, and the ratios of other cell lines were reported in comparison with this. The obtained results represent average values of two to five independent experiments for each subunit. Mitochondria (1 mg) from control MRC5 fibroblasts and three patient cell lines (patients 1, 7, and 11) were pelleted (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml pepstatin,1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% LM. The mitochondria were incubated in this solution for 20 min on ice with stirring before any insoluble membranes were pelleted again by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of 250 μl of 35% sucrose, 500 μl of 30% sucrose, 750 μl of 27.5% sucrose, 1 ml of 25% sucrose, 1 ml of 20% sucrose, and 1 ml of 15% sucrose. All sucrose solutions contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% LM, 1 μg/ml pepstatin,1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The gradient was then centrifuged overnight at 4 °C (128,000 ×g, 16.5 h, SW 50.1). The sucrose gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube into 500-μl fractions, which were frozen at −80 °C. For Western blotting, 20 μl of each fraction was loaded per lane. The antigen used to generate monoclonal antibodies was beef heart Complex I purified according to Hatefi (13Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Screening involved an assay for binding to native Complex I, Western blotting, and/or immunohistochemistry. Biochemically purified and immunopurified bovine heart Complex I, biochemically purified iron-sulfur protein, flavoprotein, and hydrophobic protein subfractions of bovine Complex I and human fibroblast cell lines from controls and patients were used in the screening. Unequivocal identification of two of the antibodies was also made by Western blotting after overexpressing the candidate human subunit antigens inE. coli. To date, seven monoclonal antibodies meet our standards for long-term culturing, i.e. they react with biochemically purified bovine Complex I, immunopurified bovine Complex I, solubilized human mitochondria, and whole-cell extracts to generate a single band in Western blot. Where two or more antibodies were obtained to a particular subunit, that which worked best in immunohistochemistry or effectively immunoprecipitated Complex I, or both, was chosen. Table II summarizes the information on the antibodies used in this study. Fibroblasts were cultured from 11 patients in whom an isolated enzymatic Complex I deficiency had been confirmed in muscle tissue as well as cultured fibroblasts. In seven of the patients, the pathogenic mutation was identified genetically, and for four patients the genetic defect was not identified. The residual Complex I activities of the 11 patient fibroblast cell lines ranged from 35 to 85%. Specifics of each patient are provided in TableI. Mitochondria were isolated from each of the patient fibroblast cell lines, a control skin fibroblast cell line, and normal and Rho0 MRC5 fibroblasts (a lung fibroblast cell line). Samples of each were examined by Western blotting with mixtures of antibodies, including ones specific to the 39-kDa subunit of Complex I, the 70-kDa subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II), core II protein of Complex III, subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), subunit IV of Complex IV, the α subunit of F1F0 (Complex V), and porin (as a control for equal loading of lanes). Fig. 1summarizes the data with a bar graph in which the levels of each complex are quantitated by determining the amount of the component subunit in each patient cell line in relation to that found in control skin fibroblasts. From the bar graph, it can be seen that the levels of the 39-kDa subunit of Complex I, but not that of any of the other OXPHOS subunit probed, are diminished in most of the patient cell lines. This is different from the MRC5-Rho0 mitochondria, in which loss of mtDNA leads to an absence of subunit II of Complex IV and lower levels of the core II protein of Complex III. The mitochondrial samples of the 11 patient fibroblasts were examined for levels of six different subunits of Complex I (referred to by their apparent molecular weights as listed in TableII). For the most part, mAbs to the 30-, 20-, 15-, and 8-kDa subunits were used as an antibody mixture along with porin, and the amounts of the 39- and the 18-kDa subunits were quantitated relative to porin separately. A representative Western blot and a bar graph of the levels of the six components of Complex I in the different samples are shown in Fig. 2. A significant reduction in the levels of one or more components of the complex was seen in all but one of the patient samples; that is, patient 7, with a mutation in NDUFV1. The patterns of subunit loss were similar in patients 3 and 4, each of which has a different mutation in NDUFS4. Similarly, the pattern of subunit loss was the same in patients 5 and 6, each with a different mutation in the same subunit, NDUFS2. Patients 9 and 10, both of which have unidentified mutations, show remarkable similarity in the pattern of subunit loss. This pattern most closely resembles that of patients 3 and 4. In Rho0 cells, where there is an absence of the mitochondrially encoded subunits of Complex I, a different pattern from any of the patient samples is observed. In this case, the levels of the 20- and 18-kDa subunits are as low or lower than those of the 15- and 8-kDa subunits. Subunit amounts were lowest in patient 11, identifying this as a likely candidate for a mutation in an assembly factor (see below). The relationship between the loss of each subunit as detected by Western blot analysis and the residual Complex I activity is shown in Fig. 3. In each panel, the dashed line represents what would be expected if there were a perfect correlation between loss of subunit and loss of activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of the 39- and 30-kDa subunits most closely track the loss of activity. However, in most cases the levels of the 20- and 18-kDa subunits are higher than predicted from the activity effects, whereas the levels of the 15- and 8-kDa subunits are lower than the residual levels of enzymatic activity. Mitochondria from three cells lines, i.e. from patient 7 with a mutation in NDUFV1, patient 1 with a mutation in NDUFS7, and patient 11, with an unknown mutation, were each dissolved in 1% LM and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation using a discontinuous gradient. In this gradient, the five complexes of OXPHOS are separated by size, and each can be identified by Western blotting of the fractions with monoclonal antibodies. Densitometric scans of the Western blots can then be made, and, for convenience, the relative expression levels of each subunit in the various fractions can be expressed as a percentage of the highest intensity band in the gradient. Fig. 4shows the distribution in the gradient of the Va subunit of cytochromec oxidase as well as the 39- and 20-kDa subunits of Complex I for the three patient cell lines and a control of MRC5 fibroblasts. Complex I, with a molecular weight of close to 900,000, elutes before the other respiratory chain complexes after gradient separation. The 39- and 20-kDa subunits of patients 1 and 7 elute at a position similar to that of control Complex I, indicative of complete or near complete assembly. However, in patient 11, the 39- and 20-kDa subunits migrate in subcomplexes of ∼200 and 500 kDa, respectively, and there is also a free subunit (eluting in fraction 9). Thus, in patient 11, assembly of Complex I is poor. Monoclonal antibodies are finding widespread use in detecting and analyzing mitochondrial disorders (17Marusich M.F. Robinson B.H. Taanman J.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of cytochromec oxidase, a panel of antibodies has been developed, which reveals different patterns of assembly of the enzyme complex (25von Kleist-Retzow J.C. Vial E. Chantrel-Groussard K. Rötig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this is providing a good indicator of which gene has been mutated, including not only structural components but assembly factors as well. Here, we show the utility of mAbs in the study of Complex I disorders. Six different mAbs were used to examine 11 different patients in which OXPHOS enzyme activity measurements had identified an isolated Complex I deficiency. In seven of these, the mutations had been determined by extensive gene sequencing. In the other four, a mutation has not yet been identified. Screening with an antibody mixture containing an mAb against at least one subunit of each of the five OXPHOS complexes supports the conclusion from enzymatic data that all are deficient in Complex I alone. It is important to note that the antibody screen to localize the defect by the complex or complexes involved is relatively rapid and easily performed and requires much less sample than enzymatic assays. The reaction of the six mAbs against Complex I used here was variable, and several different patterns of steady-state levels of subunits could be distinguished. For two subunits, NDUFS4 and NDUFS2, two patient cell lines were available with different mutations in the same gene. In both cases, the subunit profiles resulting from the two different mutations were essentially the same. In general, the subunits behaved as three classes. The levels of the 39- and 30-kDa subunits varied in the same way, as did the 20- and 18-kDa subunits, whereas the 15- and 8-kDa subunits are a third class. In most patients, the levels of the 20- and 18-kDa subunits were higher than the levels of functional complex as measured by enzymatic activity, whereas the levels of the 15- and 8-kDa subunits were lower. Interestingly, the Rho0 cells seem to behave differently, because the 15- and 8-kDa subunits are present in higher amounts relative to the 20- and 18-kDa subunits. The implication of the data in Fig. 3 is that the steady-state levels of fully assembled Complex I depend on expression levels of all of the subunits being examined here. When any one subunit is mutated, the levels of assembled Complex I are reduced. The lower levels of the 15- and 8-kDa subunits in relation to activity could indicate more lability of these subunits after assembly of the complex. One of the patient cell lines, patient 11, had very low levels of all of the subunits examined and values significantly lower than expected based on activity measurements. It could be that enzymatic activity was overestimated or that the complex is more labile to detergent solubilization with a resulting proteolysis of polypeptides because of the mutation. On the basis of the antibody data, patient 11 is the most likely to involve a mutation in an assembly factor for Complex I. The levels of subunits are low, and these subunits are not in a fully assembled complex based on the sucrose gradient data. The comparison of subunit profiles as shown here allows patients to be sorted as in genetic complementation studies, so that with wider screening of patients, a group of possible Complex I assembly factor mutants can be collected for chromosomal analysis and gene identification, as was done for the SURF1 mutations of cytochrome c oxidase (8Tiranti V. Hoertnagel K. Carrozzo R. Galimberti C. Munaro M. Granatiero M. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Marzella R. Rocchi M. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Enriquez J.A. Uziel G. Bertini E. Dionisi-Vici C. Franco B. Meitinger T. Zeviani M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1609-1621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Besides a role in diagnosis, the antibody studies here add to the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships of mutations already specified genetically. Patient 7 was shown to carry a mutation, T423M, in NDUFV1, the flavin-containing subunit of Complex I. The subunit profile and, more definitively, the sucrose gradient experiments show that the ∼25% loss of activity is due to altered catalytic function and not a failure to assemble the complex. This is different from other patients studied here, such as patients 5, 6, and 8, in whom the levels of all of the subunits probed were significantly decreased, suggesting a more profound defect. In summary, we provide evidence of the utility of monoclonal antibody analysis in the characterization of Complex I deficiencies. It appears that different assembly profiles occur when different subunits are mutated. Antibodies to additional subunits of Complex I will be required to extend the work reported here, and this project is ongoing. Complex I patients have been reported from many centers studying mitochondrial disorders. A more comprehensive analysis of the range of assembly patterns and correlation with site of the mutation will require collaboration and the sharing of the antibodies and cell lines, which should be possible. We greatly appreciate the technicians of the Nijmegen Center for Mitochondrial Disorders biochemistry group for measurements of the OXPHOS activities in skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts. We also thank Frans Trijbels and Rob Sengers for continuous support and are grateful to all colleagues who provided the patient cell lines."

Conaty N. Rubens C.E. Mol Microbiol. 1996; 19: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sialic acids participate in a myriad of signaling, recognition, and cell-cell adhesion phenomena in mammalian cells (3Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are overexpressed in some highly malignant tumors (4Kern W.F. Spier C.M. Miller T.P. Grogan T.M. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1993; 12: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Genetic disorders that lead to altered physiological levels of sialic acids have many consequences in humans and can be fatal (5Rosenberg A. The Biology of Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). In bacterial systems, sialic acids are less common and frequently have roles as virulence factors (6Jann B. Jann K. Curr. Top. Micorbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 19-42PubMed Google Scholar). In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, sialylated glycoconjugates protect the organism from phagocytosis and increase serum resistance (7Rest R.F. Frangipane J.V. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 989-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Haemophilus ducreyi the presence of 2-keto-3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate-containing glycoconjugates correlate with the organism's pathogenicity (8Lagergard T. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Likewise, the sialylated capsule of Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli K1, and group B streptococci are virulence factors (9Bitter-Suermann D. Polysialic Acid: From Microbe to Man. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993Google Scholar, 10Jann K. Jann B. The Virulence of Escherichia coli: Reviews and Methods. Academic Press, Orlando, Florida1985Google Scholar, 11Timmis K.N. Boulnois G.J. Bitter S.D. Cabello F.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 118: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that bacterial species produce sialylated glycoconjugates to mimic the host and escape detection by the immune system (12Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 382-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Clearly, the mechanism of production of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates is of clinical interest. Although bacterial and eucaryotic CMP-NeuAc synthetase enzymes share many catalytic properties, several important differences have been reported, including substrate specificity, tertiary structure, inhibitor sensitivity, and cellular localization (13Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 5: 441-447Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a result, bacterial CMP-NeuAc synthetase enzymes can be targeted by rational drug design strategies. CMP-NeuAc synthetase is also of considerable interest in the field of biotechnology. In the presence of Mg2+, CMP-NeuAc synthetase utilizes CTP and acylneuraminate (NeuAc, a sialic acid) as substrates and produces pyrophosphate and cytosine-5′-monophosphate acylneuraminate (CMP-NeuAc or CMP-NANA), an “activated” sugar nucleotide monophosphate (Fig. 1) (14Warren L. Blacklow R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3527-3534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by CMP-NeuAc synthetase (and homologous enzymes) is unique in that sialic acid is directly coupled to a cytosine monophosphate. All other activated sugar nucleotide synthetases use a phosphorylated sugar substrate and produce a sugar nucleotide diphosphate (16Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Given the expense of chemically synthesizing CMP-NeuAc and its instability, CMP-NeuAc synthetase together with various sialyltransferases are valuable for the preparative enzymatic synthesis of biologically relevant, sialylated oligosaccharides (17Gilbert M. Bayer R. Cunningham A.M. DeFrees S. Gao Y. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In turn, these sialylated oligosaccharides are used in clinical medicine and are invaluable tools for the study of the many processes that require sialic acids. In this work, the refined x-ray crystallographic structures of selenomethionyl CMP-NeuAc synthetase and CMP-NeuAc synthetase in complex with the substrate analogue CDP (CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP) are reported. The active site and substrate binding sites for this class of enzyme are described in detail for the first time, and a comparison of the two structures indicates substrate binding is accompanied by significant conformational rearrangements within the active site. Recombinant CMP-NeuAc synthetase was overexpressed in E. coli and purified using published protocols (18Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Wakarchuk W. Biotech. Lett. 1997; 19: 417-420Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly we used a combination of anion-exchange on a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Selenomethionyl CMP-NeuAc synthetase was overexpressed in a methionine auxotroph of E. coli (WA-834) grown in a defined medium containing 40 mg liter−1 selenomethionine (19Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and purified using the same protocol. All protein samples were purified to homogeneity and were of the expected molecular mass as judged by mass spectrometry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All crystals used in this work were grown by vapor diffusion using hanging drops consisting of 3 μl of protein stock (5.0 mg ml−1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and 3 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of CMP-NeuAc synthetase and CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP were both grown over reservoir solutions composed of 16% polyethylene glycol 2000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The CMP-NeuAc synthetase crystals grow in 2–3 days, are orthorhombic (space group, P212121; unit cell, a = 42.99, b = 59.52, c = 157.56 Å; α = β = γ = 90°), and a 2.0-Å resolution data set has been collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the Biology Department single-crystal diffraction facility at beamline X8-C in the National Synchrotron Light Source. Orthorhombic crystals of CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP were grown in the presence of 10 mm CDP (unit cell, a = 43.01, b = 69.89, c = 157.78 Å; α = β = γ = 90°), appeared after 7 days, and diffracted to 2.2 Å on a local Rigaku RU200 rotating anode (50 kV, 100 mA) equipped with OSMIC mirrors. All CMP-NeuAc synthetase crystals in this work were rod-shaped and the largest crystals grew to ∼0.80 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm in size. All intensity data sets were collected at 100 K after flash-freezing in mother liquor containing 22% glycerol. Intensity data collection and processing statistics for each data set used in this work are summarized in TableI.Table ISummary of data collection and MAD phasing statistics for CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP and CMP-NeuAc synthetaseCMP-NeuAc synthetaseSelenomethionyl CMP-NeuAc synthetase1-aData were collected at the NSLS DataCol'99 Workshop on rapid structure determination techniques (April 17–22, Brookhaven, NY).

The initial phase estimates were improved by density modification using DM (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar) prior to calculation of a 2.0-Å MAD phased electron density map. The initial electron density map is easily interpretable and an initial trace of the CMP-NeuAc synthetase main chain was generated within XTALVIEW (23McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). The CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP structure was determined by molecular replacement using the CMP-NeuAc synthetase model and the program AMORE (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) were utilized to examine the molecular surface of the models and to examine the local environment of specific residues. XTALVIEW was used for various least-squares superpositions and DOCKVISION (29Hart T.N. Ness S.R. Read R.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. Suppl. 1997; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for the NeuAc modeling. Docking made use of an energy-minimized acylneuraminate structure derived from Protein Data Bank accession code 1WIA and the refined CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP model. The starting NeuAc model was used to generate all common NeuAc conformations, and all conformations were docked (10,000–50,000 trials) against a static CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP model using either an energy term or conformational energy terms as a scoring function. The best docking results were obtained using CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP and CDP conformation I. The figures were prepared using GRASP (28Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) and MOLSCRIPT (30Kraulis P.K. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The overall fold of the CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP homodimer is presented in Fig. 2. The CMP-NeuAc synthetase monomer is composed of an ∼190 residue, globular α/β domain (∼50 × 50 × 40 Å) that is structurally classified as an αβα, three-layered sandwich (31Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a small 35-residue domain that is directed away from the rest of the monomer and forms an extended dimerization interface. The dimerization domains of each monomer wrap around one another in a tight interaction and make contacts with the globular α/β domain of the opposite monomer. The resulting functional homodimer is highly asymmetric with dimensions of ∼85 × 45 × 40 Å. A twisted, central β-sheet forms the hydrophobic core of the α/β domain of the monomer and is flanked by helices giving rise to the αβα, three-layered sandwich structure. The β-sheet contains six parallel β strands (β1, β4, β5, β6, β7, β11) and a single antiparallel β strand (β10) connected with a −1x, −1x, +3x, +2x, −1x, +2x topology (32Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Principles and Patterns of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The connectivity of consecutive parallel β strands is right-handed except for a relatively rare left-handed linkage between strand β6 and strand β7. Alignments of known CMP-NeuAc synthetase sequences (33Tullius M.V. Vann W.F. Gibson B.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) indicate that residues between strands β6 and β7 (102) are among the most highly conserved in the comparison (Fig. 3). Three α helices (B, C, F) pack against and bury the face of the central β-sheet furthest from the dimerization interface. The remaining face of the β-sheet is covered by two α helices (E, H) and contacts with the dimerization domain of the opposite monomer. The 310 helix A, a short β ribbon (β2, β3), 310 helix D, and α helix I are all located on the C-terminal side of the mostly parallel, central β-sheet. These secondary structures and their associated loops form a deep pocket at the C-terminal ends of the β-sheet that is the mononucleotide-binding pocket. The presence of a substrate-binding pocket at the C-terminal ends of predominantly parallel β-sheets is a recurring theme in structural biology (34Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Ringe D. Kozarich J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 372-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain contains a 310 helix (helix G) and a β ribbon (strand β8 and strand β9) that is continuous with the central β-sheet of the opposite monomer. The dimerization domain is located between strands β7 and β10 and is directed away from the rest of the α/β domain by a β-bulge at position 175 of strand β10. In the homodimer, a β-bulge in strand β10 facilitates an antiparallel hydrogen-bonding network between the N terminus of strand β10 and strand β8 of the opposite monomer. The dimerization interface buries a large surface area despite its modest size. Using a probe radius of 1.4 Å, a single monomer buries ∼1450 Å2in the dimer (35Schwabe C. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A search of representative structures in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (36Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) indicates the CMP-NeuAc synthetase overall fold has only limited homology with other known folds in the Protein Data Bank. In general, enzymes containing a mononucleotide-binding (Rossman) fold (37Schulz G.E. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resemble the N-terminal 100 residues of the α/β domain, up to but not encompassing the left-handed linkage between strands β6 and β7. The similarities between the N terminus of CMP-NeuAc synthetase and Rossman fold containing proteins are restricted to the order and connectivity of secondary structures, because CMP-NeuAc synthetase and related enzymes have unique mononucleotide-binding pockets. The CMP-NeuAc synthetase α/β domain fold is similar to that reported for cytosine-5′-monophosphate-2-keto-3-deoxy-manno-octonate synthetase (CMPKDOS (38Jelakovic S. Jann K. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)), a homologous, dimeric enzyme that synthesizes a related, activated sugar compound, cytosine-5′-monophosphate 2-keto-3-deoxy-manno-octonate (CMP-KDO). These two enzymes are similar in length but share limited amino acid sequence identity (18%, Fig. 3), and the fold of the CMPKDOS dimerization domain is significantly different from the equivalent structure in this work. In the CMPKDOS monomer, the dimerization domain is globular and compact and does not make contacts with the α/β domain of the opposite monomer. Despite the differences in the dimerization interface, both enzymes share a highly asymmetric overall shape. Because the CMPKDOS coordinates are yet to be released and were not made available to us, we cannot present a detailed comparison of the CMP-NeuAc synthetase and CMPKDOS overall folds. The two monomers of CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP in the asymmetric unit have nearly identical main-chain conformations. The monomers superpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.60 Å when considering all common main-chain atoms (888 of 912 atoms). Similarly, there are no large-scale conformational differences in a comparison of the CMP-NeuAc synthetase- and CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP-refined models and the two homodimers superpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.71 Å for 1728 equivalent main-chain atoms (Fig. 4). The most prominent differences in a comparison of the two refined models occur in the mononucleotide-binding pocket. In the unliganded CMP-NeuAc synthetase structure, the P-loop (residues 10–22) and residues following strand β5 (71) have relatively weak electron density or are fully disordered in the refined maps. In the CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP structure, the equivalent residues make specific contacts with the bound substrate analogue (TableIII and see Fig. 6) either directly or through ordered solvent molecules, and have well ordered electron density in the refined maps. The average main-chain temperature factors for residues 10–22 and 71–80 of CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP and CMP-NeuAc synthetase are 33.1 Å2 (184 atoms) and 50.3 Å2 (128 atoms), respectively. In CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP, the P-loop primarily interacts with the ribose and phosphate moieties of the substrate analogue, whereas residues 71–80 are responsible for base recognition. At the same time, these residues make relatively few specific contacts with the remainder of the enzyme. Apparently, CDP itself provides specific contacts that allow these residues to fold about the mononucleotide substrate analogue and become relatively ordered. Consequently, we propose mononucleotide binding is accompanied by a conformational rearrangement that orders both the P-loop and residues 71–80. This model of substrate binding can account for the observed differences in the refined electron density of the two structures and the observed depth of the mononucleotide-binding pocket. It also explains the ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism (CTP binds first and CMP-NeuAc dissociates last) observed in the homologous enzyme fromH. ducreyi (39Samuels N.M. Gibson B.W. Miller S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6195-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The P-loop and residues 71–80 contain 7 of the 13 invariant residues in an alignment of known bacterial CMP-NeuAc synthetase enzymes (Fig. 3). In agreement with this work, amino acid sequence analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical modification studies indicate residues 10–22 (phosphate binding loop or P-loop) following strand β1 are integral components of the mononucleotide-binding pocket (33Tullius M.V. Vann W.F. Gibson B.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Stoughton D.M. Zapata G. Picone R. Vann W.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 397-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in the CMPKDOS structure (38Jelakovic S. Jann K. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), residues of the P-loop were observed to bind a heavy atom derivative (IrCl 63−), and the authors speculated that these residues play a role in phosphate binding.Table IIIHydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts between CMP-NeuAc synthetase and CDPCDP conformation ICDP conformation IIÅÅHydrogen bondsO2Arg-71 Nη22.9Arg-71 Nη23.0Arg-12 N2.9Arg-12 N3.0N3Arg-71 Nη12.9Arg-71 Nη13.0N4Ala-80 O3.0Ala-80 O3.0Wat-943.0Wat-943.1O2′Asn-22 Nδ22.9Asn-22 Nδ23.2Wat-1603.1Wat-1602.8O3′Asn-22 Oδ12.6Asn-22 Oδ12.7O1ALys-21 Nζ3.3O3AArg-12 Nη13.3O1BLys-21 Nζ3.2O2BArg-12 Nη12.8Asp-211 Oδ12.9Asp-209 Oδ12.9O3BSer-15 Oη3.2Arg-12 Nη13.0Wat-1602.8Protein contactsBaseLeu-10 Cβ3.3Leu-10 Cβ3.3Ala-11 C2.9Ala-11 C2.9Arg-12 Cγ3.1Arg-12 Cγ3.2Leu-75 O3.9Leu-75 O3.8Ser-81 O3.9Ser-81 O4.0RiboseSer-82 Oγ13.7Ser-82 Oη3.7Gln-104 Oδ13.8Gln-104 Oδ13.8Pro-105 Cδ3.6Pro-105 Cδ3.6Thr-106 Oγ13.4Thr-106 Oγ13.4PhosphateAsp-211 Oδ13.8Ile-210 O3.6 Open table in a new tab Figure 6Observed and modeled contacts between CMP-NeuAc synthetase and CDP and CMP-NeuAc synthetase and NeuAc , respectively.

The large cleft at the C-terminal end of the central β-sheet is the mononucleotide-binding pocket. The cleft is formed by residues following strand β1 (P-loop), strand β5 (71), and strand β11 (208). Polar residues line the cleft and are responsible for binding the nucleotide substrate (Fig.6 and Table III). As shown in Fig.7, the substrate analogue, CDP, is bound in the mononucleotide-binding pocket in two distinct conformations. The cytosine base and ribose moiety are equivalent in the two conformations, whereas the α and β phosphoryl groups adopt different conformations (I, II) as a result of differences in the C4′-C5′-O5′-P1A and C5′-O5′- P1A-O3A torsion angles.Figure 7The refined 2F o −F c electron density associated with the bound CDP substrate analogue. The CDP-binding site of CMP-NeuAc synthetase-CDP is shown as a barrel and strand drawing while residues directly contacting the bound CDP and the two observed CDP conformations are indicated in ball-and-stick. The two diphosphate conformations of CDP are labeled I (green phosphorous atoms) and II (yellow phosphorous atoms). The biologically significant conformation of the α and β phosphoryl groups is conformation I (green phosphorous atoms). The refined 2F o −F c electron density for the bound CDP is contoured at 1.2 ς.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

A., Gilbert, D. J., Copeland, N. G., and MacDonald, C. C. (1999)Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 96, 6763–6768). Previously, we demonstrated the presence of two distinct forms of theM r 64,000 protein of the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF-64) in mouse male germ cells and in brain, a somaticM r 64,000 form and a variantM r 70,000 form. The variant form was specific to meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells. We localized the gene for the somatic CstF-64 to the X chromosome, which would be inactivated during male meiosis. This suggested that the variant CstF-64 was an autosomal homolog activated during that time. We have named the variant form “τ CstF-64,” and we describe here the cloning and characterization of the mouse τCstF-64 cDNA, which maps to chromosome 19. The mouse τCstF-64 protein fits the criteria of the variant CstF-64, including antibody reactivity, size, germ cell expression, and a common proteolytic digest pattern with τCstF-64 from testis. Features of mτCstF-64 that might allow it to promote the germ cell pattern of polyadenylation include a Pro → Ser substitution in the RNA-binding domain and significant changes in the region that interacts with CstF-77.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Recently, we noted that many mRNAs expressed in male germ cells lack AAUAAA, yet are efficiently polyadenylated (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 2J.-L. Redondo and C. C. MacDonald, unpublished work. 2J.-L. Redondo and C. C. MacDonald, unpublished work. To explain proper polyadenylation of mRNAs lacking AAUAAA signals in germ cells, we hypothesized the presence of a testis-specific variant of a known polyadenylation protein. In examining the expression of theM r 64,000 protein of CstF (CstF-64 (25Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)), we discovered a variant form of this protein in germ cells that is a candidate for this function (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CstF-64 interacts directly with another subunit of the complex, CstF-77 (26Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), linking it to CstF-50 to form the CstF trimer (25Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 372: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CstF-64 is the RNA-binding component of CstF that binds to U- or GU-rich elements downstream of the cleavage site during polyadenylation (28Weiss E.A. Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6647-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As such, CstF-64 is essential for polyadenylation (25Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), for cell viability (30Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and has been shown to interact with RNA polymerase II, coupling polyadenylation and transcription (31McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we showed that in mice the principalM r 64,000 form of CstF-64 is found in all somatic cells, and in premeiotic and postmeiotic (but not meiotic) germ cells (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This form of CstF-64 is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 3A7 (25Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A variant M r 70,000 form of CstF-64 is found in meiotic and postmeiotic cells in the testis and to a smaller extent in brain. We have named this form of CstF-64 “τ CstF-64.” In mice, τCstF-64 is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 6A9 (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The gene for CstF-64 has recently been renamed CSTF2 in human andCstf2 in mouse by authorities of The Genome Data base (32Talbot Jr., C.C. Cuticchia A.J. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 1.13.1-1.13.12Google Scholar, 33Blake J.A. Eppig J.T. Richardson J.E. Davisson M.T. Group T.M.G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and we will adhere to that nomenclature here.Cstf2 or CSTF2 mapped to the X chromosome in either mouse or human (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that inactivation of the X chromosome during male meiosis results in inactivation of the X-linked Cstf2 in mouse spermatocytes. This inactivation of the essential Cstf2 led us to hypothesize the requirement of an alternative CstF-64 protein in spermatocytes, which we proposed was encoded by an autosomal gene. We describe here the cloning and characterization of mτCstF-64, a cDNA that encodes τCstF-64 from mouse pachytene spermatocytes. The protein encoded by mτCstF-64 is similar to other isoforms of CstF-64 from several species and retains protein motifs such as the RNA binding, MEAR(A/G) repeats, and C-terminal domains. mτCstF-64 is capable of encoding a protein of about M r 70,000 that is recognized by the 6A9 monoclonal antibody. Partial protease digestion shows that peptide fragments from the protein encoded by mτCstF-64 are identical to those of the variant CstF-64 protein obtained from mouse testis. We also show that the RNA-binding domain of the protein encoded by mτCstF-64 is functional in vitro.Finally, Cstf2t, the gene for mτCstF-64 maps to an autosome, chromosome 19 in mouse. These data suggest that mτCstF-64 encodes the variant form of CstF-64 seen in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells. Full-length cDNA encoding human CstF-64 (34Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was cloned in frame into the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 3′ end truncations were made by limited enzymatic digestion of the above construct to obtain versions that terminated at amino acids 531, 425, and 325. A fourth construct was made by introducing a 290-bp BamHI fragment of CstF-64 encoding amino acids 316–412 into pGEX2T. Constructs were introduced intoEscherichia coli DH5α cells by transformation, grown to mid-logarithmic phase, and induced for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Bacterial extracts were prepared in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by sonication and boiling and prepared for immunoblotting with either the 3A7 or 6A9 monoclonal antibody as described previously (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An adult mouse pachytene spermatocyte cDNA library in Uni-Zap XR vector (35McCarrey J.R. O'Brien D.A. Skinner M.K. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar) was screened using the 290-bp BamHI cDNA fragment of CstF-64 encoding amino acids 316–412. Filters were denatured in 0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl, neutralized in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 m NaCl, and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe in hybridization solution (10× SSC, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% Na4P2O7, 0.5% SDS, 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) overnight at 65 °C. Filters were washed at a final stringency of 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Positive plaques were purified by two additional rounds of screening. Plasmid rescue into pBluescript SK-was according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Of two million plaques screened initially, 24 hybridized to the probe, all of which represented the same mRNA transcript (see “Results”). The longest clone (3612 bp) was designated mτCstF-64 and was sequenced by a combination of primer walking and subcloning, using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were aligned and grouped into contigs using the SeqMan analysis program (DNAStar). Polypeptides corresponding to human (hCstF-64 (34Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc.

Reprod., in press.Google Scholar)), and the mouse τCstF-64 (mτCstF-64) cDNAs were prepared in vitro using the T3 TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). Products from the transcription/translation reactions were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either the 3A7 or 6A9 monoclonal antibody (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V.

Radiolabeled proteins corresponding to mCstF-64 and mτCstF-64 were made in vitro using the T3 TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Translated products were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to full-length mτCstF-64 protein was excised and eluted overnight at 4 °C in Cleveland buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 1% glycerol, 0.0001% bromphenol blue (34Takagaki Y.

Radiolabeled τCstF-64 was made in vivo by incorporation of [35S]methionine during short term culture of mouse seminiferous tubules. Testes from 8 CD-1 mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) were decapsulated and washed several times in cold PBS to remove interstitial cells. Tubules were then washed in prewarmed DMEM lacking methionine (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc) followed by incubation in DMEM containing 10 mm methionine, 2 mmglutamine, and 1.25 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN) for 7 h at 32 °C (38O'Brien D.A. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 37: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following incubation, tubules were washed in DMEM, resuspended in RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and sonicated on ice. After preclearing, samples were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C using the 6A9 monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads as described (29MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6647-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, beads were washed in RIPA, boiled in Laemmli buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and digested with 0.1 or 1.0 μg of V8 protease (Sigma) in the presence of 5 μg of bovine IgG protein (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at 37 °C (34Takagaki Y.

The image was captured on x-ray film exposed in the presence of an intensifying screen at −80 °C for the times indicated in Fig. 3. Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus) F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J.

Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the Cstf2tlocus. DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot analysis were performed as described (41Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe, a 514-bp DraI/XhoI fragment of mτCstF-64 from the 3′-UTR, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a nick translation primed labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); washing was done to a final stringency of 0.8× SSCP (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium citrate, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. A fragment of 0.5 kb was detected inTaqI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and a fragment of 1.8 kb was detected in TaqI-digested M. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the 1.8-kb TaqI M. spretus-specific fragment was followed in backcross mice.

Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager, version 2.6.5 (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. RNA-binding domains (RBDs) from human (hRBD) and mouse CstF-64 (mRBD) and mouse τCstF-64 (mτRBD) were prepared as fusion polypeptides with N-terminal hexahistidine tags. Construction of the plasmid hRBD (formerly known as rHis64Δ247) was described previously (34Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding domains of mCstF-64 (nucleotides 53–897) and mτCstF-64 (nucleotides 77–598) were cloned in frame with the hexahistidine tag of the pQE9 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to make mRBD and mτRBD, respectively. hRBD, mRBD, and mτRBD plasmid DNAs were transformed into UltraMAXDH5α-FT cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), grown to mid-logarithmic phase, and induced at 37 °C for 3 h by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to 1.5 mm. His-tagged recombinant proteins were isolated as described (34Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant proteins were quantified by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards after staining of 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. 0.3 μg each of hRBD, mRBD, mτRBD, or bovine IgG (Bio-Rad) was mixed with 32P-labeled SVL substrate (3 × 104 cpm (45Wilusz J.

Reaction mixtures were exposed to 107μJ/cm2 of ultraviolet light in a CL-1000 Ultraviolet Cross-linker (Ultraviolet Products, Upland, CA). Control reactions were processed without exposure to UV. Reaction mixtures were incubated with 10 units of RNaseONE (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 15 min. SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and RNA-cross-linked polypeptides separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE.

Epitopes for the Monoclonal Antibodies 3A7 and 6A9 Map to Two Distinct Regions of CstF-64 cDNA—The monoclonal antibodies 3A7 and 6A9, obtained by using human CstF purified from HeLa cells, can distinguish the somatic (3A7) and variant (6A9) forms of CstF-64 in mice (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In human, however, both antibodies recognize the somatic form of CstF-64 ((25) see Fig. 2). Therefore, to map the recognition sites of each antibody, polypeptides corresponding to different regions of human CstF-64 were expressed as fusions to glutathione S-transferase in bacteria and immunoblotted with either the 3A7 or 6A9 antibody (data not shown, summarized in Figs.1 and 6).Figure 1Comparison of mτCstF-64 protein sequence to known CstF-64 homologs.

Similarly, the region of interaction for the 6A9 antibody lie on a BamHI fragment between amino acids 316 and 412 (333–427 in Fig. 1). Since τCstF-64 was recognized by the 6A9 antibody but not the 3A7 antibody (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.

An adult mouse pachytene spermatocyte library was the kind gift of John McCarrey (Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX (35McCarrey J.R. O'Brien D.A. Skinner M.K. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar)). Our previous results suggested that cells during this period of spermatogenesis expressed τCstF-64 exclusively of the somatic CstF-64 (24Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two million plaques were screened using the 290-bp BamHI cDNA fragment of human CstF-64 that was described above (see Fig. 1). Twenty four positive clones were identified and rescued into pBluescript SK−. Each of these plasmids represented nearly identical transcripts that differed in length at the 5′ ends. None of the cDNAs represented the mouse somatic CstF-64 (data not shown, see Ref. 36Dass, B., Attaya, E. N., Wallace, A. M., and MacDonald, C. C. (2001) Biol. Reprod., in press.Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the longest insert was designated mτCstF-64 (GenBankTMaccession number AF322194) and was chosen for further characterization. Sequence analysis of mτCstF-64 revealed a cDNA of 3596 bp size and 16 bp of 3′ poly(A). A single open reading frame of 1890 bp was deduced that encoded a 630-amino acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 65,893.8 Da and an isoelectric point of 7.10 (Fig.1). The putative translation initiation codon ATG at nucleotide 77 is in good translational consensus (46Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 47Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The mτCstF-64 cDNA had 76 bp of 5′-UTR and 1640 bp of 3′-UTR. There is a canonical polyadenylation sequence AATAAA at nucleotides 3576–3581. The protein encoded by the mτCstF-64 cDNA is similar to other known forms of CstF-64 and is 69.8 and 71.6% identical, respectively, to the mouse and human somatic forms of CstF-64 (Fig. 1, Band C).

Chorionic gonadotropin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone consisting of α and β subunits. Regulation of the α subunit gene within the placenta requires an array of cis elements within the 5′-flanking region of the promoter. Within this array of elements, the junctional regulatory element (JRE) putatively binds a placental-specific transcription factor. The aim of our studies was to determine the identity and role of the transcriptional regulator that binds to the JRE in choriocarcinoma cells (JEG3 cells). Mutations within the JRE resulted in reduction in basal expression of an α subunit reporter gene, suggesting that the JRE binding factor was necessary for full basal activity. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we determined that the JRE was capable of serving as a homeobox factor-binding site. The homeobox factor, Distal-less 3 (Dlx 3) was found to be expressed in JEG3 cells and in the trophoblast layer of human chorionic villus but not in a gonadotrope cell line that also expresses the α subunit gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that recombinant Dlx 3 could bind specifically to the JRE and endogenous Dlx 3 was present in JRE/JEG3 nuclear protein complexes. Overexpression of Dlx 3 resulted in activation of an α subunit reporter gene. A JRE mutation resulted in attenuated activation of the α subunit reporter via an adjacent cis element, suggesting that JRE/Dlx 3 interactions may facilitate regulation of the α subunit gene at sites immediately upstream of the JRE. Our studies support the conclusion that Dlx 3 is a placental-specific transcriptional regulator that binds to the JRE and contributes to expression of the α subunit gene in cells of trophoblast origin.

Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Within the glycoprotein hormone family, the α subunit is a common component of all members, and it is the β subunit of these hormones that confers biological specificity to the heterodimer. Glycoprotein hormones derived from the anterior pituitary gland include luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, produced by cells of the gonadotrope (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and thyrotrope lineages (thyroid-stimulating hormone). These peptide hormones play an integral role in the regulation of reproduction and metabolic homeostasis in mammals. In humans and nonhuman primates, an additional member of the glycoprotein hormone family is synthesized and secreted from the placenta. Human CG1 is produced and secreted by the cells of the trophoblast lineage during the first trimester of pregnancy and is necessary for the maintenance of progesterone secretion from the ovarian corpus luteum to ensure the establishment of an appropriate uterine environment and pregnancy (2Han V.K.M.

Furthermore, CG may play a paracrine role in the uterine endometrium to facilitate uterine receptivity to implantation in primates (6Fazleabas A.T. Donnelly K.M. Srinivasan S. Fortman J.D. Miller J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The expression of the α subunit gene is restricted to cells of pituitary and placental origin. The regulatory region of the α subunit gene is unique in that it confers cell-specific expression via a complex array of cis-acting elements and their cognate binding factors (7Nilson J.H. Bokar J.A.

Glenn D.J. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 455-484PubMed Google Scholar). In the gonadotrope of the anterior pituitary gland, expression of the human α subunit gene requires dual CREs that bind CREB family members, an element that binds a LIM-homeobox factor, and an SF-1 binding site, all of which contribute to cell-specific expression. Two additional elements, referred to as α basal elements 1 and 2, also contribute to pituitary-specific α subunit expression; however, the factors that bind these sites have not yet been identified (9Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An additional element within the murine α subunit promoter has also been identified as an Ets factor-binding site that contributes to inducible expression of the α subunit by phorbol esters and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (11Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these elements and the transcription factors that bind them represent a combinatorial code required for expression of the α subunit in the anterior pituitary gland. An overlapping but separate combinatorial code exists for expression of the α subunit in cells of placental trophoblast origin. The dual CREs, in conjunction with an upstream regulatory element, a junctional regulatory element, and a unique CCAAT box provide for trophoblast-specific expression (13Andersen B. Kennedy G.C.

Portions of the URE and JRE putatively bind cell-specific factors; however, the identity of these factors is not currently known (19Budworth P.R. Quinn P.G. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the dual CREs are a focal point for regulation via multiple signal transduction cascades including the protein kinase A and multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in choriocarcinoma cells (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, with the exception of the dual CREs, we know relatively little about the cell-specific factors that bind to and transactivate the α subunit gene in trophoblast cells. The aim of our studies was to determine the identity and role of the transcriptional regulator that binds to the JRE. Regulation of morphogenic changes and differentiation of cell lineages within many endocrine organs occurs in association with complex expression patterns of cell-specific transcriptional regulators including homeodomain-containing transcription factors. Two notable examples are the organogenesis of the anterior pituitary gland and the pancreas. Of the many transcription factors described in the ontogeny of pituitary gland development (21Watkins-Chow D.E. Camper S.A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 284-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the LIM homeobox factor Lhx3 (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) play key roles in early determination of pituitary cell lineages that give rise to multiple endocrine cell types. Furthermore, the homeobox factor Pdx 1 is necessary for differentiation of multiple cell lineages within the pancreas (24Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption of Lhx3 and Pdx 1 lead to developmental failure of the anterior pituitary gland and pancreas, respectively, underscoring the importance of these factors to organogenesis. Naturally occurring mutations in Pit 1 have generated important mouse models for pituitary dwarfism (26Andersen B. Pearse Jr., R.V. Sornson J.K. Lin S.C. Bartke A. Rosenfeld M.G. Dev.

Interestingly, these homeobox factors also contribute to cell-specific regulation of gene products that define the differentiated character of cell lineages within the developing endocrine organ. For example, Lhx3 and Lhx2 have been shown to regulate the α subunit gene in the anterior pituitary (29Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse Jr., R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Theill L.E. Karin M. Endocrinol. Rev. 1993; 14: 670-689PubMed Google Scholar, 32Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol.

Pdx 1 functions in the transactivation of the insulin gene (34Sanders M. German M.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The studies presented in this investigation of trophoblast-specific gene regulation are completely consistent with this model. It has been previously reported that the Distal-less class homeobox factor, Dlx 3, is necessary for normal placental development in a mouse knockout model (35Morasso M.I. Grinberg A. Robinson G. Sargent T.D. Mahon K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mouse knockout models are not sufficient to determine a role for Dlx factors in the cell-specific regulation of CG subunit genes since the mouse does not express a CG. Our studies demonstrate that Dlx 3 is localized to the trophoblast layer of human chorionic villus, and Dlx 3 binds to and transactivates the human α subunit gene via interaction at the JRE. JRE/Dlx 3 interactions contribute functionally to the combinatorial code necessary for placental-specific regulation of the α subunit gene. All plasmids were prepared by two cycles through cesium chloride using standard methodologies. The glycoprotein hormone α subunit reporter has been described previously (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this reporter was carried out using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The JRE mutation consisted of a four-nucleotide substitution (i.e. wild type 5′-TAATTACA-3′; the JRE mutation 5′-TGGCCACA-3′). This mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The Dlx 3 coding sequence was amplified using High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and orientation and fidelity were corroborated by DNA sequencing. A FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the 3′ end of the coding sequence immediately upstream of the TGA stop codon using the site direct mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Dlx 3 sequence was then excised by specific restriction endonuclease digestion (EcoRI-NotI) and cloned into the pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create the pCMV/Dlx 3 FLAG construct. DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm the Dlx 3 sequence. The human choriocarcinoma cell line, JEG3, was cultured in monolayers using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%). All culture media were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Before all studies, cell cultures were split to fresh medium, and sub-confluent cultures were used. All transient transfection studies were conducted using electroporation as described previously (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In transfection studies requiring agonist administration, cells were treated with forskolin (1 μm) and/or EGF (50 ng/ml) for 6 h before collection (18 h after electroporation). Forskolin was purchased from Sigma and resuspended at a stock concentration of 1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. Epidermal growth factor was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and resuspended at a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. After cell collection, lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles and clarified by centrifugation, and luciferase activity was determined as described (11Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A.

Luciferase activity was standardized by total protein amount, and all transfection studies were conducted in triplicate on at least three separate occasions with similar results. Data shown are reported as a mean (n = 3) ± S.E of the mean. The homeodomain for Lhx2 (coding sequence from lysine 147 through the carboxyl termini of the protein) was prepared as a polyhistidine fusion protein in bacteria as described (29Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lhx2 homeodomain was partially purified from bacterial lysates using a nickel chelate-agarose. Full-length Dlx 3 was prepared using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. A transcription and translation reticulocyte lysate kit was purchased from Promega and was used as per instructions. Subconfluent JEG3 cells were used for the preparation of nuclear extracts. Plates were placed on an ice bed, and cells were washed with ice-cold 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl (Hepes-buffered saline). Cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 15 min). Cells were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer and lysed by douncing, and nuclei were isolated using the sucrose cushion method as described previously (20Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nuclei were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm benzamadine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This buffer was referred to as binding buffer. Nuclear proteins were extracted by adding additional NaCl (in binding buffer) to a final concentration of 450 mm and incubating the extract for 30 min at 4 °C with constant rocking. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Nuclear extracts were separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C until later use. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted essentially as described (11Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Lhx2 homeodomain, recombinant Dlx 3, or binding activity from nuclear extracts was mixed with binding buffer, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and in some reactions, antiserum or competition oligonucleotides in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Reactions were maintained at room temperature for 20 to 30 min. JRE oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled JRE probe (∼10,000–20,000 cpm) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 20–30 min at room temperature. The binding reactions were resolved on native polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. All DNA binding studies were conducted at least twice with similar results. JEG3 or αT3–1 cell nuclear extracts were suspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, and 200 mm dithiothreitol). Protein samples were boiled for 5 min and chilled briefly on ice before loading on gels. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked with nonfat dried milk (5%) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Lhx2 antiserum was obtained from rabbits immunized with a purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion of the homeodomain region of Lhx2 as previously reported (37Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Lhx2 antibody was used at 1:15,000 in TBST, 5% nonfat dried milk. Rabbit anti-Dlx3 polyclonal antiserum was generated by Berkeley Antibody Company (Berkley, CA), against a 16-mer synthetic peptide containing amino acids 242 through 256 of the murine Dlx3 protein. Sequence comparison with other Dlx family members of several species showed homology in this area only between Dlx 3 orthologs. There is a very high amino acid conservation between the mouse Dlx 3 and human Dlx 3. There are only eight amino acid substitutions throughout the entire protein when comparing murine and human Dlx 3. IgG anti-Dlx3 antibodies were obtained by running the polyclonal antiserum through a protein A column, washing, and eluting with a change in pH and salt concentration as directed by Pierce (ImmunoPure IgG Purification Kit). The Dlx 3 antibody was used at 1:500 in TBST, 5% nonfat dried milk. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using reagents purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. JEG3 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and cultured overnight. The cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol and allowed to dry for ∼20 min. Human chorionic villi from placenta obtained at 8 weeks of gestation were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, infiltrated with 5–15% sucrose, placed in embedding medium, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (5–7 μm) were cut using a cryostat and transferred to charged glass slides as described (38Zhou Y. Fisher S.J. Janatpour M. Genbacev O. Dejana E. Wheelock M. Damsky C.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2139-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The slides were stored at −80 °C until use. For immunocytochemistry, slides and sections were allowed to dry for ∼20 min, then dehydrated using 70% ethanol for 10 min at room temperature. Slides and sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidase in a solution of 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was not necessary for slides of fixed JEG3 cells. Antigen retrieval for chorionic villus sections included boiling the sections in 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for ∼5 min. The sections were cooled for 20 min and then washed 3 times (5 min each) with deionized water. The sections were then treated with a trypsin solution (0.1% trypsin, 0.1% CaCl2, 20 mmTris (pH 7.8)) for 5 min at room temperature followed by washing in deionized water as described above. The sections were equilibrated in 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.5) for 5 min. The slides and sections were then incubated with serum-blocking solution (Histostain SP Kit, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 10 min at room temperature to eliminate nonspecific background staining. Rabbit-derived anti-Dlx3 in a dilution of 1:50 in PBS was used as a primary antibody. In chorionic villus sections, murine-derived pan-cytokeratin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a marker for cells of the trophoblast lineage. Normal rabbit serum (preimmune) was used as negative control. Incubation with primary antisera was carried out for 4 h at room temperature followed by washing with 0.01m PBS (pH 7.5) three times (2 min each). The samples were next incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 20 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS as described above. After exposure to secondary antibody, the samples were incubated with a strepavidin peroxidase conjugate for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS as described above. A chromogen solution was applied to the samples. The reaction was observed under a microscope and blocked with deionized water after 8 min. The regulatory regions of the human α subunit gene promoter necessary for expression in trophoblast cell models such as choriocarcinoma cells are depicted in Fig. 1 A. The dual CREs play a central role in basal and cAMP-induced regulation of the α subunit promoter. However, the contribution of the dual CREs to basal expression of the α subunit also depends upon interaction among several other cis regulatory elements including the URE and the JRE (10Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Budworth P.R. Quinn P.G. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). Portions of the URE and the JRE putatively bind tissue-specific factors thought to be necessary for placental-specific gene activation (10Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Budworth P.R. Quinn P.G. Nilson J.H. Mol.

A four-nucleotide mutation was placed within the JRE and used in the context of an α subunit reporter in transient transfection studies in JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells. These studies revealed that the JRE was required for full basal expression of the α subunit reporter gene despite the presence of wild type dual CREs (Fig. 1 B). Examination of the nucleotide sequence of the JRE revealed marked similarity to the downstream half-site of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (Fig.2 A). The PGBE is an imperfect palindromic sequence required for basal and GnRH-induced activation of the human and murine α subunit genes in the anterior pituitary gland (10Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol.

The PGBE is a binding site for a LIM class of homeobox factor, where Lhx3 and Lhx2 have been shown to bind and induce transcriptional activation (29Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse Jr., R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Based upon this similarity, we speculated that the JRE could serve as a homeobox-binding site. To test this hypothesis, EMSA was performed using a radiolabeled JRE oligonucleotide and the Lhx2 homeodomain (recombinant DNA binding domain) prepared and partially purified from a bacterial expression system (Fig. 2 B; Ref. 29Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonradioactive competitor oligonucleotides were added to some reactions at a 200-fold molar excess. Competitors included wild-type JRE, a JRE probe containing a four-nucleotide substitution mutation that disrupts basal expression of the α subunit reporter (Fig. 1 B) or the PGBE. Competition studies revealed that Lhx2 homeodomain binding to the JRE was specific since the wild type JRE and PGBE oligonucleotides successfully competed for binding, whereas the mutant JRE was ineffective. The JRE-Lhx2 homeodomain complex was confirmed using an Lhx2-specific antibody (37Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that resulted in the formation of a “supershift” (Fig.2 B). These studies provide direct evidence that the JRE can serve as a homeobox-binding site in vitro. We characterized the JRE binding activity in JEG3 cells by EMSA. Nuclear extracts were prepared from JEG3 cells and used in DNA binding reactions containing the radiolabeled JRE binding site. Again, competition studies were used to determine the specificity of binding as described above. EMSA revealed that JRE binding with JEG3 cell nuclear extracts resulted in the formation of two"

Truncation of the 56-amino acid cytoplasmic tail demonstrates that the cytoplasmic tail of rat Ntcp is involved membrane delivery of this protein in nonpolarized and polarized cells and removal of the tail does not affect the bile acid transport function of Ntcp. Using site-directed mutagenesis, two tyrosine residues, Tyr-321 and Tyr-307, in the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp have been identified as important for the basolateral sorting of rat Ntcp in transfected MDCK cells. Tyr-321 appears to be the major basolateral-sorting determinant, and Tyr-307 acts as a supporting determinant to ensure delivery of the transporter to the basolateral surface, especially at high levels of protein expression. When the two Tyr-based basolateral sorting motifs have been removed, the N-linked carbohydrate groups direct the tyrosine to alanine mutants to the apical surface of transfected MDCK cells. The major basolateral sorting determinant Tyr-321 is within a novel β-turn unfavorable tetrapeptide Y321KAA, which has not been found in any naturally occurring basolateral sorting motifs. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of a 24-mer peptide corresponding to the sequence from Tyr-307 to Thr-330 on the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp confirms that both the Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 regions do not adopt any turn structure. Since the major motif YKAA contains a β-turn unfavorable structure, the Ntcp basolateral sorting may not be related to the clathrin-adaptor complex pathway, as is the case for many basolateral proteins.

This bile acid transporter is only expressed in differentiated mammalian hepatocytes in a developmentally regulated pattern (4Boyer J.L. Hagenbuch B. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is a glycoprotein with a seven-transmembrane structure that is similar to the protein superfamily of rhodopsin and the G protein-linked receptors (5Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H.

Rat Ntcp contains two N-linked carbohydrate sites at amino terminus and two potential Tyr-based sorting motifs at its carboxyl terminus (Y307-E-K-I and Y321-K-A-A) (5Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These potential Tyr-based sorting motifs are conserved in the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp from other species, such as the human and mouse. However, the mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific basolateral membrane sorting of the bile acid transporter are unknown. Hagenbuch and Meier (7Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 368AAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have identified a short mouse liver Na+-dependent bile acid cotransporter (Ntcp2) in which the last 45 amino acid residues were missing compared with wild type (WT) Ntcp. Ntcp2 is presumed to be the result of alternative splicing. This potential alternative splicing structure (sites) on the genomic DNA was also found in Ntcp genes from rat and human liver. The physiological function of this tailless Ntcp isoform, Ntcp2, is unknown. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that removing of the 56-amino acid cytoplasmic tail from rat Ntcp resulted in accumulation of the truncated form intracellularly and loss of the fidelity of basolateral membrane sorting in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were performed to understand the potential function of the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp and to determine the basolateral sorting mechanisms for this transporter. Green fluorescent protein-fused wild type Ntcp and mutant rat Ntcps were constructed, and the function and cellular localization were assessed in transfected COS 7 and MDCK cells. The results from transport kinetics and substrate analog inhibition studies demonstrated that removal of the entire cytoplasmic tail from Ntcp did not change its bile acid transport function. Confocal microscopy and polarized taurocholate transport studies showed that, in contrast to WT Ntcp, most of the truncated Ntcp protein accumulated intracellularly in transfected COS 7 cells. Replacement of the Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 residues with alanines in the potential Tyr-based sorting motifs of cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp redirected the tyrosine to alanine (Y/A) mutant transporters to the apical domain of transfected MDCK cells. However, this apical surface localization of the Y/A mutant could be abolished by tunicamycin treatment. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of a 24-mer peptide corresponding to the sequence from Tyr-307 to Thr-330 on the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp confirms that both Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 regions do not adopt any turn structure. The above results suggest that 1) the 56-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of rat Ntcp is important for plasma membrane delivery, 2) both Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 residues mediated the specific basolateral surface sorting, 3) both Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 regions do not adopt any turn structure, and 4) N-linked carbohydrate groups can act as a apical sorting signal to direct the Y/A mutant transporter to the apical surface. Removal of the 56-amino acid cytoplasmic tail from rat hepatic Ntcp was done by using a PCR-based strategy to modify rat Ntcp coding sequence as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were carried out using a PTC-100TM Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). Chimeric molecules that fuse the mutant or wild type rat Ntcp to GFP were made using similar PCR-based strategies. The full-length cDNA coding sequences of wild type or mutant rat Ntcp were used as templates. The PCR-generated mutant and wild type rat Ntcp cDNA products were subcloned into a green fluorescent protein vector, pEGFPN2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), using standard techniques. These chimeras were made using a forward primer 5′-CGAAGCTTATGGAGGTGCACAACGTATCAGCC-3′, which was designed to anneal to 5′-end coding sequence of rat Ntcp cDNA with anHindIII restriction site (bold type), and a reverse primer 5′- CCGGATCCCATTTGCCATCTGACCAGAATTCAGGCCATTAGGGG -3′, containing codons that anneal to sequences 3′ end region of rat Ntcp cDNA with a BamHI restriction site (bold type). For cytoplasmic tail truncated Ntcp, the same forward primer was used, whereas a reverse primer 5′-GGTGGATCCCGCACCGGAAGATAATGATGATGAG-3′, which contained codons that anneal to the sequence A296 to C306region of rat Ntcp cDNA with a BamHI restriction site (bolded) was used. These restriction sites were compatible with the pEGFP N2 polylinker. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested at sites incorporated at the ends of PCR products, and ligated directly to pEGFP N2 digested with the same restriction enzymes to produce chimeras. All plasmid constructs were checked for correct orientation by restriction digestion analysis. The positive clones containing the wild type or mutant cDNA inserts were verified by DNA cycle sequencing using a Perkin Elmer, GeneAmp 9600, ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer at the DNA Core Facility, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. These positive clones were used for further study. The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to convert codons for Tyr-307 and Tyr-321 to alanine residues according to manufacturer's directions with minor modification. The GFP-fused Ntcp chimera was used as template. A Y307A substitution was made using a forward primer 5′-C1030TTCCGGTGCGCCGAGAAAATCAAGCCTCC1059-3′, which annealed to the coding sequence in the Tyr-307 region, and a compatible reverse primer, in place of the codon for Tyr-307 was converted to alanine residue (underlined). A Y321A substitution was made using a forward primer 5′-G1063GACCAAACAAAAATTACCGCCAAAGCTGCTGCAACTG1100-3′, which annealed to the coding sequence in the Tyr-321 region, and a compatible reverse primer, in place of the codon for Tyr-321 was converted to alanine residue (underlined). The constructs of Y307A and Y321A double substitutions were made using a Y307A mutated construct as template and using the same primer for Y321A substitution. COS 7 (SV40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast) cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10‥ (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. COS 7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing wild type or mutant rat Ntcp cDNA using LipofectinTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested 24–48 h later for bile acid transport and confocal microscopy analysis. All MDCK II cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5‥ CO2 atmosphere in complete minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) that was supplemented with 10‥ (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. MDCK II cells were stably transfected with plasmids containing wild type or mutant rat Ntcp cDNAs using LipofectinTM reagent as described by the manufacture. Transfected cells were grown 10–15 days in media containing G418 (Geneticin (0.9 mg/ml), Life Technologies, Inc.). Thereafter, stably transfected colonies were selected. For polarity studies, monolayers of polarized MDCK epithelial cells were produced as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on Transwell filter inserts (0.4-μm pore size, PET track-etched membrane; Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of ∼1.5 × 105cells/6.4-mm filter. Experiments were conducted 4–6 days after seeding. To enhance the gene expression, the stably transfected MDCK cells were preincubated in 10 mm Na+-butyrate for 15 h at 37 °C. Northern blot hybridization was done according to standard technique. Total RNA was extracted from transfected COS 7 or MDCK cells and purified by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNAs (10 μg/lane) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1‥ agarose gel (containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, 40 mm MOPS, 10 mmNa+-acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), and blotted onto a GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization was carried out in 50‥ formamide buffer at 42 °C overnight with 32P-labeled full-length cDNA probe (1 × 107 cpm) encoding Ntcp protein, and detected by autoradiography. Total proteins extracted from transfected cells were separated by 10‥ SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The Western blotting for wild type and cytoplasmic tail truncated rat Ntcp was carried out as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-fused chimeric proteins were detected using a rabbit GFP polyclonal antibody (IgG fraction, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000. Horseradish peroxidase activity was visualized by enzyme chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS cell plasma membrane fractions were purified and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (13van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The wild type and truncated Ntcp proteins were detected by Westen blotting. The quantitation of the protein intensity was carried out by using Metamorph software (University Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Na+-dependent taurocholate (TC) influx and polarized transport analysis were performed as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for wild type and cytoplasmic tail truncated rat Ntcp was carried out as described previously (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S.

Confocal microscopy of GFP-fused chimeras was performed on a confluent monolayer of transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips. Glass coverslip-grown cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 7 min in 100‥ methanol at −20 °C, and rinsed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then mounted with Aquamount (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, United Kingdom). Fluorescence were examined with a Leica TCS-SP (UV) 4-channel confocal laser scanning microscope in the Imaging Core Facility Microscopy Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The 488-nm wavelength line of an argon laser and the 568-nm wavelength line of a krypton laser were used. The cell monolayer was optically sectioned every 0.5 μm. Image resolution using a Leica 63× and/or 100× Neofluor objective and Leica TCS-SP software was 512 × 512 pixels. All NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer. The NMR sample of the Ntcp peptide of 10 mm was prepared in a 100 mmphosphate buffer of pH 6.5 in 90‥ H2O, 5‥2H2O, and 5‥ Me2SO-d6. The two-dimensional1H/15N and 1H/13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired using the nonisotope-enriched peptide with 96 and 1024 complex points in ω1 and ω2, respectively. The NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the NMRPipe (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and NMRView (15Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar) programs. A 24-mer peptide, YEKIKPPKDQTKITYKAAATEDAT, corresponding to the sequence from Tyr-307 to Thr-330 on the cytoplasmic tail of rat Ntcp, was synthesized by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The crude peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a YMC C-18 column. The peak fractions were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and analytical HPLC. Treatment of tunicamycin that abolishes the glycosylation of viral glycoproteins was performed as described previously (16Marzolo M.P. Bull P. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MDCK cells stably transfected with Tyr-321 and Tyr-307 both mutated rat Ntcp (YYAA) cDNA were incubated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 15 h and followed by 12 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, bile acid transport and fluorescence confocal microscopy analyses were utilized to verify the cell surface distribution of the mutant transporters. Inhibition of Ntcp glycosylation by tunicamycin treatment was confirmed by Western blotting. Most of the results were expressed as mean value ± S.E. and examined by Student's t test. Results of different groups or categories were compared using the unpaired t test. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that removal of the 56-amino acid cytoplasmic tail from rat Ntcp resulted in a truncated protein that largely accumulated intracellularly in transfected MDCK cells (12Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a tailless Ntcp isoform, Ntcp2, has been isolated from mouse liver, but the function and cellular localization of this protein has not been defined (7Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 368AAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp (Fig. 1 A) may contain membrane sorting information and may be of functional importance. To understand further the possible functional role of the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp, which would be relevant to a potential physiologic role for Ntcp2, the transport properties and cellular localization of a truncated mutant rat liver Ntcp were examined in transfected COS 7 cells. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from COS 7 cells transduced with plasmids containing cDNAs encoding for either the wild type or truncated Ntcp. Probing with a 32P-labeled Ntcp cDNA detected a single message of about 1.7 kilobase pairs in transfected COS 7 cells (data not shown). No hybridization was observed with total RNA from nontransfected COS 7 cells. mRNA from the truncated mutant (NL) was slightly smaller than that of the wild type Ntcp (data not shown). Bile acid transport studies showed that [3H]taurocholate influx was stimulated in both WT and truncated Ntcp cDNA-transfected COS 7 cells in the presence of a sodium but not a choline-containing buffer (Fig. 1 B). However, the truncated transporter (NL) had much lower transport activity compared with the wild type transporter (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested two possibilities: 1) the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp was essential for bile acid translocation across the membrane, or 2) the cytoplasmic tail provided a signal for plasma membrane localization. To address these questions, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was done on confluent monolayers of transfected COS 7 cells. When these cells were viewed enface, the WT Ntcp was predominantly located on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, in cells expressing the truncated Ntcp (NL), most of the protein accumulated intracellularly, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Immunoblotting of plasma membrane proteins isolated from transfected COS 7 cells confirmed that only ∼10‥ of the truncated Ntcp (NL) was sorted to the plasma membrane compared with wild type Ntcp (Fig. 1 D). To verify further the relationship between the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp and its importance to transport function, the kinetics of taurocholate uptake was analyzed in transfected COS 7 cells. In these cells, equilibrium for the transport process was achieved between 10 and 15 min at 37 °C. No significant uptake was observed in the presence of a sodium gradient at 0 °C or with a choline gradient at both 37° and 0 °C (data not shown). The kinetics of bile acid uptake by wild type and truncated rat Ntcp in transfected COS 7 cells were measured in primary cultures 72 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of a sodium gradient, [3H]taurocholate uptake increased with substrate concentration and exhibited saturable kinetics. WT Ntcp exhibited [3H]taurocholate uptake with an apparent Km of 30.4 ± 6.6 μmand a Vmax of 393.4 ± 47.0 pmol/mg of protein/min in transfected COS 7 cells. The transport process mediated by the truncated Ntcp showed a similar Km value of 43.8 ± 3.2 μm, but a markedly reducedVmax of 32.4 ± 3.9 pmol/mg/min. This value was only 10‥ of that observed with WT Ntcp. These results indicate that removal of the cytoplasmic tail does not significantly alter the substrate binding affinity of the transporter. However, the lowerVmax is likely related to a markedly reduced amount of the protein reaching the plasma membrane. To further characterize the importance of the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp to bile acid transport, studies were done to examine the effects of several bile acid analogues and organic anions on taurocholate transport by transfected COS 7 cells. The COS 7 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm unlabeled bile acids or other organic anion competitors. Taurocholate uptake in the absence of a competitor was set at 100‥ and all values measured relative to this level of activity. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the competitive inhibitors (cholate ∼ 45‥, taurodeoxycholate ∼ 30‥, taurochenodeoxycholate ∼ 25‥, and probenecid ∼ 100‥), and the noncompetitive inhibitor bromosulfophthalein (∼ 15‥) revealed similar effects on the initial rate of taurocholate uptake in COS 7 cells expressing either the wild type or truncated transporter. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail is not important for substrate binding specificity. Previous studies indicate that hepatic sodium taurocholate cotransport is stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) via protein kinase A (17Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were then done to compare the activation of transport activity by Bt2cAMP in COS 7 cells expressing either the wild type or truncated Ntcp. Bt2cAMP stimulated a significant increase (about 24‥, p < 0.05) in taurocholate uptake by transfected cells expressing wild type Ntcp (Fig. 4). In contrast, 100 μm Bt2cAMP did not stimulate taurocholate uptake in COS 7 cells expressing the truncated Ntcp. These results indicate that, as suggested previously, the cytoplasmic tail may be important for regulation of Ntcp membrane localization via protein kinase A stimulation. To determine the importance of two potential Tyr-based sorting motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of Ntcp, a series of mutations were created in these sequences which potentially represent signals for sorting to the basolateral membrane. Three mutants were made by converting Tyr-307 (Y307A-GFP), Tyr-321 (Y321A-GFP), and both Tyr-307 and Tyr-321 (YYAA-GFP) to alanines by site directed mutagenesis. These mutated transporters, as well as wild type Ntcp, were fused with green fluorescent protein at the amino terminus to follow the intracellular localization of these proteins in transfected COS 7 and MDCK II cell lines. Northern and Western blotting were used to verify the cellular expression of the GFP-fused proteins. First, the bile acid transport activity and cell surface expression of these chimeric proteins were examined in transfected COS 7 cells. Fig.5 shows that GFP-fused Ntcp is functionally similar to the wild type protein in its capacity for sodium-dependent transport. Similar to the truncated Ntcp (NL), the GFP-fused truncated Ntcp chimera (NL-GFP) had a markedly reduced initial transport rate (data not shown). However, all of the chimeras containing point mutations, Y307A-GFP, Y321A-GFP, and YYAA-GFP, demonstrated transport activity similar to the wild type Ntcp-GFP (Fig. 5). To confirm the steady state surface expression of the GFP-fused transporter chimeras, transfected COS 7 cells were cultured on glass coverslips and then examined by fluorescence confocal microscopy. When viewed enface, Ntcp-GFP and all of the three Y/A mutants were detected on the plasma membrane of transfected COS 7 cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, in cells expressing NL-GFP, fluorescence was predominantly localized to the cytosolic portion of the cell near the nucleus (Fig. 6). These studies confirm that, similar to wild type Ntcp, the GFP-fused Y/A mutants were targeted to the plasma membrane of transfected COS 7 cells.Figure 6Effects of Y/A mutation of potential Tyr-based signal motifs on membrane localization in transfected COS 7 cells. Transfected COS 7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 7 min. Selected images were analyzed for fluorescence distribution of COS 7 cells nontransfected (left top panel) and transfected with pEGFPN2 vector, Ntcp-GFP, cytoplasmic tail truncated Ntcp-GFP (NL-GFP) (right top panel), and Y/A mutated transporters (Y321A-GFP, YYAA-GFP, and Y307A-GFP, lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the transporters with point mutations of the possible tyrosine-based sorting signals were sorted to the basolateral domain, the Y/A mutant chimeras were stably expressed in MDCK II cells. Fluorescent images both enface and inx-z cross-section were then gathered using laser scanning confocal microscopy. To further confirm the localization of these proteins within this cell line, bile acid uptake was measured across the apical and basolateral membrane domains of stably transfected MDCK cells, which were grown to confluence on permeable Transwell filter inserts. When membrane localization of the Y307A-GFP mutant was examined by both fluorescence confocal microscopy and polarized bile acid uptake, the Y307A-GFP protein was predominantly localized to"
https://openalex.org/W2162997452,"Ligation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for full scale T cell activation. Despite extensive studies, the intracellular signaling pathways delivered by CD28 ligation are not fully understood. A particularly controversial matter is the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in CD28-mediated costimulation. It is known that the binding site for PI3K and Grb-2 lies nested within the YMNM motif of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. To elucidate the role of PI3K during CD28-mediated interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, CD28 YMNM point and deletion mutants were expressed in Jurkat cells. We then measured IL-2 promoter activation after CD28 ligation. Our results showed that the Y189F mutant, which disrupts binding by PI3K, and the YMNM deletion mutant both demonstrated reduced but significant activity for IL-2 promoter activation. In contrast, the N191A mutant, which retains PI3K binding ability, resulted in a complete abrogation of activity, suggesting that PI3K mediates a negative effect upon transcriptional activation of theIL-2 gene. Consistent with this idea, we found that the addition of a PI3K pharmacological inhibitor augmented IL-2 promoter activity, whereas coexpression of a constitutively active form of PI3K reduced this activity. Taken together, these data indicate that PI3K, when associated with the YMNM motif, may act as a negative mediator in CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription.

Among them, the CD28-mediated signal is considered to be one of the most important costimulatory signals. Costimulation delivered by CD28 is involved in T cell activation and subsequent expression of T cell functions such as cytokine production (1June C.H. Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B.

Although the importance of CD28 in T cell activation has been well documented, the intracellular signaling pathways required for CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells have yet to be clearly defined.

Chem. 1999; 274: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have been shown to be involved in CD28-mediated costimulatory signals. PI3K is a heterodimer, composed of a p85 adaptor subunit linked to a p110 catalytic subunit that phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively (11Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Ligation of CD28, either by its natural ligands (B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cell) or by monoclonal antibodies, triggers phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation of CD28 on Tyr189within the YMNM motif has been shown to provide a binding site for the SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (4Pagés F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A.

Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3392-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through its lipid products, PI3K is involved many cellular responses including proliferation, cell survival, adhesion, and actin rearrangement (12Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Since the T cell responses that are induced by CD28-mediated cosignaling overlap the reported functions of PI3K in lymphocyte activation, it is conceivable that PI3K may be the critical signaling molecule in T cell costimulation. For example, wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, is reported to inhibit CD28-dependent IL-2 production in human peripheral T cells (13Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Ueda Y. Levine B.L. Huang M.L. Freeman G.J. Nadler L.M. June C.H. Ward S.G. Int.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD28 mutants, which are unable to bind to PI3K, demonstrate that PI3K is required for CD28-mediated IL-2 production in mouse T cell hybridoma cell lines (4Pagés F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 16Cai Y.C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results concerning the requirement for PI3K in CD28-mediated costimulation have been reported. For instance, some investigators reported that wortmannin fails to block CD28-mediated costimulation of IL-2 production by Jurkat cells and murine CD4+ splenic T cells (14Ueda Y. Levine B.L.

Moreover, they showed that mutation of Tyr189 to Phe, which disrupts PI3K binding, had no effect on the ability of CD28 to deliver a costimulatory signal to Jurkat cells (17Truitt K.E. Shi J. Gibson S. Segal L.G. Mills G.B. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4702-4710PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, while the role of PI3K in CD28 costimulation has been extensively investigated, there is as yet no consensus about the role of PI3K for CD28 function. CD28-mediated costimulation is involved in regulation of various T cell functions such as proliferation, cytokine production, T cell survival, prevention of anergy, and expression of cell surface antigens. We postulate that binding of multiple intracellular signaling molecules to the CD28 receptor may selectively regulate multiple CD28-induced cellular functions. As a part of efforts to define the relationship between CD28-mediated intracellular signaling pathways and T cell functions, we constructed a panel of point and deletion mutants of CD28 including the critical PI3K binding motif, YMNM, and tested their costimulatory ability for activation of IL-2 gene transcription. Murine CD28 cDNA was generously gifted by K. Lee (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Murine CD28 cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant CD28 constructs were generated by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. CD28 wild-type and mutant constructs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA for BD110, an active form of PI3K, was described previously (25Kita Y. Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.55), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. For transient transfections, exponentially growing cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 2.8 × 107 cells/ml. 7 × 106 cells (0.25 ml) were combined 10 μg of effector construct and 5 μg of the IL-2-luciferase reporter gene in a 4-mm cuvette and electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 220 V and 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad). Stable transfectants were derived by electroporating 7 × 106 Jurkat cells with 20 μg of plasmid DNA at 220 V and 950 microfarads. After 24 h, the cells were subjected to Zeocin (Invitrogen) selection at 400 μg/ml. Zeocin-resistant cells were screened for expression of the relevant construct by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACScaliber; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) analysis with anti-mouse CD28 antibody. Cell surface expression of stably transfected cells was determined by incubating 106 cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD28 (PV-1 (21Abe R. Vandenberghe P. Craighead N. Smoot D.S. Lee K.P. June C.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 985-997PubMed Google Scholar)) at room temperature for 20 min. Data were collected and analyzed with a FACScaliber and Cell quest software (Becton Dickinson). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with effector and reporter constructs. After 24 h, cells were treated with PMA (5 ng/ml; LC Services Corp, Woburn, MA) and anti-mouse CD28 mAb PV-1 (5 μg/ml) or PMA and ionomycin (200 ng/ml; Sigma), with or without anti-CD28 antibody. In the PI3K inhibition experiments with LY294002, stimulation was performed with PMA and anti-CD28 mAb, in the presence of the indicated concentration of LY294002 (Sigma). After 18 h, cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After a brief centrifugation, 50 μl of the supernatant was used with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent. Luminescence was measured immediately with a Lumat LB9501 (Berthold, Bundoora, Australia). The cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEX 4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonphosphorylated GST-CD28 was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain (Novagen). Phosphorylated GST-CD28 was expressed E. coli TKB1 strain (Stratagene), a BL21(DE3) derivative strain that harbors a plasmid-encoded, inducible tyrosine kinase gene. Bacterial cultures were grown to log phase, induced by 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were lysed, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mmNaF). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in the presence of SDS sample buffer. The protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and immunoblotted with antiserum specific for the p85 subunit of PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-Grb-2 antibody (C-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The Jurkat cells expressing the mouse CD28 wild-type and mutant constructs were activated by incubating in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed in the lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads coated with anti-mouse CD28 mAb. The proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with antiserum specific for the p85 subunit of PI3K or anti-CD28 antibody (I-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In the CD28 cytoplasmic domain, four tyrosines that potentially bind to SH2 domains and two potential motifs (PXXP motif) that bind to SH3 domains exist (Fig.1). The YMNM motif, which exists in the CD28 cytoplasmic region, is known to associate with PI3K and Grb-2 (4Pagés F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D.

To determine which amino acid is critical for IL-2gene transcription, we generated various mutants of the mouseCD28 gene, and co-transfected them with the IL-2-luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat cells (Fig. 1). The transfectants were then activated by treating with phorbol ester, PMA, and anti-mouse CD28 antibody, and subsequently luciferase activity was measured to determine the IL-2 promoter activity. It has been shown that upon CD28 ligation, the tyrosine residue within the YMNM motif is phosphorylated and that this tyrosine phosphorylation makes YMNM motif available for the association of PI3K p85 subunit and Grb-2 through their SH2 domains. These associations have been proposed to be critical to trigger the CD28 signal transduction pathway for IL-2 production. As shown in Fig. 2, the Y189F mutant, which is mutated at Tyr189 to Phe in the YMNM motif, showed reduced ability to activate the IL-2 promoter. On the other hand, mutation of Asn191 to Ala (N191A) resulted in complete abrogation of activity. In contrast, the M192L mutant retained full activity (Fig. 2). Since it has been shown that PI3K binds to the YXXM motif and that Grb-2 binds to the YXNX motif (22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar), it is predicted that the N191A mutant would associate with only PI3K, and that the M192L mutant would selectively bind to Grb-2. In fact, anti-p85 immunoblotting of anti-CD28 immunoprecipitates showed that when cells expressing the mouse CD28 WT or N191 mutant were stimulated with anti-mouse CD28 antibody, p85 was found to associate with CD28, whereas stimulation of the Y189F or M192L mutants failed to recruit p85 (Fig.3 B). To examine the effect of mutation within the CD28 YMNM motif upon Grb-2 association, we generated a GST fusion protein of WT and each mutant of CD28, and tested their binding capability to Grb-2 in Jurkat lysates by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 D, strong associations of Grb-2 with WT-GST and M192L-GST protein were present in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, whereas only minimal associations with Y189F-GST and N191A-GST were detected with or without phosphorylation. This weak phosphorylation-independent association may be due to the binding of the PXXP motif, which is present downstream of YMNM motif, to the SH3 domain of Grb-2 (23Kim H.H. Tharayil M. Rudd C.E.

A, Jurkat cells were stably transfected with the mouse CD28 WT, Y189F-, N191A-, M192L-, and YMNMdel-mutant constructs and these transfectants were analyzed by flow cytometry with control antibody (dotted line) or anti-mouse CD28 antibody (solid line). B, PI3K immunoblot was performed on a series of mouse CD28 immunoprecipitations from Jurkat cells expressing the mouse CD28 WT, Y189F-, N91A-, M192L-, and YMNMdel-mutant. Cells were incubated with (+) or without (−) anti-CD28 antibody for 10 min before immunoprecipitation. Precipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-p85 antiserum (upper panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-CD28 antibody (lower panel).

Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 B, the N191A GST fusion protein, but neither the Y189F or M192L fusion proteins were co-precipitated with PI3K. Together with the association patterns of the mutant CD28 constructs with PI3K and Grb-2, our data suggested that Grb-2 binding to the YMNM motif might play an essential role for IL-2 gene transcription, whereas PI3K may have a different role. Most interestingly, the YMNM deletion mutant, which loses association to both PI3K and Grb-2, showed comparable activity to that of Y189F mutant (Fig. 2). The simplest interpretation of these results is that Grb-2 and PI3K have opposing functions onIL-2 gene transcription. In this scenario, Grb-2 has a stimulatory role and PI3K an inhibitory role. Furthermore, our results are compatible with the possibility that there may be other adaptor or signaling molecules that associate outside of the YMNM motif in CD28 cytoplasmic domain. To test whether the tyrosine residues outside of the YMNM motif or the SH3 binding motif of CD28 are involved in the IL-2 promoter activation, we generated multiple CD28 mutants (Fig. 1). Constructs were tested that contained mutated Tyr at positions 204, 207, and 216 to Phe, or mutated Pro at positions 194, 197, 206, and 209 to Ala, respectively. These mutant constructs were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat cells. The transfectants were stimulated with PMA and anti-CD28 antibody, and then luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, all mutants showed activity comparable to that of the CD28WT construct. Thus, we were unable to demonstrate that these regions were necessary for IL-2 expression. To further analyze the PI3K function in CD28-mediated signaling, we tested the effect of LY294002, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, on CD28-mediated IL-2 promoter activation. In the CD28 WT and all mutants except for the TM mutant, LY294002 enhanced the response to anti-CD28 antibody cross-linking in a dose-dependent manner. However, the CD28 WT and the N191A mutant, which retain the capability to associate with PI3K (Fig. 3), showed greater enhancement by LY294002 treatment than the other mutants (Y189F, M192L, and YMNMdel mutant), which lost PI3K binding ability (Fig.4). These results are consistent with the idea that PI3K is a negative regulator that suppresses IL-2 promoter activation. Some enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity by LY294002 treatment observed in CD28 mutants (Y189F, M192L, and YMNMdel mutant), which do not associate with PI3K, may be due to the inhibition of constitutive activity of PI3K in Jurkat cells. However, there remains the possibility of a weak association between PI3K and these mutants that is undetectable by our assay. This possible association may work negatively on IL-2 promoter activation. Alternatively, it is possible that PI3K activation occurs downstream of CD28 signaling transmitted through site(s) outside of the YMNM region, which negatively regulates the IL-2 promoter activation. Only the IL-2 promoter activity of the TM mutant decreased with LY294002. Our interpretation of this result is that since cross-linking of the CD28 TM mutant does not induce a positive signal for IL-2 promoter activation, overall inhibition of PI3K may hinder the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, resulting in the decrease of IL-2 promoter activity. To confirm these results, we tested another inhibitor of PI3K, wortmannin. In the nanomolar range, wortmannin also had a similar enhancing effect, as did LY294002 (data not shown). To further examine whether activation of PI3K suppresses IL-2 promoter activation, we tested the effect of a constitutively active form of PI3K, BD110 (25Kita Y. Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on CD28-mediated signaling. The BD110 protein has an inter-SH2 domain of p85, which binds to the p110 amino terminus, but does not have the two SH2 domains of p85. Thus, this active form of PI3K does not have a binding site for the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Jurkat cells were transfected with empty vector or the plasmid encoding BD110 together with the mouse CD28 construct and IL-2 reporter plasmid, and their CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity was measured. As shown in Fig.5, expression of the BD110 strongly inhibited promoter activation by PMA plus anti-CD28 antibody stimulation. On the other hand, this suppressive effect of BD110 was weaker, when transfectants were stimulated with anti-CD28 antibody in the presence of both PMA and ionomycin and, it was not seen, when cells were treated with PMA/ionomycin alone (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of PI3K negatively regulates the CD28-mediated IL-2 promoter activation, and that this negative regulation primarily works in CD28-mediated costimulation. Alternatively, it is possible that PMA and ionomycin activate signal transduction that is downstream of CD28. The role of PI3K in CD28 costimulation remains controversial. In this study, we found that the YMNM motif deletion mutant and the Y189F mutant had reduced, but yet retained significant activity for IL-2 promoter activation, whereas the M192L mutant was not altered after CD28 stimulation. Because each of these three mutations eliminated the PI3K association to CD28, we concluded that PI3K is not absolutely required for CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription. We also found that the mutation of Asn191 completely abolished CD28-mediated signaling. Since the mutation of Asn191 to Ala reduces Grb-2 binding but does not affect PI3K binding, Grb-2 may have a critical role in CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription. Together, these results lead us to propose the following hypothesis. 1) Two molecules that bind to the YMNM motif may control CD28-mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter positively and negatively. 2) Since the N191A mutant retains its ability to bind PI3K and reduces binding to Grb-2, PI3K could be considered to be a negative regulator, while Grb-2 may be a positive regulator, and 3) yet undefined positive regulators may exist, which bind to the CD28 cytoplasmic domain outside of the YMNM motif. Several groups demonstrated that PI3K has a crucial role in CD28-mediated IL-2 production. For example, using a similar approach, Cai et al. (16Cai Y.C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showed that murine T cell hybridomas expressing point mutations of Tyr189 or Met192within the YMNM motif eliminated IL-2 production after CD28 ligation. In contrast, Truitt et al. (17Truitt K.E. Shi J. Gibson S. Segal L.G. Mills G.B. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4702-4710PubMed Google Scholar) reported that transfection of the mouse CD28 Y189F mutant into Jurkat cells, which showed partial reduction of IL-2-transcriptional activation, did not inhibit CD28-dependent IL-2 production. Furthermore, in Jurkat cells, it was reported that wortmannin treatment did not decrease or, in some cases, even increased CD28-dependent costimulation of IL-2 production (14Ueda Y. Levine B.L.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 4702-4710PubMed Google Scholar) also found that wortmannin did not inhibit CD28-dependent IL-2 production from freshly isolated murine CD4+ T cells. On the contrary, wortmannin was reported to inhibit CD28-mediated costimulation of IL-2 in human primary T cells (13Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Ueda Y. Levine B.L. Huang M.L. Freeman G.J. Nadler L.M. June C.H. Ward S.G. Int.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One of the possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies among these reports may be the nature of the cell used in the respective studies. We have recently found that T cells from transgenic mice expressing the CD28 Y189F mutation are able to produce a significant amount of IL-2 following CD28 cross-linking. 2Harada, Y., Tokushima, M., Matsumoto, Y., Ogawa, S., Otsuka, M., Hayashi, K., Weiss, B. D., June, C. H., and Abe, R. (2001) J. Immunol., in press. This result suggests that PI3K is dispensable for CD28-mediated IL-2 production in primary T cells. Recently, two groups generated PI3K p85α null mutant mice and reported that these mice had impaired B cell development and functions, whereas T cell development and proliferation were normal (26Suzuki H. Terauchi Y. Fujiwara M. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Science. 1999; 283: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). These reports are consistent with our conclusion that PI3K (p85α)-CD28 association is not obligatory for CD28-mediated T cell activation. The physiological significance of the inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity by PI3K is unclear at present. The serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt is a downstream effector for PI3K. Recently, the PI3K-Akt pathway was shown to inhibit the Raf-Mek-ERK pathway depending on the differentiation stage of muscle cell (28Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Akt activation inhibited the Raf-Mek-ERK pathway in differentiated myotubes, but not in their myoblast precursors. In Jurkat cells, PI3K may inhibit IL-2 promoter activation using the same pathway. We are presently studying whether this inhibitory pathway exists in Jurkat cells. Given that the PI3K-Akt pathway inhibits the Raf-Mek-ERK pathway depending on the differentiation stage of muscle cells, it is possible that PI3K might play a differential role depending on the activation state of the T cell. In fact, distinct functions of CD28-mediated signals during T cell antigen recognition and activation have been documented (29Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Our recent study using CD28 null mice that have been reconstituted with CD28 mutants supports this hypothesis. Namely, splenic T cells expressing the CD28 Y189F mutant are deeply impaired in the proliferative response and IL-2 production induced by CD28-ligation and CD3 stimulation at 24 h after stimulation, whereas these responses dramatically improved at 48 h after stimulation.2 From these results, it is conceivable that PI3K activation by CD28 engagement may suppress IL-2 production in late but not in early activation stages and therefore, may lead T cell responses to terminate. In this scenario, the phenomenon observed in the present study using Jurkat cells may reflect IL-2 production in the late activation state of T cells. CTLA-4, a member of the CD28 family of receptors, appears to send a negative signal to T cells (30Walunas T.L. Lenschow D.J. Bakker C.Y. Linsley P.S. Freeman G.J. Green J.M. Thompson C.B.

CTLA-4 also has a YXXM motif in the cytoplasmic domain and Schneider et al. (34Schneider H. Prasad K.V. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reported that anti-CTLA-4 antibody ligation resulted in detectable levels of PI3K activity in human T lymphoblastoid cell line and in PHA-stimulated peripheral T cells. This result suggests the possibility that CTLA-4-induced suppression of IL-2 production may be mediated by the negative function of PI3K. Recently, a third CD28 family receptor, ICOS, has been identified (35Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Beier K.C. Eljaschewitsch B. Kraft R. Anag-nostopoulos I. Kroczek R.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 36Yoshinaga S.K. Whoriskey J.S. Khare S.D. Sarmiento U. Guo J. Horan T. Shih G. Zhang M. Coccia M.A. Kohno T. Tafuri-Bladt A.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This molecule also possesses a PI3K binding motif, YMFM. We have generated and expressed chimeric molecules composed of the CD28 extracellular domain and ICOS intracellular domain, and found that cross-linking of these molecules by anti-murine CD28 antibody resulted in a specific association with PI3K, whereas only slight IL-2 promoter activity was detected. This result is consistent with the notion of a non-obligatory role of PI3K for IL-2 production. The costimulatory effects of CD28 are not limited to IL-2 production, and PI3K is also involved in many cellular responses. Thus, PI3K may have a critical role in T cell responses augmented by CD28 costimulation other than IL-2 production. For example, it has been shown that CD28 costimulation enhances T cell survival following T cell receptor stimulation by increasing the expression of Bcl-XL(38Boise L.H. Minn A.J. Noel P.J. June C.H. Accavitti M.A. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 87-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). PI3K was also shown to be involved in cellular survival through activation of Akt. Akt is known to block apoptosis through phosphorylation and inactivation of the Bcl-2 family protein Bad, caspase-9, and Forkhead family members (39Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar). By the activation of PI3K, CD28 may block apoptosis through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, CD28 costimulation can also affect adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, which is important for efficient T cell antigen recognition. Indeed, PI3K has been implicated in CD28-dependent increases in β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin (43Zell T. Hunt S.W.R. Mobley J.L. Finkelstein L.D. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 883-886PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, it is likely that the binding of multiple signaling molecules to the CD28 cytosolic domain may selectively regulate diverse cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2014233887,"Phenobarbital induction of CYP2Bgenes is mediated by a complex phenobarbital-responsive enhancer (PBRU), which contains a binding site for nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) flanked by two DR-4 nuclear receptor (NR) binding sites for a heterodimer of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). To examine potential interactions between NF-1 and CAR/RXR, binding of purified recombinant proteins to DNA, or to chromatin assembled using Drosophila embryo extract, was examined. NF-1 and CAR/RXR bound simultaneously and independently to the overlapping NF-1 and NR-1 sites; binding of CAR/RXR to the NR-2 site was modestly increased by NF-1 binding; and CAR/RXR bound to a new site in the PBRU region, designated NR-3. Assembly of plasmid DNA into chromatin using Drosophila extract resulted in linearly phased nucleosomes in the PBRU region. The apparent binding affinity of NF-1 was increased by about 10-fold in assembled chromatin compared with DNA, whereas CAR/RXR binding was decreased. As observed for DNA, however, simultaneous, largely independent, binding to the NF-1 and NR sites was observed. CAR-mediated transactivation of the PBRU in cultured cells of hepatic origin was inhibited by mutations in the NF-1 site, and overexpression of NF-1 increased CAR transactivation in HepG2 cells. These studies demonstrate that NF-1 and CAR/RXR can both bind to the PBRU at the same time and that chromatin assembly increases NF-1 binding, which is consistent with previous in vivofootprinting studies in which the NF-1 site was occupied in untreated animals and the NF-1 and flanking NR sites were occupied after phenobarbital treatment. CAR-mediated trans-activation of the PBRU was increased by NF-1, analogous to NF-1 effects on phenobarbital induction in previous transient transfection studies and consistent with mediation of phenobarbital induction by CAR.

A characteristic of the xenobiotic-metabolizing forms is that subsets of the P450s are induced by a variety of chemicals (1Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 2Savas Ü. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This induction may alter the turnover of a drug that is given chronically and is the basis of drug interactions, because individual P450s are able to metabolize many substrates. The major human P450, P450 3A4, for example is responsible for the metabolism of nearly 50% of all therapeutic drugs (3Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). PB is a classical inducer of cytochrome P450 genes and is representative of a large number of structurally diverse phenobarbital-like inducers (4Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The most dramatic effects of PB are on the CYP2B subfamily, but members of theCYP2C and CYP3A subfamilies are also induced. In addition, PB induces the expression of other xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as glutathioneS-transferase and UDP- glucuronosyltransferases. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of PB induction of CYP2B genes. Trottier et al. (5Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A.

This sequence was also shown to mediate PB induction with heterologous promoters in rat hepatocytes in situ when DNA was directly injected into the liver (6Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and an analogous, nearly identical, sequence was identified in the mouse Cyp2b10 gene (7Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis established that the PB-responsive enhancer was a complex enhancer that contained multiple redundant regulatory binding sites, including two nuclear receptor binding sites, NR-1 and NR-2, and an NF-1 site (7Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), binds to the two nuclear receptor sites and is enriched in nuclear extracts from PB-treated animals (10Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In the liver, CAR is present mainly in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, until treatment with PB-like inducers, which causes translocation to the nucleus and binding to the NR sites as a CAR/RXR heterodimer (11Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Because CAR is constitutively active (12Choi H.S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.K. Seol W. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23565-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), translocation may be sufficient for activation. However, it has also been demonstrated that binding of CAR to the coactivator steroid receptor coactivator-1 is increased after incubation with the PB-like inducer, TCPOBOP, although the same could not be demonstrated for PB (13Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, PB induction may involve translocation of CAR to the nucleus and, for some PB-like ligands, activation of CAR as well. These experiments provide evidence for the key role of CAR in the PB induction of CYP2B genes. Consistent with these results, mutation of the NR-1 and NR-2 sites decreases the response to PB in transient transfection studies (8Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Liu S. Park Y. Rivera-Rivera I. Li H. Kemper B.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In these studies, mutation of the NF-1 site also reduced the response to PB. Contrary to the transient transfection experiments, mutation of NF-1 in transgenes containing the PBRU did not reduce the expression after PB treatment, but the basal level of expression in untreated animals was increased (14Ramsden R. Beck N.B. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C. Gene. 1999; 228: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The contributions of the NF-1 site to activation of the PBRU, therefore, are controversial but mutation of the NF-1 site affects the function of the PBRU in both the transgenic studies and the transient transfections. Furthermore, in vivo footprints of the PBRU in hepatic chromatin demonstrate that the NF-1 region is occupied by proteins in untreated animals (15Kim J. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29423-29426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Kim J. Rivera-Rivera I. Kemper B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This region is still protected after PB treatment, but the region of protection is expanded over the flanking NR-1 and NR-2 sites. The NR sites are adjacent to the NF-1 site, and the NR-1 site overlaps by one nucleotide with the NF-1 site. The close proximity of the binding sites raised the question of whether interactions between CAR/RXR and NF-1, which bind to these sites, might play a role in transcriptional activation mediated by the PBRU. The experiments described above provide strong evidence that the PBRU in CYP2B genes is the principle mediator of PB induction these genes. For PB induction, the PB treatment most likely causes the translocation of CAR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where this constitutively active receptor binds to and trans-activates the PBRU. The mechanism by which this transactivation occurs has not been elucidated but requires other accessory factors, including NF-1, for maximal activation by PB in transient transfection analyses. In vitro evidence for the role of NF-1 in PBRU function has depended on analysis of protein binding using crude nuclear extracts and mutagenesis of the NF-1 site followed by functional analysis, studies in which potential interactions between NF-1 and CAR cannot be studied. The apparent differences in the effect of mutation of the NF-1 motif in transient transfections and transgenes suggest that functional interactions between NF-1 and CAR are different in chromatin and DNA. To study potential interactions between NF-1 and CAR and the role of chromatin structure, we have examined the binding of partially purified bacterially expressed CAR, RXR, and NF-1 to the CYP2B1 PBRU either in DNA or in assembled chromatin. The results indicate that CAR/RXR and NF-1 bind independently and simultaneously to the PBRU. In assembled chromatin, nucleosomes are linearly phased in the PBRU region, and the apparent affinity of NF-1 is increased 10-fold while that of CAR/RXR is reduced. Functionally, CAR-dependent activation of the PBRU in cultured cells is decreased by mutations of the NF-1 site and coexpression of NF-1 with CAR enhances the CAR-dependent activation in HepG2 cells just as mutation of the NF-1 site inhibits PB induction in transiently transfected hepatocytes in primary culture orin situ. Mouse CAR1 and CAR2 cDNAs were isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction and verified by sequencing. For bacterial expression of CAR1 with a His tag at the N terminus, CAR1 cDNA digested withBamHI and EcoRI was inserted into pET28a+ (Novagen Corp.) to produce pETCAR. For expression of CAR in mammalian cells, a BamHI/EcoRI fragment containing the CAR1 cDNA isolated from pGEX2TK-CAR was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with the same enzymes to produce pcDNA3-CAR. For bacterial expression of His- and FLAG-tagged NF-1 and FLAG-tagged RXR, the vectors pf:His-CTF1 and pf:RXR, respectively, were obtained from C. Chiang (Case Western Reserve University). For expression of NF-1 in mammalian cells, an EcoRI/BglII fragment from NF1L21 (A. Nicosia, Istito di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare, Rome, Italy), which contained the NF-1 cDNA was inserted into pCMV5 digested with EcoRI andBamHI. The reporter plasmids, PBRU2C1-luc and NF1 m12C1-luc have been described previously (9Liu S. Park Y. Rivera-Rivera I. Li H. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RXR and NF-1 antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and N. Tanese (New York University Medical Center, New York), respectively. For production of CAR antisera, CAR2 cDNA was inserted into pET28a+, and Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with the resulting plasmid. Expression of CAR2 was induced by incubation with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thioglucopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed in Ni-NTA equilibrium buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0; 500 mm NaCl; 10 mm imidazole; 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm DTT; 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin; and 10 μg/ml benzamidine) by passing through a French press. CAR2, which was in inclusion bodies, was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice with 8m urea and once with 6 m guanidine-HCl in Ni-NTA equilibrium buffer plus 1% Nonidet P-40 minus the protease inhibitors. The protein was solubilized in 6 mguanidine-HCl and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol in Ni-NTA equilibration buffer, and the solubilized protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-NTA column. The sample was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, which resulted in precipitation of the protein. The precipitated protein was resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for injection into a rabbit for antibody production. For expression of proteins in bacteria, 1-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS in LB broth were inoculated with 1/20 volume of overnight cultures and incubated at 37 °C for about 1 h to an A 600 = 0.6. Expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thioglucopyranoside, and the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with the appropriate affinity resin, M2 agarose (Sigma Chemical Co.) for FLAG-NF-1 and FLAG-RXR and nickel-NTA slurry (Qiagen) for 6HIS-CAR and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing by centrifugation and resuspension three to five times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, proteins were eluted at 4 °C by resuspension and incubation for 20 min in 0.2–0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, which contained either 150 mm imidazole or 0.5 μg/ml of FLAG peptide for the nickel-NTA or M2-agarose resins, respectively. This elution procedure was repeated twice more. The identities of the proteins were established by Western analysis, and the purity and concentration of the proteins were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of sodium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of the samples were stored at −80 °C. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (17Kim J. deHaan G. Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Binding reactions contained 50 mm KCl, 50 ng poly(dI·dC), 4 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 5,000–10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and recombinant proteins in a volume of 20 μl. The probe was a 74-bp oligonucleotide, containing CYP2B1 sequence (−2222 to −2154) plus 5 T's, and was labeled by incubation with E. coli DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment, and [α-32P]dATP. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed with a G-25 spin column. For the binding assay, samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then at room temperature for 15 min. Competitive oligonucleotides (100× excess) and antisera to RXR, CAR, and NF-1 were added during the binding reaction. Procedures for DNase I and DMS footprinting have been described previously (15Kim J. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29423-29426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Kim J. Rivera-Rivera I. Kemper B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The probe was prepared by digestion of pPBRU2C1-TZ with EcoRI andPvuII; incubation with E. coli DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment, and [α-32P]dATP; and isolation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the resulting 540-bp fragment, which contained the PBRU sequence and was labeled at the 3′-end of the antisense strand. About 50,000–100,000 cpm of probe was added to the binding reactions. Purified recombinant proteins were added to the reaction as indicated in the figures. The samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and either DMS was added to 20 mmand the incubation was continued for an additional 3 min at room temperature, or DNase I was added to a concentration of 2 μg/ml and the incubation was continued for 2–5 min on ice. The DMS-treated samples were incubated with piperidine to cleave at the methylated G's. The DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described (15Kim J. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29423-29426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Chromatin was assembled by the Drosophila embryo extract method (18Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Drosophila embryo S-190 extract was prepared as described (18Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of S.-Y. Wu and C.-M. Chiang (Case Western Reserve University). Assembly of chromatin was as described (19Wu S.-Y. Thomas M.C. Hou S.Y. Likhite V. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23480-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of S-190 extract was incubated with 0.4 μg of purified Drosophila core histones in 10 mmKOH-Hepes, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol on ice for 30 min. Then 400 ng of pPBRU2C1-TZ DNA was added, and the volume was adjusted to 50 μl with a final concentration of 3 mmATP, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 1 μg/ml creatine kinase, 4.1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The samples were incubated at 27 °C for 4.5 h. Mock chromatin assembly reactions were carried out as above except that the S-190 extract was omitted. To analyze protein binding to the chromatin, purified recombinant NF-1, RXR, and CAR were added to 25 ng of assembled chromatin and incubations were continued for 30 min at 27 °C. To assess the formation of chromatin, 5 units of micrococcal nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1.5 μl of 0.1 mCaCl2 were added to 250 ng of DNA of the assembled chromatin in 50 μl, and 17-μl aliquots were removed after 1, 3, and 9 min of incubation at room temperature. The aliquots were added to 4 μl of 0.5% Sarkosyl, 100 mm EDTA to inhibit the nuclease, and 0.2 μg/μl RNase A was added. After further incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 0.8 μl of 5% sodium lauryl sulfate and 2 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added, and the reaction was heated to 55 °C for 15 min. 20 μg of glycogen was added as a carrier, and the samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform. The DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet radiation. Bulk DNA was analyzed by Southern analysis with total plasmid DNA as the probe, which was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random hexamer priming. Hybridization was at 68 °C for 5 h, and the membranes were washed several times with the final wash at 68 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate. The position of nucleosomes relative to the PBRU was assessed by indirect end-labeled Southern analysis. After micrococcal nuclease treatment, the DNA was digested with EcoRI and transferred to Nylon membranes as above, The probe for the hybridization was an oligonucleotide of 21 nucleotides beginning at the EcoRI site, which was labeled with 32P at the 5′-end by polynucleotide kinase. Hybridization was at 55 °C for 5 h, and the membranes were washed several times as described above. For DNase I footprinting, after incubation with NF-1, CAR, and RXR, 25 ng of DNA of chromatin was digested for 3 min at room temperature with 0.9 unit of DNase I. For mock assembled chromatin, 0.003 unit of DNase I was used. DNase I digestion was stopped by addition of 20 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 130 μg/ml proteinase K, and 60 μg/ml tRNA. After incubation at 55 °C for 15 min, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA was labeled by linear amplification for 15 cycles in a polymerase chain reaction machine using a sense oligonucleotide, 5′-GAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGG-3′, from the multiple cloning site of the plasmid as a primer. The primer was labeled with 32P at the 5′-end by polynucleotide kinase. The fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and were detected by autoradiography. Human HepG2 and mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and α-minimal essential medium, respectively, with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin. For transfections, cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of plasmids containing either the wild-type PBRU or the PBRU with the NF-1 site mutated, NF1 m1 (9Liu S. Park Y. Rivera-Rivera I. Li H. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), fused to the minimal CYP2C1promoter/firefly luciferase reporter (6Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), 2–6 ng of pRL-SV40, containing the SV40 promoter and Renilla luciferase reporter as an internal standard, and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. Expression plasmids for CAR, pcDNA3CAR1, and NF-1, pCMV5-NF1, were cotransfected as indicated in the figures. 24–36 h after transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were determined by the Dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Biotech). For each sample, the background of extracts from untransfected cells was subtracted and the firefly luciferase values were normalized by dividing by theRenilla luciferase values. TheCYP2B1 PBRU is a complex enhancer containing multiple regulatory elements, including an NF-1 motif flanked by two NR sites. As shown in Fig. 1, the NF-1 site and the NR-1 site overlap by one nucleotide and the NF-1 and NR-2 sites are separated by only three nucleotides. This proximity raises the possibility that steric hindrance might prevent binding of NF-1 and CAR/RXR at the same time or that binding among the factors might be cooperative. To examine whether all the proteins could bind at the same time, binding of partially purified recombinant CAR/RXR and NF-1 to theCYP2B1 PBRU was examined by gel mobility shift assay (Fig.2). CAR alone did not bind to the PBRU (lane 2), but RXR alone bound weakly presumably as a homodimer (lane 3). Two complexes were formed when CAR and RXR were added together, and the ratio of the slower to more rapidly migrating complexes increased as the concentration of the proteins was increased (lanes 4–6). These results are consistent with CAR/RXR binding primarily to one of the NR sites at lower concentrations and to both NR-1 and NR-2 at the higher concentrations. NF-1 alone also bound to the PBRU, forming several specific complexes (lane 7), which were competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-1 motif (not shown). The reason that multiple complexes are formed is not known, but may result from partial degradation of NF-1. Addition of both NF-1 and CAR/RXR resulted in complexes corresponding to the two CAR/RXR complexes and a more slowly migrating complex (lane 8, NF-1·NR-1·NR-2). Competition with oligonucleotides containing either the NR-1 or NF-1 motif resulted in the loss of the most slowly migrating complex (lanes 9and 10), suggesting that this complex contained both NF-1 and CAR/RXR. This was shown more directly by addition of antisera to CAR, RXR, and NF-1, each of which supershifted the more slowly moving complex (lanes 11, 13, and 14), whereas addition of preimmune serum (lane 12) had no effect. These results demonstrate that CAR/RXR and NF-1 bind simultaneously to the CYP2B1 PBRU.Figure 2Binding of NF-1 and CAR/RXR to the ratCYP2B1 PBRU. NF-1, RXR, and CAR were expressed in bacteria and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The probe was a double-stranded oligonucleotide that containedCYP2B1 sequence −2222 to − 2154, which contains the NF-1, NR-1, and NR-2 binding sites in the PBRU. After incubation with the indicated recombinant proteins, the samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 6% nondenaturing gels, and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Approximately 5 ng of NF-1 and 5 ng (+), 10 ng (++), or 20 ng (+++) of CAR and 2.5 ng (+), 5 ng (++), or 10 ng (+++) of RXR were added to the reactions. Competitor oligonucleotides containing either the NR-1 or NF-1 site in 100× excess or antisera to CAR, RXR, and NF-1 or preimmune serum (Pre.S.) were added during the incubations as indicated. The DNA sites occupied by proteins in the complexes are indicated at theleft of the figures as are the complexes with slower mobility after addition of antisera (supershifts).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gel mobility shift assays established that NF-1 and CAR/RXR bind simultaneously to the PBRU. To examine the relative affinity of CAR/RXR binding to the NR-1 and NR-2 sites and to determine directly whether both NR sites were occupied when the NF-1 site was occupied, DNase I and DMS footprinting assays of binding of the purified proteins to the PBRU were examined. Addition of increasing amounts of CAR/RXR resulted in protection from DNase I over the NR-1 site initially and both the NR-1 and NR-2 sites at higher concentrations. On the basis of these results, the complex observed in the gel shift assays with low concentrations of CAR/RXR represents binding to the NR-1 site and the more slowly migrating complex present at higher concentrations represents binding to both the NR-1 and NR-2 sites. The regions protected by CAR/RXR from DNase I cleavage extend into the NF-1 site from both the NR-1 and NR-2 sites, and binding to the NR-1 site is associated with the appearance of hypersensitive sites within the NF-1 site. Binding of NF-1 to the PBRU results in a footprint of about 30 bp over the NF-1 site, which also overlaps with the NR-1 and NR-2 sites. NF-1 binding is also associated with hypersensitivity in the NR-1 site. The overlapping footprints and the hypersensitivity induced in the binding site of the adjacent factor by binding of one factor to its site suggested that binding of NF-1 might affect binding of CAR/RXR orvice versa. However, the occupation of the NF-1 site by NF-1 has little influence on the binding of increasing concentrations of CAR/RXR to NR-1, and CAR/RXR binding has little influence on the binding of increasing concentrations of NF-1 (Fig.3). In contrast, the binding of CAR/RXR to NR-2 is modestly increased by the binding of NF-1 to its site, suggesting some interaction exists between the proteins at these sites. DMS footprinting was used to map the binding of the factors at higher resolution (Fig. 4). Protection by CAR/RXR against methylation of guanines was observed in the NR-1 site at nucleotides −2211, −2202, and −2201 and within NR-2 site at −2179 and −2170. None of the guanines on the antisense strand within the NF-1 site was protected by CAR/RXR. Likewise, protection from methylation by NF-1 was at nucleotides −2196, −2189, and −2188 within the NF-1 bipartite motif. A strong hypersensitive site was observed at"

By using a murine model of asthma we now report the effect of allergen-induced airway inflammation on the expression of transgenes regulated by the human surfactant protein (hSP)-C promoter. The hSP-C 3.7-kilobase pair promoter was used to direct the expression of eotaxin, an eosinophil-selective chemokine, into the lungs of several transgenic lines. As expected, the transgenic mice expressed increased amounts of eotaxin mRNA and protein compared with wild-type mice. Surprisingly, following allergen challenge, there was a marked down-regulation of transgene mRNA in three independent transgenic lines. The down-regulation was in contrast to other related proteins such as endogenous eotaxin and surfactant protein D levels, which were both increased following allergen challenge. Consistent with specific down-regulation of the eotaxin transgene, there was no increase in pulmonary eosinophil levels in the transgenic mice above that found in wild-type mice. Analysis of hSP-C transgenic mice with distinct reporter genes and 3′-untranslated regions revealed that allergen challenge was directly affecting the hSP-C promoter. We hypothesized that allergen-induced down-regulation of the hSP-C promoter was related to the eosinophilic inflammation. To test this, we blocked eosinophilic inflammation in the lungs by treating mice with neutralizing antiserum against interleukin-5. Interestingly, this treatment also blocked allergen-induced inhibition of the hSP-C promoter. These results establish that allergic airway inflammation is associated with up-regulation of the surfactant proteins primarily involved in immunity, whereas down-regulation of the surfactant protein primarily involved in maintaining airway patency. Furthermore, the marked down-regulation of the hSP-C promoter is interleukin-5-dependent, implying a critical role for eosinophilic inflammation.

In support of the critical function of surfactant proteins, a deficiency or dysregulation of surfactant proteins can have profound effects. For example, surfactant deficiency is responsible for the respiratory distress syndrome of infancy, and surfactant replacement is an effective therapy for this disorder. Furthermore, reduced levels of surfactant constituents are found in the lungs of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Experimental disruption of SP-A, SP-B, or SP-D in mice results in various lung-specific problems including impairment in pulmonary host responses to infection (SP-A and SP-D) and neonatal respiratory failure (SP-B) (3Clark J.C.

The pleiotropic and fundamental properties of surfactant proteins underscore the importance of elucidating the role of surfactant proteins in various lung disorders. Asthma is an airway inflammatory disorder whose prevalence is on the rise worldwide despite increased availability of therapeutic options (7Holgate S.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 2-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). An extensive amount of experimentation in humans and rodents using models of allergen-induced airway inflammation has demonstrated an essential role for Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and various cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) (8Drazen J.M. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 9Wills-Karp M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), but the specific role of surfactant proteins has not been extensively examined. Because surfactant lipids and proteins are primary molecules involved in maintaining airway patency, an impaired process in patients with asthma, they are likely to be involved, at least in part, in the pathophysiology of asthma. Consistent with this, segmental allergen challenge in sensitized animals and humans results in loss of surfactant activity (10Hohlfeld J.M. Ahlf K. Enhorning G. Balke K. Erpenbeck V.J.

Furthermore, although no difference in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) phospholipid levels are seen between patients with asthma and controls, following allergen challenge, only patients with asthma have a change in the ratio between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, the major lipid constituents of surfactant (13Heeley E.L. Hohlfeld J.M. Krug N. Postle A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L305-L311PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that allergic airway inflammation regulates the expression of hSP-C, a major gene product of alveolar type II epithelial cells. We chose to utilize an established murine model of asthma and an established transgenic system to facilitate direct analysis of human SP-C expression. Specific transcription of the hSP-C gene in pulmonary epithelial cells is regulated by the first 3.7 kb of the SP-C promoter (14Korfhagen T.R. Glasser S.W. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. Daugherty C.C. McNeish J.D. Stock J.L. Potter S.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This region confers all of the necessary elements to direct specific expression of transgenes in the distal respiratory epithelium and has been instrumental for experimental analysis of lung development and disease (15Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L489-L497PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of allergic airway inflammation on the expression of transgenes under the control of the hSP-C 3.7-kb promoter. Specific pathogen-free FVB mice, 8–10 weeks old were obtained from the NCI, Frederick, MD. Eotaxin or SP-B transgenic mice were generated by inserting the mouse eotaxin cDNA coding region (20–328 base pairs) or the coding region of the human SP-B cDNA (10–837 base pairs) (16Lin S. Na C.L.

This transgenic construct utilizes the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal that is used as a probe for identifying transgenic mice by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. In other experiments, transgenic mice containing a “mammalianized” SP-C 3.7 promoter followed by noncoding 5′ exons from the rabbit β-globin gene, the hSP-B cDNA, and the 3′ polyadenylation signal from bovine growth hormone were examined (construct III in Fig. 1) (17Beck D.C. Na C.L. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3371-3376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All mice (FVB/N) were housed under pathogen-free conditions and examined between 6 and 16 weeks of age. A mouse model of allergic lung disease was established using methods described previously (18Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Lee J.J. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were lightly anesthetized with Metofane inhalation (methoxyfluorane; Pittman-Moore, Mundelein, IL), and 100 μg (50 μl of saline) of Aspergillus fumigatus (Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Spokane, WA) or 50 μl of normal saline alone was applied to the nares using a micropipette with the mouse held in the supine position. After instillation, mice were held upright until alert. After three treatments per week for 3 weeks, mice were sacrificed between 18 and 20 h after the last intranasal challenge. In some experiments, mice were treated with neutralizing doses (1.0 mg) of anti-IL-5 (TRFK-5) or control IgG1 (GL113 (anti-Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase); both kindly provided by Dr. Fred Finkelman, University of Cincinnati and Robert Coffman, DNAX, Palo Alto, CA) by intraperitoneal injection each week prior to the 1st weekly allergen challenge. In other experiments, a mouse model of allergic lung disease was established using intranasal ovalbumin (OVA). In brief, mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection with OVA (50 μg)/alum (1 mg) in 0.9% sterile saline on day 0 and day 12. Mice were then challenged intranasally with 50 μl containing 150 μg of OVA or saline on days 20, 21, 22, and 23 and then sacrificed 18–20 h after the last OVA challenge. Mice were euthanized by CO2inhalation and exsanguinated, and the trachea was cannulated and lavaged with 2 replicate volumes (0.8 ml) of normal saline containing 0.2 mm EDTA to obtain BALF. Lavage fluid was centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and analyzed for total cell count and differential analysis. Aliquots of the BALF supernatant were taken for total protein analysis by bicinchoninic acid analysis (Pierce). A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure eotaxin protein levels in BALF. The wells of ELISA plates (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were first coated with 40 ng (100 μl) of diluted mouse eotaxin-specific goat IgG (AF-420NA; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following the incubation, the plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 300 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% sucrose, and 0.05% NaN3 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Mouse eotaxin (kindly provided by PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used as a quantitation standard. The eotaxin standard and BALF samples were diluted in the blocking solution and added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBST and then further incubated with 20 ng (100 μl) of mouse eotaxin affinity-purified polyclonal secondary antibody (BAF-420, R & D Systems) for 2 h at room temperature followed by three washes with PBST. Fifty nanograms (100 μl) of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, ABTS peroxidase substrate solution that contains 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) at a concentration of 0.3 g/liter in a glycine/citric acid buffer and 0.01% H2O2 (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to complete the reaction. The substrate reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl/well of 1 m H2SO4and quantitated by an ELISA plate reader at 495 nm. RNA was extracted from the lung tissue using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty micrograms of total RNA from each sample were electrophoresed on 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen hybridization membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 10× SSC. The membrane was UV cross-linked and prehybridized at 42 °C for 1 h in a 50% formamide buffer (pH 7.5), containing 10% dextran sulfate, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml of herring sperm DNA, and 20 mm Tris. The 32P-labeled probes were prepared for mouse eotaxin cDNA (19Rothenberg M.E. Luster A.D. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8960-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence, and mouse surfactant protein cDNAs (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett) as described previously (20D'Amore-Bruno M.A. Wikenheiser K.A.

The membranes were washed for 20 min at 42 °C, 20 min at 50 °C, 20 min at 60 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) in the BALF were examined by Western blot analysis. Mice were lavaged with five 1.0-ml washes of PBS (pH 7.4 containing 1% FBS and 0.2 mm EDTA). The recovered BALF (∼4.6 ml) was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of distilled water. Total protein in each samples was determined by bicinchoninic acid analysis (Pierce). For SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D, 10 μg of total protein was electrophoresed in 4–20% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Digeo, CA). In some experiments, an equal volume of BALF (100 μl) was reduced to 10 μl by centrifugation under negative pressure and subjected to electrophoresis. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and equal loading was verified by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). To reduce nonspecific binding, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Immunoblotting was performed utilizing 1:5000 dilution of guinea pig anti-rat SP-A, rabbit anti-bovine SP-B, or rabbit anti-murine SP-D (kindly provided by Jeffrey Whitsett, University of Cincinnati) (24Elhalwagi B.M.

For SP-C detection, 10–20% Tricine gels (NOVEX) were employed using an upper buffer composed of 0.1 mTris-Tricine with 0.1% SDS and a lower buffer composed of 0.2m Tris, pH 8.9. Rabbit anti-recombinant human SP-C serum (kindly provided by Jeffrey Whitsett) was diluted 1:25,000 in TBST and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem) was diluted 1:5000 in TBST. Surfactant protein standards (5 ng) (kindly provided by Jeffrey Whitsett) were also electrophoresed as positive controls. The signal was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance comparing different sets of mice was determined by Student's t test. The 3.7-kb 5′-flanking region of the hSP-C gene contains all of the necessary elements to promote specific expression of transgenes into pulmonary type II cells (27Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). We initially generated transgenic mice that utilized the hSP-C promoter to direct expression of eotaxin, an eosinophil-selective chemokine (28Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 29Rothenberg M.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), in type II cells of mice to examine the consequences of eotaxin overexpression in the lungs (see transgenic construct I in Fig.1). Three different eotaxin transgenic founder lines were established that had variable but increased expression of eotaxin lung mRNA (Fig.2 A) and protein in the BALF (Fig. 2 B). For example, wild-type mice had 345 ± 205 pg/ml eotaxin in the BALF, and the transgenic lines had increased levels ranging from 687 ± 61 to 3587 ± 223 pg/ml. The specificity of the ELISA for eotaxin was determined by demonstrating undetectable eotaxin in mice genetically deficient in eotaxin (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, the base-line level of eosinophils in the BALF and lungs was not different between wild-type and eotaxin transgenic mice (data not shown). This prompted investigation of the effect of the eotaxin transgene during allergic airway inflammation, since it was hypothesized that eotaxin would cooperate with other signals generated during allergic airway inflammation (e.g.IL-5) to promote eosinophil recruitment into the lung. Allergic airway inflammation (asthma) can be triggered in mice by repeated exposure of the airways to antigens. For example, exposure of naive mice to A. fumigatus antigens 3 doses/week for 3 weeks results in marked inflammatory responses. We therefore subjected eotaxin transgenic mice to Aspergillus-induced allergic airway inflammation to determine if the eotaxin transgene would enhance eosinophil recruitment. In wild-type mice, 18 h after the last allergen exposure, there was ∼100-fold increase in the total BALF cells with the largest increase being in the eosinophil lineage (4 ± 2 × 103 to 1.9 ± 0.16 × 106) followed by the neutrophil lineage (1.3 ± 1.2 × 104 to 5.6 ± 2.4 × 105). We next examined the effect of the airway challenge on the number of eosinophils in the eotaxin transgenic mice. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant difference in eosinophil levels between wild-type and eotaxin transgenic mice (Fig.3). Although a highly significant increase in eosinophil numbers was observed in both groups when compared with their respective saline control mice, the number of eosinophils in the allergen-challenged wild-type and eotaxin transgenic mice was comparable (1.39 ± 1.06 × 106 and 3.2 ± 1.5 × 106, respectively). Similarly, levels of eosinophils in the lung tissue did not differ between wild-type and transgenic mice (data not shown). Since we expected the eotaxin transgene to cooperate with allergen-induced signals in the lung thereby promoting increased eosinophil levels, we hypothesized that allergen challenge might be inhibiting the expression of the transgene. We therefore examined the effect of airway inflammation on the transgene expression. Interestingly, whereas eotaxin transgenic mice had readily detectable transgene expression following saline treatment, the transgene mRNA was barely detectable following allergen challenge (Fig.4 A). The decreased expression of the transgene was seen in all hSP-C eotaxin transgenic lines (data not shown). We also subjected sensitized mice to allergen challenge with OVA to determine if the allergen-induced SP-C down-regulation was applicable to other allergens. Similar to the effects of challenge withA. fumigatus, OVA exposure also down-regulated the level of the eotaxin transgene (Fig.4 B). We were next interested in determining if allergic airway inflammation was a nonspecific phenomenon associated with the down-regulation of other epithelial genes. We therefore examined the expression of the endogenous murine surfactant proteins and eotaxin. Of note, the mRNA for SP-D, and to a lesser extent SP-A, was increased following allergen challenge compared with saline challenge (Fig.5 A). Additionally, the protein level of SP-D, and to a lesser extent SP-A, was also increased. Interestingly, whereas the endogenous SP-C mRNA was not altered at this time point, the level of the SP-C protein was substantially reduced (Fig. 5 B). We also examined the expression of the endogenous eotaxin mRNA. As expected, allergen challenge markedly increased the level of eotaxin in the lung. Taken together, these results establish that the down-regulation of the hSP-C transgene by allergen was a specific event, not likely related to generalized epithelial cell toxicity. We were next interested in ruling out the possibility that the mechanism for the down-regulation of the transgene by allergen was dependent upon the presence of the eotaxin cDNA in the genetic construct. Although unlikely, it remained possible that the inhibition of the transgene was dependent upon sequences in the eotaxin cDNA or that the overexpressed eotaxin protein was inhibiting the transgene. To test these possibilities, we examined the effect of allergen challenge on an independent hSP-C transgenic mouse line. We examined transgenic mice that contained the hSP-B cDNA under the control of the same 3.7-kb hSP-C promoter used in the eotaxin transgenic mice (construct II in Fig. 1) (16Lin S. Na C.L. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, down-regulation of the hSP-C-SP-B transgene in response to allergen was observed in all mice when compared with their respective saline-treated controls (Fig.6). It remained possible that the ability of allergen exposure to decrease the level of transgenes regulated by the hSP-C promoter was dependent upon the 3′-UTR of the transgenic construct, since 3′-UTR have been shown to be involved in mRNA stability (30Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Since the hSP-C transgenic construct contained a viral polyadenylation signal (from SV40) (14Korfhagen T.R. Glasser S.W. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. Daugherty C.C. McNeish J.D. Stock J.L. Potter S.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we were interested in examining the effect of allergen challenge in hSP-C transgenic mice that utilized the same 3.7-kb hSP-C promoter but a different 3′-UTR. To test this, we employed transgenic mice that contained a mammalian-derived 3′-UTR composed of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence (construct III in Fig. 1) (17Beck D.C. Na C.L. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3371-3376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed down-regulation of the hSP-C-transgene in these mice in response to allergen when compared with saline-treated controls (Fig. 7). Taken together, these results demonstrate that allergen-induced inflammation down-regulates the hSP-C transgene by directly affecting the hSP-C promoter. We hypothesized that the influx of inflammatory cells during allergic airway inflammation was involved in down-regulating the SP-C transgene. Since eosinophils are the predominant inflammatory cell in A. fumigatus-induced allergic airway inflammation, we were interested in determining if these cells could directly down-regulate the SP-C transgene. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with neutralizing doses of anti-IL-5, a well accepted approach for attenuating allergen-induced eosinophil recruitment to the lungs (31Coffman R.L. Seymour B.W. Hudak S. Jackson J. Rennick D. Science. 1989; 245: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). For example, eosinophils were 1.8 ± 0.4 × 106 and 1.0 ± 0.3 × 104 in the BALF of allergen-challenged mice following nonimmune control and anti-IL-5 serum, respectively. Interestingly, mice treated with anti-IL-5 (but not isotype matched control antiserum) were resistant to allergen-induced SP-C inhibition. Northern blot analysis of lung RNA revealed readily detectable transgene mRNA levels in mice treated with saline and in allergen-challenged mice pretreated with anti-IL-5 (Fig.8 A). In contrast, allergen-challenged mice treated with control antiserum had a markedly reduced level of transgene mRNA. Quantitative analysis of the transgene mRNA level, performed by normalization of the mRNA signal to the 28 S ribosomal protein mRNA, revealed no significant inhibition of transgene mRNA in mice treated with anti-IL-5 (Fig.8 B). These data suggest that the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation was responsible for the inhibition of the hSP-C promoter. Surfactant proteins have been recognized as essential molecules involved in two main critical processes in the lung, maintenance of alveolar surfactant function and host defense. As such, they have the potential to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, an allergic inflammatory disorder of the lungs characterized by airway obstruction. To examine this process, we have subjected mice to experimental models of asthma (antigen-induced allergic airway inflammation) and examined the effect on transgenes regulated by the hSP-C promoter, as well as on the level of endogenous surfactant proteins. We have found the following: 1) allergen challenge inhibits the human SP-C promoter; 2) that allergen-induced inhibition of the hSP-C promoter is dependent on IL-5, suggesting a critical role for eosinophilic inflammation in this process; and 3) that allergen challenge increases the surfactant proteins known to be involved in innate immune responses (SP-A and SP-D). Previous studies on the expression of surfactant proteins in patients with asthma have been limited to analysis of surfactant activity in BALF rather than surfactant protein mRNA levels, since surfactant is synthesized by small airway and alveolar cells that reside in regions that are difficult to sample experimentally in humans. Several recent clinical studies have shown that the BALF of patients with asthma at base line or following segmental allergen challenge contains dysfunctional surfactant (10Hohlfeld J.M. Ahlf K. Enhorning G. Balke K. Erpenbeck V.J. Petschallies J. Hoymann H.G. Fabel H. Krug N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Jarjour N.N. Enhorning G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, experimental dissection in a guinea pig model of asthma has revealed that allergen challenge decreases the surfactant activity in the BALF (32Liu M. Wang L. Li E. Enhorning G. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1996; 26: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, significant changes in surfactant levels have been reported in patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and adult respiratory distress syndrome (1Mason R.J. Greene K. Voelker D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1-L13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of experimental allergen challenge on the expression of the hSP-C promoter. We have chosen to focus primarily on transgenic mice expressing reporter genes under the control of the hSP-C 3.7-kb promoter. Although this region may have distinct regulatory elements compared with the mouse or human SP-C promoter, it is sufficient for directing specific gene expression in type II pneumocytes, the cells that normally synthesize SP-C. This promoter construct has been used to generate over 100 different transgenic mouse lines for extensive analysis of lung development and function (15Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L489-L497PubMed Google Scholar, 27Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial results were limited to hSP-C transgenic mice overexpressing murine eotaxin cDNA and demonstrated that allergen challenge markedly inhibited the expression of this transgene. Experimental dissection of hSP-C transgenic mice that were generated with distinct reporter cDNAs (e.g. SP-B instead of eotaxin) and 3′-UTRs (e.g. bovine growth hormone instead of the SV40 polyadenylation signal) revealed that allergen challenge was affecting the hSP-C promoter, rather than other elements present in the transgenic construct. Most experimental allergen challenges were conducted utilizing A. fumigatus as an antigen. It should be noted that this antigen was selected because it represents a model antigen that has already been extensively analyzed (33Kurup V.P. Mauze S. Choi H. Seymour B.W. Coffman R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3783-3788PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kurup V.P. Choi H. Murali P.S. Coffman R.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Kurup V.P. Seymour B.W. Choi H. Coffman R.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To prove that the results were not strictly related to this allergen, an unrelated antigen (OVA) was used to demonstrate that the effect was not allergen-specific. Additionally, airway inflammation itself, and not allergen challenge, was demonstrated to be responsible for inhibition of the hSP-C promoter. In particular, depletion of allergen-induced airway eosinophilia with antiserum against IL-5 resulted in abolishment of the inhibitory effect of allergen challenge. These data suggested that eosinophil influx into the lung was responsible for inhibition of the hSP-C promoter. Eosinophils are known to be a rich source of pleiotropic molecules including lipid mediators (e.g.leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor), cationic granule proteins (e.g. major basic protein), and cytokines (e.g.IL-1 and transforming growth factor-α/β) (36Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Adv. Immunol. 1986; 39: 177-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 37Kita H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Rothenberg M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pulmonary epithelial cells express receptors for several of these products including tumor necrosis factor-α and transforming growth factor-α/β. Interestingly, transcription of the SP-C promoter is inhibited by certain proinflammatory triggers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (39Bachurski C.J. Pryhuber G.S. Glasser S.W. Kelly S.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19402-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the mouse SP-C gene, the tumor necrosis factor-α-sensitive elements are located 320 base pairs 5′ from the start of transcription (39Bachurski C.J. Pryhuber G.S. Glasser S.W. Kelly S.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19402-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it should be pointed out that although the 3.7-kb hSP-C promoter has been extensively characterized and appears to function similar to the endogenous promoter, it remains possible that promoter elements not included in the 3.7-kb region may be differentially affected by allergen challenge. This concern may explain the finding that the endogenous mouse SPC mRNA is not substantially reduced by allergen challenge. However, since the SPC protein level is reduced by allergen challenge, we favor the view that the mouse SPC mRNA is down-regulated at earlier points in the allergen challenge regime. Alternatively, the hSPC promoter may be distinctly inhibited by allergic airway inflammation compared with the mouse SPC promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that allergen exposure induces eosinophilic lung inflammation which inhibits the transcription of the hSP-C promoter. In contrast to the inhibition of the hSP-C promoter by allergen challenge, we have found that allergic lung inflammation increases the levels of SP-A and SP-D (but not SP-B). These proteins are known to be critically involved in innate immune responses. Interestingly, the binding of SP-A and SP-D to A. fumigatus enhances the phagocytosis of this organism by human neutrophils and alveolar macrophages (40Madan T. Eggleton P. Kishore U. Strong P. Aggrawal S.S. Sarma P.U. Reid K.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3171-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Allen M.J. Harbeck R. Smith B. Voelker D.R. Mason R.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4563-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these proteins can inhibit specific IgE binding to A. fumigatus allergens and block allergen-induced histamine release from human basophils (42Madan T. Kishore U. Shah A. Eggleton P. Strong P. Wang J.Y. Aggrawal S.S. Sarma P.U. Reid K.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of allergen challenge to increase the level of the surfactant proteins involved in immune responses indicates that these proteins are indeed likely to be involved in the host response to allergens. Finally, our results have several biological conclusions concerning eosinophil recruitment to the lung. We demonstrate that overexpression of eotaxin in the lung is not sufficient for eosinophil recruitment to this organ. This is consistent with the finding that eotaxin is constitutively produced by epithelial cells in the murine lung but not associated with substantial levels of pulmonary eosinophils (43Gonzalo J.-A. Jia G.-Q. Aquirre V. Friend D. Coyle A.J. Jenkins N.A. Lin G.-S. Katz H. Lichtman A. Copeland N. Kopf M. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Immunity. 1996; 4: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In contrast, in other organs such as the small intestine, eotaxin expression is critical for base-line eosinophil tissue homing (23Matthews A.N. Friend D.S. Zimmermann N. Sarafi M.N. Luster A.D. Pearlman E. Wert S.E. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that overexpression of eotaxin is not associated with eosinophil desensitization, as has been reported with other chemokine transgenic mice (44Rutledge B.J. Rayburn H. Rosenberg R. North R.J. Gladue R.P. Corless C.L. Rollins B.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4838-4843PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, we found no significant difference in the level of allergen-induced eosinophil recruitment into the lung of transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3). In conclusion, these findings indicate that attention should be focused on the level of expression of transgenes regulated by the hSP-C promoter when hSP-C transgenic mice are subjected to inflammatory triggers. Additionally, these results suggest that surfactant protein dysfunction in patients with asthma is likely to be caused, at least in part, by allergen-induced and IL-5-dependent decreases in the level of SP-C.

Simon Hogan and Nives Zimmermann for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2030370899,"Gene expression, protein expression, and function of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels were examined in human lymphocytes from normal individuals and individuals with Liddle's disease. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions, expression of all three cloned epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits was detected in lymphocytes. Polyclonal antibodies to bovine α-ENaC bound to the plasma membrane of normal and Liddle's lymphocytes. A quantitative analysis of fluorescence-tagged ENaC antibodies indicated a 2.5-fold greater surface binding of the antibodies to Liddle's lymphocytes compared with normal lymphocytes. The relative binding intensity increased significantly (25%;p < 0.001) for both normal and Liddle's cells after treatment with 40 μm 8-CPT-cAMP. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were recorded under basal and cAMP-treated conditions for both cell types. Liddle's cells had a 4.5-fold larger inward sodium conductance compared with normal cells. A specific 25% increase in the inward sodium current was observed in normal cells in response to cAMP treatment. Outside-out patches from both cell types under both treatment conditions revealed no obvious differences in the single channel conductance. The P open was 4.2 ± 3.9% for patches from non-Liddle's cells, and 27.7 ± 5.4% in patches from Liddle's lymphocytes. Biochemical purification of a protein complex, using the same antibodies used for the immunohistochemistry, yielded a functional sodium channel complex that was inhibited by amiloride when reconstituted into lipid vesicles and incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. These four independent methodologies yielded findings consistent with the hypotheses that human lymphocytes express functional, regulatable ENaC and that the mutation responsible for Liddle's disease induces excessive channel expression.

The most extensively studied are the toad urinary bladder (1Frings S. Purves R.D. Macknight A.D.,. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 106: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Garty H. Warncke J. Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the mammalian renal cortical collecting duct (3Schafer J.A. Troutman S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1063-F1072PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schlatter E. Schafer J.A.,. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 409: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the toad renal cell line (A-6) (5Eaton D.C. Hamilton K.L. Ion Channels. 1988; 1: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A prominent physiological function of these cell types is the vectorial transport of Na+ and water. Epithelial cells of the lung also express amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. However, the specific function of these channels is less clearly defined than that of the salt-reabsorbing epithelia (7Matalon S. O'Brodovich H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Also, the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of lung epithelial cell amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are somewhat different from those of renal cells. These channels have a different affinity for amiloride, different unitary conductance, and different cationic selectivities (8Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 509-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Palmer L.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Rossier B. Canessa C.M. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Curr. Opin. Neph. Hyperten. 1994; 3: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels have also been linked to taste (11Avenet P. Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The current carried by these channels can only be partially inhibited by amiloride (12Lindemann B. Curr. Topics Membr. 1999; 47: 315-336Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reasons for these differences are not clear. Possible explanations include multiple channel types derived from post-translational modifications of ENaC1 or the expression of completely different gene products. Human lymphocytes express a sodium conductance that is activated by cyclic AMP and inhibited by low concentrations of amiloride (IC50 = ∼75 nm) (13Bubien J.K. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1175-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sodium conductance with the same properties has been observed in whole cell clamped, principal cells isolated from the renal cortical collecting duct of the rat (14Bubien J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C791-C796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological and regulatory properties of the lymphocyte and renal principal cell channels suggest that they may be the same protein complex. Also, whole cell clamped lymphocytes isolated from individuals with Liddle's disease have a constitutively activated inward sodium conductance (15Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Cornwell T. Lifton R.P. Fuller C.M. Achard J.-M. Benos D.J. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C208-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of cyclic AMP to these whole cell clamped cells has no effect on the sodium conductance. In contrast, whole cell clamped lymphocytes from unaffected family members do not exhibit any constitutively active sodium current, even at strong hyperpolarizing voltage-clamp steps (i.e. −140 to −160 mV). The apparent constitutive activation of the Na+conductance could account for the hypertensive pathophysiology associated with Liddle's disease. Despite these biophysical similarities and the obvious abnormalities in sodium conductance regulation observed in whole cell clamped lymphocytes from individuals with Liddle's disease, there has been some question as to the identity of the protein responsible for the amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance of lymphocytes. To resolve this question, we tested the hypothesis that lymphocytes express the ENaC by four independent methods (electrophysiological, immunocytochemical, biochemical, and molecular biological). The findings from each method indicated that ENaC was expressed by human lymphocytes. Also, because amiloride inhibited all the sodium conductance, the findings ruled out the possibility that other sodium channels, such as the voltage-gated sodium channel found in nerve and muscle, were expressed by lymphocytes. This comprehensive investigation is the only set of data on ENaC of which we are aware that has utilized molecular biology, electrophysiology, protein chemistry, and immunofluorescence on a single cell type. The findings from all of these studies support the hypothesis that human lymphocyte ENaC has biophysical and regulatory characteristics that accurately reflect ENaC characteristics expressed by renal principal cells. Microelectrode pipette solutions contained 100 mmpotassium-gluconate, 30 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 mm ATP, and <10 nm free calcium and were buffered to a pH of 7.2. All electrophysiological measurements were obtained with a bath solution of serum free RPMI 1640 culture medium, buffered to a pH of 7.4, at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C). Whole cell current records were obtained by formation of conventional whole cells. Briefly, after formation of high resistance seals between patch electrodes and lymphocyte plasma membranes (>3 Gohms), a sharp suction pulse was applied to rupture physically the plasma membrane under the seal, leaving the seal resistance unchanged. The increased cellular capacitance indicated the successful formation of the whole cell configuration. The capacitance was balanced using the appropriate circuits of the Axopatch 200 patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instrs.). The voltage clamp protocol was to hold the cells at −60 mV for 200 ms and clamp to membrane potentials ranging from −160 to + 40 mV for 800 ms in sequential 20 mV increments, returning to the holding potential for 200 ms between each clamp step. Single amiloride-sensitive sodium channels were recorded in the outside-out patch configuration. This configuration was chosen because amiloride only inhibits the channels from the extracellular face of the channels. In the outside-out configuration, the outsides of the channels were exposed to the bath solution. Thus, superfusing the preparations with 2 μm amiloride-supplemented RPMI was used as a straightforward method for establishing the identity of the channels. All experiments were performed on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed non-Liddle's cells (Daudi) or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes from the proband for Liddle's disease. Normal and Liddle's lymphocytes were fixed in a 3:1 mixture of methanol:acetic acid mixture at −20 °C, for 30 min. After fixation, the cells were treated with a 3% formaldehyde solution, subsequently washed twice, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were treated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline to eliminate nonspecific protein binding and subsequently incubated in the same solution, supplemented with anti-bENaC (amiloride-sensitive sodium channels purified from bovine kidney) antibodies or nonimmune rabbit IgG as a negative antibody control for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. The antibody-bound cells were incubated in goat anti-rabbit Oregon green-conjugated antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and stained with Hoechst stain (20 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were washed and mounted in 0.1%p-phenylene diamine in 9:1 glycerol:phosphate-buffered saline. The mounted cells were examined, and the relative fluorescence intensity was quantitated using fluorescent confocal microscopy (Scanolytics, Fairfax, VA; VayTek Ink., Fairfield, IA). For total RNA isolation, we used the commercially available Tri-Reagent total RNA isolation protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). A 250-μl suspension of ∼20 × 108 B-lymphocytes (in water) was mixed with 750 μl of Tri-Reagent to lyse the cells. The lysed cell suspension was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min to dissociate the nucleoprotein complexes. The tube was then spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. To the supernatant was added 200 μl of chloroform, and the contents of the tube were mixed vigorously for 15 s, stored at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min (12,000 ×g maximum). The contents separated into three phases. The colorless aqueous phase contained the RNA. The aqueous phase was transferred to another tube and mixed with 110volume of isopropanol. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g (maximum) for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate DNA. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and the RNA was precipitated by the addition of 450 μl of isopropanol, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA precipitate was washed once with 75% ethanol (at a rate of 1 ml/750 μl of Tri-Reagent) followed by vortexing and then centrifugation at 12,000 × g (maximum) for 5 min at 4 °C. After removal of the ethanol, the pellet was air dried for 30 min and solubilized in 30 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate water, to ensure RNase-free conditions, for 15 min at 60 °C. First-strand syntheses were performed using a modification of the MasterAmp High Fidelity RT-PCR Kit protocol (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). Briefly, 25 ml of MasterAmp 2× RT-PCR premix plus 2 μl (40 units/μl) of MMLV-RT Plus 50 ng of total RNA (prepared as above), and 100 pmol of the gene-specific reverse primer were combined in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. For PCR amplification of specific ENaC subunits (α, β, and γ), we used 10 μl of the reversed transcribed product for each specific gene as template in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 100 pmol of each specific subunit forward and reverse primer for 50 cycles. Primers were designed based upon GenBankTM sequences (α-subunit, SCNN1A, accession number Z92981; β-subunit, SCNN1B, accession numberU16023; and γ-subunit, SCNN1G, accession number L36592). The specific PCR primers and expected product sizes were: α PCR primers: forward, 5′-GAA CAA CTC CAA CCT CTG GAT GTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCT TGG TGC AGT CGC CAT AAT C-3′, with an expected product size with cDNA of 257 bp; β PCR primers: forward, 5′-TGC TGT GCC TCA TCG AGT TTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGC AGA CGC AGG GAG TCA TAG TTG-3′, with an expected product size with cDNA of 277 bp; and γ PCR primers: forward, 5′-TCA AGA AGA ATC TGC CCG TGA C-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGA AGT GGA CTT TGA TGG AAA CTG-3′, with an expected product size with cDNA of 237 bp. The gene-specific reverse primers were used for cDNA synthesis. As a control for our gene expression assay, primers for the α-subunit were designed to span introns between exons 5 and 6 and between exons 6 and 7. Thus, the expected size for the α-subunit using genomic DNA was 1023 bp. PCR products derived from α-subunit cDNA using the same primer set were expected to be 257 bp. Primers for the β-subunit were within a single exon. Given the partial and equivocal sequence data for the γ-sequence in GenBankTM, primer design was guided by published intron/exon boundaries (16Thomas C.P. Doggett N.A. Fisher R. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26062-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Primers known to reside in introns were used to test for the presence of genomic DNA. For the α-subunit, PCR reaction was performed in a final reaction volume of 25 μl using 7.5 μl of double-distilled H2O, 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (final concentration, 1× (Promega); final concentration, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 200 μm each dNTP (2.0 μl), 100 pmol each of the α-forward (100 pmol) and α-reverse (100 primers), 5 unitsTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 10 μl of template cDNA. Cycle conditions were 94 °C for 5 min for 1 cycle followed by 94 °C for 1 min, 60 C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 50 cycles. The PCR reaction mix for the β-subunit and γ-subunit were the same except for the appropriate gene-specific primers. The PCR amplification conditions for β-subunit and γ-subunit were also the same as for the α-subunit except the annealing temperature for β was 63 °C. A second round of PCR amplification was performed using 2 μl of the 50-μl reaction product as template for a total of 30 cycles. PCR products for all subunits were gel purified using the commercially available QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified products were directly sequenced using the gene-specific forward or reverse primer. Sequencing was performed using the Applied Biosystems Inc. model 377 sequencer in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Microbiology Sequencing Core. Lymphocytes isolated from blood samples collected from patients with Liddle's syndrome (Liddle's) and from unaffected relatives (normal) were Epstein-Barr virus-transformed and grown in continuous culture in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (95% air) in 75-cm2tissue culture flasks. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The lymphocytes were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dounce buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm MgCl2, supplemented with protease inhibitors: 2 μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated 10 min on ice. This suspension was homogenized for 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Tonicity restoration buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 600 mm NaCl) was added to a final NaCl concentration of 150 mm. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was discarded. 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, was added to the supernatant to achieve a final concentration of 5 mmand then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The final pellet was solubilized overnight in a solution of 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm CHAPS, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (no DNase). For affinity purification, 5 mg of a polyclonal antibody raised against a bovine kidney papillary Na+ channel protein complex was irreversibly bound to protein A immobilized on agarose gel (Pierce). 2 ml of gel were first packed in a plastic column and equilibrated with 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.2. The gel was resuspended in a solution of the IgG and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Free antibody was washed from the gel with borate buffer. Bound IgG was cross-linked to the protein A by suspending the gel in a 6.6 mg/ml solution of dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Unreacted imidate groups were blocked by incubating the column in 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.2, for 10 min at room temperature. Lastly, the column was washed with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.8, and then borate buffer. Before affinity purification, the column was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Solubilized lymphocyte membrane proteins were applied to either column, allowed to run into the gel bed, and incubated there for 1 h at room temperature. The column was drained and washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate until the absorbance (A 280) of the wash from the column was the same as that of phosphate buffer alone. Bound protein was then eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, in 500-μl fractions that were neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Absorbance measurements at A 280 were used to determine which fractions contained antigen. To visualize the products, immunopurified proteins were diluted to 100 μl with phosphate-buffered saline prior to iodination with chloramine T and carrier-free 125I. Iodinated proteins were separated from unbound label on Sephadex G-25–150 columns, mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and electrophoresed through 8% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. To study the single channel activity of the normal and Liddle's protein preparations, they were reconstituted into proteoliposomes and incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The protein-containing fractions eluted from the antibody column were concentrated to 100 μl and then combined with a mixture of 500 μg of phosphatidylethanolamine, 300 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 200 μg of phosphatidylcholine. Extracti-Gel D, previously washed with KCl buffer (400 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2) was added, and the total volume was brought to 600 μl with KCl buffer. This mixture was incubated first at room temperature for 45 min and then at 4 °C for 16 h with agitation. Extracti-Gel D was allowed to settle out of the resulting proteoliposome suspension by gravity. The protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Planar lipid bilayers were made from a phospholipid solution containing a 2:1 mixture of diphytanoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine/diphytanoyl-phosphatidylserine inn-octane (final lipid concentration, 25 mg/ml). Bilayers were bathed with 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mmMOPS-Tris buffer (pH 7.4). All solutions were filter-sterilized. Current measurements were performed using a high gain amplifier circuit. Applied voltage is referenced to the trans-chamber, which was connected to the current-to-voltage converter, and therefore was at virtual ground. Acquisition and analysis of single channel recordings were performed using pCLAMP software and hardware (Axon Instruments, CA). Data were stored digitally and were filtered at 300 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter prior to acquisition at 1 ms/point. All the analyses were performed for single active channels. The records shown here are representative of 19 separate experiments. Amiloride sensitivity of the immunopurified channels in the bilayer was determined by the addition of the drug to the trans-solution of the bilayer. Using total RNA prepared from lymphocytes we have synthesized cDNA using gene-specific primes for the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the human amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel. Fig.1 shows the PCR products obtained using gene-specific cDNA prepared from B-lymphocytes as template. To test the efficacy of our cDNA preparation method and to confirm that our PCR products were indeed derived from cDNA and not genomic DNA, we designed primers flanking two introns in the α-subunit. When the same PCR primers were used for amplification of a segment of the α-subunit using genomic DNA and cDNA, two bands of different but expected sizes were obtained: 1023 bp for the genomic DNA and 257 bp for the α-subunit cDNA. Based upon the intron/exon composition and/or the lack of a clear and complete sequence for the β- and γ-subunits, a similar strategy for these units was not productive. Particularly problematic was designing primers that yield a product size amenable to direct sequencing. However, when one of the primers known to occur within an intron was used in an attempt to amplify these subunits, no amplification was obtained with our cDNAs as would be expected. PCR products for the α- and β-ENaC subunits obtained with our cDNA were of expected size and are shown in Fig. 1. Sequencing was used as a final confirmation of the subunit segments amplified from cDNA. Direct sequencing revealed that we indeed amplified the α- and β-subunits. Our cDNA sequencing results for the γ-subunit were problematic. This problem persisted even though the same primer sets were used to amplify genomic DNA and the product was successfully sequenced. The reverse primer of the same primer set was used for the cDNA synthesis and yielded the expected size band. Attempts at resolution have included efforts to sequence in both forward and reverse directions and amplification with the original primer set and then using nested primers to reduce the likelihood of any nonspecificity. Finally, we have considered the occurrence of a polynucleotide tract causing the Taq DNA polymerase drop-off as well as the presence of secondary structure. The addition of Me2SO was not useful. Additionally, alternative primer sets have been designed; however, there remains a persistent lack of sequence data. This was a consistent negative observation, irrespective of whether the primer set is the one described or alternative ones tested. This finding would suggest that there is little or no expression of the γ-subunit in B-lymphocytes. When human lymphocytes are whole cell clamped using “normal” ionic gradients, they exhibit a variety of ionic conductances. However, when the cells are hyperpolarized there is very little, inward current (Fig. 2, top left panel). Addition of the membrane permeant active analog of cyclic AMP (8-CPT-cAMP; final concentration, 40 μm) to the bath solution significantly (p < 0.05,n = 6) increased the inward conductance at hyperpolarizing clamp potentials by 25% (Figs. 2, top right panel, and 3). As shown previously, the inward current that was activated by cAMP treatment can be completely inhibited by 2 μm amiloride (13Bubien J.K. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1175-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bubien J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C791-C796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Cornwell T.

Constitutively activated single channels were observed in five of six outside-out patches. The constitutively active channels were inhibited >90% by 2 μm amiloride. Amplitude histogram analysis showed that the number of openings was reduced but the single channel conductance remained unchanged by amiloride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After formation of the whole cell configuration, slow withdrawal of the patch electrode often results in resealing of the membrane fracture, with the outside of the resealed membrane facing the bath solution. The result of this procedure is an isolated membrane patch in the outside-out configuration. For the study of ENaC single channels, this patch orientation is useful because amiloride inhibits these channels from the outside only. Thus, in the outside-out configuration, amiloride can be used to identify unambiguously amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, such as ENaC. When the outside-out configuration was formed on normal (i.e. non-Liddle's) lymphocytes, no inward single channel currents were observed when the electrical potential gradient was directed inward, in six of six consecutive patches. This finding was consistent with the basal whole cell conductance, which was very small, even at strong hyperpolarizing potentials. However, single channels were observed in five of six outside-out patches formed from cells that were previously treated with 40 μm 8-CPT-cAMP and had large inward whole cell currents prior to the formation of the outside-out configuration (Fig. 2, middle left panel). These channels were completely inhibited by 2 μm amiloride (Fig. 2, middle right panel). Analysis of the single channel records yielded a single channel conductance of 10 pS (0.6 pA) of current at a potential of 60 mV; Fig. 2, bottom left panel). Also, the time spent in the open configuration was brief (τ < 10 ms; Fig. 2, bottom right panel), with relatively long closures between multiple channel bursts of opening. The same electrophysiological analysis was performed on lymphocytes from individuals with Liddle's disease, with somewhat different results. All of the cells examined had a constitutively activated inward conductance at hyperpolarized clamp potentials (Fig.3, top panel). Unlike non-Liddle's cells, treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP did not significantly alter the whole cell currents. Another difference between Liddle's lymphocytes and non-Liddle's lymphocytes was observed after formation of outside-out patches. Single channel currents were observed in five of six outside-out patches made on Liddle's lymphocytes, without pretreatment with 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3,middle left panel). More than 90% of this single channel activity was inhibited by 2 μm amiloride (Fig. 3,middle right panel), as determined by amplitude histogram analysis (Fig. 3, bottom panel). The amplitude histogram also revealed that the single channel conductance (∼10 pS; 0.65 pA at 60 mV) was not different from that measured for amiloride-inhibitable single channels in outside-out patches from non-Liddle's cells. The basal inward currents from Liddle's cells and the cAMP-activated inward currents from non-Liddle's cells typically had a “ragged” appearance. The corresponding single channel records typically showed bursts of rapid openings and closures from multiple channels within the patches. The whole cell current characteristics and single channel characteristics were compared by summing 30 sequential 800-ms segments of single channel activity at each clamp potential to produce a “virtual” whole cell current. The parameters underlying this analysis were that the patch contained eight channels, and that each cell contained ∼716 ± 264 channels within the plasma membrane. The channel number was estimated from a conventional [14C]amil"

The cytoplasmic portion of CD4 is thought to amplify TCR-initiated signal transduction via its association with the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck. Here we describe a novel functional determinant in the cytosolic tail of CD4 that inhibits TCR-induced T cell activation. Deletion of two conserved hydrophobic amino acids from the CD4 carboxyl terminus resulted in a pronounced enhancement of CD4-mediated T cell costimulation. This effect was observed in the presence or absence of p56lck, implying involvement of alternative cytosolic ligands of CD4. A two-hybrid screen with the intracellular portion of CD4 identified a previously unknown 33-kDa protein, ACP33 (acidic clusterprotein 33), as a novel intracellular binding partner of CD4. Since interaction with ACP33 is abolished by deletion of the hydrophobic CD4 C-terminal amino acids mediating repression of T cell activation, we propose that ACP33 modulates the stimulatory activity of CD4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that interaction with CD4 is mediated by the noncatalytic α/β hydrolase fold domain of ACP33. This suggests a previously unrecognized function for α/β hydrolase fold domains as a peptide binding module mediating protein-protein interactions.

Early clues to CD4 function came from a strong correlation between CD4 expression and MHC1 class II restricted T helper cell activity that corresponds to the MHC class I-mediated cytotoxic response of CD8-positive T cells. Subsequent studies using targeted gene disruption in mice and antigen-dependentin vitro T cell activation assays implicated an important role of CD4 in T helper cell development and activation (1Killeen N. Littman D.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 89-106PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zamoyska R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of CD4 function is based on its direct interaction with invariant regions of MHC class II molecules on ACPs (3Konig R. Fleury S. Germain R.N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 19-46PubMed Google Scholar), hence stabilizing low affinity TCR-peptide-MHC complexes. To attain maximum T cell costimulation, CD4 must be specifically recruited to antigen-engaged TCR molecules (4Madrenas J. Chau L.A. Smith J. Bluestone J.A. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This selective recruitment is thought to be mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of CD4, which in turn is associated with the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck (5Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 6Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5190-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In this context, the phosphotyrosine-binding Src homology 2 domain of Lck has been shown to be sufficient for this interaction (7Xu H. Littman D.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and involves phosphorylated and TCR-associated ZAP-70 as a ligand (8Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to its adaptor function, p56lck is thought to amplify TCR-dependent signal transduction by phosphorylation of phosphotyrosine adapter molecules, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of CD3 chain and the activation loop of ZAP-70 (9Ravichandran K.S. Collins T.L. Burakoff S.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 47-62PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both extracellular and cytosolic domains of CD4 are required for optimal coreceptor function. This bifunctional activity might account for the variable requirements for CD4 costimulation by different antigen-dependent T cell lines (10Vidal K. Daniel C. Hill M. Littman D.R. Allen P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4811-4818PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to its stimulatory role during antigen-dependent T cell activation, CD4 transmits inhibitory signals to T cells when engaged independently of the TCR complex, e.g. by the proposed natural CD4 ligands IL-16 (11Cruikshank W.W. Kornfeld H. Center D.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and gp17 (12Gaubin M. Autiero M. Basmaciogullari S. Metivier D. Mis H.Z. Culerrier R. Oudin A. Guardiola J. Piatier T.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2631-2638PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation with IL-16 has been shown to counteract mitogen- or TCR-induced activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes (13Cruikshank W.W. Lim K. Theodore A.C. Cook J. Fine G. Weller P.F. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5240-5248PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ogasawara H. Takeda H.N. Sekigawa I. Hashimoto H. Kaneko Y. Hirose S. Immunology. 1999; 96: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since gp120 treatment of T lymphocytes leads to induction of anergy or apoptosis (15Laurent C.A. Coccia E. Krust B. Hovanessian A.G. Res. Virol. 1995; 146: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), binding of gp120 to CD4 is thought to contribute to the depletion of CD4-positive T cells in HIV-infected patients. Similarly, antibody-mediated CD4 clustering results in inhibitory signals that render T cells unresponsive to subsequent stimulation by TCR engagement (16Bank I. Chess L. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Janeway C.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 645-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 18Julius M. Maroun C.R. Haughn L. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The latter finding is especially relevant for therapeutic approaches involving administration of anti-CD4 antibodies in vivo for the treatment of autoimmune syndromes, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, and allograft rejection. The molecular basis for the inhibitory CD4 signaling is not known but has recently been shown to be, to some extent, independent of p56lck under different conditions. For instance, anti-CD4 antibodies block ongoing antigen-induced T cell activation in cell lines expressing a CD4 mutant unable to associate with p56lck, indicating that sequestration of Lck can only partially account for CD4-mediated inhibition of IL-2 production (19Bonnard M. Haughn L. Julius M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1252-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, HIV gp120-induced apoptosis of a lymphoblastoid T cell line did not require p56lck signaling (20Moutouh L. Estaquier J. Richman D.D. Corbeil J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8061-8072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in Lck-deficient cell lines HIV replication was nevertheless blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies directed against the CDR3-like region (21Lemasson I. Briant L. Hague B. Coudronniere N. Heron L. David C. Rebouissou C. Kindt T. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coudronniere N. Corbeil J. Robert H.V. Mesnard J.M. Devaux C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that inhibitory signal transduction by CD4 is mediated by alternative ligands of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain (23Mesnard J.M. Lemasson I. Devaux C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 99: S210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results prompted us and others to investigate CD4-dependent signal transduction during T cell activation in more detail. Interestingly, the phosphotyrosine adaptor molecule linker for activation of T cells (LAT) has recently been identified as an alternative CD4 cytoplasmic tail ligand and might contribute to CD4-mediated stimulation of TCR signaling (24Bosselut R. Zhang W. Ashe J.M. Kopacz J.L. Samelson L.E. Singer A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the hydrophobic C terminus of CD4 and discovered that it contains a negative regulatory determinant of T cell activation. Moreover, we identified a novel CD4-interacting protein, ACP33, as a candidate molecule for mediating negative signaling by the hydrophobic C terminus of CD4. Full-length cDNA coding for ACP33 was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen using a transactivator fusion protein cDNA library in conjunction with a LEXA fusion of the cytoplasmic tail of human CD4 (amino acids 399–433), essentially as described before (25Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The coding region for ACP33 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the cIg fusion protein expression vector p5C7 (26Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the cIg-ACP33 construct was performed by polymerase chain reaction to obtain a substitution of serine 109 by alanine. Full-length cDNAs of human CD4 and p56lck were obtained from Brian Seed (Harvard University) and subcloned intoHindIII and NotI restriction sites of the mammalian expression plasmid pN1 (CLONTECH). Truncation mutants of CD4 and a double point mutation changing cysteines 420 and 422 to alanines were generated by replacing theBpu1102I–NotI fragment of pCD4-N1 with polymerase chain reaction products. For generation of stable transgenic cells, a new vector, pEF-IRESpuro, was constructed by inserting the CD4 cDNA, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (27Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and a puromycin resistance gene into the pEF-BOS expression cassette (28Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Jurkat E6, JCaM1.6, HUT 78, and HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. COS-7 cells were obtained from Brian Seed and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. The antigen-dependent murine T cell line 171 was generously provided by Mark Hill and Dan Littman (New York University). Culture conditions for 171 and the respective FT7.1 antigen-presenting cells were as described (29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies directed against ACP33 were generated by immunizing Lou/C rats with a purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of full-length ACP33 expressed in bacteria. After an 8-week interval, a final boost was given 3 days before fusion of the rat spleen cells with the murine myeloma cell line P3X63-Ag8.653 (30Kremmer E. Sommer P. Holzer D. Galetsky S.A. Molochkov V.A. Gurtsevitch V. Winkelmann C. Lisner R. Niedobitek G. Grasser F.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using bacterial extracts fromEscherichia coli expressing a fusion protein of ACP33 and maltose-binding protein (MBP) or a control MBP fusion protein. Hybridoma supernatants reacting with ACP33-MBP but not with the control MBP fusion protein were analyzed by Western blots, and clone it1–2D5 (rat IgG2a) was selected for its reaction pattern. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against p56lck (Lck-01 and Lck-04) were generously provided by Vaclav Horejsi (Czech Academy of Science). Monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody MT-151 was donated by Peter Rieber (University of Dresden, Germany). Polyclonal anti-CD4 antiserum T4-4 (31Deen K.C. McDougal J.S. Inacker R. Folena W.G. Arthos J. Rosenberg J. Maddon P.J. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) was provided by Raymond Sweet (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals), through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. All secondary anti-IgG reagents were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Transgenic CD4 expressing 171 murine T cells were generated by electroporation of 10 μg of pCD4-EF-IRESpuro plasmid or mutant derivatives into 1 × 107 cells. After a 48-h cultivation, transfected cells were selected for resistance to 2 μg/ml puromycin (Biomol) for 10–12 days. Expression levels of CD4 were monitored by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. T cell activation assays were performed essentially as described (29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of peptide antigen, an analog of hen egg lysozyme 74–88, were mixed with 106transgenic 171 T cells and 5 × 105 FT7.1 ACPs in a final volume of 300 μl of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. After 24 h, secreted levels of IL-2 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (OptEIA-Set, BD Pharmingen). Procedures for transient transfection of JCaM1.6 cells and measurement of luciferase activity were described before (26Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of pIL2-GL2 reporter plasmid and 25 μg of pCD4-N1 or mutant derivatives were cotransfected by electroporation. After 20 h, cells were stimulated for 8 h with ionophore A23187 (0.5 μg/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) or were left untreated, followed by the addition of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and scintillation counting. HUT 78 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation using 20 μg of plasmid expressing cIg-ACP33 or a cIg control. Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described (32Nagel W. Zeitlmann L. Schilcher P. Geiger C. Kolanus J. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14853-14861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by passing through a 26-gauge needle in hypotonic lysis buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant corresponded to the cytoplasmic fraction and the soluble material from the pellet extracted by detergent lysis buffer, and further centrifugation was called the particulate fraction. Immunoprecipitation was performed from lysates of 171 cells, electroporated HUT 78 cells, and COS-7 cells transfected by DEAE-dextran as described before (26Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lysis buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min on ice, lysates were cleared at 20,000 × g and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with 1 μl of antiserum for immunoprecipitation of CD4 or, in case of precipitation of cIg fusion proteins, was directly incubated for 30 min with protein A immobilized on Sepharose 6MB (Sigma). Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-loading buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. To detect intracellular antigens, HUT 78 cells were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and fixed for 15 min with 2% (w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS at 25 °C. Fixed cells were blocked by washing three times for 5 min with 2% (w/v) glycine in PBS and permeabilized for 15 min in 0.2% SDS, which was found to increase reactivity of anti-ACP33 mAb 2D5. Unspecific binding was blocked by washing three times for 5 min with 2% fetal calf serum in PBS. Endogenous ACP33 was stained by incubation with undiluted 2D5 hybridoma supernatant for 60 min and washing three times for 5 min with 2% fetal calf serum in PBS followed by detection with FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG. An isotype-matched control antibody directed against a non-T cell protein did not result in significant fluorescence. Where indicated, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin, transferrin, or DAMP (all from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Endogenous CD4 was detected using T4-4 antiserum and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Total rabbit IgG was used as a control. Staining of cIg fusion proteins was achieved using FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG. Microscopical imaging was done on a Leica TCS confocal laser microscope. FITC and rhodamine signals for a single confocal section were recorded separately and overlaid using Adobe Photoshop software. For extracellular CD4 staining, cells were incubated with anti-CD4 mAb MT-151 and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter Epics XL). The CD4 cytoplasmic domain is highly homologous among its mammalian orthologues (Fig.1 A). Conserved residues include the membrane-proximal cysteines 394 and 397, which can be palmitoylated (33Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13593-13597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a short α-helix between amino acid 409 and 414, which mediates binding of the AP-2 and AP-1 adaptor protein complexes (34Pitcher C. Honing S. Fingerhut A. Bowers K. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and a double cysteine motif (position 420 and 422) required for interaction with p56lck (35Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We noticed an additional conserved motif consisting of two hydrophobic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus: either proline and isoleucine, leucine and isoleucine, or two leucines. Interestingly, hydrophobic COOH termini of transmembrane receptors have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions, e.g. with PDZ domain-containing proteins involved in signal transduction, multimerization, and subcellular sorting events (36Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 37Fernandez L.J. Merlos S.A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To analyze the functional role of the conserved hydrophobic C-terminal residues of CD4 with respect to antigen-dependent T cell activation, we used the CD4-negative murine T cell line 171, previously established as a model system for CD4 function (7Xu H. Littman D.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Oligoclonal pools of 171 cells expressing either native human CD4 or truncated mutant derivatives (Fig. 1 B) were selected and found to display comparable amounts of CD4 on the cell surface (Fig.2 A). T cell activation was induced by adding increasing concentrations of peptide antigen, and secreted IL-2 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Consistent with earlier findings (29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), expression of CD4 was required for measurable IL-2 production by 171 cells (Fig. 2 B). Deletion mutants of CD4 clearly showed different influences on costimulatory function. Truncation of only two COOH-terminal amino acids (431*) led to a pronounced gain-of-function phenotype. However, further deletion (419*, 398*/Pal−) or double point mutations in the cysteine motif required for Lck binding (Lck−) clearly resulted in reduced IL-2 secretion by the respective transfectants, confirming that p56lck makes a significant contribution to stimulatory CD4 signal transduction (29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These results were highly reproducible; experiments with three independently derived oligoclonal cell populations yielded very similar functional data (not shown). In contrast to results obtained by Glaichenhaus et al. (29Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), expression of a truncation mutant removing the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (398*/Pal−) resulted in measurable IL-2 secretion. This difference might be due to higher CD4 expression levels in our system. It has been shown that surface expression of tailless CD4 at high levels is able to circumvent the T cell development requirement for signal transduction by the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (38Killeen N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since gain-of-function mutants of CD4 have not been described before, we were interested in further characterizing this effect. One potential explanation for the 431* mutant phenotype implicates increased p56lck activity. However, association of p56lck with the CD4 mutant 431* was unaltered compared with native CD4 as analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 C). As expected from previous reports (35Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), no anti-p56lck reactive band was detected in CD4 precipitates of 419*-, 398*/Pal−-, and Lck−-expressing cell lysates. Nevertheless, the gain-of-function phenotype of 431* could still be mediated by p56lck activity, so to exclude this possibility we analyzed CD4 function in the Lck-deficient Jurkat E6 derived cell line JCaM1 (39Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Moreover, since 171 T cells are of murine origin, we also wanted to confirm the 431* phenotype in a human assay system. The JCaM1 cells we used here to study Lck-independent CD4 function did not express detectable levels of p56lck, in contrast to normal Jurkat cells (data not shown). Expression vectors for native CD4 or several CD4 mutants were transiently transfected into JCaM1 cells together with a luciferase reporter plasmid that allowed quantification of IL-2 promoter activity. Expression levels were monitored by flow cytometry and found to be within a comparable range (Fig.3 A). To our surprise, transfection of native CD4 was sufficient to significantly induce IL-2 promoter activity in phorbol ester-costimulated JCaM1 cells without further cross-linking (Fig. 3 B). The Lck− CD4 mutant had a slightly reduced effect on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced IL-2 promoter induction, whereas the 419* and 398*/Pal− mutants were completely ineffective. These results indicate the existence of Lck-independent CD4 signal transduction in JCaM1 cells, presumably mediated by alternative ligands for the CD4 cytoplasmic domain, as discussed below. Strikingly, cotransfection of the 431* truncation mutant resulted in a moderate but consistent increase in IL-2 promoter activity compared with native CD4, resembling the gain-of-function phenotype in antigen-dependent T cell activation described above. Taken together, removal of the hydrophobic amino acids proline and isoleucine from the COOH terminus of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain results in enhanced T cell costimulation in two independent assay systems. The presence of p56lck is neither required nor inhibitory for the gain-of-function phenotype of CD4 431*, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism involving novel mediators of CD4 function. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a Jurkat T cell cDNA library was performed to identify alternative CD4 cytoplasmic tail binding partners. Several selected clones were analyzed, and all were found to contain an identical cDNA insert. To identify its translation initiation site, we isolated a further 250 nucleotides of this cDNA by polymerase chain reaction from a plasmid library. This revealed that the two-hybrid isolate contained the complete open reading frame for a protein of 308 amino acids. The deduced protein does not contain any known subcellular localization signals, leader sequence, or transmembrane helix. However, a cluster of four acidic amino acids is located close to the N terminus (Fig. 4 A). Blast homology searches (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60174) Google Scholar) of protein data banks revealed identity with the recent GenBankTM entry NP_057714, a hypothetical protein encoded by a bone marrow-derived mRNA. A very limited sequence similarity to bacterial enzymes containing an α/β hydrolase fold was also detected (41Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Similarity is most significant within the region surrounding the catalytic nucleophilic residue of this class of hydrolases. In α/β fold hydrolases, the nucleophilic residue is part of a structural element known as the nucleophile elbow (42Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), which comprises a β strand, a γ-like turn containing the nucleophilic residue, and an α helix. Secondary structure predictions for the region of similarity in the novel CD4-interacting protein indicate that a motif surrounding serine 109 might adopt a similar structural fold. Furthermore, homology searches in protein domain consensus data bases (e.g. Pfam, Prosite profiles, ESTHER) detected significant similarity between the newly identified protein and the family of α/β hydrolase fold proteins. Multiple tissue Northern blot hybridization with a cDNA fragment from the CD4-binding protein detected a single mRNA species of 2.1 kilobases in length (Fig. 4 B). All human tissues analyzed contained detectable and comparable amounts of this transcript. To address protein expression and localization of the novel CD4 binding factor, we generated monoclonal antibodies against the complete polypeptide expressed in Escherichia coli. One clone, mAb 2D5, specifically detected a protein of 33 kDa in immunoblotted detergent lysates of a variety of human and murine cell lines (Fig.4 C). Furthermore, the antibody reacts with several fusion proteins of the novel CD4-binding protein, indicating that it specifically recognizes an epitope of this protein (data not shown). We propose the term ACP33 (acidic clusterprotein of 33 kDa) to denote this new factor. To test if subcellular distribution of ACP33 is compatible with a functional interaction with CD4, we analyzed the intracellular localization of the mAb 2D5 epitope in a CD4-positive T cell line, HUT 78. As an additional control, we expressed an ACP33 fusion protein (cIg-ACP33) by transient transfection, the two NH2-terminal immunoglobulin domains from human IgG1 serving as an epitope for standard anti-human IgG reagents (Fig. 5 A). Chimeric proteins containing Ig domains have been successfully used to study subcellular localization (43Korthauer U. Nagel W. Davis E.M. Le B.M. Menon R.S. Mitchell E.O. Kozak C.A. Kolanus W.

There are four alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I, all characterized by the presence of six I-repeats, R1–R6, each containing a potential helix-loop-helix motif implicated in protein-protein interactions. These isoforms exhibit both homomeric and heteromeric interactions that lead to nuclear localization. In this study we mapped two distinct regions in TFII-I that affect its DNA binding. Deletion of either of these regions led to abrogation of DNA binding and transcriptional activation from both the Vβ and c-fos promoters. The I-repeats, as expected, were capable of mediating homomeric interactions either individually or in combination. Unexpectedly, an additional homomeric interaction domain was found within the N-terminal end of TFII-I that includes a putative leucine zipper motif.

The primary structure of TFII-I is compatible with its multifunctional properties, consisting of six direct reiterated I-repeats, R1–R6, each containing a putative helix-loop-helix motif, HLH,1but only one basic region preceding R2 (4Roy A.L.

Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The latter, by analogy with more conventional HLH proteins, was postulated to constitute a DNA binding domain (12Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 13Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The I-repeats, by virtue of having the potential HLH motifs, are conjectured to present protein-protein interaction surfaces (4Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M.

Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that there are altogether four alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All isoforms contain the I-repeats and the basic region and exhibit both homomeric and heteromeric interactions with themselves that lead to their preferential nuclear localization (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although each isoform individually bound to DNA and activated transcription both from the Vβ and c-fos promoters, a particular combination of isoforms differentially regulated the two promoters (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We and others (14Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have also shown that a variety of extracellular signals mediating through cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors, lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased transcriptional activity of TFII-I. Given these unusual structural and functional features, it is important to determine the regions/domains in TFII-I that is/are responsible for its DNA binding properties and the role of the I-repeats in mediating protein-protein interactions. Here we searched for potential DNA binding domains and regions responsible for homomeric interactions. The deletion of either the N-terminal 90 amino acids, including a putative leucine zipper but containing an intact basic region, or a basic region (containing an intact N terminus) led to a loss of binding to the Vβ Inr and the c-fos upstream sites. Consistent with their lack of DNA binding activities, these mutants failed to transcriptionally activate either the Vβ or the c-fos promoters in transient transfection assays. Interaction studies revealed that deletion of either the basic region or repeats R6 through R3 from the C-terminal end had no significant effects on homomeric interactions when compared with the wild type TFII-I. However, the N-terminal 90-amino acid-deleted mutant, containing all the repeats, failed to exhibit homomeric interactions with the wild type protein. Interestingly, the I-repeats R1 and R2, either in combination or individually, could also mediate homomeric interactions. So, although the repeats can mediate homomeric interactions, they alone are insufficient and additionally require the N-terminal 90 amino acids. Based on these results, we propose a model for regulated homomeric interactions of TFII-I involving both the N-terminal end and the I-repeats containing the HLH motifs. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2environment. TFII-I has four alternatively spliced isoforms: α (977 amino acids), β (978 amino acids), γ (998 amino acids), and Δ (957 amino acids) (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The construction of wild type expression plasmids of TFII-IΔ- and β-isoforms (used in this study), pEBGII-I, pEBBGFPII-I, and p70 mutant plasmid pEBGp70 were detailed elsewhere (6Cheriyath V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TFII-I mutants used here were generated by a PCR-based strategy. In the first round, two PCR reactions were done. In the first reaction, a restriction enzyme-specific sequence 5′ to the deleted region was used as a forward primer (primer 1) and a TFII-I-specific sequence, just downstream of the deleted sequence, was used as a reverse primer (primer 2). In the second reaction, a TFII-I-specific sequence, just upstream of the deleted sequence, was used as a forward primer (primer 3) and a restriction enzyme-specific sequence 3′ to the deleted sequence was used as a reverse primer (primer 4). The products of each reaction (0.25 μg) were mixed, and the second round of PCR was performed using the primers 1 and 4. The final PCR product was gel-purified and digested with restriction enzymes, the recognition sequences of which were used as the primers 1 and 4. The restriction-digested PCR product was ligated into TFII-I-expressing plasmid, pEBGII-I or pEBBGFPII-I. The specific sequences of these primers and the corresponding restriction enzymes used are detailed as follows: Reaction 1: primer 1, 5′-ATTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTG-3′; primer 2, 5′-CATGAGGAATGTCACCATATGGCTGCCGCG-3′. Reaction 2: primer 3, 5′-ATGGTGGTGACATTCCTCATGTC-3′; primer 4, 5′-GGAGAGATGCATAAAAT- GAAATCT-3′. The final product was gel-isolated, digested with XbaI and NsiI, and then ligated with pEBGII-I.

The PCR product was digested withAcc65I and SnaB1 and ligated with pEBGII-I. The region between amino acids (1) was PCR-amplified by using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GTGGATCCACCATGGGCAG-3′; primer 2, 5′-AGGCGGCCGCCTTTCTTAATTT-3′. The final product was digested withBamHI and NotI and ligated to pEBG vector. primer 1, 5′-GTGGATCCATTGAAACACTCAGAAAA-3′; primer 2, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTAAAAAAGGTCTCTT-3′. The PCR-amplified product was gel-extracted, digested with BamHI and NotI, and ligated to pEBG. primer 1, 5′-GTGGATCCTTCGAGAAATGGAATGCT-3′; primer 2, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCAAGCTCATCTTTC-3′. The PCR-amplified product was gel-isolated, digested with BamHI and NotI, and ligated with pEBG vector. All the mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS7 cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of expression plasmids of either wild type TFII-IΔ-isoform (pEBGII-I) or its various mutants (pEBGΔN90II-I, pEBGΔBR), and the recombinant proteins were isolated as described previously (6Cheriyath V.

The protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry blotting method, and processed as described previously (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were used as follows: anti-TFII-I, 1:2500; anti-GST (Sigma), 1:3000; and anti-GFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) 1:300. Either the secondary anti-rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA; 1:8000 dilution) or anti-mouse (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN; 1:4000 dilution) horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were incubated in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. All Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The EMSA reactions in Fig. 1 was performed with either an Inr probe derived from the Vβ promoter (17Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or with a probe derived from upstream sequences of the c-fos promoter (10Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The EMSA was performed as described previously (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts (200 μg) from COS7 cells, cotransfected with GFP-tagged wild type TFII-I (either Δ- or β-isoforms) and either GST-tagged wild type TFII-I or the GST-tagged mutants, were subjected to GST pull-down assay as described (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, and probed with an anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH). The blots were stripped to remove the anti-GFP immune complex (17Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and reprobed with anti-GST antibody (Sigma). COS7 cells were transfected with either the GST construct alone or the GST-tagged wild type TFII-I or its mutants as described (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 30-h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Sigma) was used as a primary antibody at a dilution of 1:4000, and Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes) as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:30,000. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye (Sigma). Immunofluorescence was detected using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, E400) with a 100× objective. Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays were done as described (6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each experiment was done in triplicate and repeated twice. Based on its multiple DNA sequence element, recognition properties, and indirect competition experiments, it was postulated that TFII-I might have more than one distinct DNA binding domains/regions (1Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To gain insight into its DNA binding regions/domains, we generated several mutants of TFII-I and tested their ability to bind to the Vβ-derived Inr and the c-fos-derived upstream sequence elements. Of particular interest to us were two mutants. The first mutant (ΔN90) was created such that the entire N-terminal end (first 90 amino acids) before I-repeat 1, including the putative leucine zipper, was deleted. The second mutant (ΔBR) was created such that the basic region (amino acids 301–306) preceding I-repeat 2 was deleted, because, by analogy with known basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, this could constitute a bona fide DNA binding domain (11Mobley C.M. Sealy L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6511-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,12Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with the wild type and mutant TFII-I proteins on probes containing either Vβ-derived Inr sequences or c-fos-derived upstream sequences overlapping the serum response element (Fig. 1). For this and all subsequent experiments, unless otherwise stated, the Δ-isoform was used (Ref. 8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, see also “Experimental Procedures”). Compared with the wild type protein (WT), neither the ΔN90 nor the ΔBR gave any significant shifted complex on any of the probes (nearly 6-fold reduction in DNA binding between the wild type and either of the mutants). The amount and integrity of various proteins used for EMSA were monitored by Western blot assay (data not shown). Although the amount of ΔN90 used for EMSA was slightly less than the wild type TFII-I, increasing it even 2-fold did not produce any appreciable DNA binding (data not shown). That the lack of appreciable DNA binding capability of these mutants is due to specific and not general mutation in TFII-I is proven by the fact that the p70 mutant exhibits greater than wild type levels of DNA binding activity (6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we conclude that both the N-terminal 90 amino acids and the basic region are required for DNA binding and, although they may constitute separate DNA binding regions/domains, neither one alone is sufficient to mediate DNA binding. We next tested the transcriptional properties of the mutants as compared with the wild type protein on both the Vβ and c-fos promoters. For this assay, we chose an additional mutant (p70) in which the C-terminal 222 amino acids, containing an activation domain, are deleted (6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the wild type TFII-I stimulated the Vβ promoter 3-fold, none of the mutants gave any significant transcriptional stimulation and the transcriptional activity of ΔBR and p70 mutants were similar to or below the basal levels (Fig.2 A). ΔN90 failed to give any significant stimulation. Like the Vβ promoter, the wild type and the ΔBR and p70 mutants behave similarly to the c-fos promoter (Fig. 2 B). Although the transcriptional activities of ΔBR and p70 mutants were similar to or below the basal levels, the ΔN90 mutant failed to produce any significant transcriptional activation (Fig. 2 B). From these experiments we conclude that the DNA binding domains and the C-terminal activation domain of TFII-I are necessary for its transcriptional activation either as a basal factor or as an activator. Control Western blot analysis from these experiments (Fig. 2, lower panels) showed that the expression levels and integrity of the mutants were comparable to that of the wild type and thus, the differences in the functional activities were not due to alteration in protein levels. It could be argued that the lack of transcriptional activity of the TFII-I mutants is due to a lack of their proper nuclear localization. This is particularly relevant for the ΔBR mutant, because a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) is rich in basic amino acids (18Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and thus, the basic region might constitute an NLS or contribute to the proper localization of TFII-I. However, like the wild type TFII-I, all of the mutants (ΔN90, ΔBR, and p70) preferentially localized to the nucleus when ectopically expressed in COS7 cells (Fig.3). Therefore, none of the mutations impaired the nuclear localization signal of TFII-I, and the lack of the transcriptional function is indeed due to a lack of either the DNA binding or the transcriptional activation domains. TFII-I has four alternatively spliced isoforms that can undergo both homo- and heteromerization with each other (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, either homo- or heteromerization of isoforms facilitates nuclear translocation. Given the fact that ΔN90, ΔBR, and p70 mutants readily translocate to the nucleus, we anticipated that all of them would exhibit homo- and perhaps heteromerization capabilities. Furthermore, because of the presence of a putative leucine zipper (LZ) toward the N-terminal end (amino acids 23–44) of TFII-I that is conserved in all human isoforms and in mouse TFII-I (19Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Wang Y.K. Perez-Juardo L.A. Francke U. Genomics. 1998; 48: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we reasoned that it might be involved in either homo- and/or heteromerization. To test this idea and to further identify other potential interaction domains, we constructed a series of deletion mutants (as GST fusion proteins) and analyzed their homo- and heteromerization potentials. All the mutants are schematically shown in Fig. 4. In ΔN20, the first 20 amino acids from the N-terminal end, including the first acidic cluster, are removed, but the putative LZ remains intact (4Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ΔN90 is described above. In Δlinker, part of the linker region between R1 and R2 (amino acids 232–252) is removed, but the LZ remains intact. This mutant is particularly interesting, because this deletion creates a shorter version of TFII-I that is naturally absent in humans but present in mice (20Wang Y.K. Perez-Juardo L.A. Francke U. Genomics. 1998; 48: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to test whether such a mutant/isoform can have homomeric and heteromeric interactions. The p46 is a deletion mutant that contains only the first 428 amino acids from the N-terminal end (containing only repeats 1 and 2), and when expressed, migrates as a 46-kDa protein. The p70 mutant, containing the first four repeats, has been described before (Ref. 6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, see also Fig.4). Either the GFP-tagged Δ- (Fig.5 A) or the β-isoforms (Fig.5 B) were used as baits to determine homo- and heteromeric interactions in GST pull-down assays. These proteins were ectopically co-expressed in COS cells with either the GST-tagged wild type Δ- or β-isoforms or with various mutants derived from the Δ-isoform. GST protein (GST) was used as a negative control (shown only with the Δ-isoform, Fig. 5 A, lane 1). The GST pull-down precipitates were analyzed by Western blot first by an anti-GFP antibody (top panels) and, after stripping, by an anti-GST antibody (middle panels). The bottom panel shows the quantity of GFP-tagged TFII-I proteins expressed in whole extracts. Except for ΔN90 (lane 3), all other mutants interact with the Δ-isoform (Fig. 5 A, top panel). The lack of interaction of the Δ-isoform with ΔN90 is not due to lack of protein expression, because the GFP-tagged Δ-isoform is expressed comparably in all lanes (bottom panel). This is contrary to our expectations, because ΔN90 readily translocates to the nucleus (Fig. 3). The slightly diminished amounts of GFP-TFII-I in the last two lanes directly reflect the lower amount of GST-tagged p70 and ΔBR (lanes 7 and8) pulled down under our assay conditions and do not constitute a true quantitative difference with the other mutants. Also, the amount of GFP-TFII-I expression in these two lanes was less than the other lanes (see bottom panel). The slightly higher mobility of the ΔN20 mutant (lane 2) is due to its hyperphosphorylation (data not shown). In contrast to the Δ-isoform, the β-isoform clearly showed interactions with ΔN90 and all other mutants (Fig. 5 B, top panel). Once again, the expression of the GFP-β-isoform was comparable in all lanes (bottom panel). Thus, the first 90 amino acids appear to be important for homomerization of the Δ-isoform but not for its heteromerization with the β-isoform. Moreover, the first 428 amino acids (as in p46) contain information that is sufficient to mediate both homo- and heteromerization. The Δlinker mutation had no significant effects in interaction with either isoforms suggesting that this form of TFII-I, although only naturally present in mice, can have both homo- and heteromeric interactions. The lack of homomeric interaction of ΔN90, despite its nuclear localization, can be reconciled if ΔN90 interacts with itself but not with the wild type Δ-isoform. We further hypothesized that such potential interactions between ΔN90 could be mediated by the I-repeats. To test whether the two molecules of ΔN90 interact with each other and whether the first two I-repeats (as in p46) were necessary and sufficient to mediate such interactions, we employed GFP-tagged ΔN90 as bait. GFP-ΔN90 was ectopically coexpressed with GST-tagged ΔN90, GST-tagged R1, or GST-tagged R2, and GST-pull-down assay was performed. Western blot analysis with an anti-GFP antibody showed that GFP-ΔN90 was brought down by GST-ΔN90, suggesting that ΔN90 interacts with itself (Fig.6, top panel, lane 1). In addition, both R1 and R2 were also capable of interacting with ΔN90, although to a much lesser extent than the ΔN90 with itself (Fig. 6, top panel, lanes 2 and3). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-GST antibody to show comparable amounts of GST-ΔN90 (lane 1,second panel), GST-R1 and GST-R2 (lanes 2 and3, third panel) were precipitated in the pull-down assay. The bottom panel is a Western blot showing comparable amounts of GFP-ΔN90 expression in each extract. We emphasize that the interactions of R1 and R2 with ΔN90 are weak and it is likely that both R1 and R2 are necessary for a robust and physiological interaction. It is also possible that these repeats fail to reach the nucleus (note that they lack the NLS). Together, these results indicate that, although the I-repeats can mediate homomeric interactions, in the context of the full-length TFII-I, the N-terminal 90 amino acids are also required for such interactions. Since the initial discovery of TFII-I as an Initiator binding protein (1Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), this transcription factor has remained intriguing. Although additional functions ranging from roles in signal transduction to a potential role in genetic disorders have been attributed to this complex molecule (reviewed in Ref. 8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), some of the more fundamental information regarding its DNA binding ability and protein-protein interaction potentials have remained largely unknown. Given its broad potential biological role, we believe that it is important to determine these fundamental properties of TFII-I. In an attempt to understand the DNA binding and protein-protein interaction capabilities of TFII-I, we have begun its structure-function analysis and generated selective mutants and analyzed them in various functional assays. One of the most interesting features of the TFII-I sequence is the presence of six highly conserved 90-residue I-repeats, each of which contains a potential helix-loop-helix (HLH)-like domain that is implicated in homo- and heterodimerization of conventional HLH proteins (reviewed in Ref. 12Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, unlike the conventional HLH proteins, in which a basic region that directly mediates DNA contact precedes the HLH regions, most of the repeats in TFII-I lack a basic region preceding them. The only notable exception is a basic region just before I-repeat 2 (BR, amino acids 301–306). Given this feature, and the fact that the anti-TFII-I antibody raised against the BR ablates the DNA binding ability of TFII-I (5Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wu Y. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we surmised that the BR could either directly or indirectly affect the DNA binding of TFII-I. Consistent with this notion, deletion of the BR results in a DNA binding-deficient mutant that failed to bind to both a consensus Inr sequence and an upstream activation site. However, it should be noted that, although the TFII-I recognition element from the c-fospromoter lies upstream of the transcription start site, the sequence matches a consensus Inr element (9Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the BR may recognize only this sequence albeit in a context-dependent fashion. If so, then there might be other DNA recognition surfaces present in TFII-I that could bind diverse DNA elements, such as an E-box (1Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although identification of the BR as a DNA binding domain was important, it was somewhat expected. More surprising was the lack of significant DNA binding property of the ΔN90 mutant. The region that appears to be responsible for such a phenotype includes a putative leucine zipper, and it is very likely that this leucine zipper mediates a homo- or heteromeric interaction required for DNA binding (12Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 13Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, homo- or heteromerization per se may not be sufficient for DNA binding, because the ΔN90 mutant homomerizes with itself (see below). Thus, the N-terminal region may directly contact DNA or indirectly contribute to DNA binding by altering the native structure, and removal of this region will expose a negative inhibitory domain that covers the DNA binding domain. Given the lack of DNA binding ability of the ΔBR and ΔN90 mutants, it is not surprising that they fail to activate the TFII-I-dependent reporters. Together with the p70 mutant, which exhibits DNA binding but lacks an activation domain (6Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is also not surprising that the ΔBR mutant that lacks DNA binding activity did not exhibit any significant transcriptional activity. Hence, proper transcriptional function of TFII-I requires both its DNA binding capabilities and its transcriptional activation domain. In this regard, it behaves like a classical transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a separable C-terminal activation domain. Although the nuclear translocation of the mutants was normal, the lack of homomeric interactions of the ΔN90 mutant with the wild type TFII-IΔ-isoform was puzzling at first glance. This is largely because we have previously shown that homomeric or heteromeric interactions lead to preferential nuclear occupancy (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We argued that, although ΔN90 failed to interact with the wild type Δ-isoform, it could interact with itself leading to nuclear localization. Interaction studies revealed that indeed ΔN90 interacts with itself. These observations raise a very interesting question: What is the role of the N-terminal end? The N-terminal end of the protein contains the leucine zipper motif (4Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that is also present in all the isoforms of human and mouse TFII-I (8Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol.

Moreover, several TFII-I-related proteins contain this motif approximately in the same position (21O'Mahoney J.V. Guven K.L. Lin J. Joya J.E. Robinson C.S. Wade R.P. Hardeman E.C. Mol. Cell.

Tusie-Luna and A. L. Roy, submitted for publication. Based on our observations, we propose that the Δ-isoform remains in a “closed” conformation until the LZ motif becomes available to interact with other partners: either another molecule of Δ or another molecule of β (Fig. 7). In contrast to the Δ-isoform, the β-isoform can assume a constitutively open conformation. Although secondary interactions can happen through the I-repeats in the absence of the LZ motif, ΔN90, without the LZ cannot induce conformational changes in the wild type Δ (closed conformation). However, ΔN90 can interact readily with β (open conformation). Thus, we conjecture that the regulated availability of the leucine zipper, perhaps by phosphorylation or other signal-induced events, might control the extent of complex formation and consequently, nuclear function of TFII-I. Such a mechanism of regulated zipper interaction via phosphorylation has been proposed for the IκB kinase complex formation (reviewed in Ref. 27Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We are grateful to rotating student Mireia Guerau for her contribution.

The regulatory mechanisms of PAI-1 are also regulated by other molecules in the proteolytic pathway. PAI-1 and plasmin both have vitronectin binding sites. The serine protease activity of plasmin degrades Vn such that one of the PAI-1 binding sites is mostly lost. This results in destabilization of the Vn·PAI-1 complex and a loss of PAI-1 function as an inhibitor of plasmin formation through the plasminogen activator pathway. This same PAI-1 binding site on Vn overlaps a heparin binding site. The protease activity of plasmin completely abolishes the Vn binding site for heparin and exposes a plasminogen binding site (9Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin interaction with PAI-1 increases the specificity of PAI-1 for thrombin (22Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Variations in Vn conformational states can convert PAI-1 inhibitory specificity from the plasminogen activators to thrombin (23Blasi F.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PAI-1 belongs to the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. The PAI-1 protein contains a strained loop reactive center, amino acids 320–351, located at the carboxyl terminus of the molecule (25Levin E.G. Santell L. J.

PAI-1 initially interacts with uPA at Arg-346 (30Keijer J. Linders M. van Zonneveld A.J. Ehrlich H.J. de Boer J.P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a pseudo substrate “bait.” However, uPA is unable to cleave the pseudo substrate and PAI-1/uPA form a stable complex rendering uPA inactive (29Huber R.

It has been demonstrated that the PAI-1-reactive loop must then insert between strands 3 and 5 of the β-sheet to exhibit inhibitory activity (35Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In the inactive configuration of PAI-1 (not bound to vitronectin), the reactive loop is spontaneously inserted into the folds of PAI-1 at physiological temperatures (29Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 40Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This conformation is stable due to the loop insertion into strand 4a of the PAI-1 structure (41Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A Lys-323 residue located within the β-strand s5A is thought to play an important role in the regulation of the latent/inactive state. This residue forms a hydrogen bond with Asn-150 (or 144 in mature protein) on the s3A/helix F loop of PAI-1 (42Kirkegaard T. Jensen S. Schousboe S.L. Egelund R. Preissner K.T. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 12: 7-10Google Scholar). The region of PAI-1 distant from the reactive center interacts with other molecules involved with the proteolytic and fibrinolytic pathways. The PAI-1 interactive sites for vitronectin are at Gln-55, Phe-109, Met-110, Leu-116, Gln-123, and residues 128–145 (43Van Meijer M. Gebbink R. Preissner K. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), heparin (Lys-65 to Lys-88) (44Ehrlich H.J. Klein G.R. Keijer J. Pannekoek H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and thrombin interaction at residues 128–145 (7Seiffert D. Ciamborne G. Wagner N. Binder B. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region between amino acid residues 110–145 binds urokinase and fibrin (30Keijer J. Linders M. van Zonneveld A.J. Ehrlich H.J. de Boer J.P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The helix F of PAI-1 (residues 127–158) is thought to play an important role in function and stability by controlling the rate of transition from active to latent conformation (45Vleugels N. Gils A. Bijnens A.-P. Knockaert I. Declerck P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the relationship between PAI-1 structure and its multiple regulatory functions, the porcine PAI-1 gene was systematically dissected to obtain truncated PAI-1 proteins, rPAI-1. The rPAI-1 proteins would be used as tools to identify the regions of the inhibitor that bind (complex) other important regulatory molecules in proteolytic and adhesion mechanisms. In so doing, we hoped to identify other domains that have a biological function. We have closely examined one deleted PAI-1 gene product (rPAI-123) that encompasses the porcine PAI-1gene sequences (46Bijnens A.P. Knockaert I. Cousin E. Kruithof E. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) containing nucleotides 444–999 corresponding to nucleotides 238–793 in the human PAI-1 gene (amino acids 80–265 of mature protein) (47Bosma P.J. van den Berg E.A. Kooistra T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9129-9141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant rPAI-123fragment: 1) excluded those sequences coding for the reactive center loop at the carboxyl terminus; 2) eliminated a vitronectin binding site, more than one half of a heparin binding region, and the latency residue at Lys-323 (42Kirkegaard T. Jensen S. Schousboe S.L. Egelund R. Preissner K.T. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 12: 7-10Google Scholar); 3) retained vitronectin and a second tPA binding region at amino acids 128–145, part of a heparin binding site at amino acids 80–88, a thrombin interactive region at residues 115–148, residues 127–158, which contain the helix F and the loop that connects helix F with helix s3A (48Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Fitton H.L. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Chang W.S. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1059-1063PubMed Google Scholar). The data we present show that when a truncated PAI-1 protein, rPAI-123, complexes with plasminogen or plasminogen and uPA, the following results occur: 1) Plasmin is cleaved to produce a proteolytic angiostatin-like cleavage product. UPA enhances the formation of the angiostatin-like protein by increasing the amount of available plasmin. 2) Excess rPAI-123 inhibits proteolytic angiostatin formation by binding to uPA and plasminogen such that they are not available to form plasmin that can be cleaved into angiostatin. 3) Cultured endothelial cells exposed to rPAI-123 exhibit a decrease in proliferation, a loss in tube formation capability, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration in the presence of VEGF. The 555-bp DNA fragment coding for the truncated rPAI-123protein (Fig. 1) was isolated from porcine aortic endothelial cells by reverse-transcribing RNA into cDNA using the manufacturer's random primer and protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The cDNA was made double-stranded in a PCR reaction containing the following porcine PAI-1 primers: 5′-primer, 5′-GGAATTCAAGGAGCTATGG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTCCACTGGCTGATG-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: ∼1 pg of the PAI-1 gene was combined with 50 pmol of the 5′- and 3′-primers and amplified at 95 °C, 10 min; 58 °C, 1 min;Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) was added; then 72 °C, 1 min followed by 34 cycles of 95 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min. The PAI-1 DNA fragments were double-digested with EcoRI andXbaI and ligated into a Pischia pastoris yeast shuttle vector, pGAPZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The TOP 10 strain of Escherichia coli was transformed by electroporation of the ligation reaction in 2-mm cuvettes containing 50 ng of the ligation reaction/100 μl of electroporation competent TOP 10 cells using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX, San Diego, CA). The electroporation conditions were 2.5-kV resistance, 129 ohm and a charging voltage of 2.45 kV. The pulsed cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then transferred to an agar plate containing low salt Luria broth and 50 μg/ml zeocin. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, colonies were selected and grown in low salt LB broth for 5–7 h at 37 °C. The DNA from each colony growth was isolated on a Qiagen miniprep spin column (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). The purified DNA from each expanded colony was double-digested to verify the presence of the gene insert. Positive isolates from the restriction enzyme digests (Fig. 2) were verified by sequencing. The DNA from a positively identified ligation product containing therPAI-1 23 gene fragment was linearized at a specific restriction enzyme site in the pGAPZαA glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The linear DNA was transfected into electroporation competent P. pastoris strain of yeast according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The transfected yeast cells were streaked onto YPD/zeocin (100 μg/ml) plates. Resulting clones were streaked onto YPD plates a second time to ensure integration of the transfected DNA into the yeast genome. Individual clones were selected after 2–3 days of growth on the YPD plates and grown in YPD medium at 30 °C for 1 day. The transfected cells were pelleted, and the supernatant containing the secreted recombinant PAI-1 protein was collected and verified on a silver-stained 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3). The rPAI-123 protein (30 nm) was incubated with 10 nm of uPA (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) in TBS, pH 7.8, containing 100 μg/ml BSA and 0.01% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h. Following the PAI-1·uPA reaction, 33 nm plasminogen and 15 μg/ml Chromozym PL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the rPAI-123·uPA reaction mix. The reactants continued to incubate at 37 °C until color change could be detected in the uPA standards. The colorimetric change was measured at 405 nm on an EL-311 Microplate Autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Burlington, VT). In this assay plasmin cleaves Chromozym PL resulting in a p-nitraniline molecule that absorbs at 405 nm. The colorimetric change is a measurement of plasmin formation. 1.3% casein was incorporated into an SDS-polyacrylamide separating gel. The casein serves as a substrate for plasmin proteolytic activity. The rPAI-123protein (30–120 nm) was bound to 10 nm of uPA at room temperature for 1 h. Following this reaction, 33 nm of plasminogen was added to the rPAI-123·uPA reaction mix and incubated at 37 °C for 20–30 min. The samples were electrophoresed at constant voltage on a polyacrylamide gel containing 1.3% casein. The polyacrylamide gels containing the electrophoresed samples were first washed in 2.5% Triton-X before an overnight incubation at 37 °C in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9. The gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid and then stained in 10% Coomassie Blue for 1 h. The gel was destained in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid to detect the regions of proteolysis (50Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 51Allaire E. Hasenstab D. Kenagy R.D. Starcher B. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. Circulation. 1998; 98: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Vitronection (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 25 nm was incubated with 30 nm of rPAI-123 for 1–2 h at 37 °C before performing the zymography functional assay as described above. Equal fractions of reaction mixtures for the zymography assay described above were placed on an SDS, nonreducing, 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresed samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane containing the transferred proteins was blocked and washed. The results were visualized on a Western blot probed with 1 μg/ml goat anti-human plasminogen kringles 1–3 (angiostatin) (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed and blocked a second time for 1 h at room temperature. A rabbit anti-goat IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated tertiary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) diluted 1:1000 amplified the binding reaction, which was ultimately detected by addition of a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min at room temperature (52Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Russo A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The order in which rPAI-123, uPA, and Plg were added to a reaction mixture was varied: (a) uPA + Plg for 1 h at 37 °C, then rPAI-123 was added for an additional 1 h at 37 °C; (b) rPAI-123 + uPA for 1 h at 37 °C, then Plg was added for an additional 1 h at 37 °C; or (c) rPAI-123 + Plg for 1 h at 37 °C, then uPA was added for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. In some cases, the amount of uPA and/or rPAI-123 was varied. To ensure that either uPA or Plg was exhausted in a reaction mix, an additional amount of either uPA or Plg was added to some permutations The samples were electrophoresed on a zymogram as described. Porcine endothelial cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well culture plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were allowed to adhere to the culture plate before adding exogenous rPAI-123 (1 μg/ml). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h at which time an additional 1 μg/ml rPAI-123 was added. This procedure was maintained for 5 days. Controls were endothelial cells alone or endothelial cells to which equivalent amounts of secreted yeast cell protein were added. The cells were observed for proliferation, attachment, and tube formation. The 555-bp DNA fragment coding for the truncated rPAI-123 was isolated from porcine aortic endothelial cell RNA by reverse transcription as described above. The cDNA was made double-stranded in a PCR reaction containing the 3′-porcine PAI-1 primer described and a 5′-PAI-1 primer to incorporate a PstI restriction enzyme site. The sequence of the 5′-primer is 5′-AACTGCAGAAGGAGCTATGG-3′. The PCR conditions were as described. The enzyme-activated PAI-1 DNA fragments were ligated into a pCMV/Myc/ER eukaryotic protein expression vector (Invitrogen) for amplification in E. coli. Isolates from each ligation reaction were double-digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and EcoRI to verify the presence of the gene insert (data not shown). Positive isolates from the restriction enzyme digests were verified by sequencing. The pCMV/Myc/ER eukaryotic protein vector is designed to provide directionality of protein expression to the endoplasmic reticulum. The expressed protein can either be retained or secreted by manipulation of a stop codon in the inserted gene of interest. The rPAI-123/pCMV/Myc/ER DNA at a concentration of 25–50 μg/400 μl DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was placed in a 4-mm gap cuvette and electroporated into bovine endothelial cells using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600. The electroporation conditions were 550 V/capacitance and resistance, 1000 μF, 13 ohm, and a charging voltage of 260 V. The pulsed cells were immediately transferred to a culture plate containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Geneticin (G418) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was added to the cells 24 h after electroporation. Bovine endothelial cells stably transfected with rPAI-123 were plated into a 24-well culture plate at a density of 2.3 × 104/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were trypsinized and counted on a hemocytometer plate at 24-h time intervals. Further verification of proliferation was performed by use of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1 × 104rPAI-123 transfected bovine endothelial cells were plated into a 96-well microtiter plate in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 or 48 h of growth, 20 μl of the manufacturer's supplied proliferation reagent was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1–4 h. Absorbance was read at 490 nm in an EL-311 Microplate Autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Burlington, VT). Bovine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with rPAI-123 were plated in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were fed every 48 h and maintained for a total of 21 days. Tube formation was observed. At day 14, a fluorescent ester probe, BCECF AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was diluted to 10 mm in Me2SO. The diluted fluorescent probe was added to the culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 5 μm and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescing cells were photographed with a 35-mm camera at 200× magnification under a Nikon inverted microscope. Bovine aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were each plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/T-75 culture flask containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 before adding either exogenous rPAI-123 (1 μg/ml) or yeast supernatant protein (1 μg/ml). The cells were incubated an additional 18 h at 37 °C. At which time the medium containing the detached cells was collected and placed on ice while performing two HBSS washes. The medium and HBSS washes containing the detached cells were combined, counted, pelleted, and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ApopNexin and propidium iodide were added to the cells following the manufacturer's protocol (Integren, Purchase, NY) (53Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adherent cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The pelleted cells were washed twice with cold HBSS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ApopNexin and propidium iodide were added to the pelleted cells. Each cell fraction was analyzed separately on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Recent studies demonstrated that vCLAP activates NF-κB through an IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent pathway, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that vCLAP associates stably with the IKK complex through direct binding to the C-terminal region of IKKγ. Consistent with this finding, IKKγ was found to be essential for vCLAP-induced NF-κB activation, and the association between vCLAP and the IKK complex induced persistent activation of the IKKs. Moreover, enforced oligomerization of the isolated C-terminal region of vCLAP, which interacts with IKKγ, can trigger NF-κB activation. Finally, substitution of the C-terminal region of IKKγ, which interacts with vCLAP, with the CARD of vCLAP or Bcl10 produced a molecule that was able to activate NF-κB when ectopically expressed in IKKγ-deficient cells. These data suggest that vCLAP-induced oligomerization of IKKγ, which is mediated by the CARD of vCLAP, could be the mechanism by which vCLAP induces activation of NF-κB. vCLAP, the E10 gene product of equine herpesvirus-2, is a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein that has been shown to induce both apoptosis and NF-κB activation in mammalian cells. vCLAP has a cellular counterpart, Bcl10/cCLAP, which is also an activator of apoptosis and NF-κB.

Because NF-κB activation is considered to be a survival signal, virally encoded proteins, such as vCLAP, may be utilized by viruses as a strategic tool to initiate self-replication or to suppress apoptosis in infected cells (5Meinl E.

IκBs mask the NF-κB nuclear localization signal, thereby preventing its nuclear uptake. Exposure of cells to a wide variety of stimuli, such as viral or bacterial infection, inflammatory cytokines, or UV irradiation leads to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolitic degradation of the IκBs (6Brown K.

The coverslips were mounted on a glass slide, and the fluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a detection wavelength of 522 nm (GFP) or an excitation wavelength of 568 nm and a detection wavelength of 585 nm (RFP). Images were Kalman-averaged with a Kalman filter to increase the signal/noise ratio. Whereas in resting cells the IKK kinases are inactive, potent activators, such as TNF-α, interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide, induce a very rapid IKK activation, detectable within minutes. However, numerous studies have shown that this activation is only transient and after ∼30 min decreases to about 25% of its peak value (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Using a luciferase reporter assay, we and others demonstrated that expression of vCLAP results in a robust activation of NF-κB (1Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Because of the very high level of this activation, we asked whether vCLAP could persistently activate the IKKs, resulting in a sustained rather than transient activation of NF-κB. To answer this question, endogenous IKKα was isolated by immunoprecipitation from extracts prepared from vCLAP-transfected or TNF-α-treated HeLa cells and assayed for IKK catalytic activity using a GST-IκBα fusion protein as a substrate. Consistent with previous observations, TNF-α stimulation of HeLa cells induced high but transient IKKα kinase activity (Fig.1 A); the activity, which was maximum after 10 min of stimulation, declined sharply with time and was barely detectable after 90 min of stimulation. However, compared with TNF-α stimulation, overexpression of vCLAP in HeLa cells induced a robust and sustained IKKα kinase activity in the absence of any external stimulation (Fig. 1 B). IKKα protein expression was comparable in vCLAP-transfected and nontransfected cells, indicating that vCLAP activates endogenous IKKα by a post-translational mechanism. To determine whether vCLAP associates stably with the IKK complex, immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-IKKα or anti-FLAG antibodies were assayed for the presence of vCLAP or the IKK components, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 B, vCLAP was readily detected after precipitation of endogenous IKKα. Moreover, IKKα and IKKγ were also detected in immunocomplexes obtained after precipitation of vCLAP (Fig.1 C). The vCLAP immunoprecipitates also possessed IKK kinase activity (Fig. 1 C). These results provide direct biochemical evidence that vCLAP associates stably with the IKK complex and is able to persistently activate the IKK kinases. To determine which component of the IKK complex interacts with vCLAP, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged vCLAP and T7-IKKβ with or without T7-IKKγ. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a small amount of IKKβ was coimmunoprecipitated with vCLAP in the absence of ectopic IKKγ. However, a remarkably higher amount of IKKβ was coimmunoprecipitated with vCLAP in the presence of coexpressed IKKγ (Fig. 2 A). The ectopic T7-IKKγ was also detected in these complexes (Fig. 2 A). No IKKβ or IKKγ were precipitated with the FLAG antibody in the absence of FLAG-vCLAP (Fig.2 A). This result shows that IKKγ mediates the interaction of vCLAP with the IKK complex. To rule out the possibility that other proteins were necessary for the vCLAP-IKKγ interaction, we analyzed the ability of a GST-IKKγ fusion protein to associate with an in vitro-translated35S-labeled vCLAP. In agreement with a direct interaction between vCLAP and IKKγ, 35S-labeled vCLAP bound to the GST-IKKγ fusion protein but not the GST control (Fig. 2 B). To address the physiological relevance of this finding, we transiently expressed vCLAP in wild type or IKKγ-deficient Rat-1 cells (15Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type Rat-1 cells, no NF-κB activation was elicited in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells after transfection with the vCLAP construct or treatment with TNF-α (Fig. 2 C). This result provides genetic proof for the requirement of IKKγ in vCLAP-induced activation of NF-κB, confirming its role as a molecular adaptor in the assembly of the vCLAP-IKK complexes. The inability of vCLAP to induce NF-κB activation in 5R cells cannot be attributed to defects in the NF-κB pathway downstream of IKKγ, because transfection of these cells with IKKγ can restore NF-κB activation by Tax, which is expressed stably in this cell line (Ref. 15Yamaoka S.

In contrast to vCLAP, Bcl10 was unable to interact with IKKγ in vitro (data not shown). However, like vCLAP, Bcl10 was able to induce NF-κB activation in Rat-1, but not in 5R cells (Fig.2 C), suggesting that Bcl10 could relay its signal to IKKγ indirectly. We next mapped the regions of vCLAP and IKKγ that are required for their interaction. FLAG-tagged IKKγ was expressed in 293T cells with T7-tagged full-length domain, CARD (residues 1–107), or CTD (residues 108–311) of vCLAP. Extracts prepared from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-T7 antibody that recognizes the T7-vCLAP variants. Both the full-length domain and the CTD of vCLAP were able to bind to IKKγ (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the CARD did not interact with IKKγ (Fig. 3 A). The same results were obtained using a GST-IKKγ pull-down assay, which showed that the recombinant GST-IKKγ fusion protein is able to bind the in vitro-translated 35S-labeled full-length domain or the CTD of vCLAP, but not the CARD of vCLAP (not shown). Combined, these results show that the CTD of vCLAP mediates its interaction with IKKγ. To extend the characterization of the vCLAP-IKKγ interaction, we expressed T7-tagged vCLAP in 293T cells together with several FLAG-tagged full-length or truncated IKKγ. vCLAP was found to specifically associate with full-length IKKγ but not with the C-terminally truncated IKKγ () or IKKγ () (Fig.3 B). Removal of the last 119 amino acids of IKKγ strongly reduced its interaction with the vCLAP (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these data indicate that the interaction between vCLAP and IKKγ involves sequences in the C-terminal region of IKKγ. To confirm that vCLAP associates intercellularly with IKKγ when the two proteins are coexpressed in the same cell, we cotransfected 293T cells with constructs encoding GFP-IKKγ and RFP-vCLAP fusion proteins and then monitored the subcellular localization of these proteins by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the two proteins exhibited different patterns of cellular localization when expressed alone. Whereas vCLAP exhibited a clear pattern of discrete and interconnecting cytoplasmic filaments, IKKγ displayed a somewhat punctuate cytoplasmic or whole-cell distribution. However, coexpression of the two proteins resulted in redistribution of IKKγ to the vCLAP filaments. This observation is consistent with a direct interaction between vCLAP and IKKγ. Our data demonstrate that IKKγ mediates the association of vCLAP with the IKK kinases and is required for vCLAP-induced activation of NF-κB. This suggest that IKKγ is an adaptor molecule with a C-terminal half that binds to NF-κB activators like vCLAP (see above), RIP (18Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A.

It is therefore likely that CARD-mediated self-association of vCLAP could induce oligomerization of IKKγ resulting in activation of the IKK complex. To test this hypothesis, we generated a fusion protein (CARD-IKKγ-ΔC) composed of the CARD of vCLAP linked to the N-terminal part (residues 1–200) of IKKγ (IKKγ-ΔC) and determined its ability to induce NF-κB activation. To rule out the possibility that the CARD-IKKγ-ΔC chimera functions through interaction with the endogenous IKKγ protein, we examined its ability to activate NF-κB in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, transient transfection of the CARD-IKKγ-ΔC chimera resulted in a large increase of NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, neither the separate CARD of vCLAP nor IKKγ-ΔC were able to activate the NF-κB when transfected at either low or high doses (Fig.4 A). Moreover, a single point mutation of a conserved residue in the CARD of vCLAP that abrogates homodimerization (L49R) (1Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17946-17954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) prevented NF-κB activation by the chimeric protein (Fig.4 A). Similar results were obtained when the CARD of Bcl10 was used instead of vCLAP-CARD in the above experiments (data not shown). We then tested whether enforced oligomerization of the CTD of vCLAP could induce NF-κB activation. For this purpose, the CTD of vCLAP was fused to a 3-fold repeat of the FKBP12 polypeptide, which oligomerizes when it binds to the cell-permeable synthetic organic ligand AP1510 (29MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, transient tranfection of this construct into Rat-1 cells, but not in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells, induced a large NF-κB activation in a ligand-dependent manner. No NF-κB activation was detected when the FKBP12-CTD construct was cotransfected with kinase-inactive IKKβ (not shown) or after treatment of empty vector-transfected 293T cells with AP1510 (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that vCLAP-induced oligomerization of IKKγ is the triggering event leading to activation of the IKK complex. Although previous studies have shown that the EHV-2-encoded vCLAP protein activates NF-κB in mammalian cells (1Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Tsichlis P.N.

In this paper, we report several observations that, when combined, provide a potential mechanism for vCLAP-induced NF-κB activation. First, we show that the IKK kinases are persistently activated in vCLAP-expressing cells, which might explain the robust NF-κB activity observed in vCLAP-transfected cells (1Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Second, we demonstrate that vCLAP, via its C-terminal domain, interacts physically with the IKK complex through direct binding to the C-terminal part of IKKγ. Consistent with this observation, IKKγ was found to be essential for vCLAP-induced activation of NF-κB. Third, we demonstrate that vCLAP activates the IKK complex through oligomerization of IKKγ. Indeed, CARD-dependent clustering of the N-terminal part of IKKγ, which we have previously shown to interact with the IKK kinases (20Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was able to activate NF-κB. Moreover, enforced oligomerization of the CTD of vCLAP was able to induce a large increase in NF-κB activity in Rat-1 cells but not in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells. This mechanism of NF-κB activation by vCLAP, namely oligomerization-induced activation of the IKK kinases via IKKγ, is reminiscent of the model we proposed for RIP-induced activation of NF-κB after ligation of TNF-R1 (20Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Based on this model, TNF-α stimulation induces binding of RIP to, and concomitant oligomerization of IKKγ, which in turn passes the oligomerization signal to the effector kinases, resulting in their activation through autophosphorylation of their T-loop serines (20Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to vCLAP, which binds stably to the IKK complex, RIP releases the activated IKK complex after its oligomerization, resulting in transient rather than persistent activation. Therefore, our results illustrate the ubiquitous role of oligomerization in IKK activation. Activation of NF-κB by expression of a single viral protein has been described in several studies, indicating that infection with an intact virus is not always required for NF-κB activation. One well documented example of this is the human T-cell leukemia virus-Tax protein (30Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B.

Interestingly, Tax has been shown to function as a dimerizer that stabilizes dimer formation in other proteins (35Bex F. Gaynor R.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Tax-induced oligomerization of IKKγ is, as for vCLAP, the triggering event in the activation of the IKK kinases by Tax. Recently, several independent groups have demonstrated that the cellular homologue of vCLAP, Bcl10 (also called cCLAP/CIPER/hE10/CARMEN), was also able to activate NF-κB when expressed in cells, although at a lesser degree than vCLAP. Bcl10 requires IKKγ for activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2 C). Our preliminary results suggest that cCLAP interacts with the IKK complex, as immunoprecipitation of the endogenous cCLAP results in isolation of the IKK components. However, in a GST-IKK pull-down assay, in vitro-translated 35S-labeled cCLAP was not able to bind to recombinant GST-IKKγ or GST-IKKα (data not shown), indicating that the cCLAP-IKK complex interaction could be indirect or regulated by a post-translational modification of cCLAP, such as phosphorylation. Future studies will reveal the precise physiological function of cCLAP and how it activates the IKK complex. We thank W. C. Green for the IKKβ kinase inactive construct and S. Yamaoka and A.

The two primary bile acids formed in most mammals are 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid (cholic acid)1 and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid). The domestic pig, however, is virtually unable to synthesize cholic acid. Instead, another trihydroxylated bile acid, 3α,6α,7α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid (hyocholic acid), is formed in amounts equal to that of cholic acid in other mammals. Formation of hyocholic acid is accomplished by a 6α-hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic acid or its conjugates. Hyocholic acid is considered to be a species-specific primary bile acid in the pig. It has been speculated that the ability to synthesize hyocholic acid in pigs evolved from a need of trihydroxylated bile acids caused by changes in dietary circumstances. 6α-Hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic acid seems to have been biochemically preferred during evolution compared with the introduction of cholic acid biosynthesis (1Haslewood G.A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 535-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In man, small amounts of hyocholic acid have been found in plasma and urine especially from patients with cholestatic liver disease (2Summerfield J.A. Billing B.H. Shackleton C.H.L. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and also in fetal blood sample (3Courillon F. Gerhardt M.F. Myara A. Daffos F. Forestier F. Trivin F. Biol. Neonate. 1998; 73: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating a different role for this bile acid in man. In previous reports from this laboratory, the purification and characterization of the taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase from pig liver have been described (4Boström H. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 807-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown to be a microsomal cytochrome P450 heme protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and sequences of peptides obtained after partial tryptic digestion suggested that this enzyme belong to the cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) subfamily. In the present study, we report on the cDNA cloning and expression of a taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase from pig liver. The results confirm and extend the previous observation that this enzyme is a, so far uncharacterized, member of the CYP4A subfamily. The novel CYP4A enzyme was designated CYP4A21. 2The sequence reported for the porcine taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase was designated CYP4A21 by the P450 nomenclature committee.2The sequence reported for the porcine taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase was designated CYP4A21 by the P450 nomenclature committee. Livers and other tissues from castrated, otherwise untreated, male pigs were obtained from the local slaughterhouse.

The megaprime DNA labeling system, CYP IVA ECL Western blotting kit, and [1-14C]lauric acid (53 Ci/mol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tauro[24-14C]chenodeoxycholic acid (0.8 Ci/mol) was synthesized according to Norman (6Norman A. Ark. Kemi. 1955; 8: 331-342Google Scholar). All chemicals used were of first grade quality. Total RNA isolated from pig liver using RNeasy Midi kits was reversed transcribed, and first strand cDNA was used directly for PCR (RT-PCR). Oligonucleotide primers for the initial PCR were designed from amino acid sequences obtained from the purified taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The forward primer was N2 (5′-CGTCCCGGCCCTGGCCAGCGT-3′), and the reverse primer was R-FEL (5′-TGGGATCTGGCGCCAGCTCGAA-3′). The PCR was performed in presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. The cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles, and 72 °C for 10 min. The 1,430-bp PCR product was gel purified and cloned into pUC18 using a SureClone ligation kit and subsequently transformed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was purified using DNA minipreparation columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A plasmid containing the insert was sequenced using Dye-labeled Terminator for the sequence reaction and a ABI377 DNA sequencer for analysis. The full-length nucleotide sequence was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE using a 5′-RACE system according to the manufacturer's instructions and a 3′-RACE procedure according to Frohman (7Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Gene-specific primers (5′-GSP1 and 5′-GSP2) used for the 5′-RACE were 5′-GSP1 (5′-TAGATGATGTCGTTCTCGAGAA-3′) and 5′-GSP2 (5′-CATGCGCCGGTGCTGGAACCA-3′). For the 3′-RACE, two gene-specific primers (3′-GSP1 and 3′-GSP2) and a (T)12 primer were used. The sequences of the gene-specific 3′-primers were: 3′-GSP1, 5′-TTCTCGAGAACGACATCATCTA-3′, and 3′-GSP2, 5′-TCTGCTCGCCACAGCCATGCTTT-3′. The PCR products of the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, respectively, were gel purified and cloned into pUC18 and subsequently sequenced according to the procedure above. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined by alignment of overlapping sequences of the 1,430-bp PCR product and the sequences of the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE. A cDNA sequence for cloning into the expression vector pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was obtained by RT-PCR of total RNA from pig liver using two primers based on sequences in the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, of the deduced coding region. The forward primer (Xho-N, 5′-CTCTCGAGCGTGCACCATGGGGGTCCC-3′) contained a restriction site for cloning (XhoI) and a conserved eukaryotic initiation site sequence as described by Kozak (8Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The reverse primer contained the XbaI restriction site for cloning and the most 3′-nucleotides of the deduced coding sequence (Xba-C, 5′-TTTCTAGAATGGTGTCTTCCTGAGGTTCAG-3′). The PCR cycles were according to the procedure above. The PCR product was gel purified and cloned into a pSVL vector. The cloned pSVL-CYP4A21 was amplified and purified using plasmid Maxi columns (Qiagen), sequenced, and subsequently transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described by Esseret al. (9Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by electroporation (settings 0.4 kV, 100 microfarads). Transfected cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), glutamine, and antibiotics, then washed and harvested. Microsomes from COS cells were isolated by differential centrifugation according to Clark and Waterman (10Clark B.J. Waterman M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), resuspended, and homogenized in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). 14C-Labeled taurochenodeoxycholic acid (25, 145, and 200 μm) was incubated with freshly prepared microsomes from transfected COS cells. In addition to microsomes and substrate, the incubation mixture contained 1 unit of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase from pig liver microsomes (11Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5 μm dithiothreitol, and 2 μm NADPH in a total volume of 1 ml of 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 20 or 30 min and terminated with 5 ml of ethanol. The incubation mixtures were prepared for thin layer chromatography as described previously (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The chromatoplates were analyzed by radioactivity scanning. Two unlabeled authentic 6-hydroxylated chenodeoxycholic acid metabolites, 3α,6α,7α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid and 3α,6“,7α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid (Steraloids, Inc.), were used as external standards in thin layer chromatography. Hydroxylase activity toward lauric acid was assayed by incubation of microsomes from transfected COS cells with 14C-labeled lauric acid (100 μm), 1 unit of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and 2 μm NADPH in a total volume of 0.2 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 6% acetic acid in ethanol. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography according to Okitaet al. (12Okita R.T. Clark J.E. Okita J.R. Siler Masters B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using a Radiomatic detector. As positive controls of the activity assays, freshly prepared pig liver microsomes were used and incubated with respective substrate according to the procedure described above except that NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was omitted. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar) with 15% acrylamide and 0.09% bisacrylamide slab gels containing 0.1% SDS. The proteins on the gels were electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified 6α-hydroxylase (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) as primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized with an ECL Western blotting analysis system. The filter was stripped of bound antibodies and immunodetected a second time with antibodies raised against rat CYP4A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from pig liver (20 μg) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel containing formamide as described by Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A nucleotide sequence corresponding to the coding sequence of the cloned cDNA was32P-labeled using a Megaprime labeling kit and used as probe. The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe in hybridization buffer containing 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 100 μg/ml denatured single-stranded DNA, 100 μg/ml total RNA, and 1× PE (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodiumpyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.2% polyinylpyrolidine, 0.2% Ficoll, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C. The membrane was washed twice in each of the following solutions, 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 62 °C, and 0.2× SSC for 10 min at room temperature. The membrane was exposed to Fuji RX film. Total RNA was extracted from nine different tissues of pig (heart, muscle, intestine, spleen, thymus, lung, adrenal gland, kidney, and liver) using RNeasy Midi kits or according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). The quality of RNA was checked by formamide gel electrophoresis. Total RNA (1 μg) from each tissue was reversed transcribed, and the cDNA obtained was used for PCR. A reverse primer (RNON-CONS, 5′-TGGAGTCGTGACCTGCAGC-3′), which hybridizes to position 995 of CYP4A21 (see Fig. 1) was used together with the forward primer Xho-N described above. PCR was performed in presence of 2.5 mmMg2+ and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min) and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequence of CYP4A21, from the restriction site AatII at position 951 to position 1578 (Fig. 1), was amplified by PCR using CYP4A21 cDNA as template. A forward primer, 5′-CTTGACGTCCGTGCCGAAGTGGACACGTTCATGTTCGAGGGTCATGACACCACAGCC-3′ containing the restriction site AatII for cloning and nucleotides coding for three point mutations (A314F, A315E, S319T) was used in combination with a reverse primer, 3CB (5′-TTTCTAGAGCTTGTCCTTGTCCCCACA-3′, which hybridizes to a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). PCR was performed in presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min) and 72 °C for 10 min. The 600-bp PCR product was gel-purified, digested with AatII and XbaI, and subcloned into a pBluescript IIKS-ligated CYP4A21 sequence between positions 951 and 1578. The mutated sequence of CYP4A21 thus obtained was digested further with the restriction enzymes BsmBI andBsu36I, and the fragment between nucleotides 588 and 1535 (Fig. 1) was subsequently cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression plasmid pSVL-CYP4A21. The mutated CYP4A21 sequence, cloned into pSVL, was verified by sequencing and used for transfection of COS cells by the DEAE-dextran method (9Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed from peptide sequences of the purified protein (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A 1,430-bp PCR product was produced with a forward primer based on residues in the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein and a reverse primer based on a tryptic fragment, which in an alignment with rabbit CYP4A7, was the most C-terminal sequence obtained from the protein. The DNA sequence of this PCR product was analyzed. Nucleotides in the 5′- and 3′-regions of the cDNA were obtained by use of 5′- and 3′-RACE procedures. The sequence of the full-length cDNA was finally determined by alignment of overlapping sequences. The complete nucleotide sequence of the CYP4A21 and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1.Underlined sequences correspond to peptides obtained by tryptic cleavage and N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein as reported previously (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All tryptic fragments have Arg and Lys in positions that permit trypsin cleavage, and the peptide sequences completely match those encoded by the cDNA. Of the 20 N-terminal residues sequenced in the purified protein, 19 were in full agreement with those of the deduced sequence. One residue, Ala in position 17, was replaced by Ser in the encoded sequence. The N terminus of the deduced sequence had an additional Met in the 5′-end compared with that of the purified protein. The cDNA is 2,400 bp long and contains a 37-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 1,515-bp open reading frame, and an 848-bp 3′-UTR downstream from the TAA terminal codon. The cDNA encodes a protein of 504 amino acids containing the P450 signature motif of 10 residues (444) which includes the invariant cysteine residue that ligates the heme iron (16Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The conserved poly(A) additional site signal (17Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 277-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) could not be identified in the 3′-UTR, indicating that the (T)12primer used adhered to a poly(A)-rich sequence upstream from the poly(A) tail. The terminal nucleotides of the 3′-UTR are thus likely missing in the cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 1. The DNA sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence exhibit between 75 and 79% overall sequence identity with the reported sequences for known members of the CYP4A subfamily from rabbit and human (18Palmer C.N.A.

Kishimoto T. Kusunose M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is generally considered that all cytochrome P450 enzymes share a largely conserved tertiary structure core of amino acids (23Lewis D.F.V. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic sequence of about 20 residues in the N-terminal of eukaryotic P450 enzymes is thought to represent a transmembrane anchor. In the deduced amino acid sequence of CYP4A21 this N-terminal sequence is shorter by six residues compared with other CYP4A subfamilies. A unique, highly conserved region exclusively found in members of the CYP4A and 4B subfamilies (24Gasser R. Philpot R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 617-625PubMed Google Scholar) is located around position 315. In CYP4A21, however, amino acid substitutions in this region are found. As shown in Fig. 2, Phe and Glu are replaced by Ala in positions 314 and 315, and Thr is replaced by Ser in position 319 of CYP4A21. The sequences in the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of CYP4A21 show no overall identity with those of other members of the CYP4A subfamily. A short sequence between nucleotides 1686 and 1721 in the 3′-UTR of CYP4A21 shows 94% identity with that of a sequence in the 3′-UTR of CYP4A11 (1716–1751). The significance of this similarity is not known at present. To ascertain that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional enzyme, a nucleotide sequence from position 37 to 1549 (Fig. 1) was produced by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pSVL for transfection of COS-1 cells. Mock transfection with the pSVL vector without the cDNA insert was used as a control. Microsomes were isolated from transfected cells by differential centrifugation and subsequently used for the assay of hydroxylase activity and Western blot analysis. 6α-Hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid was assayed by incubating microsomes isolated from transfected COS cells with14C-labeled taurochenodeoxycholic acid. The conjugated substrate was chosen because previous studies with pig liver microsomes have shown that the rate of 6α-hydroxylation was five times more efficient when taurochenodeoxycholic acid was used as substrate compared with chenodeoxycholic acid (4Boström H. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 807-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation mixtures were subsequently analyzed by thin layer chromatography together with standards of the unlabeled authentic 6α- and 6“-hydroxylated metabolites, 3α,6α,7α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid and 3α,6“,7α-trihydroxy-5“-cholanoic acid. A single radioactive peak corresponding to the migration of the 6α-hydroxylated product (Rf = 0.22) was seen in samples incubated with microsomes from COS cells transfected with the pSVL-vector containing CYP4A21 cDNA but not in samples incubated with microsomes from the mock-transfected COS cells. The 6“-hydroxylated metabolite standard migrated with a lower Rf value (Rf = 0.16). Microsomes of the cells transfected with CYP4A21 cDNA catalyzed 6α-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid at a rate between 5 and 50 pmol/mg of microsomal protein/min, using three concentrations of substrate (25, 145, and 200 μm). A similar range of activity, dependent on the substrate concentration, was found in preparations of pig liver microsomes using the same incubation procedure (Table I). AKm of 62.9 μm has been calculated previously for the purified pig liver enzyme (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The higher rate of 6α-hydroxylation by recombinantly expressed CYP4A21 with higher concentrations of substrate is consistent with theKm-value for the purified enzyme and the high concentrations of bile acids in portal venous blood (50–170 μm) (25Arias I.M.

Open table in a new tab A preparation of microsomes from COS cells transfected with CYP4A21 cDNA was used for the assay of hydroxylase activities toward both taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lauric acid. Microsomal protein (1 mg) from transfected COS cells and pig liver, respectively, was incubated with 25, 145, and 200 μm taurochenodeoxycholic acid and 100 μm lauric acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 6α-hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid in the transfected COS cell microsomes is comparable to that in pig liver microsomes, whereas there is a marked difference in ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxylation of lauric acid. Microsomes isolated from COS cells transfected with CYP4A21 cDNA did not show ω- or (ω-1)-hydroxylase activity toward lauric acid. In Table I, the hydroxylase activities toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lauric acid, using the same preparation of microsomes from CYP4A21-transfected COS cells, are shown together with results using freshly prepared pig liver microsomes. The 6α-hydroxylase activity in microsomes from transfected COS cells and pig liver microsomes is comparable, but the ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxylase activities, present in pig liver microsomes, were not detectable with microsomes from the transfected COS cells. It has been shown in rat and human liver that formation of a ω-hydroxy metabolite of lauric acid is a marker of CYP4A enzyme activity, whereas other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, like members of the CYP2 family, hydroxylate primarily the (ω-1)-position of lauric acid (26Powell P.K.

The present results strongly indicate that 6α-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and ω-hydroxylation of lauric acid in pig liver microsomes are performed by two distinct isozymes. Thus, the cloned microsomal porcine enzyme is not a pig equivalent to the CYP4A fatty acid hydroxylase enzymes found in other species. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase (5Araya Z. Hellman U. Hansson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and antibodies raised against rat CYP4A were used to detect immunoreactive proteins in microsomes of transfected COS cells. Samples from pig liver microsomes and the purified 6α-hydroxylase enzyme were used as positive controls. As shown in Fig. 3, microsomal protein from COS cells transfected with the pSVL vector containing CYP4A21 cDNA was detected by both antibodies. The electrophoretic mobility of the immunoreactive protein was the same as that of the protein recognized by antibodies in pig liver microsomes and purified protein. Microsomes from mock-transfected cells did not show immunoreactive proteins with similar electrophoretic mobility. The ability of the antibodies raised against rat CYP4A to bind expressed CYP4A21 indicates that similar epitopes are recognized in both proteins. The overall amino acid sequence identity between pig taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase and rat CYP4A is about 68%. Total RNA from pig liver was subjected to Northern blot analysis. A nucleotide sequence corresponding to the coding sequence of CYP4A21 was labeled and used as probe. As shown in Fig. 4, the probe hybridized with one major band corresponding to ∼2.5 kb. The cloned cDNA is a nucleotide sequence of 2.4 kb, but a proper poly(A) signal sequence in the terminal 3′-UTR is missing, indicating that the mRNA is longer. An mRNA of 2.5 kb could thus correspond to the full-length mRNA. Members of the CYP4A gene subfamily have been found in various mammalian tissues including the liver, kidney, lung, intestine, brain, prostate, uterus, and placenta (30Simpson A.E.C.M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Considering the high homology between CYP4A genes, an RT-PCR procedure was chosen for investigation of tissue expression of CYP4A21 in pig. A CYP4A21-specific reverse primer (RNON-CONS), which hybridizes to position 995 of CYP4A21 but not to the corresponding conserved sequence of CYP4A fatty acid hydroxylases, was used in combination with a forward primer (Xho-N) (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 5, an intense band corresponding to the size of the expected amplified region (956 bp) was obtained using total RNA from liver. A faint band of the same size was also seen with total RNA from kidney, whereas total RNA from other tissues (heart, muscle, intestine, spleen, thymus, lung, and adrenal gland) did not generate bands of similar size. Because of the RT-PCR result using total RNA from pig kidney, the hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid was tested using pig kidney microsomes (1 mg and 5 mg). The activity was, however, below the limit of detection. The RT-PCR and activity measurement experiments indicate a substantially lower expression of the enzyme in kidney compared with liver. To study the importance of Ala-314, Ala-315, and Ser-319 for the 6α-hydroxylase activity, a mutated sequence of the CYP4A21 was produced using a primer containing nucleotides coding for the corresponding conserved amino acids Phe-314, Glu-315, and Thr-319 (Fig.2). The three mutations thus introduced in CYP4A21 were A314F, A315E, and S319T. The mutated sequence was cloned into pSVL vector and used for transfection of COS cells. Microsomes prepared from the transfected COS cells were used for Western blot and activity assays. Expression of a protein in COS cell microsomes was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against rat CYP4A. An immunoreactive band with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the expressed CYP4A21 and of the purified 6α-hydroxylase was detected (results not shown). Microsomes from COS cells transfected with the mutant CYP4A21 did not show hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid or lauric acid. This indicates that the mutated amino acids in the active site of CYP4A21 are involved in the catalytic activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid but are not the sole determinants for the CYP4A enzyme activity toward lauric acid. The primary structure of the taurochenodeoxycholic acid 6α-hydroxylase (CYP4A21) from pig liver described in this paper reveals it to be a member of the CYP4A subfamily. The hitherto known CYP4A enzymes catalyze ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxylations of fatty acids and/or prostaglandins and are often referred to as fatty acid hydroxylases. Despite the overall sequence similarity (74% identity) between the human fatty acid hydroxylase CYP4A11 and the present CYP4A21, the former showed no 6α-hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid (31Araya Z. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and the latter no hydroxylase activity toward lauric acid. A change in substrate specificity from a fatty acid to a steroid nucleus among CYP4A enzymes is notable and is probably caused by amino acid substitutions in regions involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. An unexpected difference between the deduced amino acid sequence of CYP4A21 and those of other hitherto cloned members of the CYP4A subfamily is amino acid substitutions found in the otherwise conserved sequence around residue 315 (24Gasser R. Philpot R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 617-625PubMed Google Scholar). Based on homology alignment (23Lewis D.F.V. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 2: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (633) Google Scholar) this part of the sequence is located in the center of the I-helix close to the heme in the active site. Amino acids in this region have been reported to define the steric environment of the heme group and contribute to the preference for ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids, a unique feature of CYP4A fatty hydroxylases (33Dierks E.A Davis S.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expressed mutated CYP4A21 (A314F/A315E/S319T) did not show 6α-hydroxylase activity toward taurochenodeoxycholic acid. Thus, introduction of the conserved amino acids in CYP4A21 abolishes the 6α-hydroxylase activity, indicating that Ala-314, Ala-315, and Ser-319 in the active site of CYP4A21 are important for the catalytic activity. Introduction of these amino acids did, however, not convert CYP4A21 into a fatty acid hydroxylase. The presence of a CYP4A fatty acid hydroxylase in pig liver was shown by the ability of pig liver microsomes to ω-hydroxylate lauric acid. It seems likely that the substrate specificity of CYP4A21 and CYP4A fatty acid hydroxylase(s), respectively, in pig liver are highly restricted and determined by residues also outside the active site. Substrate recognition sites distal to the heme moiety have been shown to influence the catalytic activity of rat and human CYP4As in studies using mutated enzymes (34Dierks E.A. Zhang Z. Johnson E.F.

Biophys. 1995; 320: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A number of substrate-binding residues have also been identified in the substrate access channel in a structural model of CYP4A11 (38Chang Y.-T. Loew G.H. Proteins. 1999; 34: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Those studies were, however, confined to the issue of the regiospecificity of fatty acid hydroxylation and catalytic activity toward different fatty acids. The results with CYP4A21 presented here provide new information, which should be useful in further studies on the molecular basis for CYP4A enzymes to bind and hydroxylate a steroid nucleus. Besides structural considerations, the CYP4A21 is interesting also from an evolutionary point of view. The pig is unique in having hyocholic acid as the main trihydroxylated bile acid. The ratio between hyocholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in pigs is comparable to that of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in most other mammals. It has been speculated that the ancestor of the domestic pig had the ability to carry out 12α-hydroxylation and to form cholic acid as the related warthog now does, but this ability was subsequently lost. Formation of hyocholic acid by 6α-hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic acid might have evolved as a more biochemically expedient way to fill the requirement of trihydroxylated bile acids brought about by some change in dietary circumstances (1Haslewood G.A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 535-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CYP4 family is one of the oldest cytochrome P450 families having diverged from a common ancestor over 1.25 billion years ago (30Simpson A.E.C.M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 39Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 943-945Crossref Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 40Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 572-593PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the speculation that the ability to form hyocholic acid in pigs evolved late by dietary changes, the CYP4A21 is probably a more recent cytochrome P450 compared with the known fatty acid-hydroxylating members of the CYP4A subfamily. In this context, it is interesting to note that the key enzyme in formation of cholic acid, the sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B), shows a high degree of sequence identity with the prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A). In that case, it has been suggested that CYP8A might have diverged from an ancient CYP8B and subsequently acquired the novel function through extensive alteration (41Ishida H. Kuruta Y. Gotoh O. Yamashita C. Yoshida Y. Noshiro M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In humans, increased amounts of hyocholic acid have been found in plasma and urine from patients with cholestatic liver disease and also in fetal blood sample. It seems likely that hydroxylations of bile acids in man, such as 6α-hydroxylation, are a way for detoxification of accumulating cytotoxic bile acids when the normal pathways for excretion are either disturbed (as in cholestasis) or poorly developed (as in the fetus). CYP3A4 has been shown to carry out 6α-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid in experiments with human liver microsomes and recombinantly overexpressed enzyme (31Araya Z. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A role for CYP3A4 in hyocholic acid formation in man is supported by the observation that 6α-hydroxylation of bile acids in humans is stimulated by rifampicin, a well known inducer of CYP3A4 (42Wietholtz H. Marschall H.U. Sjövall J. Matern S. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 713-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is not known at present whether an additional 6α-hydroxylating enzyme, orthologous to the porcine CYP4A21, is expressed in human or in other species besides pig. The present results showing a low expression of CYP4A21 in pig kidney indicate that this enzyme has functions in addition to participating in bile acid biosynthesis in pig liver. In conclusion, this paper describes the cloning and deduced primary structure of a novel CYP4A enzyme (CYP4A21) with the ability to 6α-hydroxylate taurochenodeoxycholic acid. In addition to its biological role in formation of hyocholic acid in the pig, this enzyme is also interesting from evolutionary and structural aspects. The porcine CYP4A21 opens up possibilities to study the evolutionary relationship between this enzyme and other members of the CYP4A subfamily and should contribute to our understanding of features important for the substrate specificity of CYP4A enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2027581208,"The mechanism of stimulation of a DNA helicase by its cognate single-strand DNA-binding protein was examined using herpes simplex virus type-1 UL9 DNA helicase and ICP8. UL9 and ICP8 are two essential components of the viral replisome that associate into a complex to unwind the origins of replication. The helicase and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of UL9 are greatly elevated as a consequence of this association. Given that ICP8 acts as a single-strand DNA-binding protein, the simplest model that can account for its stimulatory effect predicts that it tethers UL9 to the DNA template, thereby increasing its processivity. In contrast to the prediction, data presented here show that the stimulatory activity of ICP8 does not depend on its single-strand DNA binding activity. Our data support an alternative hypothesis in which ICP8 modulates the activity of UL9. Accordingly, the data show that the ICP8-binding site of UL9 constitutes an inhibitory region that maintains the helicase in an inefficient ground state. ICP8 acts as a positive regulator by neutralizing this region. ICP8 does not affect substrate binding, ATP hydrolysis, or the efficiency of translocation/DNA unwinding. Rather, we propose that ICP8 increases the efficiency with which substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis are coupled to translocation/DNA unwinding."

We were unable to isolate clones of transfected 32Dcl3 cells expressing Cbl-ΔY371 that proliferated in the absence of IL-3. In contrast, 32Dcl3/Cbl-ΔY371 cells did not undergo apoptosis like parental 32Dcl3 cells when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Both 32Dcl3 and 32D/CblΔY371 cells arrested in G1 when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Approximately 18% of the 32Dcl3 cells cultured in the absence of IL-3 for 24 h were present in a sub-G1 fraction, while only 4% of the 32D/Cbl-ΔY371 and 2% of the 32D/Bcl-2 cells were found in a sub-G1 fraction. There was no difference in the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins observed following stimulation of either cell type with IL-3.

No differences were detected in the activation of Akt, ERK1, or ERK2 in unstimulated or IL-3-stimulated 32D/Cbl-ΔY371 cells compared with parental 32Dcl3 cells.

We observed a consistent increased amount of Bcl-2 protein in five different clones of 32D/Cbl-ΔY317 cells. These data suggest that the Cbl-ΔY371 mutant may suppress apoptosis by a mechanism that involves the overexpression of Bcl-2.

Evidence demonstrating that Cbl plays a critical role in these functions is lacking, particularly since mice bearing homologous loss of both alleles encoding c-Cbl have a relatively mild phenotype (49Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J. Barnett L. Bertoncello I. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Cbl was first discovered as the oncogene present in the Cas NS-1 retrovirus, which has been shown to induce B-cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemia in mice (50Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The v-cbl oncogene is also capable of transforming NIH3T3 cells in vitro, and these transformed cells are tumorigenic when injected into nude mice (51Andoniou C.E. Thein C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4515-4523Google Scholar). The v-Cbl oncogene consists of the amino-terminal end of the gag gene fused to the amino-terminal end of c-Cbl encompassing the amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding region but lacking the ring finger motif, the proline-rich region, and the C-terminal end, which contains several major phosphorylation sites (50Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 52Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Other oncogenic forms of c-Cbl have been discovered (51Andoniou C.E. Thein C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4515-4523Google Scholar). The murine pre-B cell line 70Z expresses an oncogenic form of Cbl in which 17 amino acids, from 366 to 382, have been deleted (51Andoniou C.E. Thein C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4515-4523Google Scholar). Studies by Langdon and colleagues have demonstrated that deletion of either of two single amino acids within this 17-amino acid region results in the oncogenic activation of c-Cbl (51Andoniou C.E. Thein C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4515-4523Google Scholar). In this study, we have utilized one of these mutants, CblΔY371, in which Tyr371 has been deleted. The expression of oncogenes in hematopoietic cells results in numerous changes, including induction of growth factor-independent proliferation (53Anderson S.M. Carroll P.M. Lee F.D.

Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 60Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of oncogenic forms of Cbl in fibroblasts results in an increase in the number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, suggesting that one or more tyrosine kinases have been activated by v-Cbl (61Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously studied the ability of two activated tyrosine kinases, v-Src and BCR-ABL, to induce growth factor-independent proliferation of growth factor-dependent cell lines (53Anderson S.M. Carroll P.M. Lee F.D. Oncogene. 1989; 5: 317-325Google Scholar, 54Anderson S.M. Mladenovic J. Blood. 1996; 87: 238-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, we were able to provide evidence that these oncogenes induced the autocrine production of growth factors such as IL-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These oncogenes are also able to block the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to induce terminal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cell lines such as 32Dcl3 (53Anderson S.M. Carroll P.M. Lee F.D. Oncogene. 1989; 5: 317-325Google Scholar, 57Rovera G. Valtieri M. Mavilio F. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that oncogenic forms of Cbl would induce growth factor-independent proliferation of factor-dependent cells in a manner like that observed with v-Src. Contrary to our expectation, we observed instead that the CblΔY371 deletion mutant suppressed apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. The mechanism by which apoptosis is suppressed appears to involve an increase in the level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The 32Dcl3 cell line was obtained from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh), and their cultivation has been described recently (18Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fetal calf serum was from Summit Biotechnology (Fort Collins, CO). Recombinant murine IL-3 (mIL-3) was obtained from Becton-Dickinson/Collaborative Biotechnology, Inc. (Franklin Lakes, NJ). All other media components were from Life Technologies, Inc. 32Dcl3 cells expressing the various mutants of c-Cbl were generated by introducing the plasmid DNAs of interest into 32Dcl3 cells with a Cell-Porator (1000 V/cm at 800 microfarads) (Life Technologies). Electroporation chambers used had a 0.4-cm gap between the electrodes, and cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without any additional supplements at room temperature. The CblΔY371 mutant was expressed in the pZEN-Neo vector (51Andoniou C.E. Thein C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4515-4523Google Scholar), which contains the neomycin resistance marker as a dominant selectable marker. A Bcl-2 expression vector was constructed in which the coding sequence of Bcl-2 was inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following electroporation, the cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3 for 2–3 days. Transfected cells were then selected by the addition of 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). G418-resistant cells were allowed to expand in the presence of IL-3 for 3 days, after which the drug was removed. Conditions that allow the isolation of growth factor-independent cells have been previously described (53Anderson S.M. Carroll P.M. Lee F.D. Oncogene. 1989; 5: 317-325Google Scholar, 54Anderson S.M. Mladenovic J. Blood. 1996; 87: 238-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell clones were then isolated following growth of the cells at limiting dilution in semisolid media containing 0.6% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC Corp., Freeport, ME). Isolated colonies were picked from soft agar, expanded in liquid culture, and used in the described experiments. Multiple clones of 32D/CblΔY371cells were obtained from two separate electroporations to eliminate the possibility of examining “sister” clones. All clones used in these studies were negative for mycoplasma; this is important, since a recent report indicates that mycoplasma can suppress apoptosis of 32Dcl3 and induce growth factor-independent proliferation (62Feng S.-H. Tsai S. Rodriguez J. Lo S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7995-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 16 h in media supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum to reduce the basal level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins prior to stimulation with recombinant mIL-3 for the indicated periods of time. In one set of experiments, cells were removed from IL-3 and starved for 0–8 h to determine the kinetics with which phosphorylated proteins disappeared. Cells to be immunoprecipitated were lysed in EB (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate with 100 units/ml Kallikrein inhibitor), and the lysates were clarified by spinning at 13,000 rpm in a Savant RCF13K refrigerated microcentrifuge for 30 min. A 1-μg amount of the indicated antibody was added to a cell lysate made from 2 × 107 32Dcl3 cells in a final volume of 1 ml and placed on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by adding 30 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) to each immunoprecipitate for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Detection of proteins by immunoblotting was conducted using the enhanced chemiluminescence lighting (ECL) system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, rabbit anti-JAK2, and sheep anti-Akt were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Akt was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-phospho-ERK was obtained from Promega Biotechnology (Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies directed against Cbl, ERK1/2, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-XL, Bak, and A1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to Mcl1 and Bad were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A monoclonal antibody directed against the influenza HA epitope tag (clone 12CA5) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A monoclonal antibody 4G10 directed against phosphotyrosine was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Druker (University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR). A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against STAT5 was provided by Andrew Larner (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH). Nonimmune rabbit serum was obtained from our own nonimmunized animals. Cultures were initiated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium that either contained or lacked 50 units/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (rmIL-3). The proliferation of 32Dcl3 cells was monitored by direct counting of viable cells, which excluded trypan blue. Results were plotted as the number of viable cells at each time point examined. In one study, 100 nmwortmannin (Calbiochem) was added to each set of cells, and the proliferation of cells was monitored as described. Controls for this study included cultures with the same concentration of ethanol, the solvent in which the wortmannin was dissolved, as that present in the wortmannin-treated cultures. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 50 units/ml rmIL-3 for varying periods of time. Samples of cells were withdrawn at varying time points, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant fluid was removed, and the pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatant fluid was removed, and the pellet was vortexed briefly. A 0.5-ml volume of saponin/propridium iodide solution was added (PBS containing 0.3% saponin, 25 μg/ml propidium iodide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml RNase) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Stained cells were stored for up to 24 h at 4 °C before analysis. Ten thousand stained cells were analyzed with a Coulter XL flow cytometer (Hialeah, FL). Cell cycle modeling was performed with the ModFit software package (Verity House Software, Topsham, ME). The Caspase-3 Cellular Activity Assay Kit PLUS (Catalogue number AK-703) from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA) was used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. At varying time points, a sample of cells used was removed and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Following complete lysis of the cells, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C until all the samples were collected. Caspase assays were performed as outlined by the manufacturer, and the cleavage of the substrate,N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanaline), was monitored at 1-min intervals on a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Data were plotted as A405 versus time for each sample. The initial time period over which change in ODversus time was linear was used to"

On the basis of partial tube-peptide sequences previously obtained, experiments using reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends led to the complete cDNA sequence. Analysis of its deduced amino acid sequence shows the presence of two chitin-binding domains. These domains are closely related to type 2 chitin-binding domains that are restricted to the animal kingdom. We showed by affinity assay and immunogold labeling that RCBP is the first protein so far known that binds specifically β-chitin and that is unable to bind the most common α-form found in chitin secreting animals. The RCBP mRNA was found to be present in specific epidermal cells from the worm body wall, but never in the chitin-secreting gland cells. This unexpected result clearly indicates that this tube protein is synthesized in specialized areas of the outer epithelium and that at least two different tissues are involved in this exoskeleton synthesis.AF266752 A cDNA from Riftia pachyptila was cloned.

In such ECM, chitin microfibrils are embedded in a proteinaceous matrix. Chitin is a polymer of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, but naturally occurring forms vary in the length and arrangement of their chains. The major form of chitin in living kingdom is α-chitin, as encountered in mushrooms and arthropods (1Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin. Pergamon Press, Oxford1977Google Scholar). This common form, the more stable one, is characterized by an anti-parallel joining of polysaccharidic chains. In contrast, β-chitin is only present in few species like in squid pen, diatoms, some protists (2Mulisch M. Eur. J. Protistology. 1993; 29: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in tubes of pogonophorans as Riftia pachyptila (3Southward E.C. Harrison F.W. Rice M.E. Microscopic Anatomy of Invertebrates. 12. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 327-369Google Scholar, 4Gardiner S.L. Jones M.L. Harrison F.W. Rice M.E. Microscopic Anatomy of Invertebrates. 12.

Elsevier Applied Science, London1992: 216-224Crossref Google Scholar). This rare β form of chitin corresponds to a parallel joining of chains. The giant vestimentiferan worm R. pachyptila (up to 2 meters in length), found around the deep sea hydrothermal vents (6Jones M.L. Bull. Biol. Soc. ( Wash. ). 1985; 6: 117-158Google Scholar), inhabits a tube which is made of β-chitin associated with proteins (7Gaill F. Hunt S. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1986; 34: 267-274Crossref Google Scholar, 8Gaill F. FASEB. J. 1993; 7: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Shillito B. Lechaire J.P. Gaill F. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 59-67Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous studies on R. pachyptila have shown that large β-chitin secreting glands (present in all the four main regions of the animal except obturaculum) were involved in the tube wall production (10Gaill F. Shillito B. Lechaire J.P. Chanzy H. Goffinet G. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 201-204Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Shillito B. Lübbering B. Lechaire J.-P. Childress J.J. Gaill F. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 67-75Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins, the other component of ECMs, were mostly studied in arthropods and some of them are supposed to interact with chitin by means of specific domains. Chitin-binding proteins form a highly diversified group. They are encountered in bacteria (12Kolbe S. Fischer S. Becirevic A. Hinz P. Schrempf H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), (13Watanabe T. Kimura K. Sumiya T. Nikaidou N. Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Ferrer S. Regue M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) linked or not to a catalytic subunit. Functions of these proteins can thus range from a simple binding, like lectins, to chitinase activity, or even antimicrobial and antifungal properties in case of tachycitin (17Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Agarwala K.L. Saito T. Cho J.K. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of several chitin-binding proteins has been studied, and results showed that some proteins bind only α-chitin (12Kolbe S. Fischer S. Becirevic A. Hinz P. Schrempf H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), when others recognize both α and β-chitin forms (19Blaak H. Schrempf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but until the present work, no β-chitin-specific protein have been reported. Because R. pachyptila is a producer of large quantities of β-chitin, we have undertaken the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a protein whose deduced amino acid sequence presents chitin-binding domains and is thus called RCBP (Riftiachitin-binding polypeptide). Furthermore, to check that the chitin-binding domains predicted by search in data bases are functional, RCBP was expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for in vitro chitin binding using α and β-chitin as ligands. To specify the origin of this putative tube component, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis were performed using tissues from the different regions of this deep sea worm. R. pachyptila samples were collected on the East Pacific Rise depths by the Nautile or Alvin submersibles (HERO 94, LARVAE 95, HOT 96, and HOPE 99 cruises, 2600-m depth). The body of this worm presents four successive main anatomical regions from the upper to the most basal part (for review, see Ref. 6Jones M.L. Bull. Biol. Soc. ( Wash. ). 1985; 6: 117-158Google Scholar). The obturacular region, with its branchial plume, is the primary exchange surface of the animal. The vestimentum serves to hold the plume out of the tube opening in the external seawater. The trunk houses endosymbiotic bacteria, and the opisthosome acts as a holdfast, against which the worm may move into the tube. Once dissected immediately after arrival on board, the tissues from the four main regions of the worm (obturaculum, vestimentum, trunk, and opisthosome) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA from tissues of the four main regions of the worm were extracted by the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol method as described previously (20Bouhin H. Charles J.P. Quennedey B. Courrent A. Delachambre J. Insect Mol. Biol. 1992; 1: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-rich RNA were purified by affinity with oligo(dT)-cellulose (21Celano P. Vertino P.M. Casero Jr., R.A. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 26-28PubMed Google Scholar). The amount and the purity of each RNA sample were estimated using spectrophotometric measurements at 260 and 280 nm. Poly(A)-rich RNA from the four different main regions were used as templates for reverse transcription using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT) anchor primer (22Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). This anchor has the peculiarity to hybridize specifically at the beginning of the polyadenylated region of the mRNAs. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for different PCRs with degenerated primers A and B (primer A, 5′-TGR TCN GCN GGN GCY TC-3′; primer B, 5′-GGN AAY WSN GCN TAY GT-3′). These two primers, designed from the amino acid sequences of previously microsequenced peptides E1 and C (23Chamoy L. Nicolaı̈ M. Quennedey B. Gaill F. Delachambre J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 421-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), corresponded to the uncoding strand of the peptide E1 cDNA and to the coding strand of the peptide C cDNA. The products were amplified by 30 cycles of PCR. Each cycle comprises 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at different annealing temperatures, and 2 min at 72 °C, and then 10 min at 72 °C for the last cycle extension step. After testing the annealing temperatures from 42 °C to 56 °C, the optimal conditions to obtain a single specific band were 30 cycles at 46 °C of annealing temperature. Reaction was performed in 20 μl containing 50 pmol for each primer, 0.3 mmdeoxynucleotides, and 0.1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the appropriate enzyme buffer. Separation of PCR products was performed on 1% agarose gel, and DNA purification was carried out on an anion exchange column after solubilization of the gel-containing band (Sigmapur®). Fragments were subcloned in a T/A cloning plasmid (pGEM-T Easy, Promega) and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence of the fragment obtained by RT-PCR, two sets of specific primers (C and D and E and F) were synthesized and used for RACE. For 3′ RACE, poly (A)-rich RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) anchor primer (22Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). A 30-cycle nested PCR was carried out using the anchor primer in combination with a specific primer (primer C, 5′-CGT GTG TTC TGC GAG GGT GGA TTC G-3′), then with a second specific primer (primer D, 5′-CGC ACG TTT GCT GCC GCA CAT ACA C-3′). Each of the 30 cycles comprised 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at annealing temperature (50 °C for the 5 first cycles and 60 °C for the 25 lasting cycles), and 3 min at 72 °C. The amplified product was purified, subcloned, and sequenced on both strands as described above for RT-PCR. For 5′ RACE, the first strand cDNA was 3′-tailed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and dCTP. This matrix was used for the second strand cDNA synthesis, using 1 μm poly(G) adapter-primer, 50 μm dNTPs in one PCR cycle with 0.1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 30-cycle nested PCR was carried out using the poly(G) adapter-anchor primer in combination with a specific primer (primer E, 5′-AGT AGG CGA CAC AGG TGG AC-3′), then with a second specific primer (primer F, 5′-GTG TAT GTG CGG CAG CAA ACG TGC G-3′). The PCR conditions and product analysis were the same as for 3′ RACE. The signal peptide was located using the SignalP program (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar). Data base searches were performed using Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of chitin-binding domains were carried out using the CLUSTALW (Windows®) program (27Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar). β-Chitin was extracted from R. pachyptila tube according to a protocol derived from Ref. 28Gaill F. Persson J. Sugiyama J. Vuong R. Chanzy H. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 116-128Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar. Dissected frozen R. pachyptila tube fragments were stirred overnight in a 5% (w/v) aqueous KOH solution at room temperature. The specimens were then rinsed with distilled water and treated for 2 h with a chlorite solution at 70 °C. The chlorite solution was prepared by mixing 3 volumes of distilled water with 2 volumes of the following solutions mixed (v/v) (solution A, 17 g·liter−1 NaClO2 solution in water; solution B, aqueous 27 g·liter−1 NaOH solution in 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid). The chlorite treatment was followed by thorough washing with distilled water and immersion again in 5% aqueous KOH overnight. Three new chlorite treatments were then applied, each treatment being followed by washing and overnight immersion in aqueous KOH. After washing, the preparation was boiled 2 h in 2.5 n HCl, sonicated 15 min, and submitted to a final step of 4 h in boiling 2.5 n HCl. The samples were then neutralized with 1 n NaOH, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and either dried (for affinity experiments) or stored in methanol (to prepare grids for electron microscopy). The quality of β-chitin extracted from R. pachyptila was controlled by electron microscopy (data not shown) prior to use for both type of binding assays. Crab shell α-chitin and microgranular cellulose used for affinity experiments were purchased from Sigma (C3641 and C6413 references, respectively). For microscopy grid preparation, α-chitin was resuspended by boiling crab shell chitin for 4 h in 1 n HCl (2 h two times separated by 24 h at room temperature). The samples were then neutralized with 1 N NaOH, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and stored in methanol. Primers were designed from the full-length cDNA sequence to amplify a 550-bp fragment ofRCBP from the beginning of the open reading frame (ORF) minus signal peptide (base position 113), to base position 662 after Stop codon. Amplification was achieved with a 30-cycle PCR. Each cycle comprised 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 62 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, repeated 30 times. Restriction enzyme sites, i.e. BamHI andPstI, were added to specific sequences of primers (primer G, 5′-TAA GGA TCC TGC GGA GGC CCG TGT GAG GC-3′; primer H, 5′-TAA CTG CAG CTC TCT AGC CTC TGC CTA CG-3′) to subclone PCR products directionally in an expression cloning plasmid that has the peculiarity to add a 6-histidine tag to the N terminus of the recombinant protein (pQE-30, QIAexpressionist®, Qiagen). Reading frame and integrity of the cloned cDNA were checked by double strand sequencing. Transformed E. coli produced recombinant RCBP following kit recommendations except that 2% (w/v) glucose and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm were added to Luria-Bertani medium to avoid recombinant protein degradation. All lysis steps were done at 4 °C, including centrifugation. Induced cultures were centrifuged and harvested bacteria were lysed under native condition as follows; cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (40 μg·ml−1 bacitracin, 40 μg·ml−1 bestatin, 1 μg·ml−1 pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and sonicated for 12 s at room temperature before a centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), to remove cellular lysis fragments. The supernatant, a complete bacterial lysate, was used in binding experiments so that recombinant RCBP was in competition with bacterial proteins for chitin binding. RCBP predicted chitin binding activity was tested against the two α- and β-chitin natural forms, to reveal a possible form specificity. Cellulose was used as a negative polysaccharide control. The affinity assay binding step was done overnight at 4 °C by shaking RCBP lysate with one polymer (20 mg of β-chitin from R. pachyptila or α-chitin from crab shell or cellulose, as obtained previously, resuspended in an equal minimal volume of phosphate buffer 10 mm, pH 6). Flow-through of RCBP lysate was collected by centrifugation. After a wash with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6, added with 1 m NaCl, three successive elution steps (by mixing followed of a 30-min 4000 × g 4 °C centrifugation) were undergone with aqueous acetic acid solutions of increasing concentration: 10 mm, 500 mm, and 2m. The five fractions collected were dried in SpeedVac® concentrator and used for further analysis. The polysaccharide matrices were then stripped of possible remaining proteins by boiling with SDS-PAGE 5-fold concentrated sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The protein pellets from different fractions were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 4% 2-mercaptoethanol), then heated for 3 min at 90 °C and separated on SDS-slab gels according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), using a 12.5% polyacrylamide running gel. Polypeptides were blotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schull, 0.2-μm pore size) (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) using a semidry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). Pre-stained protein molecular mass standards from 14 to 94 kDa (Bio-Rad) were used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of the separated polypeptides. The pQE-30 plasmid used has the peculiarity to add a six-histidine tag at the N-terminal end of the expressed recombinant protein, thus allowing recombinant RCBP detection with an anti-histidine tag monoclonal antibody. Unspecific sites on Western blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature under shaking in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin (TBS-T-BSA). Blots were incubated 1 h at room temperature under shaking with the anti-histidine tag mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/3000 in TBS-T-BSA. Nitrocellulose sheets were washed five times for 2 min with TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature under shaking with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antiserum (Sigma), diluted 1/10,000 in TBS-T-BSA. The blot was washed four times for 2 min with TBS-T and once with TBS. Positive bands were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates (Promega). Methanol suspensions of either α- or β-extracted chitins (0.1 g·liter−1 suspensions, prepared as described above) were applied on 400-mesh carbon-coated nickel grids and air-dried. Grids were incubated overnight at 4 °C under soft shaking with RCBP lysate (binding step). Two washes were done at 4 °C with fresh lysis buffer added with 1 m NaCl. The grids were treated mainly according to Whitehouse et al.(32Whitehouse R.L. Benichou J.C. Couture-Tosi E. Schenkman S. Ryter A. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for immunogold labeling. They were deposited onto drops of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% of BSA (PBS-BSA) for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and transferred onto drops of anti-histidine tag mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/3000 in PBS-BSA for 1 h 30 min. After being washed two times in PBS, grids were deposited for 45 min on drops of anti-mouse goat IgG-colloidal gold (10 nm in diameter, British BioCell Tebu®) diluted 1/10 in PBS. They were then rinsed twice in PBS, twice in distilled water, allowed to dry on filter paper without further staining, and observed using a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope at 75 kV. For control grids, all steps described above were achieved except one. A β-chitin grid was treated without first antibody and another one treated without RBCP lysate, both steps replaced by a corresponding PBS incubation. A third β-chitin grid was treated by a lysate of another histidine-tagged recombinant protein without chitin binding activity (33Korchi A. Brossut R. Bouhin H. Delachambre J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), replacing the RCBP lysate. In addition, several grids were prepared with α-chitin and treated with RCBP lysate to test chitin form specificity. Depletion experiments were also performed with RCBP lysate on β-chitin grids. The crude RCBP lysate was pretreated by overnight shaking at 4 °C with an excess of either α-chitin or β-chitin (as obtained previously). Depleted lysates were recovered by centrifugation and then used for overnight binding step as a normal RCBP lysate. Total RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose (0.8%) gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The equal RNA loading (10 μg) on gel lanes was UV-checked after ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 65 °C in 5× NaCl/sodium citrate (with 1× NaCl/sodium citrate defined as 0.15 m NaCl/0.015m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5% SDS, 250 μg·ml−1 salmon sperm DNA, and an [α-32P]dCTP random primed DNA probe of 550 bp (as defined above). After hybridization, membranes were successively washed twice (20 min each) in 2× NaCl/sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and in 0.2× NaCl/ sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak Biomax MR film. The 550-bp [α-32P]dCTP random primed DNA was used as a probe forin situ hybridization to mRNA on R. pachyptila cryosections of the four main regions deposited on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. After three washes, sections were incubated in 0.2 n HCl for 10 min and acetylated with anhydrous acetic acid, then dehydrated in an ethanol series (70%, 95%, and 100%). Dehydrated sections were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in prehybridization buffer (4× NaCl/sodium citrate, 1× Denhardt's solution), and the probe, dissolved in hybridization buffer (50% formamide (v/v), 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 4× NaCl/sodium citrate, 500 μg·ml−1salmon sperm DNA), was deposited on each section for 16 h at 42 °C. After six washes (20 min each) in 4× NaCl/sodium citrate, slides were dehydrated, coated with Ilford K5® emulsion and exposed for 4 days, then stained with light green dye (34Martoja R. Martoja-Pierson M. Initiation aux Techniques de l'Histologie Animale. 1st Ed. Masson et Cie, Paris1967Google Scholar) before examination. In preliminary studies on R. pachyptilaexoskeleton, in situ trypsination of an electrophoretically purified tube protein led to five microsequenced peptides (23Chamoy L. Nicolaı̈ M. Quennedey B. Gaill F. Delachambre J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 421-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test by PCR experiments all combinations of arrangements, degenerated primers were designed in the both strands of cDNAs deduced from each of this five amino acid sequences. Among these arrangements, some allowed us to obtain the RP43 cDNA (23Chamoy L. Nicolaı̈ M. Quennedey B. Gaill F. Delachambre J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 421-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and another one (degenerate primers A and B defined under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in the amplification of a single 265-bp fragment in different R. pachyptila tube-secreting tissues (opisthosome, trunk, and vestimentum). Searches in sequences and motif data bases (BLAST, BLOCKS, PROSITE, Swissprot, ProDom, PRINTS) showed that the deduced peptidic sequence of this cDNA was unrelated to RP43, and contained a partial chitin-binding domain and was thus named RCPB (Riftia chitin-binding polypeptide). This interesting peculiarity incited us to perform 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR with specific primers deduced from the 265-bp cDNA fragment to obtain the full-length cDNA. RACE-PCR experiments lead to overlapping fragments of 325 bp for 3′ RACE-PCR and 576 bp for the 5′ one. The complete 876-bp cDNA obtained (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. AF266752) revealed an ORF of 573 bp, starting with an ATG codon at position 56 and ending with a TAG codon at position 629 (Fig.1). This ORF encodes a protein with a putative N-terminal 19 amino acid signal peptide (sequence analysis by SignalP program). The predicted protein, named RCBP, is composed of 191 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 21.3 kDa and a pI of 8.26. After removal of the signal sequence, these protein characteristics become, respectively, 172 amino acids for a molecular mass of 19.4 kDa and a pI of 8.21. The 3′ end sequences of the two degenerated primers A and B were found in the full-length cDNA (data not shown), indicating that the stop codon observed in the first 265-bp fragment was in fact the actual end of RCBP. BLAST searches in public data bases using the complete cDNA sequence revealed no significant similarity with any known DNA sequence. Similar searches with deduced amino acid sequence of full RCBP, tested against Swissprot data base, showed a significant similarity of the central part of RCBP (residues 79–123, Fig. 1) with the chitin-binding domain (residues 420–463) of human chitotriosidase precursor (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. U29615) (44% of identities and 66% of positivity, (23Chamoy L. Nicolaı̈ M. Quennedey B. Gaill F. Delachambre J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 421-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (18Boot R.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) but no significant similarity with its catalytic region. Domain search in Pfam (Sanger) data base upon peptidic RCBP full sequence localized two occurrences of chitin-binding domains close to Pfam type 2 chitin-binding domain (CBD2), specific to the animal kingdom, at positions 29–75 and 79–130 (Fig. 1) but not any type 1 chitin-binding domain (CBD1), only found in plants. A multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 2) was performed with the two RCBP chitin-binding domains (RCBPA and RCBPB, respectively, 46 and 51 amino acids long) and three known CBD2s. Alignment of the two RCBP CBDs with the consensus amino acids described for invertebrate CBD2s by Shen and Jacobs-Lorena in 1999 (35Shen Z.C. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, CBD2 line) showed that, in both RCBP CDBs, 50% of consensus amino acids are present. When only the two RCBP CBDs were considered in the alignment, one can observe 36.8% pairwise amino acid identity and 49.1% positivity between them (Fig. 2). These results can be compared with the 44.1% pairwise identity and 59.3% positivity obtained between the two domains of peritrophin 1 (APER1A and -B in Fig. 2), a multi-CBD2 protein of Anopheles gambiae. Recently, Suetake et al. (36Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) noticed that tachycitin and hevein CBDs share, a common secondary (Fig.3) and three-dimensional structure, and three characteristic amino acids (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 3) involved in interactions with chitin. Alignment of the corresponding sequences of the two RCBP CBDs with CBDs of these two proteins (Fig. 3) shows that RCBPA possesses all the three conserved residues of tachycitin, but little sequence similarity with either tachycitin or hevein. In case of RCBPB, only the two first positions are positives (with Asn-69 of tachycitin and Trp-38 of hevein) but similarities with tachycitin and hevein are hi"

After phosphorylation, CFTR gates by binding and hydrolyzing ATP. We show that CFTR open probability (Po) also depends on the electrolyte concentration of the cytosol. Inside-out patches from Calu-3 cells were transiently exposed to solutions of 160 mm salt or solutions in which up to 90% of the salt was replaced by nonionic osmolytes such as sucrose. In lowered salt solutions, CFTR Po declined within 1 s to a stable lower value that depended on the electrolyte concentration, (K1/2 ≈ 80 mm NaCl).Po was rapidly restored in normal salt concentrations without regard to the electrolyte species. Reducing external electrolytes did not affect CFTR Po. The same results were obtained when CFTR was stably phosphorylated with adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The decrease inPo resulted entirely from an increase in mean closed time. Increasing ATP levels up to 20-fold did not counteract the effect of low electrolytes. The same effect was observed for CFTR expressed in C127 cells but not for a different species of anion channel. Cytosolic electrolytes are an unsuspected, essential cofactor for CFTR gating.

CFTR is an unusual ion channel in several respects. It is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporters but is the only known ion channel among at least 39 other human ABC transporters (1Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Regulation of CFTR channel gating is unusually complex. It requires phosphorylation by protein kinase C (2Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and protein kinase A (3Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J.

CFTR gating is also influenced by cytosolic pH (12Reddy M.M. Kopito R.R. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1040-C1047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the species and concentrations of divalent cations (10Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have discovered an unsuspected and powerful influence on CFTR gating. Our data indicate that CFTR senses the concentrations of cytosolic electrolytes (apparently without regard to species) and requires high levels of electrolytes (∼160 mm) for full activity. Experiments were conducted using Calu-3 cells grown as previously described by Shen et al.(18Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar) and CFTR-transfected C127 cells (2WT2 cells) provided by Seng Cheng (Genzyme Corp.) and grown as described by Haws et al.(19Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I.B. Krouse M.E. Wakelee H. Law T. Xia Y. Nguyen H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1544-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inside-out single-channel patch clamp recordings were made at ∼23 °C. CFTR channels were identified by their signature: unitary conductance of 6.1 ± 0.2 pS (n = 8, mean ± S.E.), linear current-voltage relations, appeared in clusters, showed no voltage sensitivity, and required PKA and ATP for activity. They were the only anion channels recorded in cell-attached patches from surrounded cells in confluent islands of Calu-3 cells and were by far the most prevalent channels in transfected C127 cells (2WT2). Excised patches were alternately exposed to different flowing cytosolic solutions via solution changers (see below). CFTR activity was maintained with a perfusate containing 160 mm NaCl, 2 mmMg2+-ATP, and 10 units of PKA and was eliminated with a perfusate that lacked ATP and PKA. Other solutions contained the same activation ingredients and various concentrations of electrolytes or nonelectrolytes. Pipettes were pulled from Prism LA16/SA16 glass (Dagan Corp.) on a Brown-Flaming puller. Currents were amplified and filtered at 100 Hz with an Axopatch 1C amplifier. Data acquisition was controlled by pClamp 8.0 (Axon Instruments). Data were digitized at 1 kHz and stored on disk. Membrane voltage was held at 60 mV unless otherwise indicated. The standard bath and cytosolic control solution was (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.5 EGTA, 2.5 MgCl2, 0.227 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES titrated to pH 7.3 with ∼6.2 mm NaOH. Osmolarity was adjusted to 330–350 mosmol. The free calcium level was 100 nm as computed by MaxChelator. This formulation gives an electrolyte concentration of ∼334 mm; the main anion is Cl− (160 mm). Mg2+-ATP or Na2ATP (0.5–10 mm) was added from stock, and the pH was adjusted to 7.3 by adding ∼1.55 mm NaOH/mm ATP. To avoid changes in Po caused by dephosphorylation via patch-associated phosphatases, all solutions in most experiments contained both Mg2+-ATP and 10 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA with 50 mg/ml dithiothreitol. Test solutions were identical, except that NaCl and KCl were replaced with NaCl of the desired concentration plus the osmotically balanced replacement solute. The standard pipette solution was (in mm) 150 NMDG-Cl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2.5 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH and osmolarity adjusted to 320–340 mosmol. Because most test solutions contained reduced levels of Cl−, recordings were usually made at positive cell voltages to provide the clearest channel recordings. Poor channel resolution was seen at negative voltages because of the unfavorable gradient for chloride and a fast block by anions (20Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-C634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With reduced cystosolic Cl−, the channel amplitude was increased less at positive voltages than the Nernstian prediction. This effect presumably resulted from channel saturation and block by the osmolytes (20Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-C634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Forskolin was stored as a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol at −20 °C. PKA stock was made from 1000 units of solid dissolved in 1 ml of deionized water containing 50 mg/ml dithiothreitol and stored at −20 °C. ATP (Mg2+ and Na+ salt) and ATPγS (BioChemika) were dissolved in deionized water and stored at −10 °C. Test solutions were made by replacing part of the NaCl with 2 parts of the nonelectrolytes sucrose, mannitol (Mallinckrodt),l-proline and or taurine or 1 part of the electrolytes Na-gluconate and Na-isethionate. In experiments in which Na2SO4 replaced NaCl, the electrolyte concentrations were balanced. A rapid solution-switching system was fabricated using a piezoelectric translator (21Tia S. Wang J.F. Kotchabhakdi N. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) connected to an array of three parallel perfusion tubes, each ∼100 μm in diameter and containing a different solution. The excised patch was positioned in relation to the array such that any of three computer-controlled voltages moved the array to bathe the patch in one of the streams. Switching between streams occurred in <50 ms. Patches were alternately exposed to an activating solution containing PKA, 1–5 mm Mg2+-ATP, and normal bath electrolytes; to a minimal solution that lacked PKA and ATP; and to test solutions that were equivalent except that varying proportions of cytosolic NaCl were replaced with nonelectrolytes or other electrolytes. The valve-controlled solution changer consisted of a manifold with seven inlet ports, each connected to a different solution reservoir, and one outlet port connected to a perfusion pipette. The manifold was located ∼2 mm from the tip of the perfusion pipette. Solutions were switched manually in <2 s. In this setup the patch and perfusion pipette have fixed positions, which assures identical access to each solution. All-point amplitude histograms were constructed for selected traces to determine the amplitude of the unitary current. Histograms were least squares fit with (N + 1) Gaussian functions (N, number of active channels in the patch; resolution N < 10). The resulting average peak-to-peak interval represented the unitary current (i).Po was determined through least squares fits of binomial distributions of the multiple Gaussians or byPo = I/iNT, where I is the integrated current, and T is the total recording time. Mean closed time (tC) was estimated by multiplyingN times the mean closed time of full closures (the record contained at least 10 full closures). Mean open time (tO) was derived from the equationPo =tO/(tO +tC). N was also determined by the peak current observed in a patch, divided by the unitary current obtained as above. When cytosolic NaCl was rapidly switched from 160 to 15 mm with replacement by an iso-osmolar amount of sucrose, the Po of CFTR declined to <20% of control values within 1 s. Po returned to normal with a similar time course after switching back to the control cytosolic solution (Fig. 1 a). An equivalent reduction of Po was observed regardless of the species of nonelectrolyte that we used for replacement, including the cyclic sugar sucrose, the linear sugar mannitol, or the amino acids l-proline and taurine (Fig.1 b). (Proline is uncharged at neutral pH, and only ∼3% of taurine is predicted to be charged at pH 7.4.) This surprising result could be explained by many variables, including increased molar concentration of a nonelectrolyte, decreased molar concentration of Na+, Cl−, Na+ + Cl−, or electrolytes, or decreased ionic strength. Adding 320 mm mannitol to 160 mm NaCl did not reducePo (Figs. 1 c and2 a), indicating that the nonelectrolytes were not themselves inhibitory. (The current amplitude in the presence of 300 mm mannitol was reduced from 0.47 to 0.43 pA. This result is consistent with that of Linsdell and Hanrahan (20Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-C634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found that internal 220 mm sucrose or urea caused a 5–10% reduction in unitary conductance.) CFTR Po was also unaffected by solutions in which Na+, Cl−, or both were replaced with different ions, including the impermeant anions gluconate, sulfate, and isethionate and the impermeant cationN-methyl-d-glucamine (Figs. 1 d and2 b). Taken together, these experiments appear to eliminate all variables except the concentrations of electrolytes or ionic strength. Experiments with divalent ions will be needed to discriminate between those possibilities. In the remainder of the paper we use the term “electrolyte concentration” as an inclusive term for either molar concentrations of electrolytes or ionic strength. To determine the quantitative dependence of CFTRPo on electrolyte concentration, the cytosolic solution bathing a single excised patch was rapidly switched between control solution with 160 mm NaCl and different test solutions containing 5, 15, 30, 60, 80, or 320 mm NaCl. For most of these experiments, the nonelectrolyte was proline. Open probability in these experiments was a sigmoid function of log salt concentration, with the steepest slope occurring between 60 and 100 mm and a half-maximal value of ∼80 mm NaCl (Fig. 3). In experiments to this point, the extracellular (pipette) solution was 150 mm NMDG-Cl. To determine whether the concentration of external electrolytes or the electrolyte gradient across the patch influenced CFTR Po, we measuredPo in a series of experiments in which ∼1 mm of the pipette tip was filled with 150 mm NMDG-Cl and then back-filled with 15 mm NaCl + 300 mm proline, while the bath remained constant at 160 mm NaCl. In prior experiments with the nonpermeant anion ATP, we found that the tip solution equilibrates with the back-fill solution over a few minutes (22Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Haws C. Wine J.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Hanrahan J.W. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1876-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In our present experiments, when tips were filled with 150 NMDG-Cl and back-filled with 15 Cl, the unitary current at 60 mV decreased by 25% within 1 min and remained stable. Under these conditions CFTR Po remained constant (Po = 0.35–0.42; < 3.8% reduction;n = 3) for >15 min. We also studied two patches in which the extracellular solution was 60 mm NaCl and the cytosolic solution was switched among 160, 80, 30, and 15 mm NaCl. We saw the same decline as when the external solution was 160 mm NMDG-Cl. These experiments indicate that Po depends on the electrolyte concentration of the cytosol and not on external electrolyte concentration or the gradient of electrolytes across the membrane. To determine the kinetic basis of the electrolyte dependence of CFTR activity (NPo), we first needed to determine whether channel number (N) was altered in lower electrolyte solutions. Because of the smooth functions relatingNPo to electrolyte concentration and the rapid onset and reversal of the changes in activity, we suspected thatN did not change, and that was confirmed when Nwas estimated for each patch as described under “Materials and Methods.” To assess N more directly, we searched our records for instances of multiple channel openings during periods when the reduction of electrolytes caused a reduction inNPo. As shown by the example in Fig.4, by this criterion we concluded thatN was essentially unchanged in the two conditions. We also considered the alternate possibility that reduction inNPo was caused entirely by a change inN. For that to be true, the ratio of apparentPo in solutions of high and low electrolyte concentrations should be directly related to the ratio of Nin high- and low-salt concentrations. As shown Fig. 4 C, the ratio of N was almost invariant and was close to 1 for >10-fold change in Po. Based on this evidence that N was constant across electrolyte concentrations, we proceeded to estimate channel open and closed times in solutions of different electrolyte concentrations using the strategy outlined under “Materials and Methods.” This analysis, (shown for a single patch containing four channels in Fig.5, a and b), indicated that the low Po observed in 15 mmNaCl solutions resulted from a >10-fold increase in mean closed time with no detectable effect on mean open time. For this patch, controlversus 15 mm NaCl values werePo, 0.30 versus 0.021; open time (s), 0.591 versus 0.512; and closed time, 1.52 versus23.87. The same results were obtained after analysis of four additional patches exposed to 160 and 30 mm NaCl. For those four patches, the mean open time in low-electrolyte solution was 0.99 ± 0.20 of the control value, whereas the closed time was 3.95 ± 0.9 times longer than the control value. We conclude that electrolyte levels affect channel closed time and not N or open time. In addition to this multichannel analysis, we searched for single-channel patches. We eventually obtained one example of a “pseudo” single-channel patch, in which two CFTR channels were active in the cell-attached configuration, but after excision one channel became nearly silent, so that double openings constituted only 0.0005 of the total open time. We exposed the patch to control solution and to 60 mm NaCl balanced osmotically with taurine and analyzed the dominantly active channel as a single channel. Probability density distributions (Fig. 5, c and d) were computed for open and closed time in the control (531 events) and 60 mm NaCl (368 events) solutions. The distributions were best fit with two exponentials with the time constants shown in the figures. This analysis confirmed that open time was unchanged and also revealed that only the slow component of the closed time was changed in 60 mm NaCl, increasing from 0.6 to 1.4 s. CFTR activity is affected by the cytosolic pH, which alters phosphatases and kinases and hence the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CFTR (12Reddy M.M. Kopito R.R. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1040-C1047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether electrolytes might also affect the phosphorylation state of CFTR, we studied CFTR after stable phosphorylation with ATPγS and found that thePo of CFTR was still decreased and then restored to normal when switching between control and low-electrolyte concentrations in the absence of PKA. For these experiments,Po values in 160 and 15 NaCl were 0.31 ± 0.05 and 0.05 ± 0.02, respectively (n = 5;p < 0.01; Fig. 6). ThePo and mean open and mean closed times were derived for one patch phosphorylated with ATPγS and indicate that the effect was again entirely due to a change in the mean closed time. For 160 mm NaCl the values were: Po, 0.19; tO, 0.22 s; andtC, 0.91 s. For 15 mm NaCl the values were Po, 0.01; tO, 0.21 s; and tC, 27.63 s. (Note that this 30-fold change in closed time occurred in a patch estimated to have only four channels.) These results suggest that the electrolyte effect is most likely mediated via postphosphorylation gating events. The constellation of effects observed so far distinguishes the electrolyte effect from most other factors known to affect CFTR gating but is similar (although scaled by a concentration factor of ∼1000) to the dependence of Po on ATP concentration, which also decreases the mean closed time with no effect on mean open time (23Winter M.C. Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1398-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduced opening rate of CFTR in low cytosolic electrolytes resulted from reduced binding of ATP, we varied the ATP level 20-fold, from 0.5 to 10 mm, and measuredPo in 15 mm NaCl. Na2ATP was used, with Mg2+ held constant at 2.5 mm and pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH. (This process caused Mg-ATP levels to vary only 5-fold, from 0.5 to 2.5.) Higher levels of Mg2+were not used because of known effects on CFTR gating (13Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Higher ATP levels did not restore Po to the control level but did cause a modest increase in relative Po(from 11 ± 7 to 33 ± 21% of control; n = 3; mean ± S.E.). However, this increase is predicted simply by the added electrolytes; i.e. 10 mmNa2ATP + 15.5 mm NaOH moved the salt concentration from 15 mm to ≈38 mm NaCl equivalents (see Fig. 3). These results do not support the interpretation that the electrolyte effect is mediated by altering ATP binding. To determine whether the electrolyte effect on CFTR required factors specific to Calu-3 membranes, we excised patches from mouse mammary epithelial (C127) cells exogenously expressing CFTR (2WT2; Refs. 24Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S., C.R., O.R. Ferrara D. Amara J.F. Hoppe H.I. Scheule R.K. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. et al.J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 268: L615-L624PubMed Google Scholar) and exposed them to reduced electrolyte concentrations. The responses were equivalent to those observed for CFTR channels in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 7 a),indicating that the effect is either intrinsic to CFTR or relies on cellular components common to these two cell types. To determine whether the gating dependence on cytosolic electrolytes might be common to all channels, we studied an outwardly rectifying anion channel that was sometimes activated by strong depolarization of patches excised from cells at the edges of islands of Calu-3 cells (26Xia Y. Haws C.M. Wine J.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Excised patches were subjected to strong, sustained depolarization until rectifying anion channel activity was induced. Patches were then switched between normal and low levels of electrolytes. In contrast with CFTR channels, thePo of the rectifying channels was unaffected by the cytosolic electrolyte concentration (Fig. 7, b andc). This is additional evidence suggesting that the effect might be intrinsic to CFTR although by no means exclusive to CFTR. The discovery that CFTR gating depends on the electrolyte concentration of the cytosol was completely unexpected. In two prior studies using reduced electrolytes with sucrose substitution, no effects on Po were described (20Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-C634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marshall W.S. Hanrahan J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1562-1568PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies the electrolyte level was decreased to 75 mm, a value that in our studies reduced Po only to approximately half of control values. Because of inherent variations in CFTR Po (13Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Haws C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that a decline of that magnitude would be noticed unless a rapid solution switching system were used. Although no effect on Po was noted, it is interesting that a reduction in CFTR channel conductance by intracellular sucrose was observed (20Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-C634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marshall W.S. Hanrahan J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1562-1568PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed a reduction in channel conductance when using uncharged intracellular osmolytes (see “Materials and Methods”), which tended to offset the expected increase in channel current predicted by the greater driving force for Cl−. We found no other reports in which channel gating was shown to require cytosolic electrolytes. Many prior studies show influences of electrolytes on gating, but these are all distinct from the present phenomenon. For example, volume-regulated channels are affected by ionic strength (29Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 353-361Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but the sign is opposite from what we observe. The gating of many channels is influenced by specific ions. Examples include a strong affect of extracellular K+ concentration on the voltage dependence of an inwardly rectifying cardiac K+ current (30Pennefather P. Oliva C. Mulrine N. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 448-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the gating of an outward-rectifying K+ channel in plant stomatal guard cells (31Blatt M.R. Gradmann D. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gating (NPo) of the rat epithelial Na+channel was significantly decreased when intracellular [Na+] was increased from 0 to 50 mm in inside-out patches (32Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and CLC channel gating is influenced in a complex manner by the concentration and species of internal and external anions (33Pusch M. Jordt S.E. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 341-353Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These phenomena are distinct in their features from the present findings. They all depend on specific ions, two are voltage-dependent, and the epithelial Na+channel effect has a sign opposite to what we observed. Also, in these examples ion levels modulate gating, whereas CFTR gating has an absolute dependence on electrolytes. We also found only rare examples in which the transport or ATPase activity of ABC transporters was shown to be affected by electrolyte concentration. For example, ATPase activity and histidine transport of histidine permease are salt-sensitive, but the pattern differed markedly from what we observed, being high at 0 NaCl, maximal at ∼50 mm, and then declining at higher concentrations (34Liu C.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Is electrolyte concentration a physiological regulator of CFTR? It is conceivable that the steep dependence of CFTR Poon the electrolyte concentration of the cytosol could regulate CFTR-mediated conductance under some physiological conditions, such as in the sweat duct, where it has been hypothesized that a salt sensor closes CFTR at low luminal NaCl values (12Reddy M.M. Kopito R.R. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1040-C1047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1136-C1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electrolyte dependence of CFTR Po could allow it to be the salt sensor if the extremely high conductance of the duct apical membrane (∼125 mS/cm2; Ref. 37Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C649-C652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled the NaCl concentrations of cytosol and lumen. However, the sweat duct is exceptional in having a very high apical membrane conductance, a very low concentration (∼15 mm) of luminal ions, and low water permeability. In most cells and conditions, the cytosolic electrolyte concentration should be sufficient to maintain high CFTR activity, and alterations in external electrolyte concentration would probably affect only cell volume. These considerations suggest that electrolytes are, like Mg2+ and ATP, essential and typically invariant cofactors for CFTR activity. How might electrolytes alter CFTR gating? Kinetic analysis distinguishes the electrolyte effect from other factors known to affect CFTR gating, such as the species and concentrations of divalent cations (10Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27536-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the redox status (14Harrington M.A. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27536-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that an altered phosphorylation state does not explain the electrolyte effect, although more work needs to be done on that point. Low electrolytes did not affect channel open time. Because of considerable evidence that the open time is determined by hydrolysis at NBD2 (6Hwang T.C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 38Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the unchanged open time indicates that hydrolysis of ATP at NBD2 and all subsequent steps leading to closing are not directly affected by electrolyte levels. The remaining possibilities are that the electrolyte concentration affects either ATP binding at the NBD, ATP hydrolysis at NBD1, or the linkage between these events and channel opening. Our preliminary results do not support an electrolyte effect on ATP binding, although those experiments do not definitively rule out such an effect, because when we varied the ATP levels, we also varied the electrolyte concentration. Although the possibility of an electrolyte effect on ATP binding is still open, it appears to be more likely that electrolytes are affecting some aspect of ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 or the consequences following from hydrolysis. How might electrolytes have such effects? Two general kinds of explanations seem salient. First, electrolytes may be required for the structural integrity of CFTR. An effect on CFTR structure might arise, for example, if solution electrolytes are needed for screening of Coulomb repulsion (e.g. Ref. 39Borisov O.V. Zhulina E.B. Eur. Phys. J. B. 1998; 4: 205-217Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or attraction as occurs in salt bridges (40Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5429-5435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) between portions of CFTR. This explanation is consistent with the lack of any ion specificity to the effect. A physical effect of this nature might be expected to respond to ionic strength rather than electrolyte concentration (41Yang A.S. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), so it will be important, in future work, to establish definitively whether ionic strength is the critical variable contributing to changedPo. Alternatively, electrolytes may be required to allow CFTR to complete a hydrolysis cycle because they participate in that process directly, for example, by being a substrate for transport, or a necessary cofactor in transport. This possibility is made less attractive by the lack of any evidence that CFTR is a transporter and by the lack of specificity in the ionic species that can support activity. However, other members of the ABC transport family, such as MDR1 (P-glycoprotein), transport an extremely diverse set of substrates, which have little in common except hydrophobicity (42Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). That the dependence of CFTR gating on cytosolic electrolytes is most similar to the dependence on ATP itself raises the possibility that CFTR might retain either a transport function or at least components of transport that might now serve to regulate gating. Although we found no prior example of an electrolyte effect on “typical” channels, transporters with requirements for specific electrolytes are commonplace, and some electrolyte-dependent transporters also function as ion channels (43Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 44Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). CFTR is the only known ion channel among at least 39 human ABC transporters (1Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), many of which transport lipids, bile salts, conjugates with glutathione or sulfates, nucleoside-based compounds, or simply hydrophobic compounds (1Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). ABC1, which transports cholesterol (45Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M., Yu, L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M. Martindale D. Frohlich J. Morgan K. Koop B. Pimstone S. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), also appears to be a cAMP-dependent and sulfonylurea-sensitive anion transporter, although it is not itself a channel (46Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple functions within ABC transporters and the coexistence of channel and transport functions in other proteins suggest that a possible transport function for CFTR should not be dismissed. If CFTR gating does depend on the transport of a substrate, that substrate would need to be present within the bilayer (47Bear C.E. Li C.H. Kartner N. Bridges R.J. Jensen T.J. Ramjeesingh M. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) or the bath solution. Regardless of the merits of these speculations, the discovery that CFTR gating depends on the electrolyte concentration of the cytosol provides a new tool for probing gating and ATPase hydrolysis cycles in CFTR and perhaps in other ABC transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2137907145,"Recent studies have indicated that factor Va bound to activated platelets is partially protected from inactivation by activated protein C (APC). To explore whether this sustained factor Va activity could maintain ongoing thrombin generation, the kinetics of platelet factor Va-dependent prothrombinase activity and its inhibition by APC were studied. In an attempt to mimic physiologically relevant conditions, platelets were adhered to collagen type I-coated discs. These discs were then spun in solutions containing prothrombin and factor Xa either in the absence or presence of APC. The experiments were performed in the absence of platelet-derived microparticles, with thrombin generation and inhibition confined to the surface of the adherent platelets. APC completely inactivated platelet-associated prothrombinase activity with an overall second order rate constant of 3.3 × 106m−1 s−1, which was independent of the prothrombin concentration over a wide range around the apparent K m for prothrombin. Kinetic studies on prothrombinase assembled at a planar phospholipid membrane composed of 25 mol % phosphatidylserine and 75 mol % phosphatidylcholine revealed a similar second order rate constant of inhibition (2.5 × 106m−1 s−1). Collectively, these data demonstrate that ongoing platelet factor Va-dependent thrombin generation at the surface of collagen-adherent platelets is effectively inhibited by APC. No differences were observed between the kinetics of APC inactivation of plasma-derived factor Va or platelet factor Va as part of the prothrombinase associated with, respectively, a planar membrane of synthetic phospholipids or collagen-adherent platelets.

Efficient proteolysis of the cofactors requires the presence of membranes that contain anionic phospholipids, calcium ions, and protein S. In the presence of membranes that contain negatively charged phospholipids, plasma factor Va is inactivated by APC-catalyzed cleavage of its heavy chain at Arg306 and Arg506 (1Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tans G. Nicolaes G.A.F. Rosing J. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 244-255PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage at Arg506 is relatively rapid and yields a reaction intermediate that still retains partial cofactor activity in prothrombin activation. The slower cleavage at position Arg306 results in complete loss of cofactor activity (3Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G. D Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The rapid cleavage at Arg506 is inhibited when factor Va is in complex with factor Xa (4Comp P.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that in contrast to synthetic phospholipid membranes, thrombin-activated platelets partially protect platelet-derived and plasma-derived factor Va from inactivation by APC. Thrombin-activated platelets appeared to slow down the cleavage at Arg506 (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was speculated that activated platelets express a membrane component(s) in addition to anionic phospholipids that specifically binds factor Va resulting in a factor Va molecule with an apparent APC resistant phenotype (10Taube J. McWilliam N. Luddington R. Byrne C.D. Baglin T. Blood. 1999; 93: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protection of APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va was not observed in the presence of microparticles or synthetic phospholipid vesicles (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the questions that remain to be answered is how platelets influence APC-dependent factor Va inactivation once factor Va is assembled in the prothrombinase complex at the plasma membrane of activated platelets. The purpose of the present study was to establish the kinetics of APC-dependent inhibition of ongoing prothrombin activation at the plasma membrane of platelets adhered to immobilized collagen. To account for transport limitations of reactants, the experiments were conducted under well defined flow conditions on a rotating disc. Our findings indicate no difference in the kinetics of APC-dependent inactivation of prothrombinase at the membrane of activated, collagen-adherent platelets compared with that at the surface of a planar phospholipid membrane. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine fibrinogen, and apyrase were from Sigma. S2238, a chromogenic substrate for thrombin, was obtained from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Human factor Xa, human prothrombin, and bovine factor Va were prepared and quantified as described previously (11Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Native type I collagen fibrils were extracted from bovine Achilles tendon in the absence of proteases using 0.5 m acetic acid and precipitated with 1.7m NaCl as described (12Heemskerk J.W.M. Siljander P. Vuist W.M.J. Breikers G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Lassila R. Farndale R.W. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 782-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was prepared as described previously (13Schoen P. Lindhout T. Franssen J. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human activated protein C (APC) was purchased from Kordia (Leiden, The Netherlands). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Suspensions of washed human platelets were prepared as described previously (14Heemskerk J.W.M. Vuist W.M.J. Feijge M.A.H. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers who had not taken any anti-platelet medication in the preceding 2 weeks. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation. The platelets were then sedimented by centrifugation and washed twice with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 136 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1 units/ml apyrase, pH 6.6). Finally, the platelets were resuspended in HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.45 (buffer A). Platelets were counted on a Coulter counter (Coulter, Miami, FL), and the suspensions were adjusted to 5 × 107 platelets/ml. Rotating disc experiments were performed in a device described previously (15Salemink I. Franssen J. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28225-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, a circular glass coverslip with a diameter of 20 mm (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany), was rotated at 63 rad/s at the bottom of a cylindrical reaction vessel containing reactants in 3 ml of buffer A. This angular velocity resulted in a wall shear rate of 3681 s−1 at the edge of the rotating disc. The reaction vessel was pretreated for 1 h with 20 mg/ml BSA in buffer A. Circular glass coverslips with a diameter of 20 mm were cleaned with a 1:1 mixture of ethanol (96 volume %) and HCl (37 volume %) and subsequently rinsed with deionized water. The discs were coated with collagen by incubating the coverslips for 3 h with 300 μl of 0.5 mg/ml collagen type I in 0.5 m acetic acid. Coated discs were rinsed extensively with 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and stored in this buffer until used. Inspection of the discs by phase-contrast microscopy showed a homogeneous distribution of the collagen fibrils over the glass surface. The collagen-coated discs were incubated for 15 min with buffer A, followed by a 40-min incubation at room temperature with 300 μl of a suspension of washed platelets. Nonadherent platelets were removed by rinsing with buffer A. Spinning circular glass coverslips (63 rad/s) were exposed for 20 min to 20 μm vesicles composed of 25 mol % DOPS and 75 mol % DOPC, prepared as described previously (16Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluid phase vesicles were removed by flushing for 5 min (10 ml/min) with buffer A. The phospholipid-coated discs were then transferred to a reaction vessel containing 3 ml of buffer A for further experimentation. Discs with collagen-adherent platelets or coated with a phospholipid membrane were spun at 63 rad/s in 3 ml of buffer A containing 3 mmCaCl2. Factor Xa and, when indicated, factor Va were added, and thrombin generation was started after 3 min by adding prothrombin. Timed samples (10 μl) were taken and transferred to cuvettes with 440 μl of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 175 mmNaCl, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.9) containing 20 mm EDTA. Thrombin was assayed by adding 2.4 mm S2238 (50 μl) to the cuvette. The change in optical density was monitored at 405 nm. The thrombin concentrations in the samples were calculated from a standard curve obtained with known amounts of the enzyme. All procedures were performed at 37 °C. Samples (10 μl) from the reaction vessel were added to cuvettes containing factor Xa, factor Va, and 3 mm CaCl2 in 137 μl of Tris buffer. After a 3-min incubation, thrombin generation was started by adding 3 μl of prothrombin. The final concentrations were: 1 pmfactor Xa, 0.5 nm factor Va, and 200 nmprothrombin. Thrombin generation was stopped after 5 min by the addition of Tris-EDTA buffer and assayed as described. A reference curve was constructed using different phospholipid vesicle (25 mol % DOPS, 75 mol % DOPC) concentrations and was linear up to 1 μm. The rate of thrombin generation at the surface of the rotating disc decreases in time especially when prothrombin concentrations are used below the apparent K m for prothrombin. Thrombin generation in the presence of APC was therefore corrected for substrate depletion by assuming an APC-independent pseudo first order rate constant of inactivation, k 1, utilizing the equation [thrombin]t=V0(1−e−k1t)/k1Equation 1 in which [thrombin]t is the thrombin concentration at time t, and V 0 the initial rate of thrombin formation. Inhibition of prothrombin activation in the presence of APC was analyzed according to [thrombin]t=[thrombin]ti+V0e−k1ti(1−e−(k2+k1)(t−ti))/(k2+k1)Equation 2 fort>tiwith t i the time at which APC was added to the reaction and k 2 the APC-dependent pseudo first order rate constant of prothrombin activation inhibition. Values forV 0, k 1, andk 2 were estimated by a least square fit of Equations 1 and 2 to the experimental data obtained from thrombin generation experiments performed in the absence or presence of APC. Platelet adhesion on immobilized collagen in the presence of extracellular calcium is accompanied by the shedding of microparticles and exposure of negatively charged phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (14Heemskerk J.W.M. Vuist W.M.J. Feijge M.A.H. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These microparticles may provide a procoagulant surface that supports prothrombin activation and thus could complicate our study on the kinetics of APC-dependent inactivation of prothrombin activation at the surface of collagen-adherent platelets. Therefore, initial experiments were conducted to establish the extent of microvesiculation and their contribution to prothrombin activation and, when necessary, to redesign the experiment in such a way that the contribution of microparticles to prothrombin activation would be negligible. Coverslips with collagen-adherent platelets were spun in buffer A, and after 12 min CaCl2 (3 mm) was added. Samples were taken from the reaction vessel and assayed for procoagulant vesicles. Fig. 1 shows that immediately after the addition of calcium the concentration of solution phase procoagulant phospholipid increased, reaching a maximum after 30–40 min. To investigate the relative contributions of these microparticles and the collagen-adherent platelets to prothrombin activation, factor Xa (50 pm) followed 3 min later by prothrombin (100 nm) were added to the reaction vessel. Immediately after the addition of prothrombin an aliquot (100 μl) was taken from the reaction vessel, transferred to a test tube, and incubated at 37 °C. Timed samples were taken from both the reaction vessel and the test tube and assayed for thrombin activity. The rates of thrombin generation were 2.2 and 1.3 nm/min in the reaction vessel and test tube, respectively, demonstrating that microvesicles and adherent platelet contributed about equally to thrombin generation (Fig. 2). In the second step of this experiment the reaction vessel was flushed for 5 min (10 ml/min) with buffer A containing 3 mm CaCl2 to remove microparticles. After the re-addition of factor Xa (50 pm) followed by prothrombin (100 nm) no thrombin generation could be detected in the fluid phase. This finding indicated that procoagulant microparticles were absent and that thrombin-generating activity was now solely confined to the spinning surface with collagen-adherent platelets (Fig. 2). The rate of thrombin generation (0.3 nm/min) was, however, lower than the rate of thrombin generation at the spinning surface before the removal of microparticles (0.9 nm/min). The combined results of three similar experiments showed that the rinsing step decreased the surface-associated thrombin production by 59 ± 10% (mean ± S.D.). This loss of activity was most likely due to a loss of platelet-associated factor Va activity because addition of plasma-derived factor Va (1 nm) resulted in an increase in the rate of thrombin generation from 0.3 to 1.8 nm/min. All further experiments were performed with discs containing collagen-adherent platelets that were first spun for 30 min at 63 rad/s in buffer A containing 3 mm CaCl2 and then flushed with the same buffer for 5 min at 10 ml/min to remove microparticles prior to thrombin generation.Figure 2Platelet surface and microvesicle-associated thrombin generation. A collagen-coated coverslip with adherent platelets was spun at 63 rad/s for 30 min in buffer A containing 3 mm CaCl2. Factor Xa (50 pm) was added followed by prothrombin (100 nm) to start thrombin generation. Immediately after the addition of prothrombin an aliquot (100 μl) was taken and incubated at 37 °C. Timed samples were taken from both the rotating disc reaction vessel and the removed aliquot to determine, respectively, the rate of total thrombin generation (●) and the rate of fluid phase thrombin generation (○). After 10 min the reaction vessel was flushed with 3 mmCaCl2-containing buffer A for 5 min at 10 ml/min. Factor Xa (50 pm) and prothrombin (100 nm) were re-added. An aliquot (100 μl) was taken from the reaction vessel and further incubated at 37 °C. Timed samples from the reaction vessel (▴) as well as from the incubation mixture (▵) were assayed for thrombin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3shows the initial rates of thrombin generation at a fixed prothrombin concentration (100 nm) as a function of the factor Xa concentration. The apparent dissociation constant,K d, of surface-bound factor Xa is described by the simple single site binding isotherm, V obs =V max [Xa]/([Xa] + K d), with V obs the initial rate of thrombin formation, [Xa] the factor Xa concentration, andV max the initial rate of thrombin generation at saturating factor Xa concentration. The value for the apparentK d estimated by fitting this equation to the data from two similar experiments is 3.5 ± 0.9 pm(estimated value ± 1 S.E.). Further experiments were performed at a saturating concentration of factor Xa (50 pm). Fig. 4 shows the prothrombin dependence of thrombin generation at the surface of collagen adherent platelets in the presence of 50 pm factor Xa. The data could be described adequately by the Michaelis-Menten equation,V obs = V max[prothrombin]/([prothrombin] + K m,app), in whichV max is the initial rate of thrombin formation at a saturating prothrombin concentration, [prothrombin] the prothrombin concentration in free solution, andK m(app) is the apparent Michaelis constant. The solid line in Fig. 4 represents the best fit of this equation to the experimental data. The combined result of two similar experiments yielded a K m(app) of 42 ± 5 nm(estimated value ± 1 S.E.). The results of a typical prothrombinase inactivation experiment at the surface of collagen-adherent platelets are shown in Fig. 5. The first 8 min of the experiment was performed in the absence of APC to enable the determination of the initial rate of thrombin formation,V 0. Upon the addition of APC, the rate of thrombin formation rapidly decreased. To visualize the concentration-dependent effect of APC, a considerable interdisc variation in the rate of thrombin generation (0.5–1.2 nm/min) was corrected by setting the initial rates in the absence of APC to the same value. The total time courses of thrombin generation in the absence or presence of APC were analyzed by a least squares fit according to Equations 1 and 2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first order rate constant of inhibition as a function of the APC concentration is shown as aninsert on Fig. 5. The APC-dependent inactivation of prothrombinase obtained from these data was 3.3 × 106m−1s−1. To assess the influence of the prothrombin concentration on the inhibition of the prothrombinase activity, comparable inhibition experiments were performed at prothrombin concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 nm. The results presented in TableI show that varying the prothrombin concentration did not influence the pseudo first order rate constant of inactivation of platelet-associated prothrombinase activity.Table IEffect of prothrombin concentration on APC-catalyzed inhibition of prothrombinase activityProthrombin concentrationRate constant of inhibitionnmmin−1200.07500.071000.082000.055000.07Discs with collagen-adherent platelets were spun in buffer A containing 3 mm CaCl2, 50 pm factor Xa, and the indicated prothrombin concentrations.

After 3 min, 0.5 nmAPC was added, and the pseudo first order rate constants of inhibition by APC were calculated by fitting the thrombin generation data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inhibition of prothrombinase activity by APC at a platelet surface was compared with that at a rotating planar phospholipid membrane composed of 25 mol % DOPS and 75 mol % DOPC. The experimental conditions for thrombin generation and inhibition were the same as described for collagen-adherent platelets. However, in addition to factor Xa (50 pm) and prothrombin (100 nm), plasma factor Va (10 pm) also was added. Typical thrombin generation curves in the absence or presence of APC are shown in Fig.6. Thrombin generation was analyzed by a least squares fit of Equations 1 and 2 to the data. A plot of the first order rate constants of inactivation as a function of the APC concentration is shown as an insert on Fig. 6. Linear regression to these data yielded a second order rate constant of inhibition of prothrombin activation of 2.5 × 106m−1s−1. It is generally believed that upon vessel wall injury the adhesion of platelets to exposed collagen stimulates thrombus formation. The interaction between platelets and immobilized collagen induces the release of the content of the α-granula, exposure of anionic phospholipids, and shedding of microvesicles. As a result, highly reactive procoagulant platelets and microvesicles are generated in which factor Va from α-granula (17Monkovic D.D Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17132-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Alberio L. Safa O. Clemetson K.J. Esmon C.T. Dale G.L.

This study focuses on the role of APC as an inhibitor of ongoing thrombin generation at the surface of collagen-adherent platelets. To account for the transport-limited supply of substrate at these surfaces (19Andree H.A. Contino P.B. Repke D. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Willems G.M. Giesen P.L. Hermens W.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to approach the in vivo situation of thrombin formation under flow conditions, activation and inactivation experiments were performed utilizing saturating factor Xa and prothrombin concentrations in a previously described rotating disc device (15Salemink I.

Wingard Jr., L.B Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2203-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Initial experiments confirmed that platelet adhesion to collagen in the presence of extracellular calcium resulted in the formation of microparticles. As a matter of fact, about 60% of total thrombin generation could be attributed to prothrombinase associated with these microparticles. Because this study was focused on ongoing thrombin generation at adherent platelets, subsequent experiments were performed after the microparticles were removed from the reaction system. To further characterize the kinetics of thrombin generation at the surfaces of collagen-adherent platelets, dependence on factor Xa and prothrombin concentration was determined. The apparentK d for factor Xa on collagen-adherent platelets was 3.5 pm. We note that this K d value is determined in the presence of a fixed prothrombin concentration (100 nm) but in the absence of both microvesicles and exogenous factor Va. Much higher apparent K d values for factor Xa have been reported for thrombin-activated platelets in suspension (K d = 142 pm) (24Larson P.J. Camire R.M. Wong D. Fasano N.C. Monroe D.M. Tracy P.B. High K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5029-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and for von Willebrand factor-adherent platelets (K d = 4 nm) (25Swords N.A. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the value found here is in close agreement with the value of 1 pm reported for the interaction of factor Xa with planar phospholipid surface composed of 25% PS, 75% PC and containing preabsorbed factor Va (23Giesen P.L. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Hermens W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18720-18725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prothrombin concentration in the solution required to obtain a half-maximal rate of thrombin generation was 42 nm. This apparent K m value is lower than the value reported for vesicles in suspension (K m = 100 nm) (26Rosing J. Tans G. Govers Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but higher than the values of 5 and 7 nm for phospholipid bilayers in a tubular flow system (11Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and for prothrombin activation experiments on rotating discs (20Willems G.M. Giesen P.L. Hermens W.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. However, the values reported for the tubular flow reactor were obtained after correction for prothrombin depletion near the catalytic surface. If the same correction is made here, a K m value of 14 nm would be obtained. Interestingly, the plasma prothrombin concentration is more than 100-fold higher, meaning that inhibitors like antithrombin will have no chance to compete successfully with prothrombin for the active site of prothrombinase (27Billy D. Speijer H. Lindhout T. Hemker H.C. Willems G.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13699-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 28Speijer H. Billy D. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, unlikely that proteinase inhibitors like antithrombin can regulate platelet-associated prothrombinase activity. It has been shown that platelets greatly accelerate the rate of APC-dependent inactivation of factor Va by providing a negatively charged phospholipid surface (29Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that platelets show an APC-resistant phenotype. That is, despite the presence of APC, platelet-derived factor Va activity is sustained on the surface of thrombin-activated platelets (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taube J. McWilliam N. Luddington R. Byrne C.D. Baglin T. Blood. 1999; 93: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sidelmann J. Gram J.

Res. 1995; 78: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates that APC inhibits platelet-associated prothrombinase activity in a mono-exponential way with a second order rate constant of inactivation of 3.3 × 106m−1 s−1. This value is in excellent agreement with the second order rate constant of inhibition (2.5 × 106m−1 s−1) found for prothrombinase associated with a planar synthetic phospholipid membrane composed of 25 mol % PS, 75 mol % PC. Moreover, the inhibition rates reported here for ongoing thrombin generation are also very close to the reported (32Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Hemker H.C. Tans G. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3331-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) rate constant for APC-catalyzed cleavage at Arg306 in plasma-derived factor Va (k = 6.5 × 106m−1s−1). Thus, in the experimental setup of the present study, which mimics physiologically relevant conditions, we observed complete inactivation by APC of the prothrombin-converting activity of the factor Va-factor Xa complex bound to collagen-adherent platelets. Moreover, no differences were found between the first order rate constant of inactivation of prothrombinase assembled at collagen-adherent platelets and at a synthetic phospholipid membrane. In contrast, Camire et al. (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found different kinetics for the inactivation of factor Va at platelets and synthetic phospholipid membranes, with a slower, and most importantly, incomplete inactivation of factor Va at the membrane of platelets. We note that these investigators used thrombin-activated platelets and that the decline of factor Va cofactor activity was assayed from timed samples as prothrombinase activity using a high factor Xa concentration. Thrombin, however, has been demonstrated to be a rather weak agonist in inducing exposure of negatively charged phospholipids (PS) in the outer leaflet of the platelet plasma membrane (14Heemskerk J.W.M. Vuist W.M.J. Feijge M.A.H. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In addition, Camire et al. (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prevented thrombin-activated platelets from aggregation by using the RGDS peptide and did not stir the platelet suspension. It was recently reported that these conditions prevent thrombin-induced exposure of PS (34Dörmann D. Clemetson K.J. Kehrel B.E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the stimulating role of negatively charged phospholipids on the kinetics of the cleavage of factor V at Arg306 (32Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Hemker H.C. Tans G. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3331-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that under their experimental conditions (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), insufficient platelets provide the suitable surface to bind factor Va and to stimulate APC activity. Although this notion would explain the finding that part of the factor Va escaped inactivation, it is contradicted by their observation that exogenous plasma-derived factor Va added to a thrombin-activated platelet suspension was rapidly inactivated (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that prothrombin dramatically inhibits the ability of APC to inactivate factor Va but scarcely inhibits the inactivation of factor VaLeiden (35Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 3839-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was suggested that prothrombin inhibits the cleavage at both Arg506 and Arg306. In contrast, our experiments clearly demonstrate that the rate of inactivation of platelet-bound prothrombinase by APC is not slowed down even under conditions that result in full saturation of the prothrombinase complex with its substrate prothrombin (cf. Fig. 4, Table I). At present we have no explanation for these deviating results. In summary, our data show that APC is an efficient inhibitor of platelet-dependent thrombin generation. The half-life of prothrombinase in the presence of 1 nm APC and under the conditions of the experiment is 5 min. Whereas it has been reported that platelet-bound factor Va is resistant to APC, our results clearly indicate that platelet-bound factor Va, as part of the prothrombinase complex, is inactivated by APC with a rate that is comparable with that found on a membrane of synthetic phospholipids. Sustained platelet-derived factor Va cofactor activity therefore could be less critical than proposed (9Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taube J. McWilliam N. Luddington R. Byrne C.D. Baglin T. Blood. 1999; 93: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)."

We and others have shown that IGF-2 is a potent autocrine growth factor for a significant percent of human colon cancer cells (4Lamonerie T. Lavialle C. De Galle B. Binoux M. Brison O. Exp.

Evidence in literature strongly supports the contention that IGFs (via IGF-I receptor) play an important role not only in the proliferation/tumorigenicity of colon cancers but also in inhibiting differentiation of the cells (13Singh P.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that contribute to up-regulation of IGF-2 levels in colon cancers. The IGF-2 gene consists of 9 exons, and the peptide is encoded by exons 7, 8, and 9 (17Holthuizen P. LeRoith D. Lund P.K. Roberts Jr., C.T. Rotwein O. Spencer E.M. Sussenbach J.S. Spencer E.M.

The gene is transcribed from four different promoters (P1-P4) (18van Dijk M.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Bootsma H.J. Holthuizen P. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Multiple transcripts are synthesized as a result of alternative promoter usage and the splicing of the unique 5′-untranslated region to common coding exons (18van Dijk M.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Bootsma H.J.

Increased levels of IGF-2 mRNA in neoplastic cells can be potentially accomplished by loss of imprinting, loss of heterozygosity, transcriptional activation, and/or loss of transcriptional suppression (reviewed in Ref. 20Toretsky J.A. Helman L.J. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). With loss of imprinting or loss of heterozygosity (involving duplication of the active paternal allele), IGF transcripts are made from two copies instead of one, leading to ∼two times higher mRNA levels. However, the expression of IGF-2 mRNA is 10–40-fold higher in colon cancer cells compared with that in normal colonocytes (1Tricoli J.V. Rall L.B. Karakousos C.P. Herrera L. Petrelli N.J. Bell G.I.

In previous studies we and others have used CaCo2 cells (a human colon cancer cell line) for investigating the role of the IGF system in growth and differentiation of colon cancer cells (10Singh P.

Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 581-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are an ideal in vitro model for investigating cellular mechanisms involved in proliferation and differentiation of colonic cells. IGF-2 mRNA levels are significantly up-regulated during logarithmic growth of CaCo2 cells (days 3–6) in culture followed by a steep decline in confluent cells undergoing rapid differentiation (days 7–10) (13Singh P. Dai B. Yallampalli U. Lu X. Schroy P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zarrilli R. Pignata S. Romano M. Gravina A. Casola S. Bruni C.B. Acquaviva A.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1085-1091PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that P3- and P4-derived transcripts were significantly up-regulated during the proliferative phase of the cells (days 3–6 in culture) and declined rapidly in cells undergoing differentiation (days 7–10); P1- and P2-derived transcripts were not detected (19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, transcriptional activity of transiently transfected P3 and P4 promoters reached peak levels by days 4–6 and declined rapidly thereafter (19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At the present time, the regulatory element(s) within the P3 and P4 promoters, which is involved in the observed cell density-dependent regulation of the promoter activity, is unknown. Since a majority of colon cancers mainly express P3-derived transcripts, we further investigated the role of the endogenous P3 promoter in regulating IGF-2 mRNA levels, in a cell density-dependent/differentiation manner using the method of nuclear run-on assays. Additionally, for the first time, we have defined the promoter segment(s) and a putative novel cis element that may play a critical role in the cell density-dependent regulation of P3 promoter activity in CaCo2 cells using the methods of transient transfection with truncated promoter-reporter constructs, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and DNase footprinting. The CaCo2 human colon cancer cell line was obtained from Dr. Jing Yu, Tufts School of Medicine, and cells were grown as monolayer cultures as previously described (13Singh P. Dai B. Yallampalli U. Lu X. Schroy P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For all experimental purposes, exponentially growing cells were seeded at ∼150,000 cells/35-mm cell culture dishes (Falcon, Fisher), and the cell culture medium was changed every second day with fresh growth medium containing 10% FCS. Nuclei were obtained, and assays were performed by a modification of previously described procedures (26Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.101-4.109Google Scholar). Briefly, 7–10 × 107 CaCo2 cells, at the indicated time points, were washed 2 times in phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C). Cells were scraped and lysed in 2 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and nuclei were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl (∼1–2 × 107 nuclei/100 μl) of glycerol storage buffer (40% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Thirty μl of nuclear run-on buffer (25 mm Tris, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 750 mm KCl, 1.25 mm ATP, 1.25 mmCTP, 1.25 mm GTP) and 20 μl of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were added to 100 μl of nuclear suspension. The transcription runoff was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated with DNase I (300 units), and CaCl2 (final concentration 1 mm) was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min. One μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 25 μl of SET buffer (5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5) were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 550 μl of 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate and 90 μl of 3 m sodium acetate were added, and the mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The aqueous phase was removed, and RNA was precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of guanidinium isothiocyanate, and RNA was reprecipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dissolved in 100 μl of TES (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS), and used for hybridization. A DNA slot or dot blot apparatus was used to blot equal concentrations of linearized plasmids (10 μg) onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). The DNA plasmids used included the negative control (Bluescript II SK+ vector without insert), the Bluescript II SK+ vector (containing human 18S cDNA used as a positive control for normalizing the hybridization signals), and a plasmid containing the human IGF-2 exon 5 DNA (to measure P3 promoter-driven transcriptional activity). The plasmid DNA were linearized by appropriate restriction endonucleases and denatured with 0.2 m NaOH. The pre-hybridization and hybridization solutions consisted of 10 mm TES, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, 1× Denhardt's, 0.25 mg/ml, Escherichia coli DNA. DNA blots were pre-hybridized in hybridization buffer for 3 h at 65 °C for 36 h. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 36 h. Filters were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice and then in 0.01× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C before autoradiographic analysis. The nuclear run-on assay results were quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiographic results using the UltroScan LX laser densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Relative levels of RNA on different days of cell culture were determined with the help of GelScan XL software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA levels in each experimental blot are expressed as a ratio of the corresponding 18 S RNA blot. The IGF-2 promoter-luc constructs used for transfection are presented diagrammatically in Fig.1. The full-length human promoter P3 DNA fragment was subcloned into the BamHI and SaII sites of the luciferase reporter gene expression vector, PSla3 (18van Dijk M.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Bootsma H.J. Holthuizen P. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), resulting in HUP3. Additional P3 clones containing the indicated truncated P3 fragments (Fig. 1) were derived from HUP3 either by restriction enzyme digestions with the appropriate enzymes and filling in of the protruding ends by Klenow DNA polymerase (Fig. 1) or by PCR amplification of the indicated fragments (Fig. 1). For PCR amplification, six separate 5′ sense primers were used: (a1) 5′-GCGCGCGGAGGGCGAAGTGATTGAT-3′ (−1090/−1070); (a2) 5′-GCGCGCGGAGGGCGAAGTGATTGAT-3′ (−1048/−1012); (a3) 5′-AGGGGGGCAGGGGGGCGCGGGATTC-3′ (−1006/−982); (a4) 5′-TCCCCTTGGCTAGGCTTAGGCGGC-3′ (−946/−923); (a5) 5′-ACCCCCAAATTATCGTGGTGG-3′ (−884/−864); primer (a6) 5′-TCCCGCCCTGATCCTCTCTCC-3′ (−716/−696) along with a common 3′-antisense primer 5′-GTCGACGCGGGGCCGCCTTGCCCGA-3′ (+139/+115). The full-length HUP3-luc vector (linearized) was used as template for the PCR amplifications. The PCR reaction was performed in the presence of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (27Singh P. Xu Z. Dai B. Rajaraman S. Rubin N. Dhruva B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G459-G468PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into PCR 2.1 cloning vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as per protocols provided by the supplier. Positive clones (that were determined to have the appropriate orientation of the P3 promoter DNA fragment in relation to the KpnI site on the PCR 2.1 vector) were selected and checked by DNA sequencing. The inserts were released from the PCR 2.1 vectors by XhoI and KpnI endonuclease digestion and religated into the same sites in promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The six new luciferase expression vectors, thus constructed, were termed HUP A1-HUP A6 luc vectors as shown in Fig. 1. The orientation and the sequence of the inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing using pGL primers one, 5′-TCTATCTTATCCTACTGTAACTG-3′ (∼10 bp upstream from multiple cloning site of pGL-2 basic vector), and two, 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′ (∼20 bp downstream from multiple cloning site of pGL-2 basic vector). CaCo2 cells in culture in 35-mm dishes (as described above under cell culture) were transfected with 5–10 μg of the indicated vector DNA on days 2–8 of cell culture by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Singh P. Dai B. Dhruva B. Widen S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6563-6570PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dai B. Widen S. Mifflin R. Singh P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with the SV40 β-galactosidase expression vector (pSV β-Gal vector, Promega) to normalize for transfection efficiency (19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Dai B. Widen S. Mifflin R. Singh P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Duplicate dishes were transfected with 5 μg of luciferase expression vector (pGL2, Promega) under the transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter as a positive control (19Singh P. Dai B. Given R.L. Lu X. Holthuizen P.E. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Dai B. Widen S. Mifflin R. Singh P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in regular growth medium containing 10% FCS until 22 h before transfection. Fresh growth medium containing 10% FCS was added on alternate days until the day of transfection. Additionally, before transfection, fresh growth medium plus 10% FCS was added. Post-transfection, the cells were washed with fresh medium plus 10% FCS and cultured for 24 h followed by cell lysis for purposes of measuring luciferase and β-Gal activities. Luciferase and β-Gal were measured in the cell lysates as described by us (29Dai B. Widen S. Mifflin R. Singh P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using the reporter lysis buffer (Promega) as per the protocols provided by the company. Luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay system (Promega) using 50 μl of cell extract and 100 μl of luciferase buffer at room temperature. Luciferase activity was measured within 15 s of adding the substrate, luciferin, with Berthold AutoLumaat LB953 (Wallac-Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). The β-Gal assay was performed with the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) as per the protocols provided by the company, as described by us (29Dai B. Widen S. Mifflin R. Singh P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, the absorbance of the samples was read at 420 nm in a Umax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Initially we conducted EMSA with double-stranded (ds) DNA fragments that were obtained by restriction digestion of the full length HUP3-luc vector, as shown in Table I. The DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and labeled with [α-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The labeled DNA fragments were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography through a G50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were prepared from CaCo2 cells on the indicated days of cell culture by methods described by Abmayr et al. (30Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured, and nuclear extracts were separated into aliquots and frozen at −70 °C. EMSA was performed essentially as described by Rietveld et al. (31Rietveld L.E.G. Koonen-Reemst A.M.C.B Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, EMSA was performed in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 5–10 μg of crude nuclear extract prepared from CaCo2 cells on different days of cell culture, 5 μl of DNA probe containing ∼200,000 cpm, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For competition, a 100–200-fold excess of the unlabeled DNA probe was mixed with the radiolabeled probe before the addition of the protein extract. After incubating the samples for 15 min at room temperature, the DNA protein complexes were separated from the free DNA by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography in the presence of intensifying screens at −80 °C. We additionally conducted EMSA with the indicated ds oligonucleotide probes using methods that were essentially similar to that described previously (31Rietveld L.E.G. Koonen-Reemst A.M.C.B Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probes used are detailed under “Results.”Table IRestriction fragments of P3 promoter used as EMSA probesDNA ProbeRestriction sitesProbeIGF-2 P3 positionHUP3-luc vectorbp1HPA1/HINF1257−1372 /−11152HINF1434−1090 /−6563HINF1203−656 /−4534HINF1/Xba1165−453 /−288 Open table in a new tab DNase I footprinting assays were performed with the help of Core Footprinting System (Promega) by our published procedures (31Rietveld L.E.G. Koonen-Reemst A.M.C.B Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ds DNA fragment (−1164/−871) was amplified with sense primer, 5′-AGGGACGCGGAGGAGAGGCGC TCC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-AGGATCCATTTGGGGGTCTGGGGAAACCAT-3′, by PCR using HUP3-luc vector as the template. PCR products were cloned into PCR 2.1 vector by using TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen, CA). The DNA fragment was released from the new vector by EcoRI digestion and isolated from agarose gel by using QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The resulting 293-bp template was labeled with [α-32P]ATP by T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled DNA was digested with BamHI to get a single-stranded template for the DNase footprinting assay. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the labeled sample by using NucTrap® probe purification columns (Stratagene). The binding reaction was set up as per the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The binding reaction (50 μl) contained 100,000 cpm of labeled DNA probe, 20 μl of nuclear protein (prepared as described above), 25 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.125 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, 50 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmCaCl2 were added followed by the addition of 0.14 units of DNase I, and incubation was continued at room temperature for 3 min. DNase I digestion was quenched by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and the DNA template was purified by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gels. Gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography.
