However, evidence for the association of JAM with these molecules is missing. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with JAM (either alone or in combination with occludin) resulted in enhanced junctional localization of both endogenous ZO-1 and cotransfected occludin. Additionally, JAM was coprecipitated with ZO-1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction of Caco-2 epithelial cells. A putative PDZ-binding motif at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of JAM was required for mediating the interaction of JAM with ZO-1, as assessed by in vitro binding and coprecipitation experiments. JAM was also coprecipitated with cingulin, another cytoplasmic component of tight junctions, and this association required the amino-terminal globular head of cingulin. Taken together, these data indicate that JAM is a component of the multiprotein complex of tight junctions, which may facilitate junction assembly.

Interactions between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic molecules (together with the cytoskeleton) are likely to modulate the “barrier” and “fence” functions of TJ. Conceivably, cytoplasmic molecules might bind the transmembrane proteins and target them to junctional areas, thus accounting for regulated formation and maintenance of TJ. In particular, ZO-1 might organize occludin at junctional sites, since transfected occludin usually colocalizes at cell-cell contacts with endogenous ZO-1, while remaining diffusely expressed at the cell surface in fibroblasts that do not target ZO-1 to the junctions (20.Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, neither junctional displacement (21.Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) nor targeted gene disruption (22.Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) of occludin affects the junctional localization of ZO-1. However, the upstream events that determine or enable proper targeting of these molecules are not completely understood. Both cytosolic signaling mediators and membrane docking proteins are likely involved in the assembly and sealing of TJ (23.Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the de novo assembly of TJ in epithelial cells using the “calcium-switch” assay indicates that E-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion is one of the determinants of TJ biogenesis (24.Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Additionally, cadherin-based cell-cell contacts are likely to stabilize TJ, since treatment of Madin-Derby canine kidney epithelial cells with E-cadherin blocking antibodies dissociates preformed TJ (25.Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Goodman S.L. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,26.Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, the observation that E-cadherin-null mouse blastocysts do form normal TJ (27.Ohsugi M. Larue L. Schwarz H. Kemler R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) indicates that E-cadherin, albeit relevant, may not be the only integral membrane protein that contributes to the assembly and stabilization of TJ. Additionally, VE-cadherin null mutation in endothelial cells does not prevent JAM and other TJ components from being correctly localized at intercellular contacts (28.Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oosthuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angelillo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C.

We have recently identified junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) as a novel integral membrane protein that colocalizes with TJ components (such as occludin, ZO-1, and cingulin) at the apical region of the intercellular cleft in epithelial and endothelial cells (29.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). To test whether JAM may play a functional role in the context of intercellular junctions, it is necessary to analyze possible relationships of JAM with TJ components. Here, we have examined the ability of JAM (i) to influence the molecular organization of intercellular junctions and (ii) to associate with cytoplasmic components of TJ. For production of the anti-human JAM mAb BV16 (IgG1), BALB/c female mice were immunized with a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human JAM and the Fc portion of human IgGs. Splenocytes were fused with the SP2/0 myeloma cell line. Clones were screened for their ability to recognize the immunogen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and to stain intercellular junctions in Caco-2 cells. Production of rat anti-murine JAM mAbs BV11 and BV12, as well as and rabbit anti-cingulin polyclonal antibody (pAb), has been described previously (14.Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1988; 333: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 29.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Anti-murine JAM mAb BV19 was produced by immunizing Lewis rats with an Fc-murine JAM construct. Rabbit anti-ZO-1 and anti-occludin pAbs were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The constructs GST-JAM, GST-XC 1–378, and GST-XC 377–1368 encoded for GST fused with the cytoplasmic domain of JAM and an amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragment of cingulin, respectively. GST-JAM contains the cytoplasmic tail of murine JAM (residues 261–300). GST-XC 1–378 comprises most of the amino-terminal globular head, and GST-XC 377–1368 comprises a small part of the head (residues 377–439), the coiled-coil region (residues 440–1325), and the globular carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 1326–1368) of Xenopus cingulin (30.Cordenonsi M. D'Atri F. Hammar E. Parry D.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Shore D. Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 147: 1569-1582Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A JAM deletion mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal residues Phe298-Leu299-Val300 (JAM ΔFLV) was produced by polymerase chain reaction, using murine JAM cDNA in the pCDM8 vector as template, the sense oligonucleotide 5′-CCTGGTTCAAGGACGGGATATCCATGCTTACAGC-3′ (which corresponds to nucleotides 491–524 and encompasses an EcoRV site) as forward primer, and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GAGCGGCCGC TCACGACGAGGTCTGTTTGAATTCC-3′ (which introduces a NotI site and a stop codon upstream of nucleotide 892) as reverse primer (the restriction sites are underlined, and the stop codon is highlighted in bold). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. The EcoRV-NotI fragment containing the mutation was inserted in the JAM/pCDM8 vector to replace the corresponding EcoRV-NotI fragment encoding for full-length JAM. Then, cDNAs for full-length JAM and mutated JAM ΔFLV were cloned as HindIII-NotI fragments into the PINCO retroviral vector (31.Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar) for transfection of the Phoenix packaging cell line (32.Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), which were kindly donated by Drs. P .G. Pelicci (European Institute of Oncology, Milano, Italy) and G. P. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Supernatants of PINCO-transfected Phoenix cells were used to infect human Caco-2 cells, as described in detail (33.Introna M. Barbui A.M. Golay J. Bambacioni F. Schiro R. Bernasconi S. Breviario F. Erba E. Borleri G. Barbui T. Biondi A. Rambaldi A. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 103: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surface expression of transfected JAM and JAM ΔFLV was tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using anti-murine JAM mAb BV12. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected by calcium phosphate with 20 μg of pECE-JAM and/or pECE-occludin plus 2 μg of pB-SpacDp plasmids (34.Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cloning of murine JAM has been described previously (29.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar); cDNA encoding murine occludin was obtained from Dr. W. Risau (Max Planck Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany). Transfectants were selected with puromycin and tested for JAM and occludin expression by immunofluorescence. Briefly, CHO cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 3 min at −20 °C, as described (35.Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For occludin staining, fixed cells were sequentially incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin for 10 min and 0.5% saponin for additional 10 min. Human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum. Confluent monolayers were lysed (for 30 min at 4 °C) with lysis buffer (pH 7.5) containing either 0.5% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and protease inhibitors. Following centrifugation of cell lysates (14,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant (“soluble fraction”) was separated from the pellet. The pellet was further incubated with 0.02% SDS in lysis buffer, resuspended by gentle pipetting, and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was collected (“insoluble fraction”). After preclearing, both fractions were incubated with antibodies for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were then absorbed with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Beads were washed five times, boiled with reducing sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters by electroblotting. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckingham, United Kingdom) and autoradiography. For ATP depletion, Caco-2 monolayers were preincubated (for 60 min at 37 °C) with 2 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 10 μmantimycin A (Sigma) dissolved in Delbecco's-phosphate-buffered saline (36.Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar). Reprecipitation experiments were carried out as described above, except that immune complexes were dissociated with 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 70 °C. Samples were then diluted 1:4 (v:v) in lysis buffer, incubated with the indicated antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose for additional 60 min at 4 °C, and reprecipitated. For GST “pull-down” experiments, either GST-JAM or GST-cingulin fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and added to the lysates. Precipitation was carried out as detailed above. To prepare recombinant ZO-1 as fluid-phase ligand for binding assays, cDNA encoding full-length human ZO-1 under control of the T7 promoter in pBluescript SK+ (kindly provided by Drs. A. S. Fanning and J. M. Anderson) was transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (13.Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The nascent protein was labeled using Transcend biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Promega). Briefly, 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2 μl of reaction buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture minus leucine (1 mm), 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture minus methionine (1 mm), 40 units of RNasin, 1 μg of template DNA, 1 μl of Biotin-Lysyl-tRNA were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl, incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, and immediately used for the binding assays. As solid-phase ligands, we used either GST-JAM immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads or the carboxyl-terminal JAM peptide NH2-KQTSSFLV (or reverse NH2-VLFSSTQK control peptide) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots (20 μl) of packed beads were diluted with binding buffer (140 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 1% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 45 μl of the ZO-1 transcription and translation reaction in a final volume of 200 μl (overnight at 4 °C, with rotation). Beads were washed five times, resuspended with 20 μl of sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized using HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Biospa, Milano, Italy). To investigate functional interactions of JAM with other junctional proteins, CHO cells (which do not form TJ) were transfected with JAM (and, for comparison, with occludin) and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy for expression of both transfected molecules and endogenous ZO-1. Although no occludin, JAM, or ZO-1 staining was detectable in untransfected CHO cells (Fig. 1,OCC−/JAM−), transfection of JAM resulted in the appearance of both JAM and ZO-1 at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1,OCC−/JAM+). On the contrary, transfection of occludin induced junctional staining of occludin but not ZO-1 (Fig. 1,OCC+/JAM−). Then, to evaluate whether concomitant expression of JAM and occludin might further increase ZO-1 expression levels, CHO were cotransfected with both JAM and occludin. In the double transfectants, ZO-1 staining was not brighter than in cells transfected with JAM alone (Fig. 1, compare OCC+/JAM+ withOCC−/JAM +). Remarkably, however, greater amounts of occludin were detectable compared with cells transfected with occludin alone (Fig. 1, compareOCC+/JAM+ withOCC+/JAM−), suggesting that JAM might help recruit both ZO-1 and occludin at sites of intercellular contacts. A likely explanation for the observations reported above is that JAM and ZO-1 are components of a molecular complex involved in the formation of junctional structures. To dissect possible molecular interactions of JAM with other junctional molecules, JAM was immunoprecipitated with the anti-JAM mAb BV16 from epithelial Caco-2 cells. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with a ZO-1 pAb. Since most TJ components are linked to the actin cytoskeleton, both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were examined. In the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, mAb BV16 coprecipitated a protein with an apparent relative mass of ∼220 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of ZO-1, that was recognized by the ZO-1 pAb (Fig.2 A, lane 2). The coprecipitated band comigrated with ZO-1, when the latter was directly precipitated and blotted with the ZO-1 pAb (lane 4). In the reciprocal experimental condition, ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated with the ZO-1 antiserum and analyzed by Western blot with mAb BV16. The ZO-1 pAb coprecipitated a ∼40-kDa band (Fig. 2 B,lane 6) that comigrated with JAM (lane 8). In both conditions, association of JAM with ZO-1 was only detectable in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the lysate. Similar results were obtained when Nonidet P-40 was used as a detergent instead of Triton X-100 (data not shown). To identify molecular determinants of the association of JAM with ZO-1, we produced both molecules in recombinant form and tested their interaction in in vitro binding assays. The cytoplasmic domain of JAM (from Gly256 to the carboxyl-terminal residue Val300) was expressed as a fusion protein with GST (GST-JAM) and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Full-length ZO-1 was transcribed and translated in vitro, labeled with biotin, and used as fluid phase ligand. Bound ZO-1 was then eluted, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotting, and visualized with streptavidin-peroxidase. Like native ZO-1, recombinant ZO-1 displayed an apparent relative molecular mass of ∼220 kDa (Fig.3 A, lane 6) and was recognized by the ZO-1 pAb (lane 7). As shown in Fig. 3 A, recombinant ZO-1 bound GST-JAM (lane 2), but not GST alone (lane 1), indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of JAM is required for the association with ZO-1. PSD95/dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains mediate binding of several intracellular molecules (like ZO-1) to the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins (37.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The presence of a putative PDZ-binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of JAM (see “Discussion”) led us to investigate its involvement in the interaction with ZO-1. To this purpose, the peptide NH2-KQTSSFLV (which corresponds to the last eight residues of JAM) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads and incubated with in vitro transcribed/translated ZO-1. Recombinant ZO-1 specifically bound the JAM peptide (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), but not the reverse peptide NH2-VLFSSTQK (lane 5) or uncoupled beads (lane 3). The additional band with an apparent relative molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa is presumably due to proteolytic degradation of transcribed ZO-1. To further analyze the role of the motif, a mutant form of murine JAM lacking the three carboxyl-terminal Phe298-Leu299-Val300 residues (JAM ΔFLV) was expressed in Caco-2 cells. The availability of mAbs specific for either human (mAb BV16) or murine (mAb BV12) JAM allowed us to directly compare endogenous human JAM (full-length) with transfected murine JAM ΔFLV. Preliminary fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that JAM ΔFLV was expressed at the cell surface and colocalized with endogenous ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts (data not shown). Both JAM and JAM ΔFLV were first immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-soluble and-insoluble fractions of Caco-2 transfectants using mAbs BV16 and BV12. Then, the association with endogenous ZO-1 was tested by Western blot with the ZO-1 pAb. As expected, ZO-1 was coprecipitated by mAb BV16 with wild-type JAM in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3 B,lane 9). In contrast, no ZO-1 was coprecipitated by mAb BV12 together with JAM ΔFLV (lane 11). No association was found in the soluble fractions immunoprecipitated with either mAb BV16 (lane 8) or BV12 (lane 10). The absence of detectable association of ZO-1 with JAM ΔFLV is not due to the inability of mAb BV12 to immunoprecipitate JAM ΔFLV, as JAM ΔFLV was immunoprecipitated by mAb BV12 in a way comparable to the immunoprecipitation of JAM with mAb BV16 (lanes 13 and 15). To test whether other junctional proteins could be coprecipitated with JAM, mAb BV16-immunoprecipitates of Caco-2 cells were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-cingulin pAb. In the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, mAb BV16 coprecipitated a protein that was detectable with the cingulin pAb as a ∼140-kDa band, the apparent relative molecular mass of cingulin (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The protein coprecipitated by mAb BV16 displayed the same electrophoretic motility of cingulin, when the latter was precipitated and blotted in parallel with the cingulin pAb (lane 4). Although cingulin was present in both fractions, mAb BV16 did not coprecipitate cingulin from the soluble fraction (lane 1). Association of JAM with cingulin was confirmed in the reciprocal experiment, using the anti-cingulin pAb for immunoprecipitation and mAb BV16 for Western blot. The cingulin pAb coprecipitated a protein that was recognized by mAb BV16 as a band of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 4 B,lane 6) that comigrated with JAM (lane 8). Again, association of JAM with cingulin was only detectable in the insoluble fraction, even if a greater amount of JAM was present in the soluble fraction. To further define the interaction of JAM with cingulin, GST-JAM was immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. Similarly to mAb BV16, GST-JAM (but not GST) coprecipitated cingulin in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of Caco-2 lysates, as assessed by Western blot analysis with the cingulin pAb (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). The ∼140-kDa band precipitated by GST-JAM comigrated with native cingulin, when the latter was precipitated and blotted in parallel with the cingulin antiserum (lane 6). Cingulin did not associate with GST-JAM in the soluble fraction (lane 3). To define which region of cingulin is required for interacting with JAM, two GST fusion proteins containing either an amino-terminal (GST-XC 1–378) or a carboxyl-terminal (GST-XC 377–1368) fragment of cingulin were incubated with Caco-2 lysates. In order to reduce some aspecific background, the fraction of JAM bound to the GST-cingulin proteins was dissociated with 0.2% SDS (for 10 min at 70 °C), reprecipitated with mAb BV16, and finally analyzed by Western blot with mAb BV16. GST-XC 1–378 precipitated JAM in both TX-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9and 10). By densitometry, the JAM band was from 1.5 to 1.8 times more intense in the insoluble than in the soluble fraction. The bands precipitated by either GST-XC 1–378 or mAb BV16 showed similar molecular mass and electrophoretic motility (lanes 10 and 14). In contrast, no JAM was found in samples precipitated by GST (lanes 7 and8) or GST-XC 377–1368 (lanes 11 and12), indicating that the amino-terminal globular head of cingulin is specifically required for associating with JAM. The existence of two distinct subpopulations of JAM (a major Triton X-100-soluble pool, and a minor Triton X-100-insoluble pool that associates with cingulin and ZO-1) might reflect different degrees in the association with the cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, cells were subjected to depletion of ATP, a treatment that increases the association of junctional proteins with the cytoskeleton (23.Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were incubated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and antimycin A (which inhibit glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) and then lysed in Triton X-100. JAM was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blot with mAb BV16. The ratio of soluble to insoluble JAM was greatly reduced following ATP depletion (Fig. 6, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 4and 5), suggesting that the treatment increases the association of JAM with the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, when lysates were immunoprecipitated with the cingulin pAb, a greater amount of JAM was coprecipitated with cingulin upon ATP depletion (lane 6) compared with control conditions (lane 3). Thus, association with the cytoskeleton might shift the equilibrium between the two subpopulations of JAM toward the more insoluble state and facilitate the interaction of JAM with cingulin. The present study was undertaken to define functional interactions of JAM with other junctional molecules. The major findings of this paper are: (i) JAM facilitates the junctional localization of ZO-1 and occludin in CHO transfectants, (ii) JAM can be coprecipitated with ZO-1 and cingulin in the insoluble fraction of Caco-2 cells, and (iii) the carboxyl terminus of JAM entails a putative PDZ-binding motif that plays a critical role in the association of JAM with ZO-1. The ability of JAM to enhance the distribution of ZO-1 at cell-cell junctions complements our previous observation that transfection of JAM in CHO cells (which are normally not self-adherent) induces intercellular adhesion and reduces paracellular permeability (29.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Thus, JAM might enable the junctional localization of ZO-1 by establishing functional intercellular adhesion. Similarly, transfection of the cell adhesion molecule Protein zero enhances the junctional expression of ZO-1 in HeLa cells (38.Doyle J.P. Stempak J.G. Cowin P. Colman D.R. D'Urso D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and cadherin-dependent intercellular adhesion (24.Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 39.Sedar A.W. Forte J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 22: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) is prerequisite to the formation of TJ. However, mere overexpression of transmembrane adhesive proteins may not be per se sufficient to recruit junctional molecules. For instance, in our hands, occludin did not induce detectable ZO-1 staining at the junctions, even if transfected occludin is efficiently transported to the cell surface in CHO cells (40.Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and confers adhesiveness to fibroblasts (20.Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was somehow surprising, since ZO-1 has been shown to directly interact with occludin (41.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), even if it is possible that the amount of occludin associated with ZO-1 in our conditions was very low and below the sensitivity levels of immunofluorescence. Besides recruiting ZO-1, JAM enhanced the junctional staining of occludin. JAM might directly bind and shuttle occludin to the lateral membrane in proximity of nascent junctional complexes, even if the carboxyl terminus of occludin is capable of autonomous targeting to the basolateral membrane (42.Matter K. Balda M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, JAM-dependent recruitment of occludin at the junctions might be indirectly mediated by ZO-1, as suggested by the herein reported observation that JAM has the potential to associate with ZO-1. The latter is a junctional and multidomain protein, which may interact with several molecules and assemble them at intercellular contacts (1.Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 23.Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZO-1 interacts with diverse cytoplasmic molecules, such as ZO-2 (41.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), ZO-3 (13.Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, ZO-1 interacts with transmembrane proteins, such as the TJ components occludin (41.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 46.Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagasuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), claudins (47.Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), and JAM (as shown here). The association between JAM and ZO-1 was demonstrated by reciprocal coprecipitation and was only detectable in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Since ZO-1 binds F-actin (48.Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) through its carboxyl-terminal half (41.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), one can envision a dynamic model of junction assembly in which JAM first forms soluble complexes with ZO-1 and occludin, which are then progressively recruited into more insoluble structures linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Since the last three residues of JAM (Phe298-Leu299-Val300) fit the consensus sequence (Phe/Tyr-X-Val/Ile) identified in transmembrane proteins that bind type II PDZ domains (49.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 50.Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), ZO-1 might directly interact with the cytoplasmic tail of JAM. This hypothesis is reinforced by the herein reported observations that (i)in vitro transcribed and translated ZO-1 is specifically bound by either a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of JAM or a carboxyl-terminal JAM peptide, and (ii) coprecipitation of JAM with ZO-1 is lost upon deletion of the critical Phe298-Leu299-Val300 residues in JAM tail. JAM was also coprecipitated with cingulin. The interaction required the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of JAM and the amino-terminal globular head of cingulin, as indicated by studies with GST fusion proteins. Remarkably, the JAM-cingulin complex was almost exclusively detectable in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, despite the fact that JAM and cingulin were found in both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The lack of detectable association in the soluble fraction suggests that the JAM/cingulin association might require cytoskeletal proteins that are only present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, even if we cannot exclude at the present a direct interaction of the two proteins. Several lines of evidence indicate that cingulin is associated with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Cingulin, which was originally identified in the actomyosin fraction of intestinal epithelial cells (14.Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1988; 333: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 51.Citi S. Sabanay H. Kendrick-Jones J. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 107-122PubMed Google Scholar), was recently reported to colocalize with thick bundles of actin microfilaments during TJ assembly (52.Citi S. Cordenonsi M. Bittar D.R. Garrod A.J. North M.A.S. Chidgey A. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. JAI Press Inc., Stamford, CT1999: 202-233Google Scholar) and to interact with myosin (30.Cordenonsi M. D'Atri F. Hammar E. Parry D.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Shore D. Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 147: 1569-1582Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the other hand, compared with ZO-1, cingulin is more easily extractable from membranes and is recruited to a lower extent into fodrin-rich insoluble complexes (53.Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16133-16139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cingulin (which is a highly asymmetric molecule with a contour length of at least 130 nm (Ref. 14.Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1988; 333: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar)) is localized at about 40–60 nm distance from the membrane, farther than ZO-1 (14.Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1988; 333: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 54.Stevenson B.R. Heintzelman M.B. Anderson J.M. Mooseker M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C621-C628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that cingulin may come into close association with the cytoskeleton, even if such association might be somehow weaker when compared with ZO-1. JAM association with cingulin might increase the linkage to the cytoskeleton of the JAM/cingulin complex, thus stabilizing further the junctional plaque. Consistent with this hypothesis, shifting the equilibrium of JAM toward the insoluble fraction upon ATP depletion substantially increased the amount of JAM coprecipitated with cingulin. In conclusion, we propose that JAM might play a role in the molecular architecture of TJ by interacting with ZO-1 and cingulin and stabilizing occludin at the junctions. As schematically depicted in Fig. 7, the latter event could be accounted for by ZO-1-mediated bridging of the two transmembrane junctional molecules, since ZO-1 may bind both JAM (possibly via its PDZ domains) and occludin (via the guanylate kinase and/or acidic domain; Ref. 41.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Further strengthening of the molecular scaffold might then be provided by JAM-dependent recruitment of cingulin into the developing junctional complex. We thank Drs. Bruce R. Stevenson and Erika S. Wittchen (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta), and Drs. Alan S. Fanning and James M. Anderson (Yale University, New Haven, CT) for generous advice and for kindly providing the ZO-1 cDNA."

Previously we have reported that the intracellular effectors of TGF-β, Smad3 and Smad4, functionally cooperate with Sp1 to activate the human p21 promoter in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In this study we show that Smad3 and Smad4 when overexpressed in HaCaT keratinocytes lead to activation of the p21 promoter. Activation requires the binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 on the proximal promoter. Induction of the endogenous HaCaTp21 gene by TGF-β1 is further enhanced after overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4, whereas dominant negative mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 and the inhibitory Smad7 all inhibit p21induction by TGF-β1 in a dose-dependent manner. We show that Sp1 expressed in the Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells binds to the proximal p21 promoter sequences, whereas Smad proteins do not. In support of this finding, we show that DNA-binding domain mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 are capable of transactivating the p21 promoter as efficiently as wild type Smads. Co-expression of Smad3 with Smad4 and Sp1 in SL-2 cells or co-incubation of phosphorylated Smad3, Smad4, and Sp1 in vitro results in enhanced binding of Sp1 to the p21 proximal promoter sequences. We demonstrate that Sp1 physically and directly interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and weakly with Smad4 via their amino-terminal (Mad-Homology 1) domain. Finally, by using GAL4 fusion proteins we show that the glutamine-rich sequences in the transactivation domain of Sp1 contribute to the cooperativity with Smad proteins.

TGF-β inhibits cell proliferation of various cell types of epithelial origin by repressing the expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc and by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) which leads to the arrest of the cell cycle at an early G1 phase (3Alexandrow M.G.

The mechanism of action of TGF-β in modulating the activity of the CDKs involves the regulation of the CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p15Ink4B, p21Waf1/Cip1, and p27Kip1 and the repression of the CDK phosphatase cdc25A (4Reynisdottir I.

This regulation consists of both transcriptional induction of the genes for p15 and p21 and partitioning of the CKIs between different complexes with CDKs (4Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 7Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the transcriptional induction of the genes for the two CKIs, p15 and p21, has been postulated at least as partially determining the anti-proliferative action of TGF-β (11Hu P.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p21 gene is regulated by a rapidly growing list of physiological and pathological factors, such as tumor suppressors of the p53 family, differentiation factors, growth factors, cytokines, and stress factors (Ref. 12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and references therein). However, the detailed transcriptional mechanisms involved in p21 gene regulation by the above factors still remain poorly understood. In the cases of p53, vitamin D3, interferon γ, and other signals, factor-specific DNA motifs scattered in the region between −2,300 and −210 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional initiation site of the p21gene have been shown to mediate the response of this gene to the above stimuli (13Liu M.

In contrast, for a large number of other signaling factors such as, TGF-β1, progesterone, phorbol esters, and Rho GTPases, the proximal region of the p21 promoter (base pairs −210 to +1) is the major site for reception of the inducing signal (Ref. 12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and references therein). This short, proximal promoter contains several closely spaced G/C-rich motifs that serve as binding sites for members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors (16Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor with a zinc finger DNA-binding domain that recognizes G/C-rich DNA sequences (17Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Sp1 is required for early embryogenesis and regulates the terminal differentiation state of cells by affecting the methylation of DNA CpG islands (19Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Sp1 is regulated by phosphorylation in a cell cycle-specific manner, acetylation by the co-activator p300, and glycosylation, which protects this factor from proteasome-dependent degradation (20Black A.R.

Sp1 exerts its transcriptional properties by interacting directly with factors of the basal transcription machinery and by cooperating with several transcriptional activators (23Gill G. Pascal E.

Thus, although Sp1 traditionally appeared as a ubiquitous factor primarily serving the core activity of promoters, recent evidence increasingly implicates this protein in several instances of regulated gene transcription. It is established that transcription factor Sp1 participates in the regulation of the p21 gene by TGF-β (16Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The TGF-β signaling pathway utilizes plasma membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and their cytoplasmic effectors termed the Smad proteins (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Smad proteins are transcriptional activators that bind to DNA and cooperate with a fast growing list of transcription factors in regulating target gene expression (32Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

The Smads were shown to cooperate functionally with Sp1 and depend on the Sp1-binding sites of the p21 promoter for their action. In addition, we have demonstrated that Jun family members, which themselves are induced and activated by TGF-β, can also regulate the p21 promoter by physically interacting with Sp1 and utilizing the same G/C-rich motifs of the proximal promoter (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that Smad3 and Smad4 enhance the level of endogenous HaCaTp21 gene induction by TGF-β, whereas dominant negative Smads and the inhibitory Smad7 block p21induction by TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner. These results correlate very well with the p21 promoter transactivation studies in the same cells. We show that Smads mediate enhancement of the Sp1 affinity for the p21 promoter, independent from a direct association of Smads to DNA, and Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 physically interact with Sp1. We have mapped the domain of Smad3 and Smad4 required for this interaction and provide evidence for the involvement of specific Sp1 sequences in the functional cooperation between these two classes of transcription factors.

Human HaCaT keratinocytes, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and monkey kidney COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Drosophila Schneider's SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% insect culture-tested fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 27 °C. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells for co-immunoprecipitation assays and of Schneider's SL2 cells for nuclear extract isolation were performed using the liposome reagent Fugene-6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transient transfections using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (35Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.i U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Adenoviral stocks were maintained, and infections were performed as described previously (37Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 122: 4557-4568Google Scholar). The dominant negative (DN) Smad3 and DN-Smad4-encoding adenoviruses were the generous gifts of Dr. Theodore Fotsis, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece. Under optimal conditions, more than 90% of the cells were infected as determined by the blue, β-galactosidase-positive staining using a lacZcontrol virus or the green fluorescent protein autofluorescence (for the DN-Smad3 and DN-Smad4 viruses). Routine infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 with single viruses. HaCaT cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well tissue culture plates. The next day the cells were transfected with the reporter constructs using the Fugene-6 reagent. Twelve hours later the culture medium was changed to DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected 1 h later at the appropriate m.o.i. for 12 h and then washed and fed fresh 5% fetal bovine serum/DMEM. Twenty four hours later the reporter assays were performed, which corresponds to 49 h post-transfection and 36 h post-infection. For p21 protein analysis, HaCaT cells were seeded at a density of 106cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. Twelve hours later the culture medium was changed to DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and infected with different doses of each virus (see Fig. 2) 1 h later. Twenty four hours later cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 20 h, and 20 μg of detergent-soluble cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with the p21-specific antibody. FLAG, HA, and Smad1/2/3-specific antibodies served as controls to measure expression of the co-infected proteins, and β-catenin antibody served as control to verify equal protein amount loading. Western analysis of transiently transfected SL2 cell extracts or purified baculoviral Smad3 proteins was performed in the same fashion using the relevant antibodies as described under “Results” and figure legends. Relative protein expression levels were quantified using the scanning densitometric software of the PhosphorImager Fujix BAS 2000. Ratios of band intensities of the tested protein (p21) over the control protein (β-catenin) were calculated, and the ground condition ratio was set to 1 or 100% relative to which all other conditions are expressed. Forty hours post-transfection of COS-7 cells, total detergent extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mm aprotinin at 4 °C. The cell extracts were clarified from the insoluble material by a brief centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and were pre-cleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. The pre-cleared extracts were incubated with the FLAG or GAL4-DBD antibody at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein-G Sepharose, washed with lysis buffer four times, and dissolved in Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer. After 7% SDS-PAGE the resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the relevant proteins were detected after incubation with the anti-Myc (9E10) antibody followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and homemade enhanced chemiluminescent assay on x-ray film (Fuji). Expression of proteins in vitro was performed using the coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (TNT) of Promega as described previously (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The quality of the synthesized proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS 2000) detection. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH-10β and purified as described previously (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The solubilization of the expressed proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. All proteins were obtained at rather high levels and in relatively pure form as only the primary protein species were detectable without significant degradation products (Fig. 6, B, E, and H). Interaction assays of GST-Sp1 proteins with in vitro synthesized Smad proteins were performed as described previously (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For the interaction assays of GST-Smad proteins with endogenous HaCaT Sp1, total cell extracts were prepared by lysis in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1% aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNaOVO3. Aliquots of the extracts corresponding to approximately 107 cells were incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying 10 μg of the GST-Smad fusions for 5 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were washed with the lysis buffer, dissolved in Laemmli SDS loading buffer, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using the Sp1 antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Nuclear extracts from transiently transfected Schneider's SL2 cells were prepared 40 h post-transfection by hypotonic lysis of the cells in 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm spermidine, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm NaOVO3, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm aprotinin by three sequential freeze (liquid nitrogen)-thaw (4 °C) cycles. The nuclear pellets obtained by centrifugation at 4,000 × g were solubilized by slow rotation for 45 min in hypertonic buffer, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 600 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaOVO3, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm aprotinin at 4 °C. The soluble nuclear extracts were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g, were aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The corresponding cytoplasmic extracts were used for β-galactosidase assays to calibrate the extracts for transfection efficiency. The total protein in the nuclear extracts was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). The abundance of the transfected proteins in the nuclear extracts was estimated by Western blot analysis after 7% SDS-PAGE, using the relevant antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (GEMSAs) were performed as described previously (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides from the p21 promoter and the consensus Sp1 site used in the GEMSA experiments were described by Kardassis et al. (12Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense strand of the mutant double-stranded −86/−70 p21 promoter oligonucleotide is 5′-GGGTCGACCCTCCTTGA-3′, where the underline indicates the mutated nucleotides. For comparison, the wild type oligonucleotide sequence is 5′-GGGTCCCGCCTCCTTGA-3′ (Fig.1 A). The quadruple Smad-binding element (SBE4) oligonucleotide was described by Jonk et al. (38Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the p21 promoter regions were synthesized, annealed, labeled with Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP, and 10 fmol were incubated with 200 ng of each purified protein or with aliquots of nuclear extracts from the transfected SL2 cells that were calibrated for total protein content, β-galactosidase activity, and specific protein abundance based on the Western blot signals. For the Smad-binding depletion experiment, purified Smad proteins were first incubated with excess (4 pmol) cold SBE4 oligonucleotide for 10 min"
https://openalex.org/W1992989755,"Epithelial damage and airway remodeling are consistent features of bronchial asthma and are correlated with disease chronicity, severity, and bronchial hyperreactivity. To examine the mechanisms that control bronchial epithelial repair, we investigated expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (c-erbB1, EGFR) in asthmatic bronchial mucosa and studied repair responses in vitro. In biopsies from asthmatic subjects, areas of epithelial damage were frequently observed and exhibited strong EGFR immunostaining. EGFR expression was also high in morphologically intact asthmatic epithelium. Using image analysis, EGFR immunoreactivity (% of total epithelial area, median (range) was found to increase from 9.4 (4.1-20.4) in normal subjects (n=10) to 18.4 (9.3-28.9) in mild asthmatics (P<0.01, n=13) and 25.4 (15.4-31.8) in severe asthmatics (P<0.00, n=5). Epithelial EGFR immunoreactivity remained elevated in patients treated with corticosteroids and was positively correlated with subepithelial reticular membrane thickening. Using 16HBE 14o- bronchial epithelial cells, we found that EGF accelerated repair of scrape-wounded monolayers and that the EGFR-selective inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, inhibited both EGF-stimulated and basal wound closure whereas dexamethasone was without effect. Intrinsic activation of the EGFR was confirmed by analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, which revealed a rapid, damage-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR, irrespective of the presence of exogenous EGF. To assess the relationship between EGFR-mediated repair and tissue remodeling, release of the profibrogenic mediator TGF-beta2 was also measured. Scrape wounding increased release of TGF-beta2 from epithelial monolayers and EGF had no additional stimulatory effect. However, when repair was retarded with AG1478, the amount of TGF-beta2 increased significantly. These data indicate that the EGFR may play an important role in bronchial epithelial repair in asthma and that impairment of this function may augment airway remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2046595938,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors have been described on rodent adipocytes and expression of their mRNA is found in human adipose tissue. However, no biological effects associated with the stimulation of these receptors have been reported in this tissue. A putative lipolytic effect of natriuretic peptides was investigated in human adipose tissue. On isolated fat cells, ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) stimulated lipolysis as much as isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, whereas C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) had the lowest lipolytic effect. In situ microdialysis experiments confirmed the potent lipolytic effect of ANP in abdominal s.c. adipose tissue of healthy subjects. A high level of ANP binding sites was identified in human adipocytes. The potency order defined in lipolysis (ANP > BNP > CNP) and the ANP-induced cGMP production sustained the presence of type A natriuretic peptide receptor in human fat cells. Activation or inhibition of cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE-3B) (using insulin and OPC 3911, respectively) did not modify ANP-induced lipolysis whereas the isoproterenol effect was decreased or increased. Moreover, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (using a mixture of alpha(2)-adrenergic and adenosine A1 agonists receptors) did not change ANP- but suppressed isoproterenol-induced lipolysis. The noninvolvement of the PDE-3B was finally confirmed by measuring its activity under ANP stimulation. Thus, we demonstrate that natriuretic peptides are a new pathway controlling human adipose tissue lipolysis operating via a cGMP-dependent pathway that does not involve PDE-3B inhibition and cAMP production."

Human blood platelets contain a number of antibacterial proteins in their α-granules that are released upon thrombin activation. The present study was designed to purify these proteins obtained from human platelets and to characterize them chemically and biologically. Two antibacterial proteins were purified from platelet granules in a two-step protocol using cation exchange chromatography and continuous acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were designated thrombocidin (TC)-1 and TC-2. Characterization of these proteins using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing revealed that TC-1 and TC-2 are variants of the CXC chemokines neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-III, respectively. TC-1 and TC-2 differ from these chemokines by a C-terminal truncation of 2 amino acids. Both TCs, but not neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-III, were bactericidal for Bacillus subtilis,Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, andLactococcus lactis and fungicidal for Cryptococcus neoformans. Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid.

In addition to the cell types mentioned above, human and rabbit blood platelets are known to store antibacterial proteins (27.Dankert J.

These antibacterial proteins are released from platelet α-granules in vitro after activation with thrombin (27.Dankert J. Role of Platelets in Early Pathogenesis of Viridans Group Streptococcal Endocarditis: A Study on Thrombodefensins. Ph.D. Thesis. University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands1988Google Scholar) and were designated thrombocidins (34.Zaat S.A. Koper M. Grasselier H. Meeldijk J. Krijgsveld J. Dankert J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 418: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In vivo, direct contact of platelets with bacteria causes aggregation and activation of platelets (35.Ford I. Douglas C.W.I. Preston F.E. Lawless A. Hampton K.K. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The subsequently released antibacterial proteins most likely are involved in the elimination of adherent bacteria (36.Dankert J. van der Werff J. Zaat S.A.J. Joldersma W. Klein D. Hess J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 663-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dankert et al.(27.Dankert J.

Viridans streptococci with low susceptibility to these proteins persisted in vegetations, whereas highly susceptible bacteria were rapidly eliminated (36.Dankert J. van der Werff J. Zaat S.A.J. Joldersma W. Klein D. Hess J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 663-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, strains ofStaphylococcus aureus and Candida albicansinsusceptible to rabbit platelet microbicidal proteins (PMPs) caused more severe experimental IE than did PMP-susceptible strains (37.Yeaman M.R. Soldan S.S. Ghannoum M.A. Edwards J.E. Filler S.G. Bayer A.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Dhawan V.K. Bayer A.S. Yeaman M.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, thrombocytopenic rabbits (39.Sullam P.M. Frank U. Yeaman M.R. Tauber M.G. Bayer A.S. Chambers H.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 168: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or rabbits with antibodies neutralizing their platelet bactericidal proteins (40.Krijgsveld J. Zaat S.A.J. van der Werff J. Dankert J. Abstracts of the Conference on Microbes, Haemostasis, and Vascular Biology, Abstract 7. American Society for Microbiology, Galveston, TX1998Google Scholar) were more susceptible to streptococcal IE than control rabbits. The present study was undertaken to gain insight into the structure, activity, and mechanism of action of antimicrobial proteins present in human platelets. Citrated human blood from healthy subjects was obtained from the Central Laboratory for Blood Transfusion (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Platelets were concentrated by the buffy coat method (41.Fijnheer R. Pietersz R.N.I. Korte D.d. Gouwerok C.W.N. Dekker W.J.A. Reesink H.W. Roos D. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and isolated using a protocol adapted from Fukami (42.Fukami M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and Kaplan et al. (43.Kaplan K.L. Broekman J. Chernoff A. Lesznik G.R. Drillings M. Blood. 1979; 53: 604-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Buffy coats were pooled in transfer bags (Netherlands Production Laboratory for Blood Transfusion Equipment and Infusion Solutions, Emmer-Compascuum, The Netherlands; 8 buffy coats/bag, approximately 550 ml), to which 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.38% trisodium citrate (w/v) was added. The bags were blown tight with air and centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g at 20 °C. The upper three-quarters of the volume of each bag, containing platelets, were transferred into new bags. To this platelet concentrate, one-ninth volume of citrate solution (75 mm trisodium citrate, 38 mm citric acid) was added. The bags were blown tight again and were centrifuged at 1750 × g at 20 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were removed, and platelets were resuspended in Tris-citrate (63 mm Tris-HCl, 95 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 12 mm citric acid, pH 6.5) by gentle massage. The platelet suspensions were collected in a siliconized flask. The bags were washed once with Tris-citrate, and this washing was added to the platelet suspension. Processing of 48 buffy coats routinely yielded approximately 75 ml of highly concentrated platelet suspension containing less than 0.05% leukocytes, as determined with a Coulter counter. Platelet concentrate was kept on ice and was cavitated three times for 15 min under nitrogen at 60 atmosphere in a cavitation chamber (Parr Instrument Co, Moline, IL). Cavitate was collected in siliconized polypropylene tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cavitation resulted in 90% homogenization of the platelets as determined with a Coulter counter. Intact and disrupted platelets were removed by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the granules. The pellet was resuspended in 5% acetic acid and sonicated for 30 s on ice to disrupt the granules, using a Branson model B15 sonifier (Branson, Soest, The Netherlands). The granule sonicate was kept at 4 °C for 24 h to extract protein and was subsequently centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 60 min to remove granule debris. The supernatant containing the extracted proteins was dialyzed against 5% acetic acid using 3,500-kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis tubing (Spectrum, Breda, The Netherlands). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). To purify the major antibacterial proteins from human platelet granule sonicate to homogeneity, a rapid two-step protocol was applied. As the first step we used a CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) ion exchange column (2.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0). 25 ml of sonicate obtained from approximately 40 buffy coats and containing 3.5 mg protein/ml was applied to the column at 0.8 ml/min. The column was washed with phosphate buffer at 0.8 ml/min, and protein was eluted in a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in phosphate buffer. Fractions of 4 ml were collected and dialyzed against 1% acetic acid. Cationic antibacterial proteins were detected using acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) and gel overlay assays (see below). Fractions containing antibacterial proteins were pooled and lyophilized. Proteins were further purified using CAU-PAGE as described by Harwig et al. (44.Harwig S.S.L. Chen N.P. Park A.S.K. Lehrer R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A cylindrical gel (3.7 cm in diameter, 7 cm high; 12.5% acrylamide, 5% acetic acid, 5 m urea) was prepared in a model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). The gel was polymerized at 37 °C and prerun at 200 V for 2 h in 5% acetic acid. Protein was dissolved in sample buffer (3 m urea in 5% acetic acid with methyl green as the tracking dye) and electrophorized at 40 mA with reversed polarity. Protein was eluted in 5% acetic acid at 0.8 ml/min and collected in fractions of 4 ml. Antibacterial proteins were detected by AU-PAGE and gel overlay assays (see below). Because TC-1 and TC-2 appeared to be variants of the CXC chemokines NAP-2 and CTAP-III, we tested the antibacterial activity of these proteins, as well as of PF-4, another platelet CXC chemokine. CTAP-III, NAP-2, and PF-4 were purified from release supernatants of thrombin-stimulated platelets, as described previously (45.Brandt E. Van Damme J. Flad H.D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Ludwig A. Petersen F. Zahn S. Gotze O. Schröder J.M. Flad H.D. Brandt E. Blood. 1997; 90: 3488-4597Crossref Google Scholar, 48.Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1954-1962PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CTAP-III (together with other variants of β-thromboglobulin antigen) was absorbed by immunoaffinity chromatography and then purified to homogeneity using sequential cation exchange (45.Brandt E. Van Damme J. Flad H.D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and reversed-phase chromatography (46.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar). NAP-2 was then generated from CTAP-III by limited digestion with chymotrypsin and purified by reversed-phase chromatography (47.Ludwig A. Petersen F. Zahn S. Gotze O. Schröder J.M. Flad H.D. Brandt E. Blood. 1997; 90: 3488-4597Crossref Google Scholar). PF-4 was isolated from the flow-through of the immunocolumn obtained after absorption of β-thromboglobulin antigen and then further purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose and reversed-phase chromatography (48.Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1954-1962PubMed Google Scholar). All chemokine preparations exceeded 99% purity and contained no detectable protein contaminants as judged from analysis by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and by automated N-terminal sequence analysis. The C terminus of CTAP-III and NAP-2 was intact, as probed in Western blots by reactivity of the chemokines with an antiserum that required the ultimate amino acid residue for binding to β-thromboglobulin proteins (49.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.D. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the full length of CTAP-III (85 amino acids), NAP-2 (70 amino acids), and PF-4 (70 amino acids) was verified by matrix-assisted desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy. Sequencing of thrombocidins was performed at the Sequencing Unit of the University of Utrecht by automated Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems model 476A Protein Sequencer, San Jose, CA). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK), equipped with an on-line nanoelectrospray interface (capillary tip, 20-μm internal diameter × 90-μm outer diameter) with an approximate flow rate of 250 nl/min. This flow was obtained by splitting of the 0.4 ml/min flow of a conventional high pressure gradient system 1 to 1000, using an Acurate flow splitter (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Lyophilized samples were dissolved in water/methanol/acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v). Injections were done with a dedicated micro/nano high performance liquid chromatography autosampler, the FAMOS (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in flow injection analysis mode. Thrombocidins were treated with trypsin (Difco, Detroit, MI; 1:100, w/w) in ammonium hydrogen carbonate (50 mm, pH 8.0) for 18 h. Mass spectra of the tryptic digests were recorded from mass 50–2,000 Da every second with a resolution of 5000 full width half-maximum. The resolution allows direct determination of the monoisotopic mass, also from multiple charged ions. In MS/MS mode, ions were selected with a window of 2 Da with the first quadrupole, and fragments were collected with high efficiency with the orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The collision gas applied was argon (4 × 10−5 mbar), and the collision voltage was approximately 30 V. CM-Sepharose and CAU-PAGE-purified proteins were analyzed using AU-PA slab gels (12.5% acrylamide, 5% acetic acid, 5m urea). After polymerization at 37 °C the gels were prerun in 5% acetic acid at 150 V until the current was constant (∼8 mA). Samples to be analyzed were lyophilyzed, dissolved in 8 μl of sample buffer (3 m urea in 5% acetic acid with methyl green as the tracking dye) and electrophorized in 5% acetic acid at 150 V with reversed polarity. Gels were either stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid or by silver staining according to Blum et al. (50.Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). Gels run in parallel were used in overlay assays to localize antibacterial proteins (see below). Gel overlay assays to detect activity of antibacterial proteins in acid urea gels were performed according to Lehrer et al. (51.Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S.L. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Meth. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The test strainEscherichia coli ML35 was grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB; Difco) at 37 °C overnight. This culture was diluted 50 times in fresh TSB, and bacteria were grown to log phase in 2.5 h. Bacteria were pelleted at 14,000 × g for 30 s and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). For each assay an inoculum of 5 × 107 colony-forming units was suspended in 15 ml of nutrient-poor agarose of 42 °C (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.06% (w/v) TSB, 1% (w/v) type I agarose; Sigma). This suspension was poured into a square 12 × 12-cm dish (Hospidex, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands). Immediately after electrophoresis, acid urea slab gels were washed three times for 12 min in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) and placed on top of the bacterial agarose bottom. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the gels were removed and a nutrient-rich agar (6% (w/v) TSB, 1% (w/v) agar noble; Difco) was poured over the bottom layer to allow growth of surviving bacteria. Clear zones after overnight incubation at 37 °C indicated the presence of antibacterial proteins. Microbicidal activity of purified thrombocidins and of NAP-2, CTAP-III, and PF-4 was quantified in a liquid microbicidal assay. Suspensions of logarithmically growing test bacteria (Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, E. coliML35, or S. aureus 42D) were prepared as described for the overlay assay. Two fungi, Candida glabrata andCryptococcus neoformans (both clinical isolates) were maintained on Isosensitest agar plates (Oxoid, Unipath, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and cultured for 48 h at 30 °C in 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (YNB; Difco), supplemented with 0.15% (w/v)l-asparagine (Merck) and 1% (w/v) glucose (Merck). Bacteria and fungi were diluted to 1–2 × 105colony-forming units/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) + 0.06% (w/v) TSB. 2-fold serial dilutions of the protein to be tested were prepared in 0.01% acetic acid, and 5-μl aliquots were transferred to a low protein binding polypropylene microtiter plate (Costar, Cambridge). To each of the wells, 45 μl of the bacterial suspension was added. The plate was incubated on a rotary shaker (300 rpm) at 37 °C. After 2 h, aliquots of 0.5 and 10 μl were plated on blood agar plates (bacteria) or isosensitest agar plates (fungi) and incubated at 37 °C. Alternatively, 10-μl aliquots were spotted in duplicate on plates that had been dried for 1 h at 37 °C. In some cases, 150 μl of TSB was added to the remainder of the incubations, and the microtiter plate was incubated at 37 °C. Microbicidal activity was assessed the next day (bacteria) or after 48 h (fungi) after counting colonies on the agar plates and by visual inspection of growth in the microtiter plates. MBC and MFC were defined as the concentration of protein at which <0.1% of the inoculum survived after the 2 h of exposure. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The influence of TCs on membrane potential was assessed using L. lactis IL 1403 (52.Marciset O. Jeronimus-Stratingh M.C. Mollet B. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This strain was grown at 30 °C in M17 broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 25 mmgalactose plus 50 mml-malate. The cells were harvested in the mid-exponential phase of growth and washed and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5 or 5.0). The membrane potential (Δψ) was measured using the Δψ-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3(5)). The cells were diluted to a final concentration of 20 μg of protein/ml in 50 mm KPi of the indicated pH and equilibrated at 30 °C; the final diS-C3(5) concentration was 3 μm. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 643 and 666 nm, respectively. The membrane potential was generated upon addition of either 25 mm of glucose or 25 mm of l-malate as source of metabolic energy. We used CM-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography followed by CAU-PAGE to purify the major antibacterial proteins from granule sonicate to homogeneity. Fractions obtained after CM-Sepharose chromatography were analyzed on two acid urea gels run in parallel. One gel was silver-stained (Fig.1 A), and the other was used to assay antibacterial activity in an overlay assay (Fig. 1 B). The antibacterial activity present in the crude granule sonicate (Fig.1, son lanes) was separated from the bulk of the protein (fraction 10) and eluted in fractions 35–75 in the salt gradient. The major antibacterial activity could be assigned to two proteins present in fractions 45–75 (Fig. 1 B). These fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against 0.1% HAc, lyophilized, and subjected to CAU-PAGE. Fractions were again analyzed on two acid urea gels run in parallel, one of which was silver-stained (Fig. 1 C) while the other was analyzed for antibacterial activity in an overlay assay (Fig. 1 D). Both crude granule sonicate and the CM-Sepharose-purified thrombocidins were included in this analysis. The CM-Sepharose-purified preparation appeared to contain two antibacterial proteins. The most cationic protein was designated as TC-1, and the second, slightly less cationic one was designated as TC-2. After CAU-PAGE these proteins were effectively separated, with TC-1 collected in fractions 35–41 and TC-2 in 45–51 (Fig. 1 C). In the AU gels, TC-1 and TC-2 migrate at positions identical to the main antibacterial activities in crude platelet sonicate (Fig. 1,C and D). TC-1 and TC-2 thus can be considered to be major antibacterial compounds in platelet granules. Processing of 1013 platelets (from 10 liters of blood) yielded approximately 750 μg of pure TC-1 and TC-2. Several attempts to determine the N-terminal sequence of TC-1 by Edman degradation were not successful. Mass spectrometrical techniques were used to elucidate the structure of TC-1. Analysis by MALDI spectrometry revealed that the purified TC-1 preparation contained a 7,435.9-Da protein, together with minor amounts of proteins of similar size (Table I). Electrospray spectrometry revealed a mass of 7,436.3 Da, confirming the mass of the major protein in the preparation, identified by MALDI. This component will further be referred to as TC-1. Sequence data were obtained by trypsin digestion of TC-1 followed by mass spectrometrical analyses in MS/MS mode of the resulting fragments. The sequences of two fragments, of 839.5 and 590.3 Da, were TTSGIHPK and LAGDES, respectively. These sequences were identical to internal sequences of platelet basic protein (PBP), a 10,262-Da platelet protein (Table I and Fig. 2). The mass of undigested TC-1 was less than that of PBP and even smaller than the smallest known degradation product of PBP, NAP-2 (7,623 Da). The difference of 186 Da can be explained by assuming that TC-1 is NAP-2, truncated C-terminally by two amino acids (Ala-Asp). The presence of a 590.3-Da C-terminal fragment, LAGDES, and the absence of a fragment with the mass of LAGDESAD in the tryptic digest of TC-1 confirm the C-terminal truncation.Table ICharacterization of thrombocidinsComponentExperimental molecular massesInternal sequence of PBP matching experimental molecular massesaAmino acid numbering of PBP as in Fig. 3.Theoretical molecular massesDaDaThrombocidin-1 Electrospray7436.3Ala25–Ser927437.5 Proteins in MALDI spectrumTC-17435.9Ala25–Ser927437.5TC-1abMinor component.7600.6Tyr24–Ser927600.7TC-1bbMinor component.7219.3Ala25–Asp907220.9TC-1cbMinor component.7106.2Ala25–Gly897105.8 Tryptic fragments839.5Thr34–Lys41839.5590.3Leu87–Ser92590.3Thrombocidin-2 Electrospray9100.5Asn10–Ser929101.5 Proteins in MALDI spectrumTC-29106Asn10–Ser929101.5TC-2abMinor component.10081Ser1–Se"
https://openalex.org/W1534406877,"The ERBB receptors have a crucial role in morphogenesis and oncogenesis. We have identified a new PDZ protein we named ERBIN (ERBB2 interacting protein) that acts as an adaptor for the receptor ERBB2/HER2 in epithelia. ERBIN contains 16 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in its amino terminus and a PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1) domain at its carboxy terminus, and belongs to a new PDZ protein family. The PDZ domain directly and specifically interacts with ERBB2/HER2. ERBIN and ERBB2/HER2 colocalize to the lateral membrane of human intestinal epithelial cells. The ERBIN-binding site in ERBB2/HER2 has a critical role in restricting this receptor to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, as mutation of the ERBIN-binding site leads to the mislocalization of the receptor in these cells. We suggest that ERBIN acts in the localization and signalling of ERBB2/HER2 in epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2060222319,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates multiple signaling events, including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38 in LPS-responsive cells, resulting in transcriptional activation and cytokine generation. LPS-induced signaling via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Since LPS activates other signaling cascades in responsive cells, the objective of this study was to determine whether such events are mediated by TLR4 in response to LPS. We generated human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) that stably express TLR4 (HEK-TLR4) and examined their responsiveness to LPS by measuring NF-kappaB activity and production of interleukin-8 (IL-8). A trans-reporting system was used to measure the activity of Elk-1, an ETS-domain transcription factor targeted by MAP kinase pathways. LPS stimulated NF-kappaB reporter activity and IL-8 production but not Elk-1 activity in HEK-TLR4 cells. When MD-2, a protein associated with the extracellular domain of TLR4, was expressed in these cells, there was a marked increase in Elk-1 activity as well as ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to LPS. TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB reporter activity and IL-8 production was enhanced by the expression of MD-2. This study demonstrates that expression of both TLR4 and MD-2 is required for LPS to activate or augment the MAP kinase pathways, Elk-1 stimulation, and IL-8 generation."
https://openalex.org/W1988954221,"We describe a novel protein, Syne-1, that is associated with nuclear envelopes in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Syne-1 contains multiple spectrin repeats similar to those found in dystrophin and utrophin, as well as a domain homologous to the carboxyl-terminal of Klarsicht, a protein associated with nuclei and required for a subset of nuclear migrations inDrosophila. In adult skeletal muscle fibers, levels of Syne-1 are highest in the nuclei that lie beneath the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. These nuclei are transcriptionally specialized, expressing genes for synaptic components at higher levels than extrasynaptic nuclei in the same cytoplasm. Syne-1 is the first protein found to be selectively associated with synaptic nuclei. Syne-1 becomes concentrated in synaptic nuclei postnatally. It remains synaptically enriched following denervation or degeneration/regeneration, and is also present at high levels in the central nuclei of dystrophic myotubes. The location and structure of Syne-1 suggest that it may participate in the migration of myonuclei in myotubes and/or their anchoring at the postsynaptic apparatus.

Finally, we identify a homologous gene, syne-2, that is expressed in an overlapping but distinct pattern. neuromuscular junction acetylcholine receptor dystrophin-glycoprotein complex muscle-specific kinase reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) amino acid(s) Skeletal muscle fibers are syncytial; in most mammalian skeletal muscles, each fiber contains several hundred myonuclei. Of these, a few are located beneath the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).1 Synaptic nuclei are specialized in several respects. First, multiple nuclei (generally 3–8) are invariably associated with synaptic sites. Because <1% of the muscle fiber surface is synaptic, one would expect only a minority of synaptic sites to be associated with even a single nucleus if nuclear distribution were random. Second, most nuclei are well separated from their neighbors, but synaptic nuclei occur in tight clusters. Third, synaptic nuclei are larger and rounder than extrasynaptic nuclei (1Couteaux R. Bourne G.H. Structure and Function of Muscle. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 483-530Google Scholar, 2Zack S. The Motor Endplate. Krieger, New York1973Google Scholar, 3Brosamle C. Kuffler D.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2359-2367PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, synaptic nuclei are transcriptionally specialized; they express genes for several synaptic proteins, including subunits of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), at levels far higher than those of extrasynaptic nuclei in the same cytoplasm (4Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Burden S.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 12-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Moscoso L.M. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a result, mRNAs for synaptic proteins are concentrated in synaptic areas, allowing local synthesis of synaptic constituents. This local synthesis has been of considerable interest to neurobiologists, because it contributes to postsynaptic differentiation, and because it may serve as a model for central synapses, in which some components of dendritic spines are thought to be synthesized within the spine itself (7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The formation of the postsynaptic apparatus, including the accumulation and specialization of synaptic nuclei, is controlled by the nerve. One critical nerve-derived signal is the proteoglycan agrin which is required for all aspects of postsynaptic differentiation, including transcriptional specialization of synaptic nuclei (8McMahan U.J.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A critical component of the agrin receptor is the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), which is concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane (11Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. LeBeau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancoupulos G.D.

Little is known, however, about how activation of MuSK leads to postsynaptic differentiation, or how agrin interacts with other signals such as neuregulins, which have been implicated in induction of AChR gene expression in synaptic nuclei (15Fischbach G.D. Rosen K.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). With the aims of identifying novel components of the postsynaptic apparatus and gaining insight into mechanisms of postsynaptic differentiation, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to seek proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of MuSK. In this paper, we describe one protein identified in this screen, synaptic nuclear envelope-1 (Syne-1), and its homologue, Syne-2. Remarkably, Syne-1 is selectively associated with synaptic nuclei. Its location and structure raise the possibility that Syne-1 might be involved in the formation or maintenance of nuclear aggregates at the neuromuscular junction. Two-hybrid screening was performed in the HF7c yeast strain, which harbors two reporter genes,HIS3 and β-gal, under the control of GAL4-binding sites. We generated a “bait” vector by fusing the intracellular domain of rat MuSK (11Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. LeBeau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancoupulos G.D.

This vector was used to screen 4 × 106 clones from a library in which cDNAs from embryonic day (E) 17 mouse embryos were fused to the GAL4-activation domain of vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Sixty-one positive colonies were detected based on β-galactosidase activity and growth in the absence of histidine. Plasmids containing positive cDNAs were rescued bytrp selection in HB101 bacteria and sequenced. Twenty were discarded because they contained open reading frames that were very short or in the wrong orientation. The remaining 41 positives represented 20 different gene products. One 2.1-kb cDNA isolated from the yeast 2-hybrid library, called C-15, had an open reading frame over its entire sequence. To obtain additional sequence, nested PCR primers corresponding to C-15 and vector sequences were used to amplify cDNAs from the yeast 2-hybrid library and from a C2 muscle cell line plasmid library (provided by David Glass, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals). Other clones were obtained by RT-PCR of poly(A) selected RNA from E17 embryos and muscle of postnatal day (P) 2 mice, and by screening a mouse heart λ gt11 library (CLONTECH). Clones were sequenced in their entirety, and the identity of each nucleotide was confirmed by sequencing two or more independently obtained clones. Sequence motifs were detected using PFAM and SMART programs (16Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from mouse tissues and cells was fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane (Dupont). A Northern blot containing RNA samples from multiple human tissues was purchased fromCLONTECH. Blots were probed with32P-labeled cDNAs (random primed DNA labeling kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For PCR, cDNA samples from fetal and adult human tissues (Multiple Tissue cDNA panels; CLONTECH) were amplified using primers corresponding to human syne-1 andsyne-2 sequences. Sequences are: syne-1 (forward), 5′-CTGGAGTCTGCAATGTCCAGAGC; syne-1 (reverse), 5′-GCAGGTTAACAAAGCCAGGAAGGC; syne-2 (forward), 5′-CTCCTCTCACGAAGAGGACGAGG; syne-2 (reverse), 5′-CTGTGGGTTGCCATTCAGGACTCG. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers, supplied by CLONTECH, were used as a positive control. The quail fibroblast cell line QT-6 and the mouse muscle cell line Sol 8 were maintained as described by Apel et al. (17Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and Chu et al.(18Chu G.C. Moscoso L.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Merlie J.P.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), as modified by Phillips et al. (20Phillips W.D. Maimone M.m. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). QT-6 cells were transfected at approximately 75% confluency 1 day after plating, then harvested 2 days after transfection for immunoprecipitation experiments. For immunofluorescence staining, QT6-cells were plated onto glass coverslips (13 mm diameter) in 35-mm tissue culture dishes, transfected 1 day later, and fixed and stained 2 days after transfection. Sol 8 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips and transfected 1 day later. For studies of myoblasts, cells were plated at 50–100,000 cells per culture, then fixed and stained 2–3 days later. To study myotubes, 400,000 cells were plated, then serum levels were reduced (from 10% fetal calf serum to 2% horse serum) 2 days later to promote the fusion of myoblasts to myotubes. Cultures were fixed and stained 2–3 days later, when myotubes were abundant. In some experiments, a recombinant carboxyl-terminal fragment of agrin (21Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was added to myotubes 4–8 h prior to fixation to induce AChR clustering. A segment of mouse syne-1B corresponding to amino acids 948–1322 was expressed in bacteria. Purified protein was obtained by preparative gel electrophoresis of inclusion bodies and used to immunize two rabbits. Serum from both rabbits showed immunoreactivity to the antigen, but not to an unrelated recombinant protein generated in the same vector, when analyzed by immunoblotting. For some experiments, antibodies were affinity purified from the serum by absorption to and elution from recombinant syne-1 that had been immobilized on nitrocellulose. Transfected QT-6 cells were lysed and solubilized in saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the soluble extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the FLAG epitope (M2, Sigma). FLAG-tagged and associated proteins were isolated by binding to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), then subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies to MuSK (11Valenzuela D.M.

For routine immunohistochemical staining, tissues were frozen unfixed in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and sectioned in a cryostat at 8 μm. Cross-sections of muscle (tibialis anterior except as noted) were incubated with anti-Syne-1 for 2–4 h, then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were then incubated for 1 h with a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin, and the DNA binding dye 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole. Slides were than rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted withpara-phenylenediamine to retard fading, and viewed with a compound fluorescent microscope. Muscles were denervated by cutting the sciatic nerve in anesthetized mice in one leg with the contralateral leg serving as a control. For confocal microscopy, sternomastoid muscles were dissected, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, equilibrated with sucrose, frozen, and sectioned longitudinally at 40 μm. Sections were stained as described above and viewed with an Olympus confocal microscope. QT-6 cells on glass coverslips were fixed and immunostained as described by Apel et al. (17Apel E.D.

Sol 8 cells on glass coverslips were processed in the same manner, except that rinsing solution and fixative were warmed to 37 °C before being added to the cells. To identify novel components of the postsynaptic apparatus at the NMJ, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. A bait was generated by fusing the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 to the cytoplasmic domain of MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane (11Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. LeBeau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J.

Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The bait was used to screen a library prepared from fetal (E17) mice. Clones obtained in this screen were re-tested with each of four unrelated baits: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone, or the domain fused to lamin C, p53, or the intracellular domain of the Kv2.1 potassium channel. All positives interacted only with the MuSK-GAL 4 fusion demonstrating specificity of binding to the MuSK cytoplasmic domain (data not shown). In this paper, we focus on the gene initially identified by cDNA C-15 and later renamed synaptic nuclear envelope-1 (syne-1) for reasons described below. Proteins capable of interacting in yeast might not actually be coexpressed in vivo. Because our aim was to identify components of the NMJ, we first used Northern analysis to ask whether genes identified in our screen were expressed in skeletal muscle. RNA was prepared from several adult tissues and from postnatal day (P) 2 limb muscle and brain. C-15 hybridized to an RNA of ∼4.7 kb in skeletal and cardiac muscles, but in no other tissues tested. A ∼10-kb C-15 reactive RNA was also present in numerous tissues (Fig.1 and see below). To determine which sequences corresponded to each RNA species, we probed Northern blots with short segments of the 2.1-kb C-15 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2 a, C-15 contained common sequences at its 3′ end and ∼10-kb specific sequences at its 5′ end. This pattern suggested that C-15 was derived from the ∼10-kb RNA, and that the two RNAs have distinct 5′ termini, which might arise either by alternative splicing or from separate promoters. To obtain ∼4.7-kb specific sequence, we used the 5′-most common sequences to probe cDNA libraries from embryos, skeletal muscle, and heart. One cDNA obtained from this screen contained 233 base pairs of ∼4.7-kb specific sequence. Other cDNAs recovered an additional 1.8 of ∼10-kb specific sequence, and still others extended the 3′ common sequence by 2.3 kb to a termination codon and putative 3′-untranslated region.Figure 1Northern analysis of syne-1 expression in tissues from neonatal (P2) and adult mice. A ∼10-kb RNA, presumably encoding Syne-1B, is detectable in multiple tissues. A ∼4.7-kb RNA, presumably encoding Syne-1A, is detectable only in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

This analysis revealed that Synes-1A and -1B have common 3′ sequences but distinct 5′ sequences.b, primary sequence of Syne-1A, encoded by the ∼4.7-kb RNA. c, partial sequence of Syne-1B, encoded by the ∼10-kb RNA.

Genbank accession numbers for mouse Syne-1A and Syne-1B are AF281869 and AF281870, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, the cDNAs we obtained encode at least 3 proteins (Fig. 2, b andc). The first is encoded by the ∼4.7-kb RNA. It is 949 aa long, comprising 30 aa of ∼4.7-kb specific sequence and 919 aa of common sequence. The open reading frame begins with a methionine that is embedded in a consensus Kozak sequence and preceded by stop codons in all three frames. We refer to this form as Syne-1A. The second deduced protein is encoded by the ∼10-kb RNA, and consists of >1989 aa, comprising >1070 aa of ∼10-kb specific sequence plus the 919 aa of common sequence. We refer to this form as Syne-1B. We have not yet cloned the 5′ end of the RNA that encodes Syne-1B. Finally, one cDNA that contained sequences common to Syne-1A and -1B lacked a 174-base pair stretch within the open reading frame. RNAs containing this sequence, which presumably arose by alternative splicing, would encode proteins lacking 58 aa in full-length forms. The position of this deletion is indicated in the Syne-1A sequence (Fig.2 b), but we do not know whether the resulting transcript is a variant of Syne-1A, Syne-1B or both. Analysis of the deduced Syne-1 sequence revealed two noteworthy features. The first, and more striking, was the presence of multiple “spectrin repeats” (22Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 23Pascual J. Castresana J. Saraste M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These ∼100-aa long domains were first described in the cytoskeletal protein, spectrin; they have subsequently been found in numerous rod-shaped proteins that are components of or associated with the cytoskeleton. These include homologues of spectrin, such as fodrin; dystrophin and its homologue, utrophin (24Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Kunkel L.M. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); protein kinase A-associated protein; α-actinin; theDrosophila protein Kakapo; and its mammalian orthologue, ACF7/MACF/macrophin/trabeculin-α (25Leung C.L. Sun D. Zheng M. Knowles D.R. Liem R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Okuda T. Matsuda S. Nakatsugawa S. Ichigotani Y. Iwahashi N. Takahashi M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33522-33530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Syne-1B contains 15 spectrin repeats, of these, the final 6 are present in Syne-1A. Because our Syne-1B sequence is incomplete, and spectrin repeats extend to the 5′ end of the known sequence, additional repeats may be present in the full-length protein. Seven of the repeats are most closely related to those in dystrophin or utrophin. The others are most closely related to those in protein kinase A-associated protein, spectrin or Kakapo/ACF7; in these cases, however, dystrophin or utrophin is the second closest relative. Thus, on the whole, the closest previously characterized relatives of Syne-1 are dystrophin and utrophin. The carboxyl-terminal 60 aa of Syne-1 show a significant homology (41% identity, 58% similarity) to the carboxyl terminus of aDrosophila protein called Klarsicht (28Welte M.A. Gross S.P. Postner M. Block S.M. Wieschaus E.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 547-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29Mosley-Bishop K.L. Li Q. Patterson L. Fischer J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1211-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This protein, which is otherwise devoid of recognizable motifs, is associated with nuclei in photoreceptors cells of flies. The similarity between Klarsicht and Syne-1 is modest in extent, but may be biologically significant in view of the nuclear localization of Syne-1 and the sequence of its homologues, described below. We generated antisera to a bacterially produced fragment of Syne-1, then used the affinity purified antibodies to determine the subcellular localization of Syne-1. The fragment included 267 aa common to Synes-1A and -1B, and would therefore be expected to recognize both forms. When applied to cryostat sections of adult mouse skeletal muscle, anti-Syne-1 stained small elliptical structures that lay just beneath the plasma membrane of muscle fibers (Fig.3 a). The size, shape, and subsarcolemmal location of these structures suggested that they were myonuclei. This identity was confirmed by double staining with the DNA-binding dye, 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole. High magnification views suggested that Syne-1 is associated with the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3, c and c′). Syne-1 was also associated with nuclei in cardiac myocytes (Fig.3 b) and in smooth muscle cells associated with intramuscular arterioles (Fig. 3 d). On the other hand, nuclei were Syne-negative in a variety of non-muscle cells found within cardiac and skeletal muscles, including fibroblasts, glial (Schwann) cells of intramuscular nerves, or the cells of capillaries and venules (Fig.3 e and data not shown). Likewise, only faint cytoplasmic staining was observed in adult brain and kidney or in embryonic tissues other than muscles (data not shown). Thus Syne-1 is associated with nuclei in muscles of all three lineages (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac) but not in non-muscle cell types tested to date. As described under the Introduction, the few myonuclei apposed to the postsynaptic membrane at the NMJ are morphologically and functionally specialized. All myonuclei were faintly Syne-1-positive in adult skeletal muscles, but a small subset were stained far more intensely than the others (arrows in Fig. 3 a). Because Syne-1 was isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with a synaptic protein, MuSK, we wondered whether the intensely stained nuclei were synaptic. To test this possibility, we double-stained sections with anti-Syne-1 plus rhodamine α-bungarotoxin, a toxin that binds tightly and specifically to AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane. The brightest Syne-1-positive nuclei in each section were invariably associated with synaptic sites (Fig.4 a). Confocal microscopy of double-labeled longitudinal sections confirmed that clusters of synaptic nuclei were intensely Syne-1-positive, whereas nearby nuclei in the same myofibers were only faintly Syne-positive (Fig. 4,b and c). Perisynaptic nuclei (those near to synapses) did not exhibit an intermediate level of staining, but rather resembled other extrasynaptic nuclei in their apparent level of Syne-1 immunoreactivity. Synapse-associated myonuclei become transcriptionally specialized by E15, soon after synapses form (30Piette J. Huchet M. Houzelstein D. Changeux J.P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 123-205Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Missias A.C. Chu G.C. Klocke B.J. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and nuclear clusters form beneath the postsynaptic apparatus soon after birth (32Moss B.L. Schuetze S.M. J. Neurobiol. 1987; 18: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As a first step in determining whether Syne-1 might be involved in either of these developmental steps, we asked when Syne-1 became associated with synaptic and extrasynaptic nuclei. At E15, P0, and P7 all myonuclei were Syne-1 positive, but synaptic nuclei did not stain more intensely than extrasynaptic nuclei (Fig.5 a and data not shown). Some enrichment of Syne-1 in synaptic nuclei was evident by P14, and by the end of the first postnatal month, synaptic nuclei appeared richer in Syne-1 than any extrasynaptic nuclei in the same muscle fibers (Fig.5 b and data not shown). Thus high levels of Syne-1 are not required for transcriptional specialization or aggregation of synaptic nuclei, but might be involved in the maintenance of their specialized characteristics. In embryos, Syne-1 appeared to be associated with nuclei of myotubes but not of myoblasts. However, distinction between these two cell types is difficult in cryostat sections. We therefore stained cultured myoblasts and myotubes of the myogenic cell line, Sol 8. Sol 8 myoblasts proliferate in rich medium, but fuse to form myotubes following withdrawal of serum (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nuclei in myotubes were clearly Syne-1 positive, whereas Syne-1 was barely detectable in nuclei of myoblasts (Fig. 5, d ande). Thus, Syne-1 may be up-regulated as or soon after myotubes form. Although the entire postsynaptic apparatus is organized by signals emanating from the motor nerve, some postsynaptic specializations are lost within days following denervation, whereas others are stable for weeks to months (reviewed in Ref. 7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). To ask whether the selective association of Syne-1 with synaptic nuclei requires the continuous presence of the nerve, we stained muscles 3, 7, or 14 days following denervation. At all intervals, synaptic nuclei remained significantly richer in Syne-1 than extrasynaptic nuclei (Fig. 5 c and data not shown). Genetic and biochemical studies in mice have shown that the tyrosine kinase MuSK and the AChR-associated protein rapsyn are required for formation of the postsynaptic apparatus. No detectable synaptic differentiation occurs in the absence of MuSK (14DeChiara T.M. Bo"

In the present study, we provide evidence that the small GTPase Rac1 is activated in a type I IFN-dependent manner and that its function is required for downstream engagement of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. We also demonstrate that p38 is required for IFNα-dependent gene transcription via GAS elements and regulates activation of the promoter of the PML gene that mediates growth inhibitory responses. In studies to determine whether the regulatory effects of p38 are mediated by serine phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat3, we found that the p38 kinase inhibitors SB203580 or SB202190 or overexpression of a dominant negative p38 mutant do not inhibit phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat3 on Ser-727 in several IFNα-sensitive cell lines. Altogether these data demonstrate that the Rac1/p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade plays a critical role in type I IFN signaling, functioning in cooperation with the Stat-pathway, to regulate transcriptional regulation of IFNα-sensitive genes and generation of growth inhibitory responses. The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is activated during engagement of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor and mediates signals essential for IFNα-dependent transcriptional activation via interferon-stimulated response elements without affecting formation of the ISGF3 complex. In the present study, we provide evidence that the small GTPase Rac1 is activated in a type I IFN-dependent manner and that its function is required for downstream engagement of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. We also demonstrate that p38 is required for IFNα-dependent gene transcription via GAS elements and regulates activation of the promoter of the PML gene that mediates growth inhibitory responses. In studies to determine whether the regulatory effects of p38 are mediated by serine phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat3, we found that the p38 kinase inhibitors SB203580 or SB202190 or overexpression of a dominant negative p38 mutant do not inhibit phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat3 on Ser-727 in several IFNα-sensitive cell lines. Altogether these data demonstrate that the Rac1/p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade plays a critical role in type I IFN signaling, functioning in cooperation with the Stat-pathway, to regulate transcriptional regulation of IFNα-sensitive genes and generation of growth inhibitory responses.

These pathways are regulated by the activated Tyk-2 and Jak-1 kinases, which are constitutively associated with the two subunits of the type I interferon receptor and are activated during IFNα or IFNβ stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 1Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The activated Jak kinases regulate downstream engagement of multiple Stat proteins that form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription via binding to specific elements in the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5020) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The first characterized IFNα-activated Stat signaling pathway was that involving ISGF3, which is dependent on the formation of heterodimers between Stat1 and Stat2 and their association with a member of the IFN regulatory factor family, p48 (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5020) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The resulting ISGF3 complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of ISGs (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5020) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). In addition, several other Stat proteins are involved in IFNα signaling. Stat1 and Stat3 homo- and heterodimers, as well as homodimers of Stat4, Stat5a, and Stat5b, bind palindromic sequences found in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes to activate transcription (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and forms heterodimers with Stat5 that translocate to the nucleus and bind to GAS elements in the promoters of certain IFN-stimulated genes (7Fish E.N.

In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, which is required for translocation to the nucleus and DNA binding, serine phosphorylation is essential for full transcriptional activation of Stat proteins (8Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 28: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 9Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Specifically, Ser-727 is located in the C terminus of Stat-1 in a consensus motif for a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and its phosphorylation is essential for transcriptional activation in response to IFNγ and the generation of IFNγ responses (8Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 28: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 9Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to tyrosine kinases, serine kinases play important roles in the regulation of IFN-dependent gene transcription and ultimately the generation of the biological effects of interferons. Despite significant advances in identifying the functional roles of tyrosine kinases activated by the type I interferon receptor, much less is known regarding the serine kinases activated by interferons and their function in type I IFN-signaling cascades. Previous studies have established that the serine kinase phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is activated downstream of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor substrate-2 multisite docking proteins (11Uddin S.

Uddin S. Yetter A. Sun X.-J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 278-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and does not play a role in the activation of the ISGF3 complex and transcriptional regulation of genes that contain ISREs in their promoters (13Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the p44 map kinase (Erk2) is activated during engagement of the type I interferon receptor (15David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence to date that it regulates serine phosphorylation of Stat proteins. Recently, the p38 MAP kinase, which is activated in response to stress (16Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar, 17Lee J.C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that an IFNα-regulated signaling cascade is activated downstream of p38, involving the MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 serine kinases (27Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the small G-protein Rac1 is activated in an IFNα-dependent manner, suggesting that it is as an upstream regulator of the IFNα-dependent p38 pathway. We also demonstrate that, in addition to regulation of transcription via ISREs, p38 is required for IFNα-gene transcription via GAS elements and regulates the promoter of the IFN-inducible PML gene that mediates growth inhibitory responses. However, neither the serine kinase activity of p38 itself nor the downstream MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 kinases regulate phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat3 on Ser-727, demonstrating that the regulatory effects of p38 occur via a mechanism distinct from serine phosphorylation of Stats. The Daudi (lymphoblastoid), KG-1 (acute myeloid leukemia) and Molt-4 (acute T-cell leukemia) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line was grown in McCoy medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human recombinant IFNα2 was provided by Hoffmann LaRoche. Human recombinant consensus IFNα was provided by Amgen Inc. Human recombinant IFNβ was provided by Biogen Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 were purchased from Calbiochem Inc. Antibodies against the phosphorylated form of Stat1 on serine 727 (anti-Stat1Ser-727) and the phosphorylated form of Stat3 (anti-Stat3Ser-727) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology.

Cells were stimulated with 1 × 104 units/ml of the indicated interferons for the indicated times and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer as described previously (11Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.-J.

Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and a luciferase reporter gene containing eight GAS elements linked to a minimal prolactin promoter (8×GAS) using the superfect transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). The 8×GAS construct (29Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml IFNα. In the experiments in which the effects of overexpression of a mutant p38 were determined, the cells were transfected with a mutated dominant-negative p38 DNA, subcloned in the pCMV5 vector (pCMV-p38AGF) (Ref. 31Derijard B.

The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and, after cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. Genomic DNA affinity chromatography using cell extracts from untreated or IFNα-treated cells, in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580, was performed essentially as described previously (32Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear extracts from untreated or IFNα-treated cells, were analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, as described previously (32Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. Colamonici O.R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 2574-2582PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ATTTCCCGTAAATCCC), representing a Sis-inducing element of the c-fos promoter, was synthesized and used in gel shift assays. The activation of Rac1 by IFNα was determined using a recently described methodology (34Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the pGEX-4T3 construct encoding for the GTPase binding domain of human Pak1 (34Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) was expressed inEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein (GST-PBD). The cells were treated with the indicated IFNs and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. In some experiments, the cells were starved for 2 h prior to interferon treatment. Cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST-PBD, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 (New England Biolabs), to detect GTP-bound Rac1. We initially sought to obtain information on the mechanisms of activation of the p38 MAP kinase during engagement of the type I IFN receptor. We first determined whether tyrosine kinase activity is required for activation of the p38 MAP kinase by type I IFNs. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the phosphorylation/activation of p38 in response to treatment of cells with IFNα was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, genistein abrogated the IFNα-induced activation of p38, while there was no change in the amount of the p38 protein in cells either left untreated or treated with the inhibitor (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, pretreatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, had no effect on the activation of the p38, indicating that engagement of p38 occurs independently of the activation of the PI 3-kinase by the type I IFN receptor (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, engagement of the p38 MAP kinase by the type I IFN receptor requires the function of upstream tyrosine kinases, most likely the receptor-associated Tyk-2 and/or Jak-1 kinases. The IFN-regulated PI 3-kinase pathway (11Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.-J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15938-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Yetter A. Sun X.-J. White M.F. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar) plays no role in p38 activation by type I IFNs. Rac1 is a small G-protein, which initiates a cascade that regulates activation of the p38 pathway in response to stress (35Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M.

We sought to determine whether this small G-protein is engaged in IFN signaling to regulate phosphorylation/activation of p38. We used a recently described methodology (34Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), in which the extent of Rac1 activation is determined by its ability to associate with the GTPase binding domain of the Pak1 kinase, which is its downstream effector. Cells were treated with IFNα or IFNβ, and lysates were bound to a GST fusion protein encoding for the GTPase binding domain of Pak1. The activated form of Rac1 was subsequently detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Rac1 antibody. IFNα or IFNβ treatment of cells induced activation of Rac1 (Fig. 2, Aand B), strongly suggesting that this small GTPase is engaged in a type I IFN signaling pathway to regulate downstream activation of Pak1 and p38 (35Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 36Frost J.A. Xu S.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar). Time-course studies demonstrated that the type I IFN-dependent activation of Rac1 was rapid, occurring within 1 min of type I IFN treatment, and persisted for at least 60 min (Fig. 2 C). In addition, as in the case of p38 phosphorylation, the type I IFN-dependent activation of Rac1 was blocked by pretreatment of cells with genistein (Fig.2 D), indicating that the function of an upstream tyrosine kinase (s) is required for its activation. We subsequently determined if the function of Rac1 is required for downstream activation of p38 by type I IFNs. We determined whether overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 abrogates activation of p38 by IFNα. Cells were transfected with either control empty vector (pCDNA3) or the pCDNA3-Rac1(T17N) construct, and after treatment with IFNα, the phosphorylation/activation of p38 was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, the dominant negative form of Rac1 inhibited the IFN-dependent activation of p38, establishing that its function is required for IFN-dependent p38 activation. Thus, Rac1 is activated during treatment of cells with IFNα to regulate downstream engagement of the p38 pathway by the type I IFN receptor. To further understand the functional role of the p38 pathway in IFN signaling, we determined whether inhibition of the activity of p38 blocks IFNα-induced transcriptional activation via GAS elements in luciferase reporter assays. We first examined the effect of SB203580, a p38-specific kinase inhibitor, on such IFNα-dependent transcriptional regulation. IFN-sensitive U2OS cells were transfected with a plasmid containing an 8×GAS luciferase construct and treated with IFNα in the presence or absence of the SB203580 inhibitor. As expected, IFNα treatment induced high levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 4 A), while treatment of cells with SB203580 significantly decreased such an induction (Fig.4 A). We then measured IFNα-dependent luciferase activity in U2OS cells transiently transfected with a p38 kinase mutant that cannot undergo phosphorylation/activation (p38AGF), as the tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation sites have been substituted (31Derijard B.

As shown in Fig. 4 B, overexpression of p38AGF blocked the IFNα-induced increase in luciferase activity, establishing that a functional p38 kinase is essential for transcriptional regulation via GAS elements. We next determined whether the dominant-negative p38 mutant has the ability to block transcriptional activation of the promoter of the PML gene, which contains both ISRE and GAS elements (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H.M. Nenturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.-C. Schindler C. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar). This was of particular interest, as PML is an IFNα-inducible gene known to mediate growth inhibitory responses (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H.M. Nenturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.-C. Schindler C. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows that, consistent with previous studies (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H.M. Nenturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.-C. Schindler C. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar), IFNα treatment induced strong luciferase activity in assays using the PromPML1.44-Luc construct and that such IFNα-dependent promoter activity was strongly inhibited by overexpression of the dominant-negative p38 mutant. We have previously shown that inhibition of the p38 pathway blocks ISRE-dependent gene transcription without affecting tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of Stat1 and Stat2, which along with p48, form the active ISGF3 complex (27Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We determined whether inhibition of the p38 pathway blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-3 and/or Stat5 that participate in the formation of complexes that regulate gene transcription via GAS elements, as well as the formation of DNA-binding complexes that contain these Stat proteins. We first determined whether treatment of cells with the SB203580 inhibitor blocks IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of SB203580 and IFNα, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Stat3, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment of cells with SB203580 did not affect the IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. In a similar manner, when the effect of SB203580 on the IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 was studied, we found that SB203580 does not abrogate such phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). We subsequently determined whether inhibition of p38 activation has any effects on IFNα-dependent DNA binding of Stat3 and/or Stat5. In studies in which the IFNα-dependent DNA binding of Stat3 or Stat5 was evaluated using GDAC, we found that pretreatment of cells with the SB203580 inhibitor had no effect on Stat3 or Stat5 DNA binding (Fig. 5, C and D). In a similar manner, when U2OS cells were transfected with the pCMV-p38AGF construct and the formation of SIF complexes in response to IFNα treatment was determined, we found that there was no inhibition of SIF complex formation by overexpression of the dominant negative p38 (Fig.5 E), despite the fact that very high levels of mutant p38 expression are achievable in these cells (Fig. 5 F), consistent with our previous report (27Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A question of considerable interest is whether the p38 MAP kinase, or a serine kinase activated downstream of it, mediate phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727, which has been previously shown to be"

The catalytic proficiency of this enzyme for the reverse reaction, pyruvate synthase, is poorly understood. Conversion of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate links the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of autotrophic CO2 fixation to the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, which in these autotrophic anaerobes is the stage for biosynthesis of all cellular macromolecules. The results described here demonstrate that the Clostridium thermoaceticum PFOR is a highly efficient pyruvate synthase. The Michaelis-Menten parameters for pyruvate synthesis by PFOR are: V max = 1.6 unit/mg (k cat = 3.2 s−1), KmAcetyl-CoA = 9 μm, and KmCO2 = 2 mm. The intracellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA, CoASH, and pyruvate have been measured. The predicted rate of pyruvate synthesis at physiological concentrations of substrates clearly is sufficient to support the role of PFOR as a pyruvate synthase in vivo. Measurements of itsk cat/K m values demonstrate that ferredoxin is a highly efficient electron carrier in both the oxidative and reductive reactions. On the other hand, rubredoxin is a poor substitute in the oxidative direction and is inept in donating electrons for pyruvate synthesis.

In many anaerobic organisms, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR)1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to CO2 and acetyl-CoA (Reaction 1) (2Menon S. Ragsdale S.W.

In anaerobic acetogenic bacteria, 2 moles of CO2 generated from the decarboxylation of 2 moles of pyruvate are reduced to another mol of acetyl-CoA in an autotrophic biosynthetic scheme known as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (7Ragsdale S.W.

The reverse reaction, carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, is an important reaction for anaerobes like methanogens and acetogens that fix CO2 by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (10Simpson P.G. Whitman W.B.

In this case, PFOR (pyruvate synthase) links the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to the incomplete reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, which generates biosynthetic intermediates.Pyruvate+CoASH→Acetyl­SCoA+CO2+2H++2e−REACTION 1 CO+H2O→CO2+2H++2e−REACTION 2 PFORs can be homo- (14Wahl R.C.

The PFOR from Clostridium thermoaceticum is a 240-kDa homodimer, with two [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ clusters and one thiamin pyrophosphate/subunit (2Menon S. Ragsdale S.W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10489-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) The two electrons generated by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate are transferred to an 8-iron ferredoxin (or possibly other electron carriers, see below) that in turn can reduce a variety of cellular enzymes. This electron pair can also be transferred directly to CODH, which reduces CO2 to CO, an intermediate in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12119-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The PFOR reaction has been most extensively studied in the forward (oxidative decarboxylation) direction beginning with a series of seminal studies published in 1971 (21Uyeda K. Rabinowitz J.C. J.

They also demonstrated that low potential electron donors, like reduced ferredoxin, can drive the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (24Raeburn S. Rabinowitz J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 2At that time it was not clear whether acetyl-CoA was the substrate, so they used acetyl-phosphate in the presence of CoA and phosphotransacetylase. Subsequently, few studies of the pyruvate synthase activity have been published. Can PFOR also serve as a pyruvate synthase? A PFOR has been isolated from the methanogenic archaea, Methanosarcina barkeri (18Bock A.K. Schonheit P. Teixeira M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (25Tersteegen A. Linder D. Thauer R.K. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These enzymes must function in anabolic reactions, because methanogens cannot grow on substrates with a more complex structure than acetate. The M. barkeri enzyme was shown to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA with ferredoxin as an electron carrier (26Bock A.K. Kunow J. Glasemacher J. Schonheit P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequences of the methanogenic enzymes are closely related to those of the PFORs fromPyrococus furiosus and Thermotoga maritima (25Tersteegen A. Linder D. Thauer R.K. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,26Bock A.K. Kunow J. Glasemacher J. Schonheit P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which function in a catabolic direction (27Blamey J.M. Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, these combined studies indicate that the same enzyme (PFOR) functions physiologically in either direction. This conclusion is supported by the finding that under some conditions, methanogens can grow, albeit poorly, on pyruvate (28Rajagopal B.S. LeGall J. Curr. Microbiol. 1994; 28: 307-311Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Bock A.-K. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2002-2007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yoon et al. (37Yoon K.S. Hille R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have also studied the pyruvate synthase reaction of the PFOR from Chloribium tepidum. The results described above support the hypothesis that PFOR and pyruvate synthase are the same enzyme. However, the reverse reaction of PFOR has been scantily studied and several examples exist of distinct enzymes catalyzing forward or reverse reactions. For example, fumarate reductase and succinate dehydrogenase preferentially catalyze opposing reactions (30Hirst J. Sucheta A. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5031-5038Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Hirst J. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7434-7439Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and are separately regulated and distinct gene products (32Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hirsch C.A. Rasminsky M. Davis B.D. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3770-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many organisms, H+ reduction and H2 oxidation are catalyzed by separate enzymes with the converse catalytic biases (34Pershad H.R. Duff J.L. Heering H.A. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8992-8999Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 35Butt J.N. Filipiak M. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Can PFOR serve as an efficient pyruvate synthase or is it prejudiced toward oxidative decarboxylation? One test of its catalytic bias is to compare the specificity factor (V/K) for the two opposing reactions. Another test is to determine the relative rates of the opposite reactions at physiological substrate concentrations. A significant catalytic preference in one direction would suggest that PFOR and pyruvate synthase might be separate enzymes. The difficulty in studying pyruvate synthesis from acetyl-CoA and CO2 is that a sufficiently strong electron donor must be coupled to drive this energetically demanding reaction, with a reduction potential below −540 mV. In the work reported here, we have coupled pyruvate synthesis to CO oxidation by CO dehydrogenase (Reaction 2 and Scheme FS1), which has a similarly low reduction potential (36Lindahl P.A. Münck E. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If PFOR and pyruvate synthase are the same enzyme, one conceivable way to regulate the metabolic direction of pyruvate metabolism is for PFOR/pyruvate synthase to use a high potential electron acceptor in the oxidative direction and a separate low potential donor in the reductive direction. For example, in the fumarate reductase and succinate dehydrogenase systems, the low potential donor menaquinol is a better substrate for fumarate reduction; whereas, ubiquinone, which has a higher midpoint potential, preferentially couples to succinate (32Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We do not yet know which electron acceptor(s) are most efficient in the PFOR and pyruvate synthase reactions. Because rubredoxin rapidly accepts electrons from PFOR, it was proposed to be the physiological electron acceptor for the oxidative decarboxylation reaction, whereas reduced ferredoxin was designated as the electron donor for the synthase reaction (37Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the kinetic parameters for the substrates and electron donors/acceptors in each direction were not rigorously studied leaving some questions about electron carrier specificity unanswered. Furthermore, the electron carrier specificity may be different in different organisms. C. thermoaceticum is an interesting model system for studying PFOR because the oxidative decarboxylation and reductive carboxylation reactions are essential for heterotrophic and autotrophic growth, respectively, of this organism. We recently characterized and defined the rate constants for the elementary steps in the C. thermoaceticum PFOR reaction (2Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8484-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of substrates (k cat conditions), the synthase reaction was predicted to be ∼10-fold faster than the reverse reaction; however, the synthase reaction was not studied directly. Furthermore, the intracellular concentrations of the substrates and products of the PFOR reaction in C. thermoaceticum have not been determined; thus, the relative rates of the opposing reactions at physiological concentrations of substrates are unknown. Whether PFOR is an efficient pyruvate synthase for autotrophic acetogens thus remains an unanswered question. In the work reported here, we focused on several questions. What are the values of k cat andk cat/K m for the reverse reaction? Are these values consistent with a physiological function for PFOR in pyruvate synthesis? As a low potential electron donor, CO oxidation could conceivably provide sufficient strength to drive pyruvate synthesis. How effectively does the C. thermoaceticum pyruvate synthase reaction couple to the CO oxidation reaction? What is the most efficient direct electron donor and acceptor for the forward and reverse reactions of PFOR? N2 (99.8%, from Linweld) was deoxygenated by passage through a heated column containing BASF catalyst. CO (99.99%) was obtained from Linweld. Sodium bicarbonate (minimum 99.5%), acetyl-CoA (96%, sodium salt), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (98%, disodium salt), andl-lactic dehydrogenase (type II: from rabbit muscle) were purchased from Sigma. C. thermoaceticum (Moorela thermoacetica) strain ATCC 39073 was grown anaerobically at 55 °C in a 14-liter fermentor on glucose and CO2. CODH, PFOR, and ferredoxin were purified under strictly anaerobic conditions. PFOR was purified as described (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12119-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in anaerobic 50 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.5. CODH/ACS (38Ragsdale S.W. Clark J.E. Ljungdahl L.G. Lundie L.L. Drake H.L. J.

Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 328-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified under anaerobic conditions at 17 °C in a vacuum atmospheres chamber maintained below 10 ppm of oxygen. Enzyme concentrations were determined by the Rose Bengal method (40Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin standard. CODH/ACS activity was assayed by monitoring the CO-dependent reduction of methyl viologen (ε604 = 13,900m−1 cm−1) (38Ragsdale S.W. Clark J.E. Ljungdahl L.G. Lundie L.L. Drake H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2364-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PFOR activity was measured as described (2Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8484-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by following pyruvate- and CoA-dependent methyl viologen reduction. Ferredoxin activity was measured by coupling CO oxidation by CODH/ACS to metronidazole reduction (ε320 = 9300m−1 cm−1) (42Terlesky K.C. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4080-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction similar to that described earlier for hydrogenase (43Chen J.S. Blanchard D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rubredoxin was purified from Clostridium formicoaceticum (44Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyruvate synthase activity was determined in a coupled reaction with CO and CO dehydrogenase as the initial electron donor. Pyruvate formation was coupled to NADH oxidation by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Stock solutions of 1 mKHCO3, 10 mm or 1 mm acetyl-CoA, 22.4 mm NADH, 0.1 mm CODH, 33 μmPFOR, 121 μm ferredoxin, 10 mm methyl viologen, and 22 μm LDH were used. The assay was performed under an atmosphere of CO (1 mm) in a reaction mixture containing 1 μm CODH, 1 μmferredoxin or 40 μm methyl viologen, 110 nmLDH, 16.5 nm PFOR and varying concentrations of acetyl-CoA and CO2. The CO2 concentration was estimated by the Henderson-Hasselbach equation taking into account the pH of the reaction mixture and the KHCO3 concentration. During the initial velocity time-scale CO2 produced from CO was too low to affect the CO2 concentrations in solution. PFOR, CODH, electron carrier (ferredoxin, methyl viologen, or rubredoxin), and LDH concentrations were varied in a coupled reaction to establish the conditions under which pyruvate synthase activity is rate-limiting. In all assays, the buffer was 50 mm MES, pH 6.4, and saturated with CO gas by bubbling for 5 min with CO in a serum-stoppered cuvette. NADH oxidation (ε340 = 6400m−1 cm−1) was followed in an OLIS-modified Cary 14 spectrophotometer. The assays were performed at 25 °C and were initiated by adding PFOR. TheV max and K m values were determined by globally fitting the data to the equation for a ping-pong mechanism. PFOR has been shown to follow a ping-pong mechanism (21Uyeda K. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3120-3125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using Sigma Plot 5.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To determine the Michaelis parameters of PFOR for ferredoxin, the reaction mixture contained 10 mm pyruvate, 1 mm CoA, 1 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmmetronidazole, and varying concentrations of ferredoxin in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.1. The reaction was started by adding 2 μl of PFOR (1.3 mg/ml) to a reaction volume of 0.5 ml, and the reduction of metronidazole was followed at 320 nm (ε320 = 9300 m−1cm−1). To determine the kinetic parameters for the reaction with rubredoxin, the reaction was started by adding 1 μl of PFOR (0.42 mg/ml) to a 0.2-ml reaction mixture, and the reduction of rubredoxin was followed at 490 nm (ε490 = 7300m−1 cm−1) (44Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of reagents were the same as for the reaction with ferredoxin except that metronidazole was omitted. To determine the steady-state Michaelis parameters for pyruvate, the reaction mixture contained 1 mm CoA, 8 mm methyl viologen, 1 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, 2 mmMgCl2, in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration of pyruvate was varied from 0.1 to 10 mm. The reduction of methyl viologen was followed at 604 nm. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to yield the following parameters:V max = 14.2 units/mg,K m for pyruvate = 0.30 mm, andk cat/K m = 9.33 × 104m−1 s−1. C. thermoaceticum cells (2 g, 0.57 g of dry weight) in 5 ml of sonication buffer were sonicated for 5 min (15 s on, 45 s off). The sonication buffer contained 0.002 ng/ml DNase, 0.017 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. After sonication, the proteins were precipitated with 2 m perchloric acid at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the pH was increased to pH 5.5 with 1 m NaOH, the solution was again centrifuged, and the concentrations of metabolites were measured in the supernatant. Radioactive acetyl-CoA (1 μl of a 850 μm stock solution with 96,950 dpm/nmol) was added to the supernatant as an internal control to determine recovery from the extraction procedure. More than 99% of the acetyl-CoA added was recovered after the final extraction step. The amounts of CoASH and acetyl-CoA were determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters 616/626 LC System equipped with a Waters 996 PDA detector (Waters Inc.). We obtained the best separation of the cell extract components by eluting with a gradient from 5 to 50% methanol in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5, over a 30-min time period. We used a C-18 μBondapack chromatographic column. Under these conditions, the retention times for CoASH and for acetyl-CoA were 10.3 and 13.3 min, respectively. The concentrations of CoASH and acetyl-CoA in the cell extract were estimated based on a standard curve (nmoles CoASH, acetyl-CoA versus peak area). The concentration of pyruvate was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (45LeJohn H. Stevenson R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) assay. An internal volume of 1 μl/mg protein (49Grupe H. Physiologische Ereignisse in Clostridium acetobutylicum beim Übergang von der Säure-zur Lösungsmittelbildung Ph.D. thesis.

Kontinuierliche Aceton-Butanol-Gärung durch Clostridium acetobutylicum Ph.D. thesis. University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany1983Google Scholar) were used in calculations of intracellular concentrations of metabolites. So for 0.57 g of dry weight of cells, we calculated 0.342 ml of total internal volume. Pyruvate Synthesis with PFOR—For convenience, we will refer to the pyruvate synthase or PFOR reactions explicitly but generally refer to the enzyme as PFOR. Pyruvate synthesis from acetyl-CoA and CO2 requires a strong electron donor. Because CO2 produced by the pyruvate decarboxylation reaction is the source of the carbonyl group in acetyl-CoA synthesis by clostridial CODH/ACS (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12119-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we coupled pyruvate synthesis to CO oxidation by CODH/ACS. The rate of pyruvate formation was monitored by the lactate dehydrogenase-coupled oxidation of NADH to NAD (SchemeFS1). It was earlier shown that the addition of an electron carrier stimulates the ability of PFOR to couple to CODH, giving a 5-fold increase in the rate of CO formation (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12119-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, in the pyruvate synthase reaction, either ferredoxin or methyl viologen was required to mediate the electron transfer from reduced CODH/ACS to pyruvate synthase (Fig. 2). Given the complexity of this coupled system, it was essential to establish conditions under which pyruvate synthase is rate-limiting. These conditions include 1 μm CODH, 1 μm ferredoxin, or 40 μm methyl viologen, 110 nm LDH, 1 mm CO. At concentrations of PFOR at or below 16.5 nm, the reaction rate was strictly dependent upon PFOR. Different concentrations of CO2 (0.56–22.4 mm) and acetyl-CoA (0.005–0.05 mm) were used to define the kinetic parameters for the pyruvate synthase reaction (Fig.1).Figure 1Steady-state kinetics of the pyruvate synthase reaction. The assays were performed at 25 °C and were initiated by adding PFOR. The concentration of CO2 was varied at 5 μm (●), 10 μm (○), and 50 μm (▾) fixed concentrations of acetyl-CoA. The Michaelis parameters V max andK m were determined by global fitting of the data to a ping-pong mechanism. The Michaelis parameters determined wereV max 1.6 ± 0.1 unit/mg, KmAcetyl-CoA = 9.1 ± 1.4 μm, and KmCO2 = 2.0 ± 0.3 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The kinetic data did not fit a ternary complex mechanism; the kinetic parameters K ia and KmAcetyl-CoA had unreasonably large standard deviations (over 200% error). On the other hand, the data fit a ping-pong mechanism quite well (<15% standard deviations). The kinetic parameters were determined by globally fitting the data to a ping-pong mechanism. The Michaelis parameters for the pyruvate synthase are given in Table I along with those for the PFOR reaction, which we also determined. With CO and CODH as the electron donor, the pyruvate synthase activity is high. At saturating CO2 (22.4 mm) and acetyl-CoA (100 μm) concentrations, the specific activity is 1.6 unit/mg, which translates to a k cat of 3.2 s−1. This is only 9-fold lower than thek cat for the PFOR reaction (28 s−1), which agrees well with predictions based on kinetic simulations (2Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8484-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When methyl viologen was replaced by ferredoxin (1 μm) at saturating concentrations of pyruvate and CoA, there was no difference in the specific activity, indicating that the second half reaction of pyruvate synthesis, not electron donation to the enzyme, is rate-limiting under these conditions.Table IKinetic parameters for the pyruvate synthase and PFOR reactionsSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mExpected rate1-aCalculated rate at physiological concentrations of substrates.Measured ratedRef.mms −1mm −1 s −1s −1s −1Acetyl-CoA1-bPyruvate synthase reaction.9 × 10−33.23563.21.3This workCO21-bPyruvate synthase reaction.2.03.21.63.2This workCoASH1-cRefers to the PFOR reaction.4 × 10−3287 × 1032810.820Menon S.

Open table in a new tab d Measured rates at intracellular concentrations of substrates. Initial velocity experiments were used to determine the physiological electron carriers(s) for PFOR (Fig.2 A) and pyruvate synthase (Fig. 2 B). With ferredoxin as the mediator, thek cat/K m for ferredoxin for the synthase reaction is only ∼10-fold lower than for the oxidative decarboxylation. The 8-iron ferredoxin from the archaeon,Methanosarcina thermophila, also was as good an electron mediator as the C. thermoaceticum ferredoxin (Fig.3), suggesting that these proteins are homologous enough to interact in a similar way with both PFOR and CODH/ACS. Recently, it was proposed for the PFOR of C. tepidum that rubredoxin is the electron acceptor, whereas ferredoxin is the electron donor for the pyruvate synthase reaction (37Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is reasonable because rubredoxin has a midpoint potential near 0 mV (inC. tepidum it is −87 mV); whereas, ferredoxins have much more negative midpoint potentials, generally below −400 mV (46Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, the values of V/K, the so-called specificity factors, for rubredoxin and ferredoxin in the pyruvate synthase or PFOR reactions have never been compared. The value ofk cat/K m for rubredoxin in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction is 2.1 × 106m−1 s−1 (Fig.4), which is 50-fold lower than that for ferredoxin. Thus, although the driving force for reducing rubredoxin with pyruvate is much stronger in C. thermoaceticum, there is a strong preference of PFOR for ferredoxin in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction. Rubredoxin could not couple CO oxidation to the pyruvate synthase reaction (Table I and Fig. 3). Because rubredoxin is a highly active electron acceptor for CODH (38Ragsdale S.W. Clark J.E. Ljungdahl L.G. Lundie L.L. Drake H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2364-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bottleneck is in the pyruvate synthase step. This is reasonable because the standard reduction potential for the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple of rubredoxin is much more positive than that of the acetyl-CoA + CO2/pyruvate couple. To assess the physiological relevance of the pyruvate synthase reaction of PFOR, we determined the pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and CoASH concentrations in growing C. thermoaceticum cells (Table I). The amounts of these metabolites in the cell extract, determined by HPLC, were related to the intracellular volume (0.57 g of cell dry weight = 0.342 ml of cell internal volume) (TableII). We estimate the intracellular concentrations of CoASH and acetyl-CoA to be 0.28 and 0.01 mm, respectively. The intracellular pyruvate concentration is 0.2 mm, whereas the CO2 concentration is estimated to be 33 mm, because cells are continually sparged with 100% CO2 during growth.Table IIThe intracellular concentration of pyruvate, coenzyme A, and acetyl-coenzyme A in C. thermoaceticumMetabolitesIntracellular concentrationMethod usedμmPyruvate180 ± 40 (n = 3)Lactate dehydrogenase assayCoenzyme A280 ± 90 (n = 3)HPLCAcetyl-Coenzyme A10.4 ± 3.5 (n = 3)HPLC Open table in a new tab Because the intracellular pyruvate concentration is below its K m value (0.3 mm), the PFOR reaction would be limited by the concentration of pyruvate. Similarly, the pyruvate synthase reaction would be limited by the concentration of acetyl-CoA in the cell. The consequence is that, at physiological concentrations of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is predicted to occur about 8-fold slower than oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. To verify these predicted values, we ran the forward and reverse reactions in the presence of the measured intracellular concentrations of pyruvate, coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA, and CO2 (Table I). The results confirmed the prediction with a ratio of oxidative decarboxylation to reductive carboxylation of 8.3. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by PFOR generates low potential electrons that can be coupled to important reactions in the C, N, S, and H cycles, e.g. dinitrogen reduction, proton reduction to H2, sulfate reduction, and CO2reduction. PFOR also generates the key metabolic intermediate, acetyl-CoA. Thus, this important reaction has been studied rather extensively. The reverse reaction, reduction of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate, is equally important for autotrophic anaerobes because it links the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of acetyl-CoA formation to the incomplete reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for synthesis of longer carbon biosynthetic precursors. Anabolic reactions in acetogens are not well studied; however, in methanogens, it is clear that the incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle converts oxaloacetate (derived from pyruvate by the action of pyruvate carboxylase or the linked activities of phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) into malate, fumarate, succinate, succinyl-CoA, and α-ketoglutarate (10Simpson P.G. Whitman W.B. Ferry J.G. Methanogenesis: Ecology Physiology, Biochemistry & Genetics. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 445-472Crossref Google Scholar). What are the properties of the enzyme responsible for the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA? Evidence described in the Introduction is consistent with the concept that PFOR also serves as a pyruvate synthase in acetogenic and methanogenic microbes. The results described here support that hypothesis. The C. thermoaceticumPFOR is a very active pyruvate synthase, withk cat andk cat/K m values only 8–10-fold lower than those for PFOR. At physiological concentrations of pyruvate, CoA, acetyl-CoA, and CO2, the pyruvate synthase activity is about 8-fold slower than PFOR. This rate is sufficient for the rate of biosynthesis by growing cells, because the flux of metabolic intermediates toward biosynthesis is significantly lower than the flux toward energy generation. This may be even more marked for anaerobic organisms, which are energy limited. For example, only 4% of the CO2 consumed during the growth ofC. thermoaceticum on CO2 and H2as the sole energy and carbon source is recovered in cell biomass (47Daniel S.L. Hsu T. Dean S.I. Drake H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4464-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When cells were grown on glucose, 7% of the substrate consumed is recovered in cell biomass; most of the remainder is retrieved in acetate. In summary, it appears that the pyruvate synthase activity of PFOR is sufficient to account for its role in the generation of pyruvate as a biosynthetic precursor. What is the physiological electron carrier(s) for pyruvate synthase and PFOR? With a midpoint potential for the acetyl-CoA + CO2/pyruvate couple of −520 mV, pyruvate is a strong reductant. Correspondingly, it requires a very strong reductant to carboxylate acetyl-CoA. Tabita (37Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) discovered that rubredoxin is a strong electron acceptor for the PFOR from the green sulfur bacterium C. tepidum, indicating that it could be the physiological redox mediator in this direction. The C. thermoaceticum CODH is a highly promiscuous electron donor and can rapidly reduce rubredoxin. Several roles of rubredoxin in anaerobic energy metabolism have been proposed. These have been recently discussed in relation to a new proposed role for rubredoxin in protecting cells from oxygen (41Gomes C.M. Silva G. Oliveira S. LeGall J. Liu M.Y. Xavier A.V. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22502-22508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 48Jenney Jr., F.E. Verhagen M.F. Cui X. Adams M.W. Science. 1999; 286: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Rubredoxin is expected to be a very good electron acceptor from pyruvate, because its Fe3+/2+ couple is near 0 mV. Therefore, on the basis of driving force alone, rubredoxin could accept electrons six orders of magnitude faster than ferredoxin (midpoint potential of about −350 to −400 mV). However, thek cat/K m for rubredoxin 3We used rubredoxin from C. formicoaceticum not C. thermoaceticum to couple to theC. thermoaceticum PFOR, because this protein is relatively abundant in iron-limited cultures of C. formicoaceticum. These small electron transfer mediators can generally be used fairly interchangeably among related microbes. We do not expect this to significantly alter our conclusions, because the C. formicoaceticum rubredoxin couples equally well to the C. formicoaceticum and C. thermoaceticum CODH. Furthermore, the M. thermophila ferredoxin is nearly as good an electron acceptor as the C. thermoaceticum protein. in pyruvate oxidation is 50-fold lower than that for ferredoxin. Thus, although the driving force for ferredoxin reduction is much less relative to rubredoxin, ferredoxin is a much more efficient acceptor of electrons from PFOR. An apparently more serious problem with rubredoxin as an electron acceptor for PFOR is that it is a very poor electron donor for subsequent reactions. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to expect rubredoxin to couple pyruvate oxidation to proton, CO2, or dinitrogen reduction. The CO2/CO and the CO2 + acetyl-CoA/pyruvate couples have similar standard reduction potentials. Accordingly, we found that rubredoxin is unable to couple CO oxidation to the pyruvate synthase reaction. On the other hand, ferredoxin is an excellent mediator in this reaction. Although, rubredoxin is inept as an electron donor for pyruvate synthesis, the value ofk cat/K m for ferredoxin in the synthase reaction is only ∼10-fold lower than in the oxidative decarboxylation. Thus, our results indicate that PFOR is an efficient pyruvate synthase and that ferredoxin serves as the electron acceptor for pyruvate oxidation as well as the electron donor for pyruvate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981793553,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a transcription factor that transmits incoming 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) signaling via combined contact with coactivator proteins and specific DNA binding sites (VDREs), which ultimately results in activation of transcription. In contrast, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression via the VDR are less well understood. This study documents VDR-dependent transcriptional repression largely via histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Direct, ligand-sensitive protein-protein interaction of the VDR with the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and a novel corepressor, called Alien, was demonstrated to be comparable but independent of the VDR AF-2 trans-activation domain. Functional assays indicated that Alien, but not NCoR, displays selectivity for different VDRE structures for transferring these repressive effects into gene regulatory activities. Moreover, superrepression via Alien was found to be affected only in part by HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A. Finally, for a dissociation of VDR-Alien complexes in vitro and in vivo, higher ligand concentrations were needed than for a dissociation of VDR-NCoR complexes. This suggests that Alien and NCoR are using different interfaces for interaction with the VDR and different pathways for mediating superrepression, which in turn characterizes Alien as a representative of a new class of corepressors. Taken together, association of the VDR with corepressor proteins provides a further level of transcriptional regulation, which is emerging as a complex network of protein-protein interaction-mediated control."

Another study has shown that sustained activation of the MEK → ERK pathway resulted in induction of IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 genes in T cells (30Chen D. Heath V. O'Garra A. Johnston J. McMahon M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar). None of these studies, however, evaluated the effect of the MEK → ERK pathway on NF-κB-dependent transcription. Based on our previous data showing that the ERK kinase regulated IL-6 transcription (24Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and that the p38 MAP kinase was necessary for NF-κB-dependent gene expression (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of the MEK → ERK pathway in regulating NF-κB-dependent transcription. By utilizing a promoter construct driven only by NF-κB, we found that a constitutive active MEK1 expression vector inhibited NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, and PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, abrogated this inhibition. NF-κB activation was not altered by the MEK → ERK pathway. In contrast, the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector inhibited the phosphorylation of a His-TBP fusion protein, which must be phosphorylated to interact with the p65 subunit and to bind to the TATA box. In addition, the constitutive active MEK → ERK pathway reduced the activity of the p38 MAP kinase, suggesting that the ERK and p38 MAP kinases have differential effects on NF-κB-dependent gene expression. The THP-1 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with gentamicin and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For in vivo phosphorylation studies the cells were cultured in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the same supplements, and for in vivo kinase assays the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with gentamicin and 0.5% fetal calf serum. NF-κB-dependent gene expression was evaluated utilizing a luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-luc) driven by four tandem copies of the κ enhancer (κB4) in a pUC vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The −600 TNF-CAT (a generous gift from Dr. Tom Maniatis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and −546 IL-8-CAT (a generous gift from Dr. Naofumi Mukaida, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan) plasmids have been previously described (31Goldfeld A.E.

The pCMV-HA-ERK2 (K/A), pCMV-MEK1 plasmids (generous gifts from Dr. Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), pcDNA-His-p65, and pcDNA-His-TBP plasmids have been described previously (21Carter A.B.

The pcDNA-V5-p38 plasmid was generated by amplification of the human open reading frame of the p38 MAP kinase and inserting it into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The pTET-luc and pTET-Elk plasmids were obtained from CLONTECH. Transfections were performed utilizing the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty four h after transfection the cells were stimulated with Escherichia coli serotype 026:B6 LPS (Sigma) at a dose of 100 μg/ml. Luciferase activity, which was normalized to total protein, was measured after 6 h (Promega, Madison, WI), which was determined to be the time of maximal activity. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, which were normalized to total protein, were performed after 24 h as described previously (34Hunninghake G.W. Monick M.M. Liu B. Stinski M.F. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3026-3033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When used, the MEK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059 (Calbiochem), at 5 μm, was added 1 h prior to stimulation with LPS. A consensus NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGATTTTCCCAGGC-3′) oligonucleotide (Promega) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Binding reactions were performed as described previously (35Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol.

Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (24Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3005-3012PubMed Google Scholar). The p38 or ERK2 MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated from the lysates overnight at 4 °C with either a p38 or ERK2 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, bound to Gammabind with Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro kinase activity was assayed as described previously using ATF-2, c-Jun, or TFIID (TBP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a substrate (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3005-3012PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the pTET-luc with the pTET-ELK plasmid was performed to determine kinase activity in vivo. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with LPS, and luciferase activity, which was normalized to protein, was measured after 6 h, which was determined to be the time of maximal activity. For Western blot analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ERK2 and p38 MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution, and the p-ERK monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 dilution. The anti-Xpress monoclonal and the anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen) recognize the sequences -Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys- and -Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn-Pro-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Thr-, respectively, from the leader peptide in the His-p65, His-TBP, and the V5-p38 fusion proteins, and they were used at 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). THP-1 cells were co-transfected with an empty vector or the pCMV-MEK1 and either pcDNA-His-p65, pcDNA-His-TBP, or pcDNA-V5-p38 plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were labeled as described previously (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The His-p65, the His-TBP, or the V5-p38 fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with the anti-Xpress or anti-V5 monoclonal antibody bound to Gammabind with Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. All luciferase activity assays, which were normalized to total protein, are shown as means with the standard error. Statistical comparisons were performed using a paired, one-tailed t test, with the probability of p< 0.05 considered to be significant. Prior to determining the role of the ERK kinase in regulating NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, we assured ourselves that LPS activates the ERK kinase and that PD 98059 was working appropriately in THP-1 cells. To demonstrate that LPS activates the ERK kinase, cells were stimulated with LPS at various time points, and a Western analysis was performed for p-ERK. We found that p-ERK was maximal at 30 min, but there was increased activity as early as 5 min, and it gradually decreased to control levels at 90 min (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis of ERK2 MAP kinase shows equal loading of the protein. In vitrokinase assays were performed using c-Jun as a substrate, and similar results were found (data not shown). Interestingly, other isoforms of ERK kinase have minimal activity in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells when compared with the ERK2 kinase (data not shown). These data show that LPS activates the ERK2 kinase in THP-1 cells. The MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, has been shown previously to be an effective and relatively specific inhibitor of ERK-mediated signaling (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 39Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In order to demonstrate that PD 98059 was working appropriately in THP-1 cells, we utilized both in vivo andin vitro kinase assays to quantify activation of either the ERK2 or the p38 MAP kinase. We co-transfected a luciferase reporter with the pTET-ELK plasmid and performed luciferase assays. LPS significantly increased luciferase activity in cells expressing pTET-ELK, and in the presence of PD 98059, this activity was reduced to control levels (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained performing Western analysis for p-ERK and in ERK2 in vitrokinase assays using c-Jun as the substrate (data not shown). In contrast, LPS significantly increased p38 MAP kinase activity as measured by phosphorylation of ATF-2, and PD 98059 had no appreciable effect on kinase activity. Interestingly, PD 98059 slightly increased this activity above base line in cells not exposed to LPS (Fig.1 C). These studies confirm that PD 98059 is effective and relatively specific for ERK-mediated signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of the MEK → ERK pathway with PD 98059 slightly enhanced p38 MAP kinase-mediated signaling as quantified by kinase activity assays. To determine the role of the MEK → ERK pathway in regulating LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription, we measured NF-κB-dependent promoter activity using the pNF-κB-luc reporter plasmid. We first the used thein vivo kinase assay to show that pCMV-MEK1 was constitutively active in THP-1 cells. Cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid, pTET-ELK, and either an empty vector or the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector. Both LPS and MEK1 increased luciferase activity greater than 4× control, and in cells expressing MEK1 and stimulated with LPS the luciferase activity was at a similar level (Fig. 2 A). An ERK2 in vitro kinase assay using c-Jun as the substrate revealed similar results (data not shown). These data confirm that pCMV-MEK1 constitutively activates ERK2 both in vivo andin vitro. By utilizing the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector, we next evaluated its role in regulating NF-κB-driven gene transcription. In these studies, we co-transfected the pNF-κB-luc with either an empty vector or the MEK1 expression vector. LPS significantly increased luciferase activity in cells expressing the empty vector, whereas in cells expressing the constitutive active MEK1 vector, luciferase activity was reduced to near control levels (Fig. 2 B). A similar experiment was performed with cells cultured in the presence or absence of PD 98059 after the transient co-transfection. PD 98059 augmented LPS-induced luciferase activity in cells expressing the empty vector, and in cells expressing the constitutive active MEK1 vector, PD 98059 abrogated the effect of MEK1 on NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2 C). To evaluate this in a different manner, we co-transfected the pNF-κB-luc plasmid with either an empty vector or the dominant negative pCMV-HA-ERK2 (K/A) plasmid. The results from these experiments corroborated the results found with PD 98059. LPS increased luciferase activity in cells transfected with the empty vector, and this activity was augmented in cells expressing the dominant negative ERK2 MAP kinase (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results show that the MEK → ERK pathway negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression. In order to determine the role of the MEK → ERK kinase pathway in the regulation NF-κB-driven transcription, we next evaluated if either translocation or p65 phosphorylation was affected by MEK1 or ERK2 activity. THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of PD 98059 for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS, and nuclear protein was subsequently extracted. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that LPS increased NF-κB translocation and DNA binding. Inhibition of the MEK → ERK pathway with PD 98059 had essentially no effect on this translocation and binding (Fig. 3 A). To evaluate if the constitutive active MEK1 altered p65 phosphorylation, cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA-His-p65 plasmid and either an empty vector or the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were labeled with32Pi in phosphate-free medium and then stimulated with LPS. His-p65 was immunoprecipitated to assess phosphorylation. LPS increased His-p65 phosphorylation in cells expressing the empty vector, and the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector had no significant effect on this phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). Western blot analysis of His-p65 shows equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. As an aggregate, these studies indicate that the MEK → ERK pathway does not directly regulate the activation of NF-κB by controlling its translocation and DNA binding or the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, and inhibition of this pathway with PD 98059 does not augment the translocation of NF-κB. Due to the fact that NF-κB-driven transcription requires activation of TBP and this activation is dependent on the p38 MAP kinase (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we next evaluated if the negative regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription by the MEK → ERK pathway was secondary to modulation of TBP activation. We co-transfected the pcDNA-His-TBP plasmid with either an empty vector or the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector. The cells were labeled with32Pi in phosphate-free medium and subsequently stimulated with LPS. His-TBP was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates to assess phosphorylation. LPS increased phosphorylation of His-TBP in cells expressing the empty vector. In contrast, His-TBP phosphorylation was completely obliterated in cells expressing MEK1 (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of His-TBP shows equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. This suggests that the MEK → ERK pathway negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, in part, by modulating the activation of TBP. To determine the physiological relevance of inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional activity by the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector, we utilized a CAT reporter gene driven by either a TNF-α or an IL-8 promoter, both of which have NF-κB-binding sites. THP-1 cells were co-transfected with an empty vector or pCMV-MEK1 and either −546 IL-8-CAT or −600 TNF-CAT. LPS significantly increased CAT activity in cells expressing the empty vector. In contrast, cells expressing the constitutive active MEK1 had about a 70% reduction, as measured by densitometry, in IL-8-CAT activity (Fig.5, A and B). In cells transfected with the TNF-CAT, LPS induced a significant increase in CAT activity, and this activity was reduced by about 40% in cells expressing the constitutive active MEK1 (Fig. 5 C). These data suggest the MEK → ERK pathway negatively regulates endogenous gene expression that requires NF-κB transcriptional activity by modulating TBP activation. Furthermore, the data suggest that cytokine gene expression is clearly dependent of NF-κB even though the MEK → ERK pathway is necessary for the activation of AP-1 and NF-IL-6, both of which have binding sites within the IL-8 and TNF promoters. Due to the fact that the p38 MAP kinase is a positive regulator (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and the constitutive active MEK1 is a negative regulator of NF-κB-dependent transcription by affecting activation of TBP, we next evaluated if a constitutive active MEK → ERK pathway inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity. To determine if the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector inhibited the p38 MAP kinase, we first performed in vitro p38 MAP kinase assays. THP-1 cells were transfected with either an empty vector or the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector. The native p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, and kinase activity was determined using TFIID (TBP) as the substrate. TFIID (TBP) was phosphorylated in vitro by LPS-stimulated p38 MAP kinase obtained from THP-1 cells transfected with the empty vector, and this activity was significantly reduced in cells expressing MEK1 (Fig.6 A). Western blot analysis for p38 MAP kinase confirmed equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. The dual phosphorylation of Thr-180 and Tyr-182 is required for p38 MAP kinase activation (41Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar), so we finally determined if the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector inhibited the phosphorylation of a p38 MAP kinase fusion protein. In these experiments, we co-transfected the pcDNA-V5-p38 plasmid with either an empty vector or the MEK1 expression vector. The cells were labeled with32Pi in phosphate-free medium prior to stimulation with LPS. The V5-p38 fusion protein was immunoprecipitated to determine phosphorylation. LPS induced the phosphorylation of V5-p38, and this phosphorylation was reduced in cells expressing MEK1 (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis for the V5-p38 fusion protein confirmed equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. As an aggregate, these studies show that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates TFIID (TBP) and a constitutive active MEK → ERK pathway inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo by reducing its phosphorylation. These studies also provide novel evidence of a mechanism by which the MEK → ERK pathway, at least in part, negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression. NF-κB-dependent gene expression can be regulated at multiple levels after cell stimulation. The early regulation events occur in the cytoplasm where NF-κB is held by the inhibitor protein, IκB. Previous studies have shown that MEKK1, an upstream activator of both the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, phosphorylates both IKKα and IKKβ, and it acts in conjunction with the NF-κB-inducing kinase to synergistically activate the IKK complex (42Nemoto S.

In addition, the use of dominant negatives of either MEKK1 or MKK4 inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression by preventing translocation (42Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell.

Our data clearly indicate that the regulation by the MEK → ERK pathway occurs downstream of IKK activation, IκB degradation, NF-κB translocation, and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. After NF-κB subunits are phosphorylated and the protein is bound to DNA, other events, such as the interaction with various transcription factors, must occur to initiate transcription. Different subunits of NF-κB have previously been shown to interact directly with both enhancer transcription factors, such as C/EBPβ, AP-1, Sp1, and ATF-2 (45LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc.

Furthermore, we showed that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylated TBP, thereby modulating its activation. In the current study, we provide additional evidence that the interaction of TBP and the p65 subunit is necessary for NF-κB-dependent transcription. The novel finding, however, is that overexpression of the MEK → ERK pathway prevents the phosphorylation of TBP and thus negatively regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity. The negative regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector indicates that the ERK and p38 MAP kinases differentially regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity. Other studies have shown that these MAP kinases have opposing effects on gene expression. More specifically, activation of the p38 and JNK MAP kinases and simultaneous inhibition of the ERK MAP kinase was found to be critical for apoptosis in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (51Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar). In another study, the p38 MAP kinase was shown to enhance accumulation of IL-12 mRNA, whereas the ERK MAP kinase inhibited IL-12 transcription in murine macrophages stimulated with LPS (52Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to having opposing effects on gene expression, these kinases have also been shown to negatively regulate one another. For example, activation of the p38 MAP kinase with anisomycin in mast cells inhibited the activation of the ERK2 MAP kinase (40Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This, in turn, resulted in a reduction in TNF-α and arachidonic acid production in these cells. In a study evaluating the regulation of low density lipoprotein receptor expression in HepG2 cells, inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB202190 resulted in increased ERK MAP kinase activity and increased receptor expression (53Singh R.P. Dhawan P. Golden C. Kapoor G.S. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19593-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our study is similar in that these MAP kinases appear to differentially regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription. Furthermore, our data suggest that this differential regulation occurs, in part, through the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity by the constitutive active MEK → ERK pathway. Although we did not determine the mechanism by which the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity, one plausible mechanism would be through induction of MKP-1 or other phosphatases. The ERK MAP kinase has been shown to activate MKP-1 by phosphorylation on two carboxyl-terminal serines both in vivo and in vitro (54Brondello J.-M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 55Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Multiple studies have shown that MKP-1 also has much more specificity for the p38 MAP kinase than the other MAP kinases (56Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A.

The interaction, both verified and proposed, of MEK, ERK, p38, MKP-1, TBP, and NF-κB is depicted schematically in Fig. 7. MKP-1 activity is induced by stress stimuli, such as LPS, and its induction requires ERK MAP kinase activity (60Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thus, use of the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, prevents activation of MKP-1. This may explain the mechanism by which both PD 98059 and the dominant negative ERK2 expression vector augment NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Our data clearly show that the constitutive activation of the MEK → ERK pathway negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription through modulation of TBP activation. In addition, this is the first study showing that a constitutive active MEK → ERK pathway inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity and implicates the dynamic balance between ERK- and p38-mediated signaling required for NF-κB-dependent gene expression. It may be of interest in further studies to determine if the constitutive active MEK1 expression vector induces constitutive activation of a phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W2008549086,"Abstract This report outlines the protein requirements and subunit organization of the DNA replication apparatus ofStreptococcus pyogenes, a Gram-positive organism. Five proteins coordinate their actions to achieve rapid and processive DNA synthesis. These proteins are: the PolC DNA polymerase, τ, δ, δ′, and β. S. pyogenes dnaX encodes only the full-length τ, unlike the Escherichia coli system in which dnaX encodes two proteins, τ and γ. The S. pyogenes τ binds PolC, but the interaction is not as firm as the corresponding interaction in E. coli, underlying the inability to purify a PolC holoenzyme from Gram-positive cells. The τ also binds the δ and δ′ subunits to form a τδδ′ “clamp loader.” PolC can assemble with τδδ′ to form a PolC·τδδ′ complex. After PolC·τδδ′ clamps β to a primed site, it extends DNA 700 nucleotides/second in a highly processive fashion. Gram-positive cells contain a second DNA polymerase, encoded by dnaE, that has homology to theE. coli α subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III. We show here that the S. pyogenes DnaE polymerase also functions with the β clamp."
https://openalex.org/W1977826373,Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) plays an important role in the progression of several malignancies including breast cancer. We have identified a noncompetitive antagonist of the uPA-uPAR interaction derived from a nonreceptor binding region of uPA (amino acids 136-143). This 8-mer capped peptide (A6) inhibited breast cancer cell invasion and endothelial cell migration in a dose-dependent manner in vitro without altering cell doubling time. Intraperitoneal administration of A6 resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth and suppressed the development of lymph node metastases in several models of breast cancer cell growth and metastasis. Large areas of tumor necrosis and extensive positive staining by TUNEL were observed on histological and immunohistochemical analysis of experimental tumor sections from A6-treated animals. A6 treatment also resulted in a decrease in factor VIII-positive tumor microvessel hot-spots. These results identify a new epitope in uPA that is involved in the uPA-uPAR interaction and indicate that an antagonist based on this epitope is able to inhibit tumor progression by modulating the tumor microenvironment in the absence of direct cytotoxic effects in vivo.

The 53-kDa protein is essentially composed of six thrombospondin type 1 repeats, all of which contain the WXXW motif, the recognition sequence for C-mannosylation. C-Mannosylation is a post-translational modification of tryptophan residues in which, in contrast to the well known N- andO-glycosylation, the carbohydrate is attached via a C–C bond to C-2 of the indole moiety of tryptophan.C-Mannosylation was first found in human RNase 2 and interleukin-12. The terminal complement proteins C6–C9 also carry this modification as part of their thrombospondin type 1 repeats. We studied the C-mannosylation pattern of human properdin by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. Properdin contains 20 tryptophans of which 17 are part of a WXXW motif. Fourteen tryptophans were found to be modified 100%. This is the first example of a protein in which the majority of tryptophan residues occurs in theC-mannosylated form. These results show thatC-mannosylated proteins occur at several steps along the complement activation cascade. Therefore, this system would be ideal to investigate the function of C-mannosylation.

In the common cases ofN- and O-glycosylation the glycan is attached via an amide or a hydroxyl group of an amino acid side chain to the protein. In human RNase 2 a fundamentally different type of glycosylation was discovered (1Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

An α-mannosyl residue was found to be linked via a C–C bond to the C-2 of the indole ring of tryptophan (Fig. 1). It was shown that this modification is enzyme-catalyzed and that dolichylphosphate mannose is the sugar donor (4Doucey M.A. Hess D. Cacan R. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In RNase 2 the recognition signal for the transferase was determined to be WXXW (or less efficiently WXXF), in which the first tryptophan becomes modified (5Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Meanwhile a total of 22 tryptophans in 7 proteins have been shown to be C-mannosylated, i.e. RNase 2 (1Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), interleukin-12 (6Doucey M.A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and terminal complement proteins C6, C7, C8α and β, and C9 (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The terminal complement proteins showed a more complex pattern of C-mannosylated tryptophans than RNase 2 and interleukin-12. They contain as a part of their thrombospondin repeats (TSRs)1 WXXWXXW motifs, in which both of the first two tryptophans and, surprisingly, also the last one can be C-mannosylated. In addition, in TSRs of C6 and C7, tryptophans were found to be modified although they were not even part of a WXXW motif (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The complement system is an innate first line host defense mechanism against microbes. Its activation pathways are composed of three proteolytic cascades, which merge at the cleavage step of (inactive) C3, converting it into active C3b (Fig.2; reviewed in Ref. 8Prodinger W.M. Würzner R. Erdei A. Dierich M.P. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1999: 967-995Google Scholar). Properdin (or factor P) is a positive regulator of the complement system. It stabilizes the C3 convertase (C3bBb) in the feedback loop of the alternative pathway (Fig. 2), protecting it from rapid inactivation (9Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10DiScipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 485-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the C5 convertase (C3bBbC3b), which converts C5 into C5b, can also bind properdin. This eventually leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex, the actual lytic moiety of complement that will kill the attacked microbe. The importance of properdin is demonstrated in properdin-deficient individuals. These patients have a higher susceptibility to meningococcal infections byNeisseria, leading to fulminant meningitis with mortality rates as high as 75% (reviewed in Ref. 12Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 118: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mature properdin monomer is a 53-kDa protein that occurs in plasma at a specific ratio of dimers, trimers, and tetramers of 26:54:20 (13Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 202-207PubMed Google Scholar) and a concentration of 15–25 mg/liter. It consists of six TSRs, which are enclosed by N- and C-terminal parts (14Nolan K.F. Schwaeble W. Kaluz S. Dierich M.P. Reid K.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that show no homology to other proteins. Five of the TSRs contain a WXXWXXWXXC motif, but in the fourth repeat the last tryptophan has been replaced by a valine. OneN-glycosylation site is found in the sixth TSR, which is not essential for activity of the protein (15Farries T.C. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 842-847PubMed Google Scholar, 16Higgins J.M. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5777-5785PubMed Google Scholar). Finding C-mannosylation in the TSRs of the terminal complement proteins prompted the question of whether properdin, being composed mainly of TSRs, is also C-mannosylated. In this paper we show that properdin is the first protein in which the majority of tryptophans occurs in the C-mannosylated form. This, together with its clearly defined biological function, makes properdin an ideal protein for functional studies onC-mannosylation. Human properdin was purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA).N-(Iodoethyl)trifluoroacetamide was from Sigma. Endoproteinase Lys-C (Achromobacter) was from Wako BioProducts (Richmond, VA). Properdin was reduced and aminoethylated according to Ref. 17Schwartz W.E. Smith P.K. Royer G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. In brief, 50 μg of properdin were dissolved in 50 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm EDTA and reduced with 0.56 μmol of dithiothreitol for 4 h at room temperature under argon. After adding110 volume of methanol, the solution was heated at 50 °C. 3.1 μl of 4.5 m N-(iodoethyl)trifluoroacetamide dissolved in methanol were added twice and incubated at 50 °C for 60 min and 90 min, respectively. Removal of the trifluoroacetyl protection group was achieved by adding 40 μmol of acetic acid and incubating for 60 min at 37 °C. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, 1 m guanidine HCl, pH 9.0 containing 20% methanol, followed by the same buffer without methanol. Digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C was performed at 37 °C at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:40. After 20 h a fresh portion of protease was added, and the incubation was continued for another 20 h. Digests were fractionated by C8 reversed phase LC-ESIMS as described (18Krieg J. Gläsner W.

Peptides containing an aminoethylated cysteine followed by a proline were not cleaved under these conditions. These peptides were further digested in the same buffer without guanidine HCl for 6 h at 37 °C with 500 ng of Lys-C. Fractionation by high pressure liquid chromatography at pH 6.0 was achieved as described (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nano ESIMSMS and solid-phase Edman degradation were performed according to Refs. 19Wilm M. Mann M.

The elution position of PTH-(C-2-Man-)Trp was established by comparison to standard runs of residues 5–10 of human RNase 2 [FT(C-2-Man-)WAQW] (1Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) directly before or after analysis of each of the properdin peptides as described (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Peptides have been numbered as they occur in the sequence of the mature protein and labeled with the prefix “K” to indicate that they were generated by endoproteinase Lys-C. To obtain peptides from properdin that were suitable for analysis, we took advantage of the spacing of the cysteine residues of its TSRs by aminoethylation and endoproteinase Lys-C digestion. This yielded peptides ranging from 12 to 21 residues in length. Fractionation of an endoproteinase Lys-C digest of reduced and aminoethylated properdin was achieved by reversed phase LC-ESIMS (Fig.3). The mass spectrometry data were extracted for the masses of the expected peptides containing tryptophan(s) without and with one, two, or three hexosyl residue(s), which corresponds to an additional mass of 162 Da per hexosyl residue. The fractions were analyzed by ESIMSMS and Edman degradation. A peptide with a mass of 1928 Da was found to elute at 35.1 min, corresponding to peptide K52 (residues 353–364) with all three tryptophansC-mannosylated. In the same fraction a second peptide with a mass of 1149 Da was observed, which was identified by ESIMSMS as peptide K5 (GLLGGGVSVEDCae). ESIMSMS of the doubly charged ion of peptide K52 with an m/zvalue of 965 gave the spectrum shown in Fig.4. Three times the parent ion [M + 2H]2+ showed the loss of 120 Da (corresponding to anm/z value of 60 in the case of a doubly charged ion; indicated with dotted lines in Fig. 4). This loss of 120 Da is characteristic for aromatic C-glycosides (21Li Q.M. van den Heuvel H. Dillen L. Claeys M. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1992; 21: 213-221Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Becchi M. Fraisse D. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 122-130Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and has been instrumental in determining the presence of (C-2-Man-)Trp in several proteins (1Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T.

Moreover, multiple water losses can be seen (labeled with #), which together with the 120-Da loss, form the fingerprint for aC-linked hexosyl residue. A nearly complete series of y ions together with several b ions confirmed the identity of peptide K52. For all y ions and for some b ions containing a C-mannosylated tryptophan, at least one loss of 120 Da (indicated with dashed lines), often together with the multiple water losses, was observed. This has been illustrated in Fig. 4. Edman degradation of this peptide confirmed that all tryptophans were C-mannosylated. Cycles 3, 6, and 9 of peptide K52 showed a PTH-derivative that comigrated with (C-2-Man-)Trp from RNase 2. No signal for the PTH-derivative of unmodified tryptophan was observed. The C-mannosylation pattern of this peptide is another example of the modification of the last tryptophan in a WXXWXXC context, as it was first found in the terminal complement proteins (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab At 40.3 min a peptide with a mass of 2099 Da was found that was 324 Da heavier than expected from the cDNA sequence for residues 49–66 (14Nolan K.F. Schwaeble W. Kaluz S. Dierich M.P. Reid K.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Nolan K.F. Kaluz S. Higgins J.M. Goundis D. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), corresponding to a modification with two hexosyl moieties. The pure peptide was directly analyzed by ESIMSMS and Edman degradation. The tandem mass spectrum of the doubly charged peptide twice showed a loss of 120 Da from the parent ion. Furthermore, a nearly complete series of b ions was observed, and all of the b ions containing a C-mannosylated tryptophan showed the 120-Da loss (Table I). Interestingly, the spectrum also showed a series of a ions, again with all possible 120-Da losses (data not shown). This experiment allowed us to localize the modified tryptophans to position 56 and 59 (Table I). The assignment was confirmed by Edman degradation. At 34.8 min a peptide with a mass of 2352 Da was found. This mass fitted to peptide K17–18 (residues 106–121), with an N-terminally aminoethylated cysteine and all three tryptophans C-mannosylated. The series of b and y ions observed in the ESIMSMS spectrum, the triple loss of 120 Da from the parent ion, and Edman degradation of the pure peptide confirmed this (Table I). A peptide with a mass of 2753 Da was found at 37.7 min that corresponded to the combination peptide K26–27 (residues 158–178) with two hexosyl residues. Apparently, endoproteinase Lys-C had not cleaved the (aminoethyl)Cys–Pro bond at position 163–164. ESIMSMS analysis showed two 120-Da losses from the parent ion. A series of b and y ions confirmed the identity of the peptide and localized the two modified tryptophans to positions 169 and 172 and one unmodified tryptophan to position 175. Edman degradation showed the same pattern of modified and unmodified tryptophans (TableI). In the case of peptide K37, endoproteinase Lys-C in the presence of guanidine HCl did not cleave the (aminoethyl)Cys–Pro bonds at positions 227–228 and 242–243. This resulted in the combination peptide K36–38 (eluting at 36.6 min), which was too large for analysis by ESIMSMS and Edman degradation. To obtain peptide K37, the peptide K36–38 was subjected to a Lys-C digest, but now without guanidine HCl. Its mass of 1834 Da matched that of peptide K37 (residues 228–242) modified with two hexosyl residues. The peptide was purified to apparent homogeneity by LC-ESIMS using a pH 6 buffer system (data not shown). The ESIMSMS spectrum showed two 120-Da losses from the parent ion and a complete y ion series with nearly all possible (C-2-Man-)Trp-related 120-Da losses. Edman degradation confirmed that both tryptophans areC-mannosylated (Table I). The sequence of interest was found in two different Lys-C cleavage products: the fully cleaved peptide K43 (at 36.9 min) and the combination peptide K42–43 (at 38.3 min). In both cases the masses were 324 Da heavier than predicted from the cDNA sequence, suggesting the presence of two hexosyl residues (Table I). The ESIMSMS spectra of both peptides showed two characteristic 120-Da losses from the parent ions. Both spectra allowed the assignment of the C-mannosylated tryptophans to position 294 and 297, with Trp-291 unmodified. The ESIMSMS spectrum of K43 showed a complete y ion series and a nearly complete b ion series, both with several secondary C-linked sugar losses. Edman degradation of K43 confirmed the modification pattern (Table I). The results presented in this paper (Fig.5) show that 14 of 20 tryptophans in properdin are stoichiometrically C-mannosylated. These tryptophans were identified by tandem mass spectrometry experiments and confirmed by Edman degradation (Table I). Mass spectrometry experiments cannot distinguish between different hexoses but enable the establishment of the presence of a C–C bond between the hexosyl residue and tryptophan by observing the 120-Da loss, typical for aromatic C-glycosides (21Li Q.M. van den Heuvel H.

Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 122-130Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was verified by Edman degradation that all PTH-derivatives of modified tryptophans comigrated with authentic PTH-(C-2-Man-)Trp (Table I). For three proteins, RNase 2 (2de Beer T.

Importantly, the NMR data showed that in C9 this is true for both tryptophans in the WXXW motif (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Up to now noC-α-hexosylated tryptophan derivatives other than the mannosylated one have been detected; nor are synthetic compounds available. The recent synthesis of (C-2-Man-)Trp should also allow the production of other hexosyl derivatives, which would provide suitable controls (24Nishikawa T. Ishikawa M. Isobe M. Synlett. 1998; 1: 123-125Google Scholar, 25Manabe S. Ito Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9754-9755Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). So far seven polypeptides have been shown to contain a total of 22C-mannosylated tryptophans. Properdin increases this number substantially, further supporting the notion thatC-mannosylation is not a rare post-translational modification (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the case of RNase 2 (4Doucey M.A. Hess D. Cacan R. Hofsteenge J. Mol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and interleukin-12 (6Doucey M.A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) it has been well established that WXXW is the recognition signal for C-mannosylation, where only the first tryptophan becomes modified. In properdin, only the C-mannosylation of TSR 3 follows this rule (Fig. 5). In the other TSRs, tryptophans occur that are not followed by a second tryptophan (or another aromatic residue) at position +3. Most of the time a cysteine is found at this position; however, in TSR 4 a valine is present.C-Mannosylation of tryptophan residues in such a context has also been observed in the terminal components of complement. This led to the hypothesis that in addition to the WXXW motif, another signal must exist in these proteins (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At present, it is not known what constitutes such a signal. In vitroexperiments using synthetic substrates strongly suggest that the additional signal is not formed by the residue at the +3 position (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If this signal were solely encoded in the primary structure, the signal would lie outside the amino acid sequence used in these studies, and a second kind of C-mannosyltransferase would be involved (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the signal could be formed by a three-dimensional signal patch, as has been described for substrates of UDP-GlcNAc lysosomal enzyme:GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (26Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In TSRs 1 and 5 of properdin the first tryptophan is notC-mannosylated, indicating that negative signals must exist. These could be either neighboring amino acids or three-dimensional constraints. The high degree of C-mannosylation of properdin poses the question of degradation of (C-2-Man-)Trp. On the one hand, pathways could exist that degrade (C-2-Man-)Trp to intermediates suitable for entering metabolic pathways. On the other hand, (C-2-Man-)Trp could be excreted, either as part of a peptide or as free (C-2-Man-)Trp. The latter pathway is compatible with the recent finding of (C-2-Man-)Trp in human urine (27Gutsche B. Grun C. Scheutzow D. Herderich M. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Considering the number ofC-mannosylated tryptophans in properdin and the terminal complement proteins (7Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the concentrations of these proteins in plasma, the amounts of (C-2-Man-)Trp found in urine could readily be explained by turnover of only 5% of these proteins per day. In addition to thrombospondin-1, properdin, and the terminal complement proteins, TSR modules occur in F-, M-, and SCO-spondin (28Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M.

Acta. 1991; 1068: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Properdin stabilizes the C3 convertase by binding to its components C3b and Bb (Fig. 2). This inhibits the deactivation of the C3 convertase by factors H and I (11Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this way properdin is not only essential for the activation of the alternative pathway but also for the amplification of the classical and mannose-binding lectin pathways. Although there is no three-dimensional structure of properdin or a TSR module available, it seems very likely that the 14 C-linked mannoses, as hydrophilic moieties, will be exposed at the surface of properdin and therefore could influence the binding to C3b and Bb. Furthermore, it is known that many pathogenic microbes carry mannose-binding receptors on their surfaces (56Sharon N. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions, and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 493-527Crossref Google Scholar). If properdin were to interact with these receptors through the C-linked mannoses and thereby get deposited on the surface of an invading microorganism, it could form a focus for attack through any of the three pathways of complement. Its stabilization of the C3 activation feedback loop would ensure local production of C3b, C5b, and the membrane attack complex. The same could be true for a possible interaction between the C-linked mannoses of properdin and the multivalent mannose-binding lectin from serum, which has been shown to bind a variety of microorganisms (57Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed, however, as it is not known whether the (C-2-Man-)Trp residues in properdin are able to bind to lectins of bacterial or mammalian origin. In conclusion, it has been shown here that human properdin is a highlyC-mannosylated protein. The fact that, in addition to the terminal components C6-C9, the positive regulator properdin (with its well defined biological role) is C-mannosylated makes complement an ideal system to investigate the function of this post-translational modification.

Reid (Oxford) for the initial gift of properdin."

Compared with other growth factors that contribute to the processes of vascular formation, VEGF is unique in its high specificity for endothelial cells. It is essential not only for normal physiological processes such as wound healing, the female endometrial cycle, and embryonic formation, but also during the development of diseases that involve undesired angiogenesis, for example, tumor growth, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy (2Ferrara N.

These multiple effects are exerted through the interaction of VEGF with two receptor tyrosine kinases (Flt-1 or VEGF receptor 1 and KDR or VEGF receptor 2). Knockout studies in mice show that both receptors are essential for survival (9Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L.

It is widely accepted that KDR is the receptor that mediates the proliferation of endothelial cells, but besides the essential role of Flt-1 in embryogenesis, the function of Flt-1 is poorly understood.

Recent work with VEGForf, which is KDR-selective, has shown that activation of KDR alone is sufficient to stimulate the growth and migration of endothelial cells, the permeability of blood vessels, and the influx of calcium; in addition, VEGForf is fully angiogenic in vivo (11Meyer M.

Interpretation of the results obtained with natural VEGF variants may be complicated by the presence in some variants of additional domains of unknown function, low sequence similarity (30–45%) to the wild-type protein, and the wide range of receptor affinities. Furthermore, some of these variants are unlikely therapeutic candidates due to expected immunogenic responses. In attempts to circumvent these disadvantages, the wild-type protein has been used as the starting point for the introduction of point mutations in the receptor-binding region of the protein (21Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V.

The resulting variants showed moderate selectivity but also often lost binding affinity for the targeted receptor. Recently, structure-function studies have elucidated the three-dimensional structure of VEGF and defined its receptor-binding site (24Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A.

Herein, we describe three receptor-selective VEGF variants with a minimal number of sequence changes compared with the wild-type. One mutant, containing four amino acid changes, binds with native affinity to Flt-1 and about 470-fold more weakly to KDR compared with wild-type VEGF. The other two variants, with three and four changes from the wild-type protein, respectively, have wild-type affinity for KDR but about 2000-fold reduced affinity for Flt-1. These variants are useful reagents for the further elucidation of the biological roles of KDR and Flt-1 2H. Gille, J. Kowalski, B. Li, T. F. Zioncheck, N. Pelletier, and N.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of Kunkel et al. (29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) in the background of the receptor-binding domain (residues 1–109) of VEGF. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The following VEGF residues were individually mutated to Ala: Lys-16, Phe-17, Met-18, Tyr-21, Gln-22, Tyr-25, Ile-43, Ile-46, Phe-47, Lys-48, Asp-63, Glu-64, Gly-65, Leu-66, Gln-79, Met-81, Ile-83, His-86, Gln-89, Ile-91, Lys-101, Glu-103, Arg-105, and Pro-106. A combination mutant with four residues changed to Ala (Ile-43, Ile-46, Gln-79, and Ile-83) was made using site-directed mutagenesis (29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). VEGF alanine-scanning data were used to select residues for randomization in phage-displayed libraries. Libraries were constructed following the method described by Sidhu et al. (30Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a phagemid (pB2105; Ref. 24Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) that allows for the phage display of VEGF as a fusion to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the gene-3 minor coat protein. Briefly, for each library, a “stop template” phagemid was constructed in which codons chosen for randomization were replaced with stop codons using site-directed mutagenesis (29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting phagemid was then used as the template for a second round of mutagenesis with oligonucleotides designed to replace all stop codons with appropriately designed degenerate codons. Successful mutagenesis at all sites produced library members with randomized codons at all selected positions, and unsuccessful mutagenesis at one or more sites resulted in the retention of stop codons and thus produced phagemids that did not display VEGF. Approximately 70% of the clones contained mutations at all the designed sites. Two types of degenerate codons were used. VEGF positions that were not important for KDR binding (see “Results”) were “hard randomized” using a degenerate codon (NNS, where N = A/C/G/T and S = C/G) that encodes all twenty natural amino acids. Positions that were important for KDR binding (see “Results”) were “soft randomized” using oligonucleotides designed to maintain a bias toward the wild-type sequence while allowing a 50% mutation rate at each position. This mutation rate was attained by synthesizing the oligonucleotides such that each base in the doped region is coupled using a mixture containing 70% of the base corresponding to the wild-type sequence and 10% of each of the other three bases. Four libraries were constructed, with four or five varied residues per library (see Table I). Each library contained 1.5 × 1010 unique members and was thus sufficiently large to represent all possible random sequence combinations. Standard phage display methods (30Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to cycle phage from each library through rounds of binding selection with domains 1–3 of KDR (KDR (1Risau W.

Briefly, the protein was solubilized and unfolded in 6.0m guanidine HCl, 1.0 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 6.0. The solution was dialyzed for 10 h against 10 volumes of 2.0 m urea, 2.0 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Urea was removed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 20 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The refolded dimer was further purified using anion exchange chromatography (Pharmacia HiTrap Q, 1.0 ml) to remove traces of misfolded monomer. The purity and identity of the refolded dimer were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A previously described RIA (24Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W.

IgG Fc fusions of the extracellular domain of KDR or Flt were incubated with 5 pm125I-labeled VEGF and varying concentrations of VEGF mutant (18 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). The solution was then transferred to a 96-well plate coated with anti-Fc antibody and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween and counted with a Topcount microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). KDR- or Flt-1-transfected NIH3T3 cells were made as described previously (27Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For binding assays, cells were plated in 12-well plates at 1 × 106 cells per well to reach confluency the next day. Cells were washed and blocked in Hanks' buffered saline with 1% BSA for 1 h before adding the mixture of125I-VEGF109 with increasing concentration of unlabeled VEGF variants. The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h and then washed two times with Hanks' buffered saline with 0.5% BSA. The bound labeled VEGF was collected by solubilizing the washed cells with 1 N NaOH and counted in a gamma counter (Isodata, ICN).125I-VEGF109 was made by the chloramine-T method. 50 pm and 10 pm labeled VEGF was used for KDR and Flt-1 cell binding, respectively. The mitogenic activity of VEGF variants was determined using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics). An early passage (less than six) of HUVEC was seeded in 96-well plates (about 3000 cells per well) in F12 with 1% fetal bovine serum and starved for 18 h. The cells were fasted in CS-C medium (Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) without growth factors and supplemented with 2% diafiltered fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before replacing the medium with fresh fasting medium. VEGF variants at several concentrations in the same fasting medium were added to the wells to bring the volume up to 150 μl per well. The cells were incubated for 18 h, pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi per well) for 24 h, harvested, and counted with a Topcount microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Activity of the VEGF variants was determined by measuring their ability to induce KDR phosphorylation in a kinase receptor activity assay. Serially diluted VEGF-(1–109) variants (0.01–10 nm) were added to Chinese hamster ovary cells that express KDR with a peptide epitope flag (gDflag) fused to the amino terminus. Cells were lysed using 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm hepes, pH 7, and phosphorylated gDflag-KDR in the lysate was captured with anti-gDflag monoclonal antibody coated on an ELISA plate. The wells were incubated with biotinylated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 2 h, followed with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. Phosphorylation of gDflag-KDR was detected by measuring absorbance at 450 nm on a plate reader. Human aorta smooth muscle cells (Clonetics) were maintained in SM2 medium (Clonetics) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% ambient air in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-well polystyrene plates (Becton Dickinson). When cells attained 90% confluence, they were growth-arrested for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA. VEGF-(1–109), PlGF or VEGF-(1–109) variants were added at a final concentration of 40 ng/ml, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in the serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA. Gelatinase in the conditioned medium was analyzed by zymography. Media were collected and concentrated, and 25 μl-aliquots were mixed with 2 × sample buffer without reducing agent or heating. Samples were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin (Novex, San Diego, CA) for electrophoresis. In addition to using regular molecular weight markers, the MMP-2 and MMP-9 zymographic standards (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used as standards for gelatinases. After electrophoresis, proteins were renatured by incubation of the gels for 30 min at room temperature in renaturing buffer and in developing buffer (Novex) overnight at 37 °C.

TOK-1α also preferentially bound to an active form of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) via p21, and these made a ternary complex in human cells. Furthermore, the results of three different types of experiments showed that TOK-1α enhanced the inhibitory activity of p21 toward histone H1 kinase activity of CDK2.

The p21 gene is induced dependently or independently by p53 in cells after various stresses. p53-dependent p21 induction occurs by x-ray or UV irradiation, which causes DNA damage, and by heat shock or osmotic shock to cells (5el-Deiry W.S.

The molecular mechanisms explaining the versatile functions of p21, however, remain to be determined. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel protein, TOK-1, as a p21 C-terminal region-binding protein. TOK-1 comprises two splicing isoforms, TOK-1α and TOL-1β. Only TOK-1α bound to p21 in a ternary complex with CDK2 in cells and enhanced the p21 function of inhibition of the kinase activity of CDK2. Thus, TOK-1 is a new modulator of p21. Human HeLa, 293 and 293T cells, and monkey COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. All of the plasmid DNAs were basically constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based methods, in which the amplified fragments were inserted into the respective sites of the desired vectors. Details of the construction procedures are available upon request. Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells containing the lacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pLex-p21, which did not activate lacZ transcription by itself. The transformant cells were subsequently transformed with human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain fused to the cDNAs from human brain cells. Approximately 5 × 106 colonies were screened for lacZ expression, which indicate the association of a GAL4 activation domain-fused protein with the LexA DNA binding domain (LexABD)-fused p21. The plasmid DNAs in thelacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols from CLONTECH. The plasmid derived from a positive colony was named pACT-TOK-1α and characterized. A fusion protein of GST to TOK-1α was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (26Negishi Y. Nishita Y. Saëgusa Y. Kakizaki I. Galli I. Kihara F. Tamai K. Miyajima N. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1133-4113PubMed Google Scholar). GST-TOK-1α was released from GST-TOK-1α by the PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rats were immunized by GST-free TOK-1α. The serum of the rats was used as a polyclonal anti-TOK-1 antibody after purification through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column containing GST-TOK-1α. GST-TOK-1α, GST-TOK-1β, GST-p21, and GST were purified from a 1-liter culture of E. coliBL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-GST-TOK-1α, pGEX-GST-TOK-1β, GST-p21, and pGEX-6P-1, respectively, as described previously (26Negishi Y. Nishita Y. Saëgusa Y. Kakizaki I. Galli I. Kihara F. Tamai K. Miyajima N. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1133-4113PubMed Google Scholar). GST-free TOK-1α and TOK-1β were released from the GST-TOK-1α and GST-TOK-1β, respectively, by digestion with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Three μg of GST-p21 or GST was first incubated with 3 μg of GST-free TOK-1α or TOK-1β for 2 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% NaN3 and then applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing of the column, the proteins recovered from the resin were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a rat polyclonal anti-TOK-1 antibody. One μg of pCMV-FLAG-TOK-1α or TOK-1β together with 1 μg of pCMV-p21 was transfected to human 293T cells 60% confluent in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Forty-eight hr after transfection, the whole cell extract was prepared by the published procedure (27Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of the 293T cell proteins was first immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. After washing with the same buffer except for 0.05% Nonidet P-40 instead of 0.25%, the precipitates were separated in a 10% of polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a mouse anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), a mouse anti-CDK2 monoclonal antibody (M2, Santa Cruz), or the rat anti-TOK-1 antibody. COS1 cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-TOK-1α or TOK-1β together with pCMV-p21-HA by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (28Graham F.J. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hr after transfection, the cells were fixed with a solution containing acetone-methanol (3:7) and reacted with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) and a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). The cells were then reacted with an fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, respectively, and observed under a confocal razor fluorescent microscopy. An adenovirus expressing TOK-1α was constructed according to the published procedure for the method by a homologous recombination (29Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Basically, a blunt-ended cDNA containing TOK-1α was inserted into SwaI site of pAxCAwt followed by transfection together with adenovirus DNA containing a terminal protein to human 293 cells. After plaque purification of the desired adenovirus, a recombinant adenovirus for TOK-1α (AxCATOK-1α) was selected. HeLa-Tet-on cells were purchased fromCLONTECH. HeLa-Tet-on cells in a 10-cm dish were transfected with 5 μg of pUHD-TOK-1α or pUHD-p21 together with 0.5 μg of pSV-bsr, a blasticidin S expression vector, by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique and cultured in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml of blasticidin and 1 μg/ml of tetracycline. About 2 weeks after transfection, blasticidin-resistant colonies were selected and used as TOK-1α or p21-expressing cell lines. HeLa cells expressing TOK-1α or p21 under the control of doxcycline were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml of doxcycline for 2 days, and the cell extracts were prepared by sonication of cells in an H1-kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaF. One hundred μg of proteins in the extracts was first incubated with 250 ng of an anti-CDK2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and further incubated with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. After extensive washing of the mixture with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, then with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and, finally, with H1-kinase buffer, the mixture was reacted with 5 μCi (6000 mmol/ml) of γ-ATP and 1 μm ATP and 5 μg of histones H1 for 20 min at 30 °C. The mixture was boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the proteins in the mixture were separated on polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Fifty μg of H9 cell extract prepared as described above was first reacted with a recombinant TOK-1α with or without a recombinant p21 extracted from E. coli for 2 h at 4 °C. After the anti-CDK2 antibody was added to the mixture, the kinase assay was carried out as described above. HeLa cells expressing TOK-1α or p21 under the control of doxcycline were infected with a recombinant adenovirus of TOK-1α at multiplicity of infection 10 and cultured in the presence or absence of doxcycline for 2 days. Three hundred μg of cell extract prepared as described above was added to 250 μg of anti-CDK2 antibody, and the kinase assay was carried out as described above. To screen cDNAs encoding p21-associated proteins, a segment spanning amino acid number 87 to 164 of human p21 cDNA was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexABD) in pGLex (30Koike N. Maita H. Taira T. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and S. cerevisiae L40 cells were transformed with the plasmid. A library of human brain cDNAs in pACT was then introduced to the transformants, and the colonies resistant to the His marker were selected. Among the 5 × 106 cells transformed in total, 87 colonies were His-positive. After the β-galactosidase assay of the colonies, 5 positive clones were obtained and identified as the same clones by DNA sequencing analysis. A clone was termed TOK-1 (ptwenty-one and CDK-associated protein-1) and characterized in this study. The TOK-1 cDNA isolated contained 1,272 nucleotides and encoded 320 amino acids without the putative first methionine. After an EST data base search, two types of cDNA homologous to the cloned TOK-1 cDNA were found. One clone was TOK-1 cDNA with an extra 18 bases at the 5′ end encoding 322 amino acids, and the other, encoding 314 amino acids, was a splicing isoform of TOK-1, changing after amino acid 259. The former of the original isolate was named TOK-1α, and the splicing form was named TOK-1β (Fig.1). TOK-1β cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction with desired primers from the TOK-1β DNA sequence using human brain cDNAs as a template. Although there was no in-frame stop codon upstream of the first methionine of cDNA clones obtained, the nucleotide sequences around the putative first methionine were well matched with the Kozak consensus sequence (31Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cDNAs encode full-size TOK-1α and TOK-1β. There were no unique structural motifs therein.Figure 1Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of TOK-1 α. A, nucleotide and amino acid sequences of TOK-1α and TOK-1β are shown. The plausible initiation and stop codons are boxed. A putative nuclear localization signal is underlined. The polyadenylation signal are indicated by a hatched square.

Open boxes indicate regions of TOK-1α and TOK-1β that contain the same amino acids (aa), and the hatched boxesrepresent the regions containing unique amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of TOK-1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis in various human and mouse tissues using a common or specific probe to TOK-1α and TOK-1β. The common probe to TOK-1α and TOK-1β gave 1.5- and weak 3.0-kilobase mRNA (Fig.2 A, TOK-1α, β). By using a specific probe to TOK-1α and TOK-1β, a TOK-1α mRNA of 1.5 kilobases was expressed highly in skeletal muscle, and TOK-1β mRNA of 1.5 kilobase was expressed highly in skeletal muscle and the heart, moderately in the placenta and pancreas, and weakly in the brain, kidney, and liver, the patterns of which were similar to those of p21 (Fig. 2 A, TOK-1α, TOK-1β, and p21, respectively). A polyclonal antibody against TOK-1 was prepared by using recombinant TOK-1α expressed in E. coli and purified as an immunogen to the rat. In Western blot analyses using the polyclonal anti-TOK-1 antibody, two distinct proteins of 50 and 45 kDa were detected in human 293T cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). When an excess amount of the recombinant TOK-1α was added to the reaction with the antibody, both the 50- and 45-kDa proteins disappeared (Fig.2 B, lane 2), and both proteins were thus identified as endogenous TOK-1α or TOK-1β. Expression vectors for TOK-1α and TOK-1β were transfected to 293T cells, and the cell extract was blotted with the anti-TOK-1 antibody (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 4). Proteins of 50 and 45 kDa were detected in TOK-1α- and TOK-1β-transfected cells, respectively. The results suggest that the TOK-1α and TOK-1β cDNAs cloned correspond to the 1.5-kilobase mRNAs encoding the 50 and 45 kDa proteins, respectively. To see the expression of TOK-1 during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were treated with mimosine to restore the cells at the G1/S boundary. Then the total RNAs and proteins were extracted from the cells at various times after mimosine release, and Northern and Western blotting analyses were carried out (Fig.3, A and B, respectively). To confirm that the cells were synchronized by this procedure, DNA from an aliquot of cells was stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 C). Cells entered the S phase at 6 h after mimosine release, then entered the G2/M phase from 12 to 18 h and reentered the G0/G1 phase after 30 h. Northern blot analysis showed that TOK-1α mRNA was expressed after the G2/M phase and peaked before the S phase of the cell cycle. TOK-1β mRNA, on the other hand, was expressed during the cell cycle with a tendency to the pattern of TOK-1α. The p21 mRNA was expressed throughout the cell cycle. At the protein level, however, distinct expression patterns among TOK-1α, TOK-1β, and p21 were observed. Both TOK-1α and p21 were prominently expressed at the boundary of G1/S of the cell cycle (Fig.3 B, lane 8), whereas TOK-1β was expressed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3 B). The different patterns between RNA and protein levels of TOK-1β and p21 may be due to the modification of proteins to affect their stabilization. To determine the TOK-1/p21 binding domains on both of the proteins, GST fusion proteins of various deletion mutants of TOK-1α, TOK-1β, and p21 were constructed to be expressed in E. coli and purified by a GST affinity column. GST- TOK-1α or TOK-1β was subsequently treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to release GST-free TOK-1α or TOK-1β. GST-p21 or its deletion mutants were incubated with GST-free TOK-1α or TOK-1β and then trapped on the glutathione-Sepharose resin. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the column were recovered and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-TOK-1 antibody. The presence of GST-p21 and GST-p21 deletion mutants was first confirmed by blotting against an anti-GST antibody (Fig.4 middle). TOK-1α bound to the wild type and the C-proximal region of GST-p21 but not to the N-terminal half of p21, which includes the regions bound by cyclin and CDK (Fig. 4). Fine deletion mutants of the C-proximal region of GST-p21 indicated that TOK-1α bound to a region spanning amino acids 149 to 164 of p21, which included the region bound by PCNA and cyclin. To see the interaction domain of TOK-1 with p21, the wild type or deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged TOK-1α or TOK-1β was incubated with GST wild type p21 (GST-p21 wt) or the GST-N-terminal half of p21 (GST-p21 1–158) and then applied to glutathione-Sepharose resin. The proteins bound to the resin were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5). The wild type and the mutants containing a region spanning amino acids 161 to 259 of TOK-1α were recovered from the resin bound by the GST-p21 wt but not GST-p21 1–158 (Fig. 5, lanes 1–10). Contrary to TOK-1α, neither the wild type nor the deletion mutants of TOK-1β, including even the mutant C containing the region spanning amino acids 161 to 258 common to TOK-1α and TOK-1β, bound to GST-p21 (Fig. 5, lanes 11–16). These results suggest that p21 directly binds to the region spanning amino acids 161 to 259 of TOK-1α and that the C-proximal region of TOK-1β spanning amino acids 259 to 322 interferes with the binding between p21 and TOK-1β. To determine the cellular localization of TOK-1α or TOK-1β, an expression vector for FLAG-tagged TOK-1α or TOK-1β was transfected to monkey COS1 cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were stained with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the proteins were visualized under a confocal razor microscopy. Cell nuclei were identified by Hoechst staining. Both FLAG-TOK-1α and -TOK-1β were observed in the nuclei but not in the cytoplasm (Fig.6 A). When both p21 fused to HA and FLAG-TOK-1α or -TOK-1β were cotransfected to COS1 cells and detected by the rhodamine- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies, respectively, the TOK-1α or TOK-1β (green) and p21 (red) were co-localized in nuclei as shown by the yellow color (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that although TOK-1β does not directly bind to p21, both exist in the same region or near regions in cells. Expression vectors driven by the CMV promoter for FLAG-TOK-1α and various amounts of p21 or its deletion mutant containing amino acids 1 to 152 (p21 ()) were transfected to human 293T cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and the proteins in the extract were first precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitates were subjected to Western blot analyses using an anti-p21 or CDK2 antibody (Fig. 7). Since the immunogen to the anti-p21 antibody used here (Transduction Laboratories C24420) was the peptide spanning amino acids 1–150 of p21, the expressions of both wild-type p21 and p21 () in transfected cells were confirmed by Western blotting with this antibody (Fig. 7, second autoradiogram from the top, lanes 8–10, and data not shown). Relatively constant amounts of the introduced FLAG-TOK-1α were detected in the precipitate with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7, lanes 1–5). Furthermore, p21, but not p21 (), and the endogenous CDK2 were detected in a dose-dependent manner in the precipitate with the anti-FLAG antibody in FLAG-TOK-1α-transfected cells but not in non-transfected cells (Fig. 7, lanes 2–5and 6, respectively). It was noted that an active phosphorylated form of CDK2 was precipitated much more than was an inactive unphosphorylated CDK2 in Flag-TOK-1α-transfected cells (Fig.7, lanes 2–4), whereas the inactive unphosphorylated CDK2 was more precipitated in cells transfected with p21 alone (Fig. 7,lane 11). By using recombinant CDK2 and TOK-1α expressed in and purified from E. coli, no direct binding between the two proteins was observed (data not shown). The results suggested that TOK-1α makes a ternary complex with p21 and CDK2 via p21 in cells. Human HeLa-Tet-on cells that harbor tetracycline/doxcycline-dependent reverse-repressor (CLONTECH) were transfected with a expression vector for TOK-1α or p21 under the control of a doxcycline-dependent CMV promoter (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 33Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar), together with pSV-bsr, an expression vector for blasticidin S-resistant gene, and were cultured in the presence of blasticidin S. Then, blasticidin S-resistant HeLa cell lines that express TOK-1α or p21 in the presence of doxcycline were established. Inducibility of the desired proteins in the cells was tested in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml of doxcycline by Western blotting (Fig.8). Cells harboring the vector alone, HV9, expressed neither TOK-1α nor p21 irrespective of the presence of doxcycline (Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 1and 2). Two cell lines, HTα39 and HTα52, expressed TOK-1α only in the presence of doxcycline (Fig. 8 A,lanes 3–6). HP28 and HP8 expressed p21 only and highly in the presence of doxcycline (Fig. 8 B, lanes 3–6). All these cell lines, however, equally expressed both inactive and active forms of CDK2 under both conditions of doxcycline (Fig.8 C). To determine the biological functions of TOK-1, the effect of TOK-1α on the inhibitory effect of p21 on CDK2 kinase activity was examined by three procedures. First, HV9, HTα39, and HP28 cell extracts were prepared from cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxcycline, and they were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CDK2 antibody. The precipitates were reacted with [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1 as a substrate (Fig.9 A). Autoradiogram and its quantitation result are shown. HV9 cells harboring the vector alone did not change H1 kinase activity irrespective of the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml doxcycline, and HP28 cells, p21-expressing cells, inhibited H1 kinase activity of CDK2 (Fig. 9 A,lanes, 1, 2, 5, and 6). HTα39 cells, on the other hand, also inhibited H1 kinase activity in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxcycline less than did p21 (Fig.9 A, lanes 3 and 4). We then tested the activity of TOK-1α toward CDK2 activity by the ectopic expression system. HV9, HP28, and HP8 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus to express TOK-1α (Ad-TOK-1α) or with an adenovirus harboring the vector alone (Ad-V), and they were cultured in either absence or presence of low amounts (0.02 and 0.2 μg/ml) of doxcycline, where the inhibition of H1 kinase activity by induced p21 was approximately 30% that of 1 μg/ml doxcycline. Cell extracts were then prepared and used for the H1 kinase assay of CDK2 (Fig.9 B). HV9 cells infected with Ad-TOK-1a showed kinase activities that were decreased to a similar extent in all of the concentrations of doxcycline used, whereas Ad-V-infected cells had no effect (Fig. 9 B, lanes 1–6). As shown in Fig.9 A, the H1 kinase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in HP28 and HP8 cells infected with Ad-V, and infection of Ad-TOK-1α further inhibited H1 kinase activity (Fig. 9 B, lanes 7–18). These results suggest that TOK-1α alone moderately inhibits CDK2 activity and/or enhances the inhibitory activity of endogenous p21 toward CDK2. To assess this possibility more precisely, a reconstitution experiment was carried out. Cell extracts from HV9 cells were reacted with the purified recombinant TOK-1α with or without the purified recombinant p21, then immunoprecipitated with the anti-CDK2 antibody, and their H1 kinase activities were examined (Fig. 9 C). The results clearly showed that TOK-1α alone did not inhibit H1 kinase activity of CDK2 over the range of TOK-1α used (Fig. 9 C, lanes 1–4). The inhibitory activity of p21 toward CDK2 was, however, further enhanced by the recombinant TOK-1α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9, lanes 5–8). This result suggests that TOK-1α enhances the p21 inhibitory activity of CDK2s. We have described the cloning and characterization of novel proteins, TOK-1α and TOK-1β. TOK-1β is a splicing form of TOK-1α in which two-thirds amino acids from the N terminus are identical to those of TOK-1α. These were found to be co-localized in cell nuclei. TOK-1α, but not TOK-1β, was expressed in the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle at the same timing as that of p21 and bound directly to p21 both in vitro and in vivo. TOK-1α also preferentially bound to an active form of CDK2 (34Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) via p21 in a ternary complex in cells. Since p21 alone tended to bind to the inactive form of CDK2, TOK-1α was assumed to modulate a function or status of p21 when both were in a complex. TOK-1α enhanced p21 activity to inhibit H1 kinase activity of CDK2 in three types of experiments in which the precipitates of cell extracts with an anti-CDK2 antibody were used as the kinase source on an exogenously added histone H1 substrate, suggesting that TOK-1α helps p21 to absorb the active form of CDK2 in cells. TOK-1 expressed in doxcycline-induced or TOK-1α adenovirus-infected human cells moderately inhibited the H1 kinase activity of CDK2 by itself, whereas TOK-1α alone purified from E. coli did not show any inhibitory activity but still enhanced the inhibitory activity of p21 toward CDK2 in a reconstitution system. This discrepancy between TOK-1α in human cells and the recombinant TOK-1α from E. coli cells may be explained as follows: the modified form of TOK-1α due to phosphorylation or acetylation in human cells efficiently binds to p21 endogenously present in a low amount but sufficient to inhibit CDK2, whereas the unmodified form of TOK-1α inE. coli has no or only weak activity. Alternatively, another protein or other proteins associated with TOK-1α present in the immunoprecipitates might be necessary for TOK-1α to enhance p21 activity. Although two-thirds of the N-terminal amino acids of TOK-1β were identical to those of TOK-1α, p21 bound to this identical region of only TOK-1α. This suggests that the different one-third C-terminal amino acids of TOK-1β from that of TOK-1α interfere with the binding activity of TOK-1β toward p21, probably due to the tertiary structure of the protein. TOK-1β was, however, co-localized with p21 in cell nuclei. It is plausible to speculate from these phenomena that TOK-1β affects or modulates the some functions of TOK-1α or p21. Originally, p21 was reported to inhibit CDK activity (4Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar), and it was later found that p21 stimulated the assembly of CDK4/cyclin D and translocation of CDK4-cyclin D to the nucleus (35LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). To do this, the CDK-cyclin complex binds to the N-proximal region of p21. In addition to these N-terminal functions of p21, p21 was assumed to have other functions due to the interaction of proteins with the C-proximal region of p21. These include PCNA (12Chen J.

It would therefore be interesting to examine whether TOK-1α interacts with or competitively interferes with SEN/TAF1 or calmodulin on p21. Taken together, TOK-1α is a new type of modulator of p21.

https://openalex.org/W2085208129,"Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, generally functions as an antioxidant by directly reacting with reactive oxygen intermediates and has a vital role in defenses against oxidative stress. However, ascorbic acid also has pro-oxidant properties and may cause apoptosis of lymphoid and myeloid cells. The present study shows that dehydroascorbate, the oxidized form of vitamin C, stimulates the antioxidant defenses of cells, preferentially importing dehydroascorbate over ascorbate. While 200-800 μM vitamin C caused apoptosis of Jurkat and H9 human T lymphocytes, pretreatment with 200-1000 μM dehydroascorbate stimulated activity of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and transaldolase, elevated intracellular glutathione levels, and inhibited H2O2-induced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell death. A 3.3-fold maximal glutathione elevation was observed after 48 h stimulation with 800 μM dehydroascorbate. In itself, dehydroascorbate did not affect cytosolic or mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediate levels as monitored by flow cytometry using oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes. The data reveal a novel mechanism for increasing glutathione levels through stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and identify dehydroascorbate as an antioxidant for cells susceptible to the pro-oxidant and proapoptotic properties of vitamin C.—Puskas, F., Gergely, P., Jr., Banki, K., Perl, A.

https://openalex.org/W2132279779,"Adenosine released during cardiac ischemia exerts a marked protective effect in the heart that is mediated by the A(1) and A(3) subtypes of adenosine receptors. The signaling pathways activated by these adenosine receptors have now been characterized in a chick embryo ventricular myocyte culture model of cardioprotection against ischemia. Selective A(1) and A(3) receptor agonists were shown to activate phospholipases C and D, respectively, to achieve their distinct cardioprotective effects. The specificity of the A(3) receptor-phospholipase D interaction was also demonstrated in chick embryo atrial myocytes (which do not express endogenous A(3) receptors) that had been transfected with a vector encoding the human A(3) receptor. Activation of both endogenous A(1) and A(3) receptors in ventricular myocytes resulted in a protective response greater than that induced by stimulation of either receptor alone. Agonists that activate both adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors may thus prove beneficial for the treatment of myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1967261224,"Mechanisms accounting for the cellular entry of calcium that mediates cellular proliferation and apoptosis have been obscure. Previously we reported selective augmentation of type 3 inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R3) in lymphocytes undergoing programmed cell death, which was prevented by antisense constructs to IP(3)R3. We now report increases in mRNA and protein levels for IP(3)R3 associated with cell death in several apoptotic paradigms in diverse tissues. Elevations of IP(3)R3 occur during developmental apoptosis in early postnatal cerebellar granule cells, dorsal root ganglia, embryonic hair follicles, and intestinal villi. Neurotoxic damage elicited by the glutamate agonist kainate is also associated with IP(3)R3 augmentation. In chick dorsal root ganglia neurons undergoing apoptosis due to deprivation of nerve growth factor, levels of IP(3)R3 are selectively increased and cell death is selectively prevented by antisense oligonucleotides to IP(3)R3. Thus, IP(3)R3 appears to participate actively in cell death in a diversity of tissues."

Using a two-hybrid screening in yeast, a novel protein, termed Hklp2 (humankinesin-like protein2), was identified and shown to interact with the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of pKi-67. Hklp2 has 1388 amino acids and shows a striking similarity (a 53% identity in amino acids) to Xklp2, a plus-end directed kinesin-like motor found inXenopus.

That the interaction was striking in the mitotic extract was also verified. In addition, immunofluorescence using specific antibodies revealed an association between pKi-67 and Hklp2 at the periphery of mitotic chromosomes, largely in close proximity to the centromeres.

These findings suggest that pKi-67 is involved in the progression of mitosis via its interaction with Hklp2. forkhead-associated glutathioneS-transferase The Ki-67 antigen (pKi-67) was originally identified as an antigen for a monoclonal antibody raised against the nuclear extract from a Hodgkin's lymphoma derived cell line and is characterized as a class of proteins that are localized around mitotic chromosomes (1Gerdes J. Schwab U. Lemke H. Stein H. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Because of this, it is assumed that pKi-67 is involved in mitotic chromosome organization. Moreover, pKi-67 is a convenient cell proliferation marker, because its expression is restricted to growing cells (2Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.-H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). Although the recent identification and characterization of a marsupial counterpart of pKi-67, which is referred to as chmadrin, suggests a role of pKi-67 in the organization of higher order chromatin structure (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar), the actual function of the molecule in the cell cycle progression is presently unclear. To better understand the role of pKi-67 in the cell cycle, a two-hybrid screening from a HeLa cDNA library was carried out using the N-terminal portion of pKi-67 as the bait. This portion is well conserved between human pKi-67 and chmadrin (the putative ortholog found in marsupial cells) and contains the FHA1 domain. It was originally reported that the FHA domain constituted a conserved region that is found in a subset of forkhead-type transcription factors (4Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The sequence profile was also found in variety of proteins with diverse functions (transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and so on) (4Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In several instances, the FHA domain was shown to preferentially recognize partner proteins when they are phosphorylated (5Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and, thus, it is currently thought to be a general phosphopeptide recognition motif (7Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A search for the interaction partner(s) of the FHA domain of pKi-67, which might be phosphorylated, is an intriguing issue because the interaction would be a significant component of the regulation of the cell cycle progression. Here, we report the interaction between the FHA domain of pKi-67 and a novel kinesin-like protein (herein referred to as Hklp2), which is a human homolog of Xklp2 (X enopus kinesin-like protein 2) (8Boleti H. Karsenti E. Vernos I. Cell. 1996; 84: 49-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Xklp2 is a plus-end directed kinesin-like motor that has been reported to be required in centrosome separation and the maintenance of spindle bipolarity during mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts (8Boleti H. Karsenti E. Vernos I. Cell. 1996; 84: 49-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because pKi-67 is localized around mitotic chromosomes (9Verheijen R. Kuijpers H.J. van Driel R. Beck J.L. van Dierendonck J.H. Brakenhoff G.J. Ramaekers F.C. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar), Hklp2 might also function at a point near mitotic chromosomes, via its interaction with pKi-67. We also characterized the mode of interaction between the FHA domain of pKi-67 and Hklp2. As described previously for the FHA domains of other proteins (5Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F.

Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the FHA domain of pKi-67 preferentially was likely to recognize the phosphorylated form of the partner protein, Hklp2. Our findings provide a possible molecular link between pKi-67 and the cell cycle and further provide a new clue to understand dynamism of mitotic chromosomes. This study will also be of use for understanding the mode of interaction between the FHA domain and specific partner phosphoproteins. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed essentially as described previously (10Field S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain Y190, which expresses the fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and Ki-FHA (residues 1–99 of pKi-67) was transformed with a HeLa cDNA library constructed in a plasmid pACT (purchased from CLONTECH) and plated on selective medium supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Bait loss was carried out by successive inoculation with a medium devoid of leucine. One of the clones obtained by the two-hybrid screen (clone 3α) showed a striking similarity to Xklp2 (8Boleti H. Karsenti E. Vernos I. Cell. 1996; 84: 49-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The clone spanned the region that corresponds to approximately one-third from the C-terminal end of the coding region of Hklp2. Using the sequence of Xklp2 as a query, the human expressed sequence tag data base was searched with the result that clone AA332437was likely to encode a portion of the more upstream region of Hklp2. The 300-base pair fragments from 5′- and 3′-end of clone 3α andAA332437, respectively, were labeled with DIG-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and were used to screen the entire coding sequence of Hklp2 from HeLa cDNA library constructed in λZAPII (Stratagene). The acquired clone (clone 18-1) did not contain the first methionine. To recover cDNA sequences 5′ to clone 18-1, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was conducted using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends System, version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Hklp2-specific antisense primers used were GSP1 (5′-CTTCTGCATGGGTATC-3′), GSP2 (5′-AGGGAGGTCCGTATATTCAC-3′), and GSP3 (5′-GCATGAGACCTAGACGATTC-3′). GST fusions of Ki-FHA (residues 1–99 of pKi-67) and Hklp2-tail (residues 1132–1388) were created by cloning the appropriate insert into pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MBP fusion of Hklp2 (1132–1388) and histidine-tagged Hklp2 (1017–1237) were created by cloning the appropriate inserts into pMALc2 (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and pRSET (Invitrogen), respectively. Proteins were expressed in strain BL21 (DE3) grown at 20 °C and purified by the manufacturers' recommended protocols. Antisera were prepared by immunizing two rabbits (kbs:JW) (purchased from Kitayama Labes Co., Ltd.) with purified GST-Hklp2-tail. Antibodies were affinity purified against MBP-Hklp2-tail immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane by a previously described procedure (11Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described previously (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar), except that cold (−20 °C) methanol was used for the fixative. Anti-Hklp2 antibodies were used at 2 μg/ml. The anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:200. MIB-1 (Immunotech), a monoclonal antibody against pKi-67, was used at 1:100. Human autoimmune antibodies against centromere proteins (12Yoda K. Nakamura T. Masumoto H. Suzuki N. Kitagawa K. Nakano M. Sinjo A. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5169-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Hiroshi Masumoto (Nagoya University) and were used at 1:160. In the experiments presented in Fig.3 C, nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml for 3 h before fixation. Deconvolution microscopy was carried out with a Delta Vision System (Applied Precision, Inc.), and the acquired digital images were processed by using Adobe Photoshop software. HeLa cells, at a 70% confluence, were incubated with 50 ng/ml of nocodazole for 14 h, and mitotic cells were collected by mechanical shake-off. To prepare cell extracts, asynchronous or mitotic HeLa cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, and 1 mm KH2PO4) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before resuspending in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) to give 2 × 104 cells/μl. Cell suspensions were left on ice for 20 min and passed 10 times through a 27-G needle, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until used for kinase assay. To examine the activity of the cell extracts with respect to the phosphorylation of Hklp2, purified His-Hklp2-tail (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with the extracts in the presence of 10 μm ATP and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. As control substrates, histone H1 and GST (0.5 mg/ml) were used. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer containing SDS. Samples were then heated for 5 min at 60 °C before analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. HeLa cells (asynchronous or mitotic-arrested) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in EB150 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) to give 2 × 104 cells/μl. The cell suspensions were left on ice for 20 min, passed through a 27-G needle 10 times, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as EB150 extracts. EB150 extracts were incubated with GST or GST-Ki-FHA coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GS-4B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed extensively with EB150. Associated proteins were boiled out in sample buffer and separated in 2–15% gradient gel (Multigel 2/15, Daiichi Pure Chemicals). Hklp2 was detected by Western blotting using anti-Hklp2 antibodies at 0.5 μg/ml. To identify cellular proteins that might interact with the FHA domain of pKi-67, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA library was carried out using residues 1–99 of human pKi-67 as bait. From the ∼5 × 106 cDNA clones screened, 10 positive clones were obtained. Sequence analyses revealed that these clones could be placed in one of two possible classes. One class (containing five clones), which corresponded to a novel RNA-binding protein, which will be described elsewhere. 2M. Takagi, M. Sueishi, T. Saiwaki, and Y. Yoneda, manuscript in preparation. Here, we focus on the other class (containing two clones). A full-length sequence was first obtained using the strategy summarized in Fig.1 A. The predicted protein showed striking similarity to Xklp2 (53% identity in amino acids over their entire length) and was therefore termed Hklp2 (humankinesin-like protein2). Hklp2 and Xklp2 share some structural features; kinesin motor domain at the N-terminal portion, coiled-coil structure at the rest of the motor domain, and leucine zipper motif at the C-terminal portion (Fig. 1 B). To map the interaction domain of Hklp2, a deletion analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system was carried out. For this analysis, deletion derivatives of Hklp2 (depicted in Fig.2 A) were fused to the GAL4 activation domain and transformed into yeast strain Y190 together with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion of the residues 1–99 of pKi-67 (Ki-FHA). This experiment indicated that residues 1017–1238 of Hklp2 were sufficient for interaction with Ki-FHA. We were not able to narrow the interaction domain further, which suggests that the entire sequence was essential for the interaction. When secondary structural prediction methods (13Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) were applied to this region, seven α-helices, inserted between turns, were predicted (Fig. 2 B). In the first, second, and seventh helices, leucine or isoleucine residues were predicted to be clustered and to form a hydrophobic surface on each helix (Fig. 2 C). A protein conformation properly mediated by these leucine zipper-like structures might be significant, in terms of its interaction with Ki-FHA. To confirm that the interaction observed above is not merely specific to yeast cells, we performed an in vitro binding assay using purified recombinant proteins. GST fused to Ki-FHA (GST-Ki-FHA) was expressed in Escherichia coli, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with purified histidine-tagged Hklp2 (1017–1238). The matrix-attached Hklp2 (1017–1238) was detected by Western blotting. Hklp2 (1017–1238) was retained on beads coupled to GST-Ki-FHA but not on control beads (Fig.2 D). These data are consistent with Ki-FHA interacting with Hklp2, both in yeast and in vitro. As an approach to understanding the biological significance of the interaction between the FHA domain of pKi-67 and Hklp2, the subcellular localization of Hklp2 was examined using polyclonal antibodies raised against its C-terminal portion (residues 1132–1338). The antibodies specifically recognized a 160-kDa protein from the total HeLa extract by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A). In the interphase, Hklp2 was detected on centrosomes as described for Xklp2 (data not shown). From prometaphase to metaphase, Hklp2 was detected primarily on the mitotic spindles emanating from the spindle pole regions (Fig.3 B). Hklp2 was not uniformly located over the entire length of the spindles. A certain population of Hklp2 in metaphase was localized in the equatorial region, distinct from the microtubules (Fig. 3 B, panels d and e). It is likely that the population is integrated in, or closely associated with, the chromatin structure (Fig. 3 B, panels d–f). When the mitotic spindles were disrupted by nocodazole before fixing the cells, the chromatin-integrating population of Hklp2 was detected in the form of dots on mitotic chromosomes (Fig.3 C). These dots were not co-localized with but were close to the centromeres (Fig. 3 C). In anaphase, Hklp2 was also detected at the equatorial region of the spindle in a punctate pattern (Fig. 3 B, panels g and h), raising the possibility that Hklp2 may be involved in the sliding of antiparallel microtubules in anaphase B. Considering the fact that pKi-67 is localized around the mitotic chromosomes (9Verheijen R. Kuijpers H.J. van Driel R. Beck J.L. van Dierendonck J.H. Brakenhoff G.J. Ramaekers F.C. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar), pKi-67 and Hklp2 could, in theory, be co-localized at the surface of the chromosomes where mitotic spindles are pointed to. In fact, it is likely that a certain population of Hklp2 is colocalized with pKi-67 on mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 3 D, yellow). A previously published report (7Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) concluded that the FHA domain interacts preferentially with a phosphorylated peptide. We examined the issue of whether this was also the case for the FHA domain of pKi-67. We first asked whether the partner protein, Hklp2, was modified differently through the cell cycle. When the electrophoretic mobilities of Hklp2 derived from differently synchronized HeLa cells were compared, the mitotic Hklp2 showed a slower mobility than the interphasic Hklp2 (Fig.4 A). Whether this was due to mitosis-specific phosphorylation was not determined in this study. We next examined the issue of whether Hklp2 is phosphorylated within the interaction domain to pKi-67 (residues 1017–1238). When histidine-tagged Hklp2 (1017–1238) was purified and incubated with differently synchronized HeLa extracts in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, the protein was labeled only when the mitotic HeLa extract was used, suggesting that Hklp2 is phosphorylated within this region in the mitotic phase. The possible presence of other phosphorylation sites in the Hklp2 sequence, however, cannot be excluded. To test the possibility that the interaction between pKi-67 and Hklp2 is regulated through the cell cycle, cell extracts were prepared from asynchronized or mitotic HeLa cells. These extracts were then incubated with a GST fusion of Ki-FHA immobilized on Sepharose beads. After incubation, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, and Hklp2 was detected with anti-Hklp2 antibodies. The slowly migrating form of Hklp2 contained in the mitotic extract was pulled down more efficiently than the quickly migrating form of Hklp2. A novel kinesin-like protein, referred to as Hklp2, has been identified and shown to interact with the FHA domain of pKi-67 (Ki-FHA). The interaction occurred efficiently in the mitotic phase, during which Hklp2 was likely to be phosphorylated. These findings suggest that the Ki-67 antigen might play an crucial role in the progression of mitosis, thus providing a clue to our understanding of the strict correlation between the expression of pKi-67 and cell proliferation. Further analysis of the mode of interaction between Ki-FHA and Hklp2, including an investigation of whether phosphorylation itself is essential, will obviously be required for a more complete understanding of the biological significance of the interaction. Because the phosphoproteins that are recognized by the FHA domain have, thus far, been specified only in limited cases (5Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), these data will be also helpful in exploring the general mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent protein recognition mediated by the FHA domain. Given the mitotic localization of pKi-67, it is possible that it co-operates with Hklp2 on the surface of mitotic chromosomes to allow mitosis to proceed. Given the fact that Hklp2 is a plus end-directed motor by analogy to XKlp2 (8Boleti H. Karsenti E. Vernos I. Cell. 1996; 84: 49-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Hklp2 could generate “polar ejection force” (14Fuller M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by acting along chromosome arms via an interaction with pKi-67. However, this notion is apparently inconsistent, given the observed localization of Hklp2 (Fig. 3 C), in which a certain population of this molecule is associated with chromosomes in a punctate pattern but are not distributed throughout the entire chromosome arms. It is possible that we overlooked detecting the localization of Hklp2 on the chromosome arms because of its low levels in that area. Alternatively, our protocol (nocodazole treatment and methanol fixation) might disrupt the actual localization. In any case, it would be intriguing to examine the issue of whether the working point of Hklp2 exists on the mitotic chromosome arms. In an early study, we identified a molecule, termed chmadrin, from a marsupial cell line (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Chmadrin shows certain similarities to pKi-67 in its primary structure and cellular localization and thus is considered to be a marsupial counterpart of pKi-67. The C-terminal portion of chmadrin has a novel domain that is characterized by repetitive occurrences of LR (leucine and arginine) pairs with irregular spacing. The domain, called the LR domain, gave rise to severe heterochromatin formation when overexpressed (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar) and, as a result, can be implicated in the organization of higher order chromatin structure. The C-terminal portion of human pKi-67 also possesses the LR domain and, in fact, has the activity to drive heterochromatin formation in a manner similar to that of chmadrin. 3M. Takagi and Y. Yoneda, unpublished observation. Thus, pKi-67 appears to play a role in chromatin condensation in its C-terminal region (LR domain). If pKi-67 serves as an adapter between chromosomes and the mitotic apparatus in its N-terminal region (FHA domain), this protein may be a multifunctional protein that acts throughout the cell cycle. We are grateful to Dr. Hiroshi Masumoto (Nagoya University) for providing us with antibodies against centromere proteins."

However, ascorbic acid also has pro-oxidant properties and may cause apoptosis of lymphoid and myeloid cells. The present study shows that dehydroascorbate, the oxidized form of vitamin C, stimulates the antioxidant defenses of cells, preferentially importing dehydroascorbate over ascorbate. While 200-800 microM vitamin C caused apoptosis of Jurkat and H9 human T lymphocytes, pretreatment with 200-1000 microM dehydroascorbate stimulated activity of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and transaldolase, elevated intracellular glutathione levels, and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell death. A 3. 3-fold maximal glutathione elevation was observed after 48 h stimulation with 800 microM dehydroascorbate. In itself, dehydroascorbate did not affect cytosolic or mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediate levels as monitored by flow cytometry using oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes. The data reveal a novel mechanism for increasing glutathione levels through stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and identify dehydroascorbate as an antioxidant for cells susceptible to the pro-oxidant and proapoptotic properties of vitamin C."

In our previous in vitro studies we have mapped the 5′ terminus of the ANK-1 mRNA in erythrocyte RNA and characterized the ANK-1 promoter sequences (15Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 271-bp minimal promoter was shown to direct high level expression of a luciferase reporter gene in erythroid cell lines (K562 or HEL) but not in non-erythroid cell lines (HeLa, the neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, and the murine myoblast cell line, CLCIL). Mutation of a GATA-1 binding site at position −127 abolished luciferase expression in K562 cells while co-transfection of anANK-1 luciferase reporter gene and a plasmid containing theGATA-1 gene into HeLa cells resulted in transactivation of the reporter gene. Mutation of a CACCC site at position −186 that binds BKLF resulted in a 50% decrease in reporter gene expression (15Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have used transgenic mice to characterize expression from the ankyrin promoter in erythroid and non-erythroid cells and at different developmental stages. Transgenic mouse lines containing the minimal ANK-1 promoter linked to a human Aγ-globin reporter gene expressed Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA in an erythroid-specific, position-independent, copy number-dependent manner in yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult erythroid cells. In transgenic mice that contained the human Ank/Aγ-globin gene linked to the HS2 site from the β-globin LCR (16Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA was expressed in yolk sac and fetal liver-derived erythroid cells at levels similar to that of animals with the Ank/Aγ-globin transgene, but was absent or expressed at lower levels in adult erythroid cells. We conclude from these data that the minimal ankyrin promoter contains all the sequences necessary and sufficient for erythroid-specific, position-independent, and copy number-dependent expression. The failure of the β-globin HS2 site to increase the expression of the Ank/Aγ-globin transgene suggests that the HS2 cannot act as an enhancer for the minimal ANK-1 promoter. To generate Ank/Aγ-globin, a 276-bp SmaI/BglII fragment containing the ANK-1 promoter (−291 to −20 + polylinker sequence) was excised from a pGL2 vector (15Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1938-bpBglII/HindIII Aγ-globin fragment from plasmid 72βsp + Aγ (described in Sabatino et al.) (17Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P.

A triple ligation consisting of both fragments andSmaI/HindIII-digested pSP72 was used to generate the Ank/Aγ-globin plasmid. The Ank/Aγ-globin gene (2244 bp) was excised from the plasmid with EcoRV and HindIII for microinjection. HS2 Ank/Aγ-globin was generated by a four-part ligation using a 712-bp XhoI/HincII fragment containing HS2 (GenBank™ accession number 455025, coordinates 8486–9177 + polylinker sequence), the 1938-bp BglII/HindIII fragment containing the Aγ-globin gene, the 276-bpSmaI/BglII fragment containing the ankyrin promoter, and the vector pBluescript II KS + cut withXhoI/HindIII. The 2917-bp HS2 Ank/Aγ-globin gene was excised from this plasmid withScaI and HindIII for microinjection. Both constructs were sequenced to confirm that the ANK-1 promoter was correctly fused to the Aγ-globin gene. Transgenic mice were generated as described in Hogan et al. (18Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were collected from superovulated FVB/N female mice (Taconic Farms) approximately 9 h after mating to CBy6F1 male mice (Jackson Laboratory). Fragments for microinjection were separated on an agarose gel, electroeluted, and purified with an Elutip-d minicolumn (Schleicher and Schuell, Inc.). The fragments were diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μl in 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and ∼2 pl was injected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs. The injected eggs were transferred to pseudopregnant CByB6/F1 foster mothers. Founder animals were identified by Southern analysis of DNA extracted from tail biopsies by probing with an Ank/Aγ-globin probe. Founder animals were crossed to FVB/N mice for propagation and developmental studies. Copy number was determined by comparing the γ-globin signals from Southern blot analysis of transgenic mouse and K562 DNA (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Statistical analysis of copy number and expression data was analyzed by linear regression with the Graph Pad Prism Version 2.0 software. Reticulocytes were obtained by collecting 200 μl of blood from phlebotomized animals. Tissues were collected from anesthetized animals perfused with 50–60 ml of saline, and the tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was extracted from adult reticulocytes, 10.5 dpc of embryo blood cells, 13.5 dpc of fetal livers, and tissues using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications (Life Technologies, Inc.). Linear DNA templates for the RNase protection assay were prepared by EcoRI (Ank/Aγ) and HindIII (mouse α) digestion of cesium chloride-purified plasmid preparations. The templates were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The linear DNA template for the mouse β-actin gene was obtained from the MAXIscript in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Inc.). 32P-Labeled RNA probes were transcribed using this same kit. The hybridization of the probe and RNA (1–10 μg) was carried out overnight according to the standard procedure of the RPA II of the RNase protection assay kit (Ambion, Inc.). RNase digestion was performed using an RNase A/RNase T1 mixture in RNase digestion buffer (Ambion, Inc.), and the protected fragments were separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To quantitate the levels of mRNA, the gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The relative amounts of the bands human Aγ-globin exon 2 (175 bp) and mouse α-globin exon 2 (186 bp) were estimated by the following formula: (Aγ-globin RNA/transgene copy number) × (4 mouse α-globin genes/mouse α-globin RNA). The 271-bp minimal ANK-1 promoter fragment was fused to the human Aγ-globin genomic sequence immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon (Ank/Aγ-globin) (Fig. 1 A). A second construct added 5′-HS2 of the human β-globin LCR gene immediately 5′ of Ank/ Aγ-globin (HS2 Ank/Aγ-globin) (Fig.1 B). Seventeen transgenic mouse lines were generated with the Ank/Aγ construct. Southern blot analysis determined that the transgene copy number of these lines ranged between 1 and 100 (Table I). RNase protection analysis demonstrated that 16 of these 17 lines expressed Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA in adult reticulocytes (Fig.2). The probe protects both exon 2 of the γ-globin gene and the chimeric exon 1 of the Ank/Aγ-globin gene. The size of the upper band corresponds to the predicted size for properly spliced γ-globin exon 2 (Fig. 1 C). The size of the lower band corresponds to the predicted size of properly spliced Ank/Aγ-globin exon 1 initiated at a site described previously for ANK-1 mRNA in K562 cells (15Gallagher P.G. Romana M.

An analysis of all 16 lines that expressed theAγ-globin gene demonstrated a significant exponential correlation between the copy number and transgene expression (p < 0.01; Fig. 3, bottom panel). The average level of Ank/Aγ mRNA in the 16 expressing Ank/ Aγ-globin transgenic mouse lines was 11% (±8%) that of the mouse α-globin per transgene copy (Table I). RNase protection analysis of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA levels was performed on RNA extracted from 10 different tissues from perfused mice of four different Ank/Aγ-globin lines. The Ank/Aγ-globin transgene was expressed in reticulocytes (Fig. 2), bone marrow, and spleen cells (Fig.4; TableII). Occasional Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA transcripts were detected at low levels in other tissues. However, this mRNA was always present along with mouse α-globin mRNA, and the ratio of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA to mouse α-globin mRNA was nearly the same in the tissues as the ratio in bone marrow, spleen, and reticulocyte RNA (data not shown). We conclude that these signals represent low level contamination of the tissue RNA with reticulocytes, but we cannot completely exclude low levels of expression.Table IIAnkyrin/ A γ-globin mRNA levels in transgenic mouse tissuesTissueLine LLine OLine K% Ank/ A γmRNA 2-aAnk/Aγ-globin mRNA in tissue/Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA in marrow × 100.Marrow100.00100.00100.00Spleen2.302.307.80Thymus0.031.000.24Brain0.011.600.01Heart0.333.100.16Kidney0.510.320.01Liver0.270.000.01Lung0.010.000.02Muscle3.600.520.18Testis1.060.060.012-a Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA in tissue/Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA in marrow × 100. Open table in a new tab RNA was collected from 10.5 dpc of yolk sac-derived peripheral blood cells, 13.5 dpc of fetal livers, and adult reticulocytes from seven of the Ank/Aγ-globin transgenic lines. RNase protection analysis demonstrated that Ank/Aγ was expressed at similar levels in yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult erythroid cells in all seven lines analyzed. The average levels of Ank/Aγ mRNA during development ranged between 5% and 15% that of the endogenous mouse α-globin per transgene copy (Fig.5; Table I). Hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the β-globin locus control region (LCR) has been shown to be an erythroid-specific enhancer element that reduces position effects and increases the level of expression of linked globin genes in transgenic mice. To determine whether 5′-HS2 could increase the level of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA, we fused 5′-HS2 to the Ankyrin/Aγ-globin gene and generated eight HS2 Ank/Aγ-globin transgenic mouse lines. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the copy number for the transgenic lines ranged between 1 and 39 (TableIII). RNA was isolated from 10.5 dpc of yolk sac-derived erythroid cells, 13.5 dpc of fetal liver-derived erythroid cells, and adult reticulocytes of all eight lines. RNase protection analysis demonstrated that five transgenic lines had Ank/Aγ mRNA present at an average level of 18 ± 16% the level of mouse α-globin mRNA in yolk sac-derived erythroid cells, 9 ± 8% of mouse α-globin mRNA in fetal liver-derived erythroid cells, and no Ank/Aγ mRNA in the adult reticulocytes (Fig. 6; TableIII). One transgenic line expressed Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA at all stages of development, however, the level of expression in yolk sac erythroid cells was 22% that of mouse α-globin in the yolk sac and decreased to 4% that of the mouse α-globin in adult erythroid cells (Fig. 6; Table III). In contrast to the Ank/Aγ-globin transgenic mice where 16 of 17 lines expressed the transgene, two HS2 Ank/Aγ-globin transgenic mouse lines did not express Ank/Aγ mRNA at any developmental stage (χ2 = 4.8; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6; Table III).Table IIIExpression of HS2 ankyrin/ A γ-globin in transgenic miceLineHuman γ-globin RNA/mouse α-globin RNATransgene copy no.Mean γ-globin RNA transgene copy no. in yolk sacYolk sacFetal liverAdultD0.22 ± 0.080.08 ± 0.060.04 ± 0.0120.44B0.19 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.040.00 ± 0.0030.25C0.28 ± 0.070.25 ± 0.210.00 ± 0.00390.03F0.47 ± 0.130.14 ± 0.030.00 ± 0.00140.13H0.09 ± 0.040.070.00 ± 0.00390.01J0.23 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.020.00 ± 0.0040.23E0.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.0010.00G0.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.0050.00Mean0.18 ± 0.160.09 ± 0.080.00 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the 271-bp minimal ANK-1 promoter contains all of the sequences necessary and sufficient for position-independent, copy number-dependent expression of the Ank/Aγ-globin gene. The significant exponential correlation between transgene copy number and mRNA level in all 16 lines is consistent with a model in which erythroid transcription complexes become limiting when the copy number exceeds 10 copies. In this model additional transgene copies would generate incremental rather than linear increases in the level of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA. It is less likely that the level of Ank/Aγ-globin mRNA is controlled by the rate of RNA degradation, because globin mRNA is stable in erythroid cells (20Stolle C.A. Benz Jr., E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The effect of the 5′-HS2 on expression of the Ank/Aγ-globin gene differs markedly from the effects of 5′-HS2 on the human ε-, γ-, and β-globin genes in other transgenic mouse models. In the absence of HS2, globin genes are expressed at low levels (<1% of the endogenous mouse gene) in 50% or less of transgenic lines (21Chada K. Magram J. Costantini F.

The presence of 5′-HS2 relieved the position dependence of linked globin genes and increased the level of expression 10-fold or more, but the genes were expressed at all stages of development (26Caterina J.J.

Previously, we have showed that the β-spectrin promoter can also be influenced by the 5′-HS2 (17Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of a βsp/Aγ-globin transgene was position-dependent, because only three of five lines expressed the βsp/Aγ mRNA in erythroid cells. The addition of 5′-HS2 to the β-spectrin promoter relieved the position dependence (seven of seven lines expressed) but had no effect on the level of expression (17Sabatino D.E. Cline A.P. Gallagher P.G. Garrett L.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies 5′-HS2 caused the Ank/Aγ-globin transgene to be expressed in a position-dependent, stage-specific pattern. We conclude that, unlike the globin or β-spectrin promoters, the ANK-1 promoter is not sensitive to the enhancer effects of 5′-HS2. Further dissection will be required to determine the basis of these observations. The sequence of the ankyrin promoter differs from many other erythroid-specific gene promoters. Similar to housekeeping promoters, the ANK-1 promoter is GC-rich and does not contain consensus TATA, InR, or CCAAT sequences. In contrast, globin gene promoters contain both TATA and CCAAT sequences (30Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Varmus H. Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1993: 107-155Google Scholar), whereas the β-spectrin promoter contains a TATA box (31Gallagher P.G. Sabatino D.E. Romana M. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Bodine D.M. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6062-6073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The minimal ankyrin promoter is also compact (271 bp) and does not require more distal cis-acting elements for erythroid-specific, position-independent expression of the γ-globin transgene. In contrast, the β-globin locus LCR is acis-regulatory element located 10–60 kb upstream of the β-like globin genes and is required for their high level position-independent expression (16Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B.

The promoter of the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor, GATA-1, which is important for expression of genes of erythroid and other hematopoietic cell lineages (34Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is similar to the ANK-1 promoter, because it lacks TATA and CCAAT sequences (35Zon L.I. Orkin S.H.

McDevitt M.A. Cantor A.B. Katz S.G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Development. 1999; 126: 2799-2811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the porphobilinogen deaminase gene requires a region that is DNase I-hypersensitive located 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site for position-independent, erythroid-specific expression (38Porcher C. Picat C. Daegelen D. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17368-17374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The minimal ANK-1 promoter contains a GATA-1 binding site at position −128 (15Gallagher P.G. Romana M. Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Forget B.G.

Genet. 1996; 13: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) described mutations at positions −204 (C to G) and −108 (T to C) in the ANK-1 promoter, which they postulated caused a decreased synthesis of ANK-1 mRNA. Neither of these variants involve the GATA-1 or basic Kruppel-like factor binding sites, suggesting that if the −204 and −108 variations are disease-causing mutations, additional binding proteins may be involved in ANK-1 gene erythroid transcription. One of our interests is to evaluate the expression of the Ank/Aγ-globin gene delivered to erythroid cells by a retroviral vector as a potential gene therapy of the hemoglobinopathies. The development of globin retrovirus vectors has been hampered by unstable gene transfer and position-dependent, variegated expression of globin genes with LCR elements. The high level, erythroid-specific, position-independent expression of the Ankyrin/Aγ-globin gene makes it a good candidate for a retroviral vector. If the Ankyrin/Aγ gene can be expressed in the same fashion in a retroviral vector, it could provide therapeutic levels ofAγ-globin in erythroid cells of patients with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W1487822085,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase epsilon (pol ε) is essential for chromosomal replication. A major form of pol ε purified from yeast consists of at least four subunits: Pol2p, Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p. We have investigated the protein/protein interactions between these polypeptides by using expression of individual subunits in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The essential subunits, Pol2p and Dpb2p, interact directly in the absence of the other two subunits, and the C-terminal half of POL2, the only essential portion of Pol2p, is sufficient for interaction with Dpb2p. Dpb3p and Dpb4p, non-essential subunits, also interact directly with each other in the absence of the other two subunits. We propose that Pol2p·Dpb2p and Dpb3p·Dpb4p complexes interact with each other and document several interactions between individual members of the two respective complexes. We present biochemical evidence to support the proposal that pol ε may be dimeric in vivo. Gel filtration of the Pol2p·Dpb2p complexes reveals a novel heterotetrameric form, consisting of two heterodimers of Pol2p·Dpb2p. Dpb2p, but not Pol2p, exists as a homodimer, and thus the Pol2p dimerization may be mediated by Dpb2p. The pol2-E andpol2-F mutations that cause replication defects in vivo weaken the interaction between Pol2p and Dpb2p and also reduce dimerization of Pol2p. This suggests, but does not prove, that dimerization may also occur in vivo and be essential for DNA replication.

This suggested that the protein might have at least two essential functions. Supporting this idea, the C-terminal mutants were defective both in DNA replication and in the surveillance mechanisms that monitor DNA damage and replication blocks during S phase, the S/M, and the intra-S checkpoints (19Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 20Frei C. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 81-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain mutants, pol2–9 and pol2–18, in contrast, were defective only in DNA replication (19Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We made serial 10 amino acid deletions over the C-terminal 120 amino acids to identify the amino acids specifically involved in the checkpoint function of the C terminus. A 20-amino acid stretch between two putative zinc fingers (see Fig. 8) was critical for both DNA replication and the S/M checkpoint. Given the phenotypes of the C-terminal mutants, we reasoned that the mutations might affect either protein/DNA or protein/protein interactions. In fact, the mutations affected at least two important protein/protein interactions. We discovered that the Pol2 protein dimerized using two-hybrid assays, and that the inter-zinc finger mutants failed to do so, suggesting that the dimerization was not an artifact of the two-hybrid assay (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, we found that the C terminus of Pol2p interacted strongly with the Dpb2p subunit by two-hybrid analysis, and that the inter-zinc finger mutations also destabilized this interaction, although they did not abolish it (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results led to the model that Pol2p C-terminal amino acids were involved in assembling an active holoenzyme, as also suggested by Sugino, Araki, and collaborators (22Sugino A. Trends Biochem. 1995; 20: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) based on studies of the holoenzyme purified from yeast. The importance of the Pol2p C terminus at the replication fork was made clear when it was found that the entire catalytic domain of Pol2p can be deleted and cells remain viable, as long as the C-terminal 110-kDa fragment of the protein is intact (23Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenburg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Dua R. Levy D. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, it is the C-terminal half of the protein that provides the only non-redundant essential role in DNA replication, rather than, as would have been expected, the catalytic polymerase activity. The large size of the pol ε complex currently precludes direct structural studies. However, a first order picture of the arrangement of subunits that assemble into pol ε can be obtained by methods similar to those used to analyze the Escherichia colireplicase, i.e. purification of individual subunits or mixtures of subunits and analysis of their interactions. We have analyzed the protein/protein interactions in pol ε by both biochemical analysis and two-hybrid assay of pairwise combinations of subunits. We find that Pol2p and Dpb2p form a stable complex and that Dpb3p and Dpb4p form a tight complex. It seems logical to propose that these two subcomplexes may interact to form the holoenzyme observed in yeast extracts, since Pol2p and Dpb3p interact strongly. We also find that the Pol2p·Dpb2p complex is dimeric, with dimerization of the catalytic subunit, Pol2p, being mediated by dimerization of Dpb2p. Mutations that reduce Pol2p/Dpb2 interaction and dimerization have severe growth defects. This suggests, but does not prove, that pol ε is active as a dimeric protein. Plasmid PTZ18 was from Bio-Rad. Plitmus39, M13KO7, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Klenow large fragment were from New England Biolabs. E. coli CJ236 and mutagenesis kit were obtained from Bio-Rad. Grace's medium and supplements for culturing Sf9 insect cells were from Invitrogen. PfastbacI and pfastbacHTb baculovirus vectors, E. coli DH10bac, Cellfectin reagent, SFM medium for insect cells, and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Agarose Ni2+/NTA beads were from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the oligonucleotide facility at California Institute of Technology. Plasmid miniprep kits were from Qiagen. Western blotting reagents and nitrocellulose membrane were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The His6 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody for the pol ε complex was provided by Dr. Akio Sugino (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The pSEY18-POL2 vector (17Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 496-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested withSacI, and the purified POL2 fragment was cloned at the SacI site in the PTZ18 vector to create PTZ18-POL2. To excise the C terminus of POL2, PTZ18-POL2 was digested with BsrGI and the vector was ligated with itself. The ligated vector containing the N terminus of POL2 was transformed into E. coli CJ236, and cells were infected with M13KO7 phage to make a POL2 phagemid. Uracil containing single-stranded DNA phagemid template was prepared as described earlier (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA template was annealed to an oligonucleotide, which was designed to introduce a SacI restriction enzyme site near the ATG start of POL2. Mutagenesis was carried out as described (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide used is as follows: P1, 5′-C AAA CAT CAT AG A GC T C TC CCC TGA G-3′. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This resulted in PTZ181-POL2. The C-terminal BsrGI fragment of POL2 (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the PTZ181-POL2 to reconstitute the full-lengthPOL2 gene resulting in PTZ182-POL2. For pol2-Eand pol2-F mutants, plitmus39 containing the mutagenized C terminus (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used to reconstitute the full-lengthpol2-E and pol2-F, which resulted in PTZ183-POL2 and PTZ184-POL2, respectively. The PTZ182-POL2, PTZ183-POL2, and PTZ184-POL2 were digested with SacI, and the purified fragment was subcloned in the pfastbacI baculovirus vector atSacI site. Colonies were screened by colony hybridization, and positive clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The DPB2 gene was excised from the pGal4BD-DPB2 vector (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by NcoI/SalI digestion and cloned in the pfastbacHTb vector. The DPB3 gene (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was cloned atBamHI/XhoI sites in pfastbac1 and pfastbacHTb vectors. The open reading frame of clone YDR121W, which encodesDPB4,2 was synthesized by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template and cloned at BamHI/XhoI in pfastbac1 and pfastbacHTb vectors. (The Western blot in Fig. 3confirms that the gene we cloned actually encodes Dpb4p.) TheDPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 genes in pfastbacHTb have a His6 epitope and 16 additional amino acids at the N terminus. The oligonucleotides used for PCR cloning ofDPB3 and DPB4 are as follows: DPB31, 5′-C AAC CGT GTT GGA TCC AAA ATG TCC AAC TTA G-3′; DPB32, 5′-CA ATA ATC TCG AGA TCA CTA AGG ATC GGT G-3′; DPB41, 5′-GAC CAT ATA TTT GGA TCC ACG ATG CCA CC-3′; and DPB42, 5′-TAG ACA GTT TCC CTC GAG GGG TTA CGT TTG-3′. The C terminus of POL2 was prepared by PCR (25Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned at SacI/XhoI sites in pfastHT1 and pfastHA baculovirus vectors. pfastHT1 and pfastHA were made by inserting oligonucleotide cassettes shown below into pfastbac1. The pfastHT1 and pfastHA vectors contain His6 and HA epitopes atBamHI/EcoRI sites, respectively. The oligonucleotides used are as follows: HT1, 5′-GA TCC ATG TCG CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT GGT G-3′; HT2, 5′-AA TTC ACC ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG CGA CAT G-3′; HA1, 5′-GA TCC ATG TAC CCA TAC GAC GTC CCA GAC TAC GCT G-3′; HA2, 5′-AA TTC AGC GTA GTC TGG GAC GTC GTA TGG GTA CAT G-3′; K1, 5′-G CCC TCG GAG AGA GCT CTC ATG GAC GAG G-3′; K2, 5′-CA TTG AAC CTC GAG TTA TAT ACT G-3′. The preparation of baculoviruses was performed using the Bac to Bac system from Life Technologies Inc. Briefly, recombinant pfastbacI or pfastHTb vectors were transformed into E. coli DH10bac cells. Bacmid DNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and immediately transfected into log phase Sf9 insect cells using Cellfectin reagent. The culture supernatant containing the baculovirus particles was collected after 3 days, amplified twice, and stored in darkness at 4 °C. As a control, pfastbacI vector plasmid was used to prepare wild type baculovirus. For expression of proteins, 70 × 106 log phase Sf9 insect cells were layered on four 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks. After cells were attached (1 h), supernatant was removed and cells were infected with viral supernatant at multiplicity of infection of 10 for POL2 (or pol2-F mutant), 5 forDPB2, 5 for DPB3, and 5 for DPB4. The cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Then, 5 ml of additional Grace's complete medium was added and cells were incubated at 27 °C. After 2 days, cells were harvested, washed once with cold 1× Tris-buffered saline, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C. For pairwise coinfections, Sf9 cells were infected with the corresponding baculoviruses as described above and incubated at 27 °C for 2 days. To purify various pol ε subunits, the frozen cells (70–100 × 106 cells) were thawed once on ice and then resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9) containing leupeptin (20 μg/ml) and pepstatin A (20 mg/ml). After lysis, cells were kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min and supernatant was recovered. 300 μl of Ni2+/NTA-agarose beads (50:50 in buffer A) were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C with end to end rotation for 2 h. All further purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. After binding of the proteins, beads were centrifuged at 1000 rpm using a swinging bucket centrifuge and the unbound protein fraction was collected. The beads were extensively washed (8 × 0.8 ml) with buffer A. To elute proteins, beads were mixed with 350 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9) containing 0.3m imidazole with rotation for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the eluted proteins was collected. Samples were stored at −70 °C. The total protein, unbound protein, and eluted protein fractions were analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. The SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and precision column Superdex 200 PC (2.4 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for the analysis. The column was equilibrated at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m KCl, and 10% glycerol. 50 μl (50 μg) of the protein eluted from the Ni2+/NTA column was injected on the column. The flow rate was set at 40 μl/min, and protein fractions (40 μl) were collected. The fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and assayed for DNA polymerase activity using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a DNA template as described below. Marker proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were chromatographed in a similar manner. To cleave the N-terminal His6 sequence, the proteins (20–30 μg) were incubated with rTEV protease enzyme as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cleaved peptide and the rTEV protease were removed by adding Ni2+/NTA beads to the protein mixture and collecting the unbound fraction. ThelexA DNA binding domain (LEX A-BD) plasmid BTM116, provided by Stanley Fields (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), andGal4 activation domain plasmid pACT2 (Matchmaker two-hybrid system; CLONTECH) were used for cloning the C-terminal fragment of POL2 (aa 1265–2222),DPB2, DPB3, DPB4, and the N-terminal fragment of POL2 (aa 1–1265). Construction of the pACT2/C terminus POL2, DPB2, and DPB3 were described previously (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pACT2/N terminus POL2 andDPB4 were cloned by generating a PCR product using yeast genomic DNA as a template and primers to give flankingSmaI/XhoI sites (5′-CTGCCCGGGCATGTTTGGCAAGAAAAAAAACAACGG-3′ and 5′-GGTCGCCTCGAGCTAGTCCATGGAAGGAATCTCCG-3′) andNcoI/BamHI sites (5′-CATATTTTTTCCATGGCGATGCCACCA-3′ and 5′-TACTAGACAGGATCCATAGCGGG-3′). Plasmid pBTM116BD-C terminus POL2 was cloned by generating a PCR product using pK1 (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with primers generating flankingSmaI/BamHI sites (5′-AGATTCCTTCCCCGGGCGAGGACTATGT-3′ and 5′-CGTTATATACTGGATCCTCATATGGTCAAATC-3′). pBTM116BD-N-terminus POL2, DPB2,DPB3, and DPB4 were cloned via the univector plasmid-fusion system (UPS) (25Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UPS uses Cre recombinase to facilitate a loxP site-specific recombination event.DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 were excised from previously isolated pAS2–1 vectors (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and ligated into the pUNI15 vector at the NcoI and BamHI sites, downstream of the loxP site, 5′-ATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT-3′. The N terminusPOL2 was cloned into pUNI15 downstream of theloxP site after PCR with SmaI primers 5′-CTGCCCGGGCATGATGTTTGGCAAGAAAAAAAACAACGG-3′ 5′-GGTCGCGCCCGGGTAGTCCATGGAAGGAATCTCCG-3′. A loxP site was inserted into the polylinker of pBTM116 atSmaI/PstI, designated pBTM116loxP. The respective pUNI15 plasmids were recombined with pBTM116loxP, and the pBTM116BD-N-terminus POL2, DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 plasmids were isolated as described (25Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P1 Cre recombinase was either from Novagen or purified from GST-Cre-expressing pBL21DE3plys/pQL123 (25Liu Q. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (pUNI15 and pQL123 plasmids were supplied by the Elledge laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The L40 two-hybrid strain (MATa hisΔ200 trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ade2 lys2–801am URA3::(lexAop)8 -lacZ LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3) (26Hollenberg S.M. Sternblanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with the binding domain and activation domain fusion constructs using the polyethylene glycol/lithium method. Transformants were selected on Leu−/Trp−/His−synthetic agar plates plus or minus 1 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Colonies that grew were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay and then quantified in a subsequent β-galactosidase assay (both as per instructions from CLONTECH). β-Galactosidase units of activity were calculated as β- galactosidase activity = 1000 ×A 420/(t × v ×A 600), where t = time (min) required for the reaction and v = 0.1 × concentration factor. All quantitative measurements were done in replicates of 4–11n and are reported as an average ± S.D. The polymerase assays were as described, using poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10 (1:20, template to primer chains) as DNA template (4Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (60 ml) consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 8 mmMgCl2, 17 μg/ml poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10, 120 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μm [3H] dTTP (100 cpm/pmol). The poly(dA) /oligo(dT)10 mixture was annealed in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.1, 60 mm KCl prior to the reaction. The reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by spotting the reaction mixture on Whatman DE81 filter paper (2.4 cm diameter). The filters were washed (five times) with 0.5m Na2HPO4, two times with water, and then rinsed with 95% ethanol. Filters were dried, 3 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was measured. One unit of polymerase activity is defined as 1 nmol of dNMP incorporated/h. The point mutations in the inter-zinc finger domain of POL2 were constructed as before (20Frei C. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 81-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are as follows: L2146D (5′-G TTT TTC AAT GTC GTG TTC TTG C-3′), L2150D (5′-GAT ATC AGA ACG GTC TTT TTC AAT C-3′), and L2146D,L2150D (5′-GAT ATC AGA ACG GTC TTT TTC AATGTC GTG TTC TTG CAA C-3′). The mutations were verified by automated DNA sequencing, and the full-length POL2 gene was reconstituted in pRS314 as described previously (21Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). If two proteins directly contact each other, one of which is tagged with a His6 peptide, it is expected that the protein without the His6 tag will co-purify with the protein fused to the His6 peptide upon Ni2+/NTA chromatography. We have used this as the basis of a strategy to identify putative protein contacts between known subunits of pol ε. In order to assess the interaction of Pol2p with Dpb2p subunit, Sf9 cells were infected with Pol2p·His6-Dpb2p recombinant baculoviruses. After 48 h, cells were harvested, extracts prepared, and proteins purified by Ni2"

Mouse GTK is highly homologous to human FRK/RAK (13Cance W.G. Craven R.J. Bergman M. Xu L. Alitalo K. Liu E.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1347-1355PubMed Google Scholar,14Lee J. Wang Z. Luoh S.-M.

Acta. 1994; 1221: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of these tyrosine kinases, and they have been suggested to be members of a subgroup within the Src family with certain specific characteristics compared with the other Src family members. We have previously investigated the importance of two tyrosine residues within the tail of GTK, namely Tyr-497 and Tyr-504, for NIH3T3 (16Öberg-Welsh C. Annerén C. Welsh M. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and RINm5F cell proliferation (17Annerén C. Welsh M. Growth Factors. 2000; 17: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was shown that expression of a kinase-active mutant that could enter the nucleus (GTKY497F/Y504F in NIH3T3 cells and GTKY504Fand GTKY497F/Y504F in RINm5F cells) reduced the cell proliferation rate. Furthermore, we observed that the Y504F- and Y497F/Y504F-GTK mutants increase the mRNA levels of glucagon in the RINm5F cells. These findings raise the possibility that GTK might be involved in differentiation and maturation of cells. To investigate this hypothesis we have transfected PC12 cells with GTK and studied the effects on neurite outgrowth in the absence and presence of NGF. We observe that GTK overexpression induces NGF-independent neurite outgrowth and Rap1 activation, probably through activation of the CrkII-C3G pathway. This could be the consequence of increased levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylation of the Shb adaptor protein.

Wild-type PC12 cells (107) were electroporated (330 V, 1000 microfarads) with 15 μg of GTK cDNA inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His B or empty vector. 24 h after electroporation, 0.75 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) was added for clonal selection. Surviving clones were picked and expanded before Western blot analysis for GTK expression. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5% horse serum (HS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PC12 cells were cultured for 72 h in medium with a full serum supplement with or without the presence of 20 ng/ml NGF and/or PD98059 (a final concentration of 20 μm, added 10 min prior to NGF). The percentage of cells with neurites extending two diameters of the cell body was counted every 24 h. Subconfluent cells were grown overnight in medium containing 2% FCS and 1% HS and stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for the indicated time points. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), briefly sonicated in SDS sample buffer (containing β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mmPMSF), and subjected to Western blot analysis. The membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoreactivity was subsequently detected by ECL. PC12 cells cultured to subconfluence in 10-cm dishes and maintained in 2% FCS, 1% HS overnight, were stimulated for 10 min with 100 ng/ml NGF and washed with cold PBS containing 100 μm orthovanadate.

The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-sample buffer. All solutions were supplemented with 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western transfer was performed. The filters were either directly exposed or blotted with phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody.

Lysates were clarified at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated on ice with the indicated antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed with PBS + 1% Triton X-100. 50 μl of SDS-sample buffer was added, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.

PC12 cells cultured to subconfluence in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min and thoroughly washed with cold PBS containing 100 μm orthovanadate and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 μm orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mm leupeptin, 20 mm calpain inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal). Lysates were clarified at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated on ice with GST-CrkSH2 fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h.

PC12 cells cultured to subconfluence in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min and thoroughly washed with cold PBS containing 100 μm orthovanadate and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μm orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mm PMSF, 0.05 mm leupeptin). Lysates were clarified at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated on ice with GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein (see Ref. 22Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar for details) immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed with PBS + 1% Triton X-100, and 50 μl of SDS sample buffer was added. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for Rap1 or Ras. The pMT2HA-RalGDS-RBD construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of RalGDS encoding amino acids 200–297 as a SalI/NotI fragment and subsequently subcloned into SalI/NotI-digested pMT2HA expression vector. The pMT2HA-Rap1GAP was generated by subcloning full-length Rap1GAP into the pMT2HA expression vector (according to Ref. 23Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.F. Zwartkruis F.J.T. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Parental PC12 and PC12-GTK cells cultured in 2-cm dishes were transfected with 0.3 μg of pIRES-EGFP and 2 μg of RalGDS-RBD or Rap1GAP construct using 1.8% LipofectAMINE™ for 3 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium. As control, cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of pIRES-EGFP-vector and 2 μg of carrier DNA. After 24 h, cells were left unstimulated or treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 48 or 24 h, and the GFP-positive cells with neurites extending two diameters of the cell body were counted in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. To elucidate if GTK affects the differentiation of PC12 cells, we established PC12 cell lines stably overexpressing the wild-type GTK cDNA. Two clones (PC12 GTK-7 and GTK-10) were found to have increased intracellular levels of a 55-kDa GTK protein, compared with the control cells as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). A significant portion of the GTK-expressing PC12 cells displayed a flattened phenotype and extended neurites when cultured in the absence of NGF. As seen in Fig. 1 B, the GTK-10 cells that express higher levels of GTK than the GTK-7 cells also show the more altered morphology, with a higher fraction of cells with neurites after 72 h in culture as well as more somal flattening compared with the GTK-7 cells. To investigate if NGF could induce further differentiation of these cells, a time course experiment in response to NGF was performed. The cells were cultured for 24 h before treatment with 20 ng/ml NGF for another 72 h. The GTK-expressing cells responded to NGF, and the fraction of cells with neurites was significantly higher at all time points compared with the control cells (PC12 or PC12-neo, Fig.2). The NGF-induced increment in neurite outgrowth compared with the outgrowth before NGF treatment was similar in the GTK and control cells. To assess the activity of GTK in PC12 cells we performed an in vitrokinase assay using PC12-GTK10 and parental PC12 cells that were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min or left unstimulated. The amount of GTK present in the lysates and the total amount of tyrosine phosphorylation were determined by Western blot analysis using GTK or phosphotyrosine antibody. 32P incorporation into a 55-kDa band was specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates from the GTK-overexpressing cells, and NGF had little impact on GTK autophosphorylation (Fig. 3). This 55-kDa band was tyrosine-phosphorylated as demonstrated by Western blot analysis with the specific phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10. Western blot analysis of PC12-GTK10 lysate for phosphotyrosine also showed a strong 57-kDa band just above the position of GTK. Another protein of 125 kDa was also tyrosine-phosphorylated to a larger extent in the cell lysates from PC12-GTK cells compared with the control cells. Due to the proximity of GTK to IgG it was not possible to assess the GTK levels in the immunoprecipitates, but the amount GTK present in the lysate was similar in stimulated and unstimulated PC12-GTK cells. Wild-type PC12 cells express low but detectable levels of GTK. It is well established that the MAPK pathway is important for differentiation of PC12 cells, and therefore we wanted to assess the activation of p42 and p44 ERK in the GTK-expressing cells. Phosphorylation of p42/p44 ERK was assessed after stimulation with 100 ng/ml NGF for 0, 2, 10, and 60 min and related to their total amounts by Western blot analysis and densitometric scannings. Addition of NGF stimulates ERK phosphorylation in both GTK-overexpressing and control cells (Fig.4 A), without an elevation of the basal phosphorylation of ERK in PC12-GTK cells. Moreover, the NGF-induced activation is even somewhat delayed in these cells, with significantly decreased phosphorylation of both p42 and p44 ERK at 2 min, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is not responsible for the basal neurite outgrowth induced by GTK. To exclude the possibility of a minor increase in ERK activation in PC12-GTK cells, we investigated if the MEK inhibitor PD98059 could influence neurite outgrowth of PC12-GTK cells. Cells were cultured as described above but in the presence or absence of PD98059 (20 μm), which was added 10 min prior to the addition of NGF (20 ng/ml), and cells with neurites were counted (Fig. 4 B). PD98059 inhibited the effects on neurite outgrowth induced by NGF but could not lower the fraction of PC12-GTK cells with neurites below that of the basal state. Thus, no correlation between ERK activation and neurite outgrowth in response to GTK overexpression can be found, suggesting that GTK transmits a MAPK-independent differentiation signal in PC12 cells. NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells is mediated by the TrkA receptor that becomes phosphorylated after NGF binding. We thus wanted to see if TrkA phosphorylation was elevated in the PC12-GTK cells. Cells were left unstimulated or treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min followed by TrkA immunoprecipitation using a specific TrkA antibody. Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine was performed, and the amount of phosphorylated TrkA was compared with the total amount present in lysate and immunoprecipitate. We observe a TrkA-specific band in both lysates and immunoprecipitates corresponding to 120–145 kDa. In addition we detect two bands of 90–100 kDa displaying TrkA immunoreactivity that showed no signs of tyrosine phosphorylation. NGF stimulated TrkA phosphorylation in the control cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA following NGF treatment was similar in the control and GTK-overexpressing cells, whereas the unstimulated cells from both GTK-expressing clones exhibited more tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA compared with the control cells (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, the total amount of TrkA was lower in the PC12-GTK cells compared with the control, suggesting an attempt to down-regulate this receptor as a consequence of its constitutive activation. When TrkA binds NGF, the tyrosine at position 490 becomes phosphorylated, and this generates a binding site for the adaptor protein Shc. We therefore performed Western blot analysis of equal amounts of crude lysate from cells stimulated with NGF for 10 or 60 min using an antiserum specifically recognizing the Tyr-490-phosphorylated form of TrkA. There is a sustained increase of Tyr-490 phosphorylation after NGF stimulation in the control cells. The GTK-expressing cells, however, show an elevated basal phosphorylation of Tyr-490 that cannot be increased further with NGF indicating that Tyr-490 is a phosphorylation site involved in GTK-mediated activation. We have previously shown that PC12 cells overexpressing the adaptor protein Shb exhibit enhanced NGF-induced differentiation, assessed as neurite outgrowth (24Karlsson T. Kullander K. Welsh M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 757-766PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that NGF induced phosphorylation of p57 Shb in the overexpressing cells, and therefore it was suggested that Shb could be involved in the transmission of NGF-dependent differentiation signals in PC12 cells. To determine if GTK could influence Shb phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated Shb from extracts of cells incubated in the absence or presence of NGF, and we examined its degree of tyrosine phosphorylation. High amounts of phosphorylated Shb were observed in the GTK-expressing cells (Fig. 6), whereas control cells exhibited no detectable phosphorylation despite the presence of similar amounts of Shb in all these immunoprecipitations. NGF did not exert any apparent effect on Shb phosphorylation in this experiment, which is in line with previous experiments studying Shb phosphorylation in parental PC12 cells (24Karlsson T. Kullander K. Welsh M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 757-766PubMed Google Scholar). When exposing the phosphotyrosine blot for a long time, a 125-kDa band appeared in the immunoprecipitates (result not shown). To assess if this band could be focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the blot was stripped and reprobed with antibody against FAK, demonstrating the appearance of a 125-kDa band in the GTK-10 cells but not in the control cells (Fig.6). FAK has been postulated to play a central role in the cellular response to the extracellular matrix and for cell morphology and motility (for review see Ref. 25Guan J.L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Google Scholar). Due to the GTK-dependent FAK-Shb association we decided to study FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and expression in PC12-GTK cells. The FAK protein levels in cell extracts were much increased in both GTK-7 and GTK-10 PC12 cells (Fig.7, A and B) compared with parental PC12 cells. Mock-transfected PC12-neo cells express similar levels of FAK as parental cells indicating that the elevated FAK levels in PC12-GTK cells are not caused by clonal selection (result not shown). Immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK antibody and Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine was performed, and the results show that the degree of FAK phosphorylation is increased to the same extent as the overall FAK content (Fig.7 A). The effect of FAK on the cytoskeleton may involve the binding to p130Cas. CrkII and C3G have been shown to associate with p130Cas (reviewed in Ref. 26Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and C3G has been identified as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 (for review see Ref.27Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine if GTK is involved in regulating this pathway, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-CrkII, anti-p130Cas, or anti-C3G antibody, and the phosphorylation and protein complex formations were analyzed (Fig. 7, B–D). The expression of CrkII, p130Cas, and C3G was similar in GTK-expressing cells and control cells. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine, CrkII, p130Cas, FAK, and C3G revealed an NGF-independent phosphorylation of CrkII and an association of FAK and p130Cas to CrkII to a higher extent in the GTK-expressing cells compared with the control cells. The GTK cells exhibited augmented p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.7 C), and this might explain the increase in the association between p130Cas and CrkII. C3G phosphorylation was similar in the GTK cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 7 D). To examine if the SH2 domain of CrkII mediates an association with Shb, we performed a pull-down experiment using a GST-Crk-SH2 fusion protein. The Crk-SH2 protein was incubated with lysates of PC12-GTK and control cells, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.7 E). The phosphotyrosine blot revealed stronger bands of 130–135 and 57 kDa in the unstimulated GTK-overexpressing cells compared with the control cells. One possible explanation for the observed decrease of the 135-kDa phosphotyrosine band after NGF stimulation could be that its binding sites for the CrkII-SH2 fusion protein are blocked by an NGF-dependent association of endogenous proteins that occurs in intact cells. Shb and FAK were found to bind the SH2 domain of CrkII in a GTK-dependent manner as determined by immunoblotting with specific antibodies for Shb and FAK, and the Shb band was detected at the same position as the 57-kDa phosphotyrosine band. Since it is known that FAK associates with p130Cas directly, and since we show that Shb can bind both CrkII and FAK, it is likely that FAK associates with CrkII via Cas or Shb. GTP-bound Rap1 associates with high selectivity and specificity to RalGDS in vitro (28Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar); therefore, we performed a Rap1 activity assay using a GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein. Immunoblotting of precipitated Rap1 provides a qualitative representation of Rap1-GTP binding, corresponding to quantitative changes detected using classical GDP/GTP-binding ratio techniques (22Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The relative Rap1 activation, as determined by the amount of Rap1 bound to RalGDS relative to the total amount of Rap1 in the lysate, was assessed. We also measured the amount of activated Ras bound to RalGDS-RBD by blotting for Ras. As shown in Fig.8, Ras is activated by NGF in both PC12-GTK and control cells to a similar degree. However, there is a significant NGF-independent increase in the activation of Rap1 in GTK-expressing cells compared with parental PC12 cells. We conclude that GTK overexpression induces a constitutive increase in the amount of GTP-bound endogenous Rap1. To assess to what extent NGF-dependent activation of Rap1 in GTK-overexpressing PC12 cells is responsible for the increase in neurite outgrowth in these cells, transient transfections of RalGDS were performed. When expressed, this construct will yield a product, which contains the 97-amino acid long Rap1-binding domain (RBD), thus associating with Rap1 and blocking its interaction with physiological downstream effectors (23Reedquist K.A.

High-level expression of HIV-1 integrase was obtained in various human cell lines independently of viral accessory proteins. A human 293T cell line was selected that stably expresses HIV-1 integrase and has growth kinetics comparable to the parental cell line. The enzyme was localized in the nucleus and remained stably associated with the chromosomes during mitosis. Lentiviral vector particles carrying the inactivating D64V mutation in the integrase gene were capable of stably transducing 293T cells when complemented in the producer cells with integrase expressed from the synthetic gene. When the cell line that stably expresses integrase was infected with the defective viral particles, complementation of integrase activity was detected as well. Expression of active HIV-1 integrase in human cells will facilitate the study of the interplay between host and viral factors during integration."

In addition to recognizing mispaired bases in DNA, hMSH2-hMSH6 has also been shown to bind DNA containing a variety of covalent adducts including O6-methylguanine (11Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T.

For example, a human lymphoblastoid cell line deficient for hMSH2-hMSH6 activities has been shown to be dramatically resistant to the methylating agent MNNG and failed to undergo apoptosis (18Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Richards B. Wilson T. Lloyd M. Cranston A. Thorburn A. Fishel R. Meuth M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3021-3027PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the repair of O6-methylguanine adducts by methylguanine methyltransferase precluded MMR proficient cells from undergoing apoptosis (20Meikrantz W. Bergom M.A. Memisoglu A. Samson L. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The reintroduction and expression of a wild type MMR gene has been shown to restore the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (21Hawn M.T. Umar A. Carethers J.M. Marra G. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3721-3725PubMed Google Scholar, 22Umar A. Koi M. Risinger J.I. Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Kolodner R.D. Boland C.R. Barrett J.C. Kunkel T.A.

These and other findings suggest a direct role for the MMR system in potentiating the toxicity of DNA-damaging drugs such as MNU and MNNG. The mechanism of MMR-potentiated toxicity to O6-methylguanine lesions remains enigmatic, although a number of models have been proposed. One model is based on the observation that replication past O6-methylguanine lesions results in the misincorporation of a nucleotide opposite the lesion (24Singer B. Chavez F. Goodman M.F. Essigmann J.M. Dosanjh M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8271-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mismatched nucleotide, often a thymidine, then serves as a substrate for repair directed to the newly replicated strand by hMSH2-hMSH6. This newly synthesized region of DNA continues to misincorporate a nucleotide opposite the O6-methylguanine lesion, which is subsequently excised and resynthesized. Repeated cycles of binding, excision, and resynthesis are suggested to result in the accumulation of strand breaks, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, termed the “futile cycle model” (17Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Risinger J.I. Barrett J.C. Hamilton T.C. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3579-3585PubMed Google Scholar, 25Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick Jr., R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol.

Cells lacking MMR are thought to escape such futile cycles of repair and display a damage tolerance (resistant) phenotype. A second model proposes that the binding of mismatch repair proteins to damaged bases may shield the adduct from cellular repair processes allowing lesions to persist in the genome, termed “binding occlusion model” (27Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Yet a third model has suggested that MMR-proficient cells are capable of inhibiting replication past certain DNA adducts leading to cell cycle arrest and a cytotoxic response (28Moreland N.J. Illand M. Kim Y.T. Paul J. Brown R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2102-2106PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, an alternative to these models suggests that specific types of DNA damage are recognized by the MutS homologs, which provokes the exchange of ADP → ATP resulting in the formation of a sliding clamp associated with the DNA adjacent to the lesion. In the absence of a targeted repair event, a threshold number of DNA-bound sliding clamps is proposed to ultimately signal apoptosis (29Fishel R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that mismatched nucleotides stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of both hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This intrinsic ATPase is controlled by mismatch-provoked ADP → ATP exchange, which results in a conformational transition and the formation of a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp on the DNA. However, it is not clear whether the same biochemical process(es) operate on DNA-containing adducts such as O6-methylguanine. Here we have explored the biochemical interaction of purified hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimeric complexes with oligonucleotides containing a single O6-methylguanine adduct at a defined position. It was our goal to understand the distinctions between mispair and lesion recognition by the human MutS homologs toward clarifying the models, which have been proposed to explain the influence of MMR on the toxicity of such lesions. It would appear that the defining biochemical feature that distinguishes these models is the ability of the MutS homologs to recognize O6-methylguanine lesions in the context of a homoduplex substrate and to be displaced by ADP→ ATP exchange. Our results appear most consistent, but not uniquely confined, to the direct apoptosis signaling model. Recombinant hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 protein complexes were overexpressed in SF9 cells using the pFastBac dual expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified as described previously (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using globular protein standards (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX). Unlabeled duplex oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing equal amounts of gel-purified single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1). The purity and consistency of the annealed duplex DNA was monitored by radiolabel phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) as recommended by the manufacturer. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed using Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton Separations). In all cases, >99% of the substrate was found to be duplex as monitored by native gel electrophoresis. Reactions were carried out with 0.5 nm (∼0.27 ng) of 32P-end-labeled duplex DNA substrate in 20 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 25 μm ADP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 25 ng (∼923 fmol) of unlabeled G/C duplex competitor. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, placed on ice, and loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide TBE gel containing 5% glycerol. Gels were dried onto Whatmann 3MM paper and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging screen overnight. Reactions were carried out using 20 nm (∼10 ng) 32P-end-labeled duplex DNA substrate in 20 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 25 μm ADP, 2 mm MgCl2, and the indicated amounts of unlabeled duplex DNA competitors. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, placed on ice, and diluted into 4 ml of ice-cold wash buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 15% glycerol. Samples were applied to pre-wet nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HAWP02500, 25 mm, 0.45 μm) and washed with 4 ml of wash buffer. Filters were dried and Cerenkov counted. Protein concentrations were set to 10–20% total binding in the absence of any unlabeled DNA competitor, which was 12.5 nm hMSH2-hMSH6 for radiolabeled G/T and 25 nmhMSH2-hMSH3 for radiolabeled +(CA) DNA substrates. The ATPase assay was performed using the method described by Gradia et al. (30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 were incubated with 240 nm (∼125 ng) duplex DNA substrate at 37 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.33 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP and various concentrations of unlabeled ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 μl of 10% (w/v) activated charcoal containing 1 mm EDTA. Samples were centrifuged in 0.5-ml tubes for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a tabletop microfuge. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed and counted in a RackBeta 1209 liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration was varied (15–30 nm for hMSH2-hMSH6 and 10–50 nm for hMSH2-hMSH3) to maintain the total amount of ATP hydrolyzed under 20%. The ATPase velocity is expressed in min−1 values ((mol ATP hydrolyzed) (mol protein)−1 (minute)−1) as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 4) and DNA concentration (Fig. 5). For DNA concentration-dependent ATPase assays, reactions were carried out as described above except 75 nm hMSH2-hMSH6 was incubated with the DNA substrates in a final volume of 20 μl containing 100 μm ATP.Figure 5DNA concentration-dependent stimulation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase by O6-methylguanine DNA substrates.

(30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out with 60 nm (32.5 ng) DNA substrate in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, and 2.3 μm[3H]ADP. Protein (60 nm) was incubated with [3H]ADP for 15 min at 25 °C. The DNA substrate was then added and the mixture placed on ice for 5 min. The exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 25 μm. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C and stopped at the times indicated in Fig. 6 by dilution of the sample into 4 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 15% glycerol. The sample was then immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP02500, 25 mm, 0.45 μm) and washed with 4 ml of ice-cold stop buffer. Five ml of scintillation fluid was added to the dried filters, and the samples were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of [3H]ADP bound by hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 before the addition of DNA and ATP was used as the zero time point and normalized to 100% binding. Purified hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 were assessed for their ability to bind to duplex DNA oligonucleotides containing a single O6-methylguanine adduct at a defined position paired with either cytosine (mG/C) or thymine (mG/T) nucleotides (Fig. 1). A number of reports have demonstrated that hMSH2-hMSH6 binds primarily to single base mispairs in DNA with the highest apparent binding affinity for G/T mismatches (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol.

In addition, hMSH2-hMSH6 has been shown to bind DNA containing a variety of adducts including O6-methylguanine (11Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In contrast, hMSH2-hMSH3 recognizes primarily larger insertion deletion loop type mismatched DNA (34Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Whereas biochemical studies of hMSH2-hMSH3 on insertion deletion loops have been reported (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), its affinity for DNA adducts is not known. We examined the relative gel shift binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 to the five model DNA substrates (Figs. 1 and2). A comparison of hMSH2-hMSH6 binding affinity suggests G/T ≫ +CA > mG/T > mG/C ≈ G/C. In contrast, the hMSH2-hMSH3 binding affinity suggests +(CA) ≫ mG/T ≈ mG/C ≈ G/T ≈ G/C. However, these results should be tempered by the lack of equivalent binding saturation by the DNA substrates, which suggests complex binding functions (see “Discussion”). We have used competition studies to overcome such complex binding activities and to gauge the relative binding specificity of the human MutS homologs for DNA (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that hMSH2-hMSH3 exhibited a substantial affinity for DNA containing a +(CA) mismatch (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas hMSH2-hMSH6 exhibited a substantial affinity for DNA containing G/T mismatch substrates (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore we assessed the relative affinity of O6-methylguanine containing DNA substrates for hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 relative to their binding to 20 nm of the 32P-labeled model high affinity substrates (Fig. 3). We determined that the amount of unlabeled test DNA competitor required to reduce binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 to 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a G/T mismatch (G/T) by 50% (IC50) was: G/T (45 nm), mG/T (360 nm), mG/C (560 nm), +(CA) (870 nm), and G/C (1550 nm). In contrast, the IC50 for unlabeled competitors with hMSH2-hMSH3 binding to the 32P-labeled +(CA) substrate were: +(CA) (40 nm), mG/T (275 nm), G/T (285 nm), G/C (365 nm), and mG/C (375 nm). These observations suggest that hMSH2-hMSH6 displays a significant affinity for both mG/C and mG/T containing DNA substrates, whereas hMSH2-hMSH3 does not appear to exhibit any significant affinity for the O6-methylguanine DNA substrates. DNA containing mispaired nucleotides has been shown to stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity associated with both hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether DNA containing nucleotide damage stimulates the intrinsic ATPase activity of the heterodimeric complexes in a similar manner. We determined the ability of the mG/C and mG/T substrates to stimulate the ATPase activity of hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 (Fig. 4 and TableI). The steady-state ATPase activity of hMSH2-hMSH6, relative to that of homoduplex (G/C) DNA, was increased for both mG/C and mG/T substrates. It is interesting to note that when O6-methylguanine was paired with T (mG/T), the steady-state ATPase was dramatically reduced compared with the G/T substrate, whereas the mG/C substrate increases steady-state ATPase compared with the G/C substrate. Surprisingly, we find thek cat value for hMSH2-hMSH6 in the presence of the +CA substrate was approximately half of that reported by Gradia (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas the values for the G/T mismatch substrate and homoduplex DNA were similar. Comparison of the oligonucleotides used in these two studies suggested that the sequence context surrounding the +CA mismatched base pairs was different and likely to account for the differences between experiments (data not shown). Studies are in progress to understand the sequence context effects associated with ATPase activation of the hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 molecular switch. Importantly, we found that mG/C and mG/T only slightly elevated the ATPase activity of hMSH2-hMSH3 over that of the G/C DNA substrate.Table IStimulation of hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 ATPase activity by duplex oligonucleotide substratesDNA substratekcat-DNAK mk cat/K mmin −1m × 10 −6min −1 · m −1 × 10 −4hMSH2-hMSH6 G/T17.98 ± 0.4142.5 ± 3.042.4 mG/T8.72 ± 0.1128.0 ± 1.331.2 +CA8.44 ± 0.1924.2 ± 2.034.9 mG/C7.29 ± 0.1224.4 ± 1.629.9 G/C5.82 ± 0.0829.0 ± 1.520.1 No DNA1.10 ± 0.1980.2 ± 33.81.4hMSH2-hMSH3 +CA1.92 ± 0.0294.8 ± 0.24240.2 mG/C1.22 ± 0.0222.4 ± 0.18450.7 mG/T1.16 ± 0.0182.8 ± 0.17442.1 G/T1.04 ± 0.0253.0 ± 0.28335.1 G/C0.85 ± 0.0131.9 ± 0.13344.7 No DNA0.28 ± 0.0020.5 ± 0.02661.5 Open table in a new tab We find a continuous discrimination of O6-methylguanine-containing substrates versushomoduplex DNA by hMSH2-hMSH6 over a wide variety of DNA concentrations (Fig. 5 and TableII). Taken together with the single DNA concentration kinetic data, these results are consistent with the idea that hMSH2-hMSH6 (and not hMSH2-hMSH3) is specifically activated by of O6-methylguanine-containing DNA.Table IIDNA concentration-dependent stimulation of hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase activity by G/C, mG/C, and mG/T DNA substratesDNA substratek cat-DNAK½DNAk cat/K mmin −1m × 10 −6min −1 · m × 10 −4G/C7.89 ± 0.9077.97 ± 23.710.12mG/C9.77 ± 0.6763.78 ± 12.715.32mG/T9.89 ± 0.2333.13 ± 2.929.85 Open table in a new tab The rate-limiting step for the intrinsic ATPase of MutS and its homologs is ADP → ATP exchange (30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADP→ ATP exchange by hMSH2-hMSH3 and MSH2-hMSH6 has been shown to be specific and hierarchical for individual mismatched nucleotides (10Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of O6-methylguanine containing oligonucleotides to provoke ADP→ ATP exchange (Fig. 6). Relative to the homoduplex DNA, the presence of the O6-methylguanine group resulted in a significantly faster rate of exchange with both mG/C and mG/T with hMSH2-hMSH6. However, the rate of ADP → ATP exchange provoked by mG/C and mG/T was nearly identical to that of homoduplex DNA with hMSH2-hMSH3. These results are consistent with the steady-state ATPase activities induced by O6-methylguanine containing oligonucleotides and suggest that hMSH2-hMSH6 is activated by O6-methylguanine in homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA, whereas hMSH2-hMSH3 is largely inactive in the presence of O6-methylguanine lesions. To compare the efficiency that these substrates induce the steady-state ATPase of the human MutS homologs we calculated thek cat/K m (Table I). Although the k cat for the methylated substrates relative to the homoduplex DNA appeared to increase with hMSH2-hMSH3, little change was observed in thek cat/K m values (even for the +CA, which is a known substrate for hMSH2-hMSH3). These results contrast the ADP → ATP exchange data, which clearly demonstrate that the +CA substrate provokes ADP → ATP exchange, whereas the G/T, mG/T, mG/C, and G/C substrates appeared nearly identical. Moreover, although we find the k cat and ADP → ATP exchange data are concordant, the K m for the +CA substrate increases significantly relative to the G/T, mG/T, mG/C, and G/C substrates. These results suggest that there is likely to be little or no discrimination of O6-methylguanine containing DNA over homoduplex DNA by the hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer and that the ATPase efficiency (as measured by thek cat/K m ) of hMSH2-hMSH3 for a recognized substrate may indicate an alternative feature distinct from hMSH2-hMSH6. In contrast, thek cat/K m and ADP → ATP exchange for both mG/C and mG/T increased relative to that of the homoduplex G/C for hMSH2-hMSH6. The eukaryotic MMR system has been shown to be involved in the cellular processing of DNA damage induced by methylating agents such as MNU and MNNG. These alkylating agents are capable of forming covalent adducts at the O6 position of guanine, which are known to be mutagenic and cytotoxic if not properly repaired. In this study, oligonucleotides containing a single O6-methylguanine lesion at a defined position were used as substrates for the purified human DNA mismatch recognition proteins hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 in an effort to understand the underlying biochemical mechanism by which they mediate the cytotoxicity of O6-methylguanine lesions. The O6-methylguanine was placed opposite both a C (mG/C) and a T (mG/T) on the complementary strand. It has been reported that DNA replication past an O6-methylguanine frequently inserts a T opposite the G containing the O6-methyl group. We found that the O6-methylguanine adduct was a better substrate when paired with a T than when paired with a C for hMSH2-hMSH6 in both the gel shift and competition binding analysis. These results are similar to other reports that have shown an increased binding affinity of hMSH2-hMSH6 for O6-methylguanine and cisplatin intrastrand cross-links when opposite a T (11Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 12Yamada M. O'Regan E. Brown R. Karran P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that translesion DNA replication increases the efficiency of damage recognition leading to repair and/or other downstream signaling. Interestingly, little or no binding to O6-methylguanine lesions was observed with hMSH2-hMSH3, which is consistent with the observation that cells carrying homozygous mutations in hMSH6 are more resistant to the killing effects of methylating agents, whereas cells carrying homozygous mutations in hMSH3 appear similar to wild type (37de Wind N. Dekker M. Claij N. Jansen L. van Klink Y. Radman M. Riggins G. van der Valk M. van't Wout K. te Reile H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that mismatched nucleotides in DNA induce the intrinsic ATPase activity of both hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6. We have demonstrated here that DNA containing a single O6-methylguanine lesion is also capable of stimulating the ATPase activity hMSH2-hMSH6. This steady-state ATPase activity was consistent with the rate at which a particular lesion/mismatch provokes ADP → ATP exchange by either hMSH2-hMSH3 or hMSH2-hMSH6. However, the role for the ATPase activity of these complexes in mismatch repair has been somewhat controversial. It has been proposed that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for the translocation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer along the DNA backbone following recognition of mispaired nucleotides (38Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). An alternative model suggests that mismatched or lesion-containing DNA provokes the exchange of ADP→ ATP resulting in a conformational transition and in the formation of a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp on DNA (31Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this model, it is the increased local concentration of sliding clamps bound to the DNA adjacent to the lesion/mismatch that serve as a first step for downstream signaling events (29Fishel R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whereas O6-methylguanine lesions appear to stimulate hMSH2-hMSH6 adenosine nucleotide processing activity, the modest stimulation of cognate hMSH2-hMSH3 activities suggests only a weak or modest overlapping and redundant function, similar to mispair recognition (39Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that the ratio of hMSH2-hMSH6 to hMSH2-hMSH3 in mismatch proficient HeLa cells has been estimated to be 10:1 (34Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that hMSH2-hMSH3 displays a near order of magnitude weaker ATP processing activity than hMSH2-hMSH6, these results suggest that processing of O6-methylguanine lesions by hMSH2-hMSH3 is unlikely to contribute to the cytotoxicity of these lesions. The mechanism by which loss of DNA mismatch repair results in resistance in the O6-methylguanine and cisplatin lesions is not completely understood. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that methylation damage (likely O6-methylguanine lesions) induce apoptosis through a MMR-dependent signaling pathway (19Zhang H. Richards B. Wilson T. Lloyd M. Cranston A. Thorburn A. Fishel R. Meuth M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3021-3027PubMed Google Scholar, 20Meikrantz W. Bergom M.A. Memisoglu A. Samson L. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that cells treated with MNU induce the phosphorylation and stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor, which appears to require a functional MMR system (40Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, other studies have clearly shown that apoptosis induced by methylating agents is dependent on MMR but independent of p53 (18Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. Richards B. Wilson T. Lloyd M. Cranston A. Thorburn A. Fishel R. Meuth M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3021-3027PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a p53-related gene, p73, appears to be overexpressed and directly linked to the MMR-dependent apoptotic response induced by cisplatin (41Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). These studies are complicated by the observation that, initiation of apoptosis appears to be lesion specific, because cells treated with ionizing radiation undergo apoptosis regardless of MMR status (18Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The observation that hMSH2-hMSH6 adenosine nucleotide processing is stimulated by mG/C reduces the likelihood of a model for methylation sensitivity in mammalian cells that uniquely depends on replication misincorporation followed by a futile cycle of repair. Moreover, the significant steady-state ATPase implies cycles of lesion recognition, ADP → ATP exchange, and the formation of an hMSH2-hMSH6 sliding clamp that diffuses away from the lesion-containing oligonucleotide, thus reducing the likelihood of a binding occlusion model. These observations are consistent with a model in which a portion of the sensitivity to O6-methylguanine occurs via recognition of mG/C by the MMR machinery and direct transduction of this lesion recognition to the apoptotic machinery (although we cannot completely eliminate an intertwined lesion-dependent replication block model). The importance of MMR complexes in the direct initiation of apoptosis has been underlined by the observation that overexpression of hMSH2 or hMLH1, but not hMSH3, hMSH6 or hPMS2, in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts provokes apoptosis in both repair proficient and deficient lines (19Zhang H. Richards B. Wilson T. Lloyd M. Cranston A. Thorburn A. Fishel R. Meuth M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3021-3027PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of MMR signaling to downstream effectors, such as the repair or apoptotic processes, remains to be established. It is tempting to speculate that two separate signal transduction pathways exist for the MMR machinery, one to signal DNA mismatch/lesion repair and one, in the case of high lesion loads, to signal apoptosis.

Epitope-tagged constructs were used to study expression of the two isozymes. The expression of Ade17p is repressed by the addition of adenine to the media, whereas Ade16p expression is not affected by adenine.

This reaction involves the formylation of AICAR using 10-formyltetrahydrofolate as the formyl donor (Fig.1). Saccharomyces cerevisiaepossesses two genes, ADE16 and ADE17, that encode AICAR transformylase enzymes that share 85% identity (1.Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This reaction is the only purine biosynthesis step that is catalyzed by separate isozymes in yeast. Expression of either ADE16 orADE17 alone is sufficient to support the growth of yeast in adenine-free media, but disruption of both genes results in adenine auxotrophy (1.Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AICAR transformylase assays of yeast crude extracts demonstrated that the ADE17 gene product is the more active of the two enzymes, but the low level of activity supplied by theADE16 gene product is sufficient for wild-type growth rates. Given these results, we began to question why yeast possess two AICAR transformylase isozymes and whether these two enzymes have separate metabolic roles in the cell.Recent research has shown a difference in the regulation of the expression of ADE16 and ADE17 by adenine. Like other purine biosynthesis genes, optimal expression of ADE17is dependent on the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p, andADE17 expression is repressed by adenine (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TheADE17 gene is one of the most strongly repressed purine biosynthesis genes, as shown using ADE17-lacZ fusion constructs. Unlike other purine biosynthesis genes, there are no consensus Bas1p and Bas2p binding sequences in the promoter region of the ADE16 gene, and Northern blot analysis has revealed thatADE16 expression is not affected by adenine (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this work, His-tagged Ade16p and Ade17p were purified and their activities were characterized, the cellular localization of the two isozymes was determined, and the regulation of Ade16p and Ade17p expression was investigated. The effect of adenine on Ade16p and Ade17p expression was followed at the protein level, using epitope-tagged versions ofADE16 and ADE17 integrated into the yeast genome. The levels of epitope-tagged Ade16p and Ade17p were also monitored in cells grown under various medium conditions in order to elucidate any other differences in the expression of these two isozymes.DISCUSSIONThe first step in answering why yeast have two isozymes for AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase was to purify the proteins and assess their enzymatic activities. Based on their similar specific activities, Ade16p and Ade17p are equally capable of catalyzing both the AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase reactions (Table III). Previous work showed that the ADE17 gene product accounts for approximately 90% of the total AICAR transformylase activity in wild-type yeast, whereas the ADE16 gene product accounts for less than 10% of wild-type activity (1.Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the specific AICAR transformylase activities of Ade16p and Ade17p are similar, the low level of Ade16p activity in yeast crude extract appears to be due to lower expression. This was confirmed by the immunoblotting experiments reported here, in which Ade17p was shown to be 4–5 times more abundant than Ade16p (Fig. 6). This difference in expression levels was also reflected in the immunofluorescent staining results (Fig. 5).Immunoblotting experiments also demonstrated the difference between the regulation of Ade16p and Ade17p expression by adenine. As with other purine biosynthesis enzymes, the expression of Ade17p is repressed by adenine, whereas Ade16p expression was not affected by the addition of adenine to the media. This result was expected because theADE16 gene does not contain a Bas1p binding site in the promoter region and because earlier work had not revealed any effect of adenine on the expression of ADE16 (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The expression of Ade16p was increased when cells were grown on nonfermentable carbon sources. Cells grown on acetate or glycerol plus ethanol expressed 1.5–2 times more Ade16p than glucose-grown cells. This small increase in Ade16p expression on nonfermentable carbon sources was an unexpected result, for which there are no clear explanations at this time. The increase in Ade16p expression is probably not a result of glucose derepression, because Ade16p levels were not affected by growth on galactose (as compared with glucose). Meiosis and spore formation are cellular processes that are controlled by the levels of certain carbon sources. Meiosis is blocked by the presence of glucose, but it is dependent on a nonfermentable carbon source, such as acetate (30.Esposito R.E. Klapholz S. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 211-288Google Scholar). It is possible that Ade16p is the preferred AICAR transformylase isozyme when cells are lacking glucose and are forced to either sporulate or use an alternate route to meet their energy requirements.A second possibility is that the increase in Ade16p levels in acetate and glycerol plus ethanol is a result of increased mitochondrial function, because cells growing on nonfermentable carbon sources are relying on mitochondrial respiration to meet the energy requirements of the cell. There is evidence for two separate pools of one-carbon units in the cell that are incorporated into purines (31.Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and it is known that mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism produces formate, which can be incorporated into purines (32.Pasternack L.B. Laude Jr., D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increase in Ade16p expression on nonfermentable carbon sources reflects the association of this protein with the mitochondrially derived one-carbon pool. Some of these ideas can be tested genetically using yeast strains with ade16 or ade17 disruptions in combination with mutations of other folate-metabolizing enzymes.Another hypothesis explaining the presence of two AICAR transformylase isozymes in S. cerevisiae is that one enzyme may be more involved with utilizing the AICAR from histidine biosynthesis, whereas the other is involved in the metabolism of AICAR from the de novo purine pathway. In particular, we speculated that Ade16p might be responsible for metabolizing the AICAR produced as a byproduct of histidine synthesis, because of its low, constitutive expression even in the presence of adenine. We found no evidence for this in the experiments presented here, however, because the addition of histidine did not affect the expression of either isozyme and because 3-aminotriazole, which inhibits histidine biosynthesis, did not affect the regulation of Ade16p or Ade17p. These results do not rule out the involvement of Ade16p with histidine biosynthesis, though. Recent research has shown that most histidine biosynthesis enzymes catalyzing steps upstream of AICAR production are co-regulated with purine biosynthesis genes, whereas genes encoding steps downstream of AICAR production are not (33.Springer C. Kunzler M. Balmelli T. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29637-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when yeast are grown with adenine in the media, the cells are still able to make histidine, indicating that repression of histidine biosynthesis by adenine is not complete. This suggests that AICAR can still be produced by the histidine pathway under adenine-repressing conditions. Whether or not Ade16p is responsible for metabolizing this AICAR is not known, but it remains a possibility. The research presented here has shown, however, that if Ade16p is involved with histidine biosynthesis, it is not regulated in response to histidine.In this work, we show that an ade16 ade17 disruption leads to histidine auxotrophy in addition to adenine auxotrophy, similar to the adenine/histidine requirement of ade3 mutant yeast strains. Although this result was somewhat surprising, theADE16 and ADE17 gene products are presumably capable of metabolizing the AICAR produced by the histidine synthesis pathway, and the ADE3 gene product, C1-THF synthase, can provide the 10-formyl-THF necessary for the AICAR transformylase reaction. One might speculate that a mutant blocked in the ability to formylate AICAR would accumulate this intermediate, which in turn might inhibit histidine biosynthesis in a feedback or other regulatory manner, thus leading to a histidine requirement. This question deserves further study and will require a determination of the relative contributions of the histidine pathway and the purine pathway to the overall production or accumulation of AICAR.In summary, these results show that the enzymes encoded byADE16 and ADE17 are functionally indistinguishable with respect to specific activity, cellular localization, and subunit organization. They differ significantly in their expression levels and patterns. In cells growing under normal conditions, Ade17p is the predominant isozyme and appears to be a classic adenine-responsive enzyme, being strongly repressed by adenine. This repression occurs at the level of transcription as reported by Daignan-Fornier and involves the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34.Pinson B. Sagot I. Borne F. Gabrielsen O.S. Daignan-Fornier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ade16p, the minor isozyme, appears to be expressed constitutively, unresponsive to adenine levels. However, Ade16p shows a small response to nonfermentable carbon sources, perhaps suggesting a role for this isozyme in respiration or sporulation. Only a limited number of conditions were tested here, and the complete metabolic role of Ade16p remains to be elucidated. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)1 transformylase catalyzes the ninth step of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This reaction involves the formylation of AICAR using 10-formyltetrahydrofolate as the formyl donor (Fig.1).

This repression occurs at the level of transcription as reported by Daignan-Fornier and involves the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34.Pinson B. Sagot I. Borne F. Gabrielsen O.S. Daignan-Fornier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ade16p, the minor isozyme, appears to be expressed constitutively, unresponsive to adenine levels. However, Ade16p shows a small response to nonfermentable carbon sources, perhaps suggesting a role for this isozyme in respiration or sporulation. Only a limited number of conditions were tested here, and the complete metabolic role of Ade16p remains to be elucidated. The first step in answering why yeast have two isozymes for AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase was to purify the proteins and assess their enzymatic activities. Based on their similar specific activities, Ade16p and Ade17p are equally capable of catalyzing both the AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase reactions (Table III). Previous work showed that the ADE17 gene product accounts for approximately 90% of the total AICAR transformylase activity in wild-type yeast, whereas the ADE16 gene product accounts for less than 10% of wild-type activity (1.Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the specific AICAR transformylase activities of Ade16p and Ade17p are similar, the low level of Ade16p activity in yeast crude extract appears to be due to lower expression. This was confirmed by the immunoblotting experiments reported here, in which Ade17p was shown to be 4–5 times more abundant than Ade16p (Fig. 6). This difference in expression levels was also reflected in the immunofluorescent staining results (Fig. 5). Immunoblotting experiments also demonstrated the difference between the regulation of Ade16p and Ade17p expression by adenine. As with other purine biosynthesis enzymes, the expression of Ade17p is repressed by adenine, whereas Ade16p expression was not affected by the addition of adenine to the media. This result was expected because theADE16 gene does not contain a Bas1p binding site in the promoter region and because earlier work had not revealed any effect of adenine on the expression of ADE16 (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expression of Ade16p was increased when cells were grown on nonfermentable carbon sources. Cells grown on acetate or glycerol plus ethanol expressed 1.5–2 times more Ade16p than glucose-grown cells. This small increase in Ade16p expression on nonfermentable carbon sources was an unexpected result, for which there are no clear explanations at this time. The increase in Ade16p expression is probably not a result of glucose derepression, because Ade16p levels were not affected by growth on galactose (as compared with glucose). Meiosis and spore formation are cellular processes that are controlled by the levels of certain carbon sources. Meiosis is blocked by the presence of glucose, but it is dependent on a nonfermentable carbon source, such as acetate (30.Esposito R.E. Klapholz S. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 211-288Google Scholar). It is possible that Ade16p is the preferred AICAR transformylase isozyme when cells are lacking glucose and are forced to either sporulate or use an alternate route to meet their energy requirements. A second possibility is that the increase in Ade16p levels in acetate and glycerol plus ethanol is a result of increased mitochondrial function, because cells growing on nonfermentable carbon sources are relying on mitochondrial respiration to meet the energy requirements of the cell. There is evidence for two separate pools of one-carbon units in the cell that are incorporated into purines (31.Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and it is known that mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism produces formate, which can be incorporated into purines (32.Pasternack L.B. Laude Jr., D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increase in Ade16p expression on nonfermentable carbon sources reflects the association of this protein with the mitochondrially derived one-carbon pool. Some of these ideas can be tested genetically using yeast strains with ade16 or ade17 disruptions in combination with mutations of other folate-metabolizing enzymes. Another hypothesis explaining the presence of two AICAR transformylase isozymes in S. cerevisiae is that one enzyme may be more involved with utilizing the AICAR from histidine biosynthesis, whereas the other is involved in the metabolism of AICAR from the de novo purine pathway. In particular, we speculated that Ade16p might be responsible for metabolizing the AICAR produced as a byproduct of histidine synthesis, because of its low, constitutive expression even in the presence of adenine. We found no evidence for this in the experiments presented here, however, because the addition of histidine did not affect the expression of either isozyme and because 3-aminotriazole, which inhibits histidine biosynthesis, did not affect the regulation of Ade16p or Ade17p. These results do not rule out the involvement of Ade16p with histidine biosynthesis, though. Recent research has shown that most histidine biosynthesis enzymes catalyzing steps upstream of AICAR production are co-regulated with purine biosynthesis genes, whereas genes encoding steps downstream of AICAR production are not (33.Springer C. Kunzler M. Balmelli T. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29637-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when yeast are grown with adenine in the media, the cells are still able to make histidine, indicating that repression of histidine biosynthesis by adenine is not complete. This suggests that AICAR can still be produced by the histidine pathway under adenine-repressing conditions. Whether or not Ade16p is responsible for metabolizing this AICAR is not known, but it remains a possibility. The research presented here has shown, however, that if Ade16p is involved with histidine biosynthesis, it is not regulated in response to histidine. In this work, we show that an ade16 ade17 disruption leads to histidine auxotrophy in addition to adenine auxotrophy, similar to the adenine/histidine requirement of ade3 mutant yeast strains. Although this result was somewhat surprising, theADE16 and ADE17 gene products are presumably capable of metabolizing the AICAR produced by the histidine synthesis pathway, and the ADE3 gene product, C1-THF synthase, can provide the 10-formyl-THF necessary for the AICAR transformylase reaction. One might speculate that a mutant blocked in the ability to formylate AICAR would accumulate this intermediate, which in turn might inhibit histidine biosynthesis in a feedback or other regulatory manner, thus leading to a histidine requirement. This question deserves further study and will require a determination of the relative contributions of the histidine pathway and the purine pathway to the overall production or accumulation of AICAR. In summary, these results show that the enzymes encoded byADE16 and ADE17 are functionally indistinguishable with respect to specific activity, cellular localization, and subunit organization. They differ significantly in their expression levels and patterns. In cells growing under normal conditions, Ade17p is the predominant isozyme and appears to be a classic adenine-responsive enzyme, being strongly repressed by adenine. This repression occurs at the level of transcription as reported by Daignan-Fornier and involves the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p (2.Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B.

https://openalex.org/W4242377567,"It is believed that an inflammation-induced activation of the CNS leads to an inhibition of overshooting immune responses to prevent extensive local cytokine secretion. However, immunosuppression by the sympathetic nervous system may be unfavorable when bacteria are present locally and when TNF-alpha is necessary to overcome infection. We now report in a superfusion model, using mouse spleen slices, that although local Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased splenic TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion severalfold over basal levels, electrically released neurotransmitters attenuated cytokine secretion to similar basal level as under bacteria-free conditions. Bacteria reversed noradrenergic inhibitory effector mechanisms: Under bacteria-free conditions, TNF-alpha secretion was very low and IL-6 secretion was mainly inhibited by alpha2-adrenoreceptor ligation. In the presence of bacteria, TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion were high and IL-6 secretion was mainly inhibited by beta-adrenoreceptor ligation. The alpha- to beta-adrenoswitch of IL-6 inhibition in the presence of bacteria was mediated by the prior adrenergic regulation of TNF-alpha. In vivo, chemical abrogation of sympathetic inhibition reduced accumulation of bacteria in the spleen, which depended at least in part on TNF-alpha. This suggests that activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a forerunner for accumulation of bacteria in tissue and consecutively sepsis due to intensified inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion."

The work of Kearney et al. (1.Kearney E.B. Salach J.I. Seng R.I. Kenney W.C. Zeszotek E. Singer T.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 24: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) demonstrates the nature of the covalent linkage in MAO B to be an 8α-S-cysteinyl-FAD. Subsequent studies on purified human placental MAO A also showed the same type of covalent linkage (2.Nagy J. Salach J.I. Arch. Biochem.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and human liver MAO B expressed in Pichia pastoris contain an identical covalent flavin linkage. 2P. Newton-Vinson, F. Hubalek, and D. E. Edmondson, submitted for publication. 2P. Newton-Vinson, F. Hubalek, and D. E. Edmondson, submitted for publication. The molecular basis for the requirement of a covalent flavin linkage has been addressed in MAO as well as other enzyme systems containing covalent flavin coenzymes. Mutagenesis studies by Shih and co-workers (5.Wu H. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that replacement of Cys-397 in MAO B with a seryl residue resulted in an inactive enzyme in a COS cell expression system. More recent work from Ito and co-workers shows that recombinant rat liver MAO A in which Cys 406 is mutated to an alanyl residue does exhibit catalytic activity at a level estimated to be 40–60% that of the wild-type enzyme (depending on the nature of the substrate) when expressed in S. cerevisiae (6.Hiro I. Tsugero Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on other flavoenzymes containing 8α-substituted covalent flavin coenzymes have shown that mutations of the linking amino acid result in enzymes still able to bind FAD non-covalently and to exhibit some catalytic activity. Replacement of His-44 with Cys in fumarate reductase results in a mutant enzyme that contains non-covalent FAD that can be reversibly resolved and reconstituted with FAD to form an active enzyme (7.Blaut M. Whittaker K. Valdovinos A. Ackrell B.A.C. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13599-13604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies on vanillyl-alcohol oxidase demonstrate that replacement of His-422 with Ala results in an enzyme that binds FAD non-covalently, exhibits ∼10% the activity of the native enzyme, and has essentially the same structure of the native enzyme as determined by x-ray crystallography (8.Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H.

Expression of ratl-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (containing an N(1)-histidyl-FAD (9.Kenny S.C. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. Nakagawa H. Asano A. Sato R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10.Kiuchi K. Nishikimi M. Yagi K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5076-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) in a baculovirus insect cell system where the medium is deficient in riboflavin results in the formation of an apoprotein that is reactivated by the addition of FAD (11.Nishikimi M. Kobayashi J. Yagi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 313-320PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of FAD to this apoenzyme is apparently non-covalent even though the liganding histidyl residue is present. These studies with enzymes containing 8α-histidyl-FAD demonstrate that covalent linkage of the flavin is not necessary for protein folding to a form capable of binding the flavin coenzyme by non-covalent interactions. Although the catalytic activities of these mutated forms are lower than those of the native wild-type enzymes, covalent binding of the flavin does not appear to be a requirement for functionality. In the cases tested, however, catalytic turnover is more efficient when the flavin cofactor is covalently bound. This manuscript describes experiments on the C406A mutant form of human liver MAO A expressed in a riboflavin-requiring strain of S. cerevisiae described in a previous publication from this laboratory (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the apo form of the enzyme is incorporated into the outer mitochondrial membrane in a folded form that can bind FAD and a number of FAD analogues. Catalytic activity is reconstituted upon binding of FAD and several of the FAD analogues tested, which allow the determination of binding constants. Although native, expressed MAO A can be liberated from the outer mitochondrial membrane in an active stable form by detergent extraction, the mutant enzyme is very unstable to detergent solubilization, which suggests a role for covalent flavin linkage in maintaining the structural stability of the enzyme. The gene encoding human liver MAO A was obtained from Dr. P. Urban, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France and was ligated into pUC18. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH. Two primers were used, one carrying the desired mutation and a selection primer that converts a uniqueNdeI restriction site in pUC18 to an NcoI restriction site. This change in restriction site was used in selection of the desired mutant. The pUC18 plasmid containing the C406A MAO A gene was then subjected to polymerase chain reaction using primers GAA GAT CTA TGG AGA ATC AAG AGA AGG CG and CGA ATT CTC AAG ACC GTG GCA GGA GC. These two primers were designed such that the polymerase chain reaction product contains the C406A MAO A gene with BglII and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with the above two restriction enzymes, ligated into a pYeDP (60) expression vector, and transformed into XL-2 Blue ultracompetent cells. Confirmation of the correct mutated gene sequence was performed at the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Georgia, Athens. Positive colonies were screened for the C406A MAO A insert by restriction digestion analysis. Plasmids were isolated from positive colonies and transformed into S. cerevisiae strain RM2 (rib5−) using standard protocols as described previously (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 200 μm riboflavin in red glass culture flasks to prevent light destruction of the flavin. After 16 h of growth, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 0.4% (w/v) galactose for enzyme induction. For apoC406A MAO A preparations, no riboflavin was added to the “induction” medium. To produce holo C406A MAO A, 200 μm riboflavin was added to the medium. For studies on thein vivo incorporation of riboflavin analogues, the appropriate analogue was added to the induction medium at a concentration of 200 μm in place of riboflavin. C406A MAO A induction took place over a 16-h period of incubation of the culture in the galactose medium at 30 °C. After the induction period, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with sterile distilled water to remove any exogenous riboflavin. Cell walls were disrupted by zymolase digestion (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and mitochondria were isolated as described previously in the presence of the protease inhibitors: aprotinin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), benzamidine (0.1 mm), and sodium metabisulfite (0.1 mm). The mitochondrial preparation can be stored frozen as a suspension in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.6 m sorbitol, and 25% (v/v) glycerol at −80 °C without loss of activity for 4 weeks. C406A MAO A activity was determined fluorometrically by monitoring kynuramine oxidase activity at 30 °C (12.Krajl M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1965; 14: 1684-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial preparations were incubated with 1 mmkynuramine in air-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 30 min in the absence of any detergent. The concentration of product formed is then determined fluorometrically. Protein concentrations were determined using the modified Bearden procedure as described previously (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on mitochondrial protein samples was performed as described by Laemmli (13.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots to detect MAO A or covalent flavin were performed as described previously (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The following riboflavin analogues used in this study were the generous gifts of Dr. John Lambooy (University of Maryland): 7-nor-7-chlororiboflavin, 8-nor-8-chlororiboflavin, 8-nor-8-bromoriboflavin, 7α-methylriboflavin, 8-α-methylriboflavin, 7-α,8-α-dimethylriboflavin, 7-nor-7-bromo-8-α-methylriboflavin, 7-α-methyl-8-nor-8-bromoriboflavin, 7-nor-7-chloro-8-α-methylriboflavin, and 7-α-methyl-8-nor-8-chlororiboflavin. Dr. Sandro Ghisla (University of Konstanz, Germany) provided generous gifts of 8-nor-8-fluororiboflavin, 7-nor-7-chloro-8-nor-8-chlororiboflavin, and 8-nor-8-aminoriboflavin. 5-Deaza-5-carbariboflavin and N(3)-methylriboflavin were previously synthesized in this laboratory. 8-Nor-8-cyanoriboflavin was synthesized as described by Murthy and Massey (14.Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). See Ref. 3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar for a listing of the structures of these riboflavin analogues. FAD analogues were prepared enzymatically from the corresponding riboflavin analogues using purified recombinant Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FAD synthetase (a gift from Dr. W. McIntire, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco) (15.Efimov I. Kuusk V. Zhang X. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After incubation of the riboflavin analogues (200 μm) with 3 mm ATP for 16 h in the presence of the FAD synthetase in the absence of light, FAD was separated from reactants by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column using distilled water as eluent. Purity of the FAD fractions was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography. Our initial approach was to express the C406A mutant of MAO A in tens of milligram quantities in the expression system described by Weyler et al. (16.Weyler W. Titlow C.C. Salach J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that has proven successful for the high level expression of human liver MAO A (16.Weyler W. Titlow C.C. Salach J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4624-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18.Miller J., R. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activity is observed in cell extracts as expected from the work of Ito and co-workers (6.Hiro I. Tsugero Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Attempts, however, to solubilize and purify the enzyme were unsuccessful in our hands due to the extreme lability of the mutant enzyme after extraction from the membrane. The addition of exogenous FAD to cell extracts did not result in any apparent stabilization of enzyme activity, which suggests the lability of activity is more complex than simply the loss of FAD on solubilization. These results suggest that the C406A mutant form of MAO A appears to be stable in its membrane-associated environment; however, is very unstable when extracted into an aqueous detergent solution, conditions that are suitable for the extraction and purification of the WT enzyme in a stable, functional form. Therefore, the presence of covalent FAD appears to impart structural stability to the enzyme. Since the mutant enzyme is stable only in a membrane environment, our alternative approach was to express the mutant enzyme in the riboflavin auxotrophic strain of S. cerevisiae (RM2), which has been described in a previous study investigating the covalent incorporation of riboflavin analogues into both recombinant MAO A and MAO B (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This system also has the advantage in that the Gal promoter is tightly regulated so that no MAO expression is observed until galactose is added to the medium. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed similar to those done previously with WT enzyme. Cell cultures were grown in the presence of riboflavin until reaching stationary phase. At this stage, no expression of MAO A or C406A MAO A is detected either by catalytic activity or immunochemically. After washing the cells with distilled water to remove any exogenous riboflavin, the cells were incubated in a fresh medium (containing 0.4% w/v galactose) containing either 1) no riboflavin, 2) 200 μm riboflavin, or 3) 200 μm riboflavin analogues as done previously (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After incubation for 16 h, the mitochondria were isolated from different cultures and assayed for MAO A activity. The results are presented in Table I, in which specific activities are compared with a control sample containing riboflavin.Table IRelative levels of expressed C406A MAO A activities in mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae induced in the presence of different flavin analoguesFlavin analogueMAO A activity% specific activity of Riboflavin controlRiboflavin1007-Nor-7-chlororiboflavin539 ± 327-Nor-7-bromoriboflavin505 ± 1007-α-Methylriboflavin99 ± 248-Nor-8-chlororiboflavin267 ± 378-Nor-8-bromoriboflavin240 ± 88-Nor-8-fluroriboflavin22 ± 0.18-Nor-8-chloro-7-nor-7-chlororiboflavin150 ± 268-α-Methyl-7-nor-7-chlororiboflavin19 ± 0.18-α-Methyl-7-nor-7-bromoriboflavin17 ± 28-α-Methylriboflavin11 ± 28-α-Methyl-7-α-methylriboflavin8.4 ± 2.38-Nor-8-chloro-7-α-methylriboflavin140 ± 138-Nor-8-bromo-7-α-methylriboflavin356 ± 388-Nor-8-aminoriboflavinNone detected5-Carba-5-deazariboflavinNone detectedN(3)-methylriboflavinNone detected Open table in a new tab Previous results (6.Hiro I.

Our results on the expressed human WT and mutant enzymes are in good agreement with the data published (6.Hiro I. Tsugero Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The specific activity of C406A MAO A expressed in the presence of riboflavin is 0.86 ± 0.13 milliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein (average of 17 determinations with a range of 0.64–1.2 milliunits/mg). Expression of WT enzyme under the same conditions results in a specific activity of 2.4 ± 0.5 milliunits/mg (7 determinations with a range of 1.8–2.9 milliunits/mg). Therefore, based on specific activity measurements, our data suggest that C406A MAO A exhibits 36% that of WT MAO A. Estimates of MAO catalytic sites in our mitochondrial preparations using clorgyline titrations result in a calculatedk cat of 22 min−1 for kynuramine oxidation by WT MAO A and 8 min−1for the C406A mutant. Using the published data in Hiro et al. (6.Hiro I. Tsugero Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests the k cat for kynuramine oxidation by the WT rat liver enzyme is 9 min−1, which is within the range of our value when consideration is given to variations in expressed activity among different preparations. However, titrations of clorgyline inhibition of enzyme activity results in overestimates of MAO A levels in crude preparations presumably due to nonspecific binding of clorgyline (19.O'Carrol A.M. Anderson M.C. Tobbia I. Phillips J.P. Tipton K.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,20.Gomez N. Unzeta M. Tipton K.F. Anderson M.C. O'Carroll A.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since k cat for kynuramine oxidation by purified WT MAO A is 120 min−1 (17.Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4624-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the level of WT MAO A in our preparations is overestimated by a factor of 5.5 from clorgyline titration data. Thus, our assumption is thatk cat values for WT MAO A in both soluble form and in mitochondrial preparations are similar and taken to be 120 min−1. With this comparative data as a basis between the WT and C406A MAO A preparations, the influence of flavin analogue structure on C406A-expressed activity was determined (Table I). Of the riboflavin analogues tested, the 7-halogen-substituted flavin analogues exhibit highest activity (∼5-fold higher than riboflavin), whereas the 8-halogenated flavins exhibit a 2–3-fold higher activity than riboflavin. The 8-nor-8-fluororiboflavin is an exception and has been found previously (3.Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23515-23525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to reconstitute less activity since it probably undergoes side reactions with cellular nucleophiles that lead to a lower effective concentration of this analogue. Those riboflavin analogues where an ethyl group replaces a methyl group in the 8 position are found to exhibit lower activities than riboflavin, possibly as a result of steric influences since the redox potential of these analogues are expected to be similar to that of riboflavin (21.Edmondson D.E. Ghisla S. Ghisla S. Sund H. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin, Germany1999: 71-76Google Scholar). No catalytic activity is observed with 8-nor-8-amino or N(3)-methylriboflavin analogues, as these two analogues are not converted to their respective FAD levels by the yeast enzyme (as will be shown below, the FAD forms of these analogues bind to apoC406A MAO A but do not reconstitute catalytic activity). The 5-deaza-5-carba-FAD also does not reconstitute catalytic activity as expected, since its reduced form does not react catalytically with oxygen. To test whether the differences in observed activities of C406A MAO A in the presence of different flavin analogues are due to different levels of expressed C406A MAO A, mitochondrial proteins from each culture were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with anti-MAO A antibodies (Fig. 1). All cultures tested showed similar levels of C406A MAO A expression (Fig.1), which demonstrates that the nature of the flavin analogue or even its absence has no influence on the level of C406A MAO A expression. As expected, immunoblots using the flavin antisera (22.Barber M.J. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed no evidence for the presence of covalent flavin co-migrating with C406A MAO A (data not shown). The results in Fig. 1 and in Table I show that galactose induction of C406A MAO A in the absence of riboflavin in the medium results in synthesis of the protein and insertion into the mitochondrial membrane of the yeast with no observable catalytic activity. To test whether this apo form of the enzyme is activated by the addition of FAD, mitochondria were isolated from yeast cultures in which C406A MAO A was induced in the absence of riboflavin. Activity levels were determined upon the addition of FAD in the absence of any detergent since the inclusion of Triton X-100 might be expected to disrupt the membrane and lead to inactivation of the mutant enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, kynuramine oxidase activity is restored on the addition of FAD to the mitochondria. The activity increases in a hyperbolic dependence on the FAD concentration. Analysis of the data using a single site binding equation shows a good fit with the experimental data with an apparent K dof 62 ± 5 nm. The maximal activity expressed at saturating FAD concentrations is 0.17 ± 0.05 milliunits/mg (average of 14 determinations ranging in value from 0.09 to 0.26 milliunits/mg). Note that the maximal activity reconstituted by FAD addition is ∼20% that observed when C406A MAO A is expressed in the presence of riboflavin (see above). The lowered level of expressed activity could be due to either damage of the apoenzyme on cell disruption and mitochondrial isolation or to improper folding of a fraction of the apoenzyme on insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Current data do not allow the resolution of these two possibilities or evidence to support other possibilities. No activity is observed on incubation of apoC406A MAO A with riboflavin or FMN, which demonstrates the specificity of the flavin binding site for FAD. Incubation of the FAD-reactivated C406A MAO A with the irreversible inhibitor clorgyline results in complete inhibition of catalytic activity (data not shown), as observed previously (6.Hiro I. Tsugero Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With the ability to reconstitute apoC406A MAO A catalytic activity with FAD, it was of interest to examine the ability of FAD analogues to reconstitute the enzyme activity as well as to determine their relative binding affinities. In addition, FAD analogues can be prepared from several of the riboflavin analogues that are not converted by the yeast FAD synthetase system. Twelve FAD analogues were prepared and purified from their respective parent riboflavin forms by recombinantC. ammoniagenes FAD synthetase, which exhibits a broad substrate specificity. The results in Table II show the relative levels of kynuramine oxidase activities relative to an FAD control as well as the relative binding affinities upon reconstitution experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 2. Those FAD analogues with halogen substituents in either the 7 or 8 positions exhibit limiting activities ranging from 3- to 7-fold higher than FAD. In addition, the high potential analogue 8-nor-8-cyano-FAD (E m,7 = −50 mV (14.Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) exhibits a limiting activity ∼4-fold higher than FAD (E m,7 = −208 mV (23.Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Five FAD analogues (8-α-methyl; 5-deaza-5-carba; 8-nor-8-amino; 1-deaza-1-carba; and N(3)-methyl-FAD) do not reconstitute any detectable activity.Table IIActivities of reconstituted apoC406A MAO A in the presence of different FAD analogues and the binding constants of the FAD analogues for apoMAO AFlavin analoguePercent specific activity of FAD controlK dnmFAD10062 ± 57-Nor-7-chloro-FAD475 ± 1044 ± 28-Nor-8-chloro-FAD694 ± 1462 ± 58-α-Methyl-FAD <590 ± 12 aDetermined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD.5-Deaza-5-carba-FAD <569 ± 5 aDetermined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD.1-Deaza-1-carba-FAD <5377 ± 32 aDetermined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD.8-Nor-8-amino-FAD <5240 ± 64 aDetermined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD.N(3)-methyl-FAD <5920 ± 108 aDetermined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD.7-Nor-7-chloro-8-nor-8-chloro-FAD317 ± 442 ± 27-α-Methyl-FAD47 ± 330 ± 87-α-Methyl-8-nor-8-bromo-FAD323 ± 1346 ± 67-α-Methyl-8-nor-8-chloro-FAD383 ± 1042 ± 48-Nor-8-cyano-FAD437 ± 3861 ± 17a Determined by competitive binding experiment with 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD. Open table in a new tab The relative binding affinities were determined for those analogues that reconstitute MAO A activity as described for FAD (Fig. 2). The relative binding affinities for those FAD analogues not reconstituting MAO A activity were estimated by competition experiments with one of the FAD analogues exhibiting high catalytic activity. An example of this competition experiment is shown in Fig.3, where 8α-methyl-FAD (which exhibits less than 5% the activity of FAD when incubated with apoC406A MAOA) markedly influences the observed apparent K d for 7-nor-7-chloro-FAD reconstitution of the enzyme. From this data, an apparent K d for 8α-methyl-FAD binding to apoC406A MAO A is determined to be 90 ± 12 nm. Using the same approach, the binding affinities of other FAD analogues that do not reconstitute MAO A activity were also determined (Table II). As shown in Table II, most of the FAD analogues bind apoC406A MAO A with binding affinities similar to that of normal FAD, with the exception of 1-deaza-1-carba, 8-nor-8-amino, and N(3)-methyl-FAD analogues. The tight binding of 5-deaza-5-carba-FAD is reasonable since this analogue has similar steric features as FAD. The absence of activity is attributed to the inability of the reduced form of this analogue to react with oxygen and may also be due to a slow rate of reduction by the substrate since it has a low oxidation-reduction potential (E m,7 = −310 mV (24.Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The inability of other analogues to reconstitute catalytic activity even at saturating concentrations provides some new insights into the FAD binding site of MAO A, which has heretofore been inaccessible due to t"
https://openalex.org/W2168615333,"Serpins are the prototypical members of the conformational disease family, a group of proteins that undergoes a change in shape that subsequently leads to tissue deposition. One specific example is α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), which undergoes misfolding and aggregation that has been implicated in emphysema and Alzheimer's disease. In this study we have used guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation to investigate the conformational changes involved in the folding and unfolding of ACT. When the reaction was followed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, one stable intermediate was observed in 1.5 mGdnHCl. The same experiment monitored by fluorescence revealed a second intermediate formed in 2.5 m GdnHCl. Both these intermediates bound the hydrophobic dye ANS. These data suggest a four-state model for ACT folding N ↔ I1 ↔ I2 ↔ U. I1 and I2 both have a similar loss of secondary structure (20%) compared with the native state. In I2, however, there is a significant loss of tertiary interactions as revealed by changes in fluorescence emission maximum and intensity. Kinetic analysis of the unfolding reaction indicated that the native state is unstable with a fast rate of unfolding in water of 0.4 s−1. The implications of these data for both ACT function and associated diseases are discussed.

The serpin superfamily includes some of the most studied proteins involved in this group of disorders. The misfolding and aggregation of serpins have been implicated in diseases ranging from emphysema and liver disease, to cancer and dementia (3Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

It is, however, extremely surprising that so little is known about the basic folding pathways of this class of protein. A number of studies have shown that α1-antitrypsin unfolds through one intermediate (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29628-29632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (10Wang Z. Mottonen J. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16443-16448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown similar results. The folding pathway of α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT),1 which is involved in regulation of several proteinases, including chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, has, so far, received no attention. ACT is an acute phase DNA binding glycoprotein that possesses the characteristic serpin tertiary fold, composed of three β-sheets (A, B, and C) surrounded by nine α-helices (A–I) (11Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic and biochemical data have shown that ACT is capable of adopting several different conformations (12Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Chang W.S. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the reactive center loop (RCL) by noncognate proteinases causes full insertion of the RCL into the A β-sheet, forming an additional β-strand, which confers additional stability to the protein (12Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The recent structure of an ACT variant demonstrated that partial insertion of the RCL was also possible, concomitant with unwinding and insertion of part of the F-helix, which lies on the A β-sheet (14Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RCL sheet insertion is also possible in the absence of proteolytic cleavage, two examples of which are the adoption of the latent conformation (13Chang W.S. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the formation of serpin polymers (14Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These conformations are all accessible due to the mobility of the RCL and the A β-sheet. This mobility is essential for the inhibitory function of serpins but can also be adversely affected by mutations (15Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which cause ACT to become either a proteinase substrate or to undergo polymerization. The structural changes involved in these processes are relatively well understood, however, the conformational changes involved in the folding reaction have never been characterized. It is not only the folding of serpins that is poorly understood; the folding behavior of large proteins in general is also unclear. The folding pathways of small proteins have received immense attention, primarily due to the ease with which data can be obtained and interpreted (16Jackson S.E. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). These studies, for a small number of proteins, have revealed at high resolution how a linear polypeptide chain folds to its unique three-dimensional structure. Large monomeric proteins are not amenable to many of the high resolution techniques such as NMR applied to small proteins. In this study we have used a combination of spectroscopic approaches, including intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, to monitor the structural changes that occur within ACT as it unfolds and folds under equilibrium conditions. We have identified two intermediates on the unfolding pathway; the first shows many similarities to that of α1-AT, whereas the other has not been previously identified for any serpin. Kinetic characterization also demonstrates that the serpins are unstable and designed for dramatic conformational change. Ultrapure grade guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. 8-Anilinonaphthelene 1-sulfonate (ANS) was purchased from Sigma. ACT and α1-AT were purified as described previously (17Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and were greater than 95% pure, with no polymeric material found upon native gel analysis. Their concentration and activity were determined as described previously (20Plotnick M.I. Schechter N.M. Wang Z.M. Liu X. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14601-14608Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,21Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12241-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of inhibition against chymotrypsin was found to be 1, indicating full activity. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter using a thermostatted cuvette at 25 °C in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2.5 nm for all spectra, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min was used. The absorbance at the excitation wavelength was monitored in all experiments and remained below 0.05. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter using a thermostatted cuvette at 25 °C. Far UV spectra from 190 to 250 nm were collected with 5 s/point signal averaging; θ222 measurements were made with the signal averaged over 15 s. The concentration of protein used was 0.1 mg/ml with a 0.1-cm path length. Stock solutions of GdnHCl (7m) in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, were prepared and filtered through 0.2-μm membranes before use. The GdnHCl concentration was determined by refractive index measurements as described previously (22Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding and refolding curves were determined by adding a concentrated solution of either native or denatured protein to a series of GdnHCl concentrations. These solutions were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C before analysis by measuring either the fluorescence emission spectra of the protein solution or the change in signal at 222 nm in the far UV spectra, as a function of denaturant concentration. No differences were observed in experiments where spectroscopic measurements were made after more extensive equilibration. All unfolding data were fit to a three-state unfolding model, using a nonlinear least-squares-fitting algorithm, as described previously (23Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). This analysis recognizes the presence of one stable intermediate structure, I, populated during the transition from the folded state (N) to the unfolded state (U). The free energy unfolding in 0 mdenaturant, ΔGH2O, andm value for each transition were determined from this analysis. The midpoint, Dm, of each transition was calculated by ΔGH2O/m. Samples of ACT (200 nm) were incubated in increasing concentrations of GdnHCl in the presence of ANS (1 μm) at 25 °C for 30 min. The resulting fluorescence emission spectrum was then scanned (λex = 390 nm) between 450 and 550 nm. Unfolding was monitored by changes in fluorescence at wavelengths >320 nm using a cut-off filter and an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Experiments were performed on anApplied Photophysics SF.18MV stopped-flow apparatus. Unfolding was performed by rapidly mixing one volume of 10 μm protein solution with 10 volumes of concentrated GdnHCl solution at 25 °C. Both solutions contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mmNaCl, pH 7.8. Data was collected from at least eight experiments, which were averaged and fitted to a single exponential function with a term included for baseline instability using the manufacturer's software. The three-dimensional structure of ACT conforms with the typical serpin tertiary structure, consisting of three β-sheets surrounded by nine α-helices (Fig. 1). ACT contains three tryptophan residues, which all contribute differently to the overall fluorescent signal observed for the protein. Trp-194 is one of the most highly conserved residues across the serpin family and is located buried between the A and B β-sheets of the molecule, at the top of strand 3 of the A β-sheet (Fig. 1). Trp-276, located on the H helix, is buried against the B β-sheet, whereas Trp-215 is fully solvent-exposed, located at the end of strand 3 of the C β-sheet. The normalized fluorescence emission spectrum (λex = 290 nm) of native ACT is shown in Fig. 2, and reveals an emission maximum (λmax) of 333 nm. Increasing concentrations of GdnHCl caused a red-shift of λmax, along with a concomitant decrease in emission intensity (Fig.2 A). The far-UV CD spectrum for the native state of ACT shows a minimum at 222 nm (Fig. 2 B) similar to other serpins, indicating that the serpin family members adopt the same amount of secondary structure (9Liu T. Pemberton P.A. Robertson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29628-29632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The native spectrum was analyzed using the CONTIN algorithm (25Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) and gave a predicted secondary structure content of 29% α-helix and 37% β-sheet, which agrees closely with the x-ray structure of ACT and other serpins (7Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Liu T. Pemberton P.A. Robertson A.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the unfolding and refolding pathways of ACT. Throughout these studies we compared the results with those of α1-AT, whose unfolding pathway has been well characterized by many groups, including our own (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol.

The unfolding profiles for ACT and α1-AT monitored by fluorescence emission maximum (λmax) are shown in Fig.3 A and Fig.4 A, respectively. The profiles for ACT were the same over a concentration range of 0.01–0.1 mg/ml protein, and analysis of various samples by native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration indicated that at these low concentrations no polymeric material was present. Similar concentration dependence is observed for α1-AT (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ACT remained stable below 1m GdnHCl and was fully unfolded in denaturant concentrations above 4 m. Increasing GdnHCl concentrations caused λmax to gradually red-shift to a wavelength of 353 nm, indicative of tryptophan residues fully exposed to solvent. Above 5m GdnHCl the emission spectra also displayed a distinct peak around 308 nm, indicating the spatial separation of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues (Fig. 2 A). The λmaxunfolding curve of ACT showed two cooperative transitions (Fig.3 A). The first, associated with a small increase in λmax from 333 to 336 nm, and with a Dm of 1.5m. The second, larger transition (336–353 nm) occurred in a highly cooperative manner with a Dm of 3.5 m(Fig. 3 A). These ACT data indicate the presence of a stable intermediate formed in 2.5 m GdnHCl. The identical experiment with α1-AT reveals a different result. The unfolding of α1-AT resulted in a single cooperative transition occurring with a midpoint of 2.8 m GdnHCl, and there is no indication of any intermediates in the unfolding pathway (Fig. 4 A). Both ACT and α1-AT displayed completely reversible unfolding/refolding pathways.Figure 4GdnHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding of α1-AT. Structural changes in α1-AT during unfolding unfolding (▪) and refolding (■) were monitored by fluorescence emission maximum (A), fluorescence intensity (B), and CD (C) and plotted as a function of GdnHCl concentration. Fluorescence emission and intensity (λex = 290 nm) were recorded with a bandpass of 2.5 nm. CD changes were monitored at 222 nm. Thelines represent the two- and three-state curves fitted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shaded areasrepresent the conditions that favor formation of the intermediates I. All experiments were performed at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although λmax reports changes in the solvent exposure of the tryptophan residues, changes in fluorescence intensity (I330) can provide further information regarding the solvent exposure and the proximity of neighboring charged residues, which may quench the fluorescence of the tryptophan residues (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2 Ed. Plenum Publishers, NY1999Crossref Google Scholar). The denaturation profile observed for ACT through changes in I330 again reveals two transitions, with midpoints of 1.5 and 3.4 m GdnHCl. These are similar to those determined using λmax, suggesting that both probes are monitoring the same structural movements. These data suggest the presence of a single stable intermediate in the unfolding pathway of ACT. The I330 changes of α1-AT consisted of two transitions, the first is a dramatic increase in I330, which occurs with a midpoint of 0.8 m (Fig. 4 B). Because this occurs without a change in λmax, it presumably represents the movement of side chains that quench the fluorescence of the Trp residues in the native state. The first transition is followed by a decrease in I330 with a midpoint of 2.9 m, similar to the value obtained using λmax as the probe. These data indicate that α1-AT also unfolds through one intermediate, which exists in low concentrations of denaturant. The unfolding was also monitored by far-UV CD, which follows the changes in overall secondary structure. Both ACT and α1-AT exhibited two transitions that involved a decrease in secondary structural content. The first transition occurred with a midpoint of approximately 0.8 m and was associated with approximately 20% loss of CD signal amplitude at 222 nm (Figs.3 C and 4 C). The second, larger transition corresponded to a complete loss of secondary structure, with Dm of 3.5 m. Both CD and fluorescence indicated that the protein was completely unfolded in 4.0 m GdnHCl. It is also interesting to note that, although ACT and α1-AT share only 30% sequence identity, they appear to unfold through similar pathways, as monitored by CD spectroscopy. Under the low protein concentrations used in these experiments, ACT unfolding was fully reversible. Each data set was therefore analyzed using a three-state model (23Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The calculated free energy changes for the N ↔ I1, I1 ↔ I2, and I2 ↔ U transitions of ACT are 5.3, 7.4, and 11.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Table I). The denaturant dependence of each transition, the m value, decreases from 5.5 to 4.8 to 3.3 kcal/mol/m as the reaction moves from N to U. The N ↔ I1 transition was monitored by CD spectroscopy, whereas the I1 ↔ I2 and I2 ↔ U transitions were monitored by the change in λmax.Table IAnalysis of the equilibrium and kinetic unfolding dataProteinEquilibrium analysisKinetic analysisΔG N→Im N→ID mN→IΔG I→Um I→UD mI→UkUH2Om kukcal/molkcal/mol/mmkcal/molkcal/mol/mms −1m−1 ACT0.350.80 αI-AT0.360.76λmax ACT7.434.841.5411.713.333.52I330 ACT2.181.461.498.172.213.70 αI-AT2.533.000.843.621.232.94FAR-UV CD ACT5.345.490.974.461.303.43 αI-AT4.014.920.815.101.663.07Results from Figs. 3 and 4 were fit to three-state unfolding analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the results presented represent the average of five individual curves ΔG N→I, ΔG I→U represent the free energy change for the unfolding for the N → I and I → U transitions, respectively. m N→I,m I→U represent the m values for the N → I and I → U transitions, respectively.

Ptitsyn and colleagues (27Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) have shown that a specific tool for detecting intermediate states in protein folding is the binding of the fluorescent probe ANS. ANS often binds weakly to native states, but its binding to equilibrium intermediates is usually much stronger and is accompanied by an increase in fluorescence intensity. Fig.5 shows that ANS binds weakly to the native state of ACT and that as ACT is denatured, using GdnHCl, there is a dramatic increase in ANS fluorescence. Maximum binding was achieved at 1.7 m GdnHCl which coincides with I1. There was, however, an asymmetry in the binding curve with another maximum at 2.7 m that coincides with I2. Similar asymmetrical binding curves have previously been observed for bovine carbonic anhydrase, which also undergoes a four-state folding pathway (28Uversky V.N. Ptitsyn O.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To thoroughly characterize the folding pathway of ACT, kinetic analysis of both the folding and unfolding reactions was carried out. The increased concentrations of protein required for the stopped-flow experiments, however, resulted in aggregation during refolding, so accurate and reproducible folding data could not be collected. Unfolding was examined beyond the transition region ([GdnHCl] > 4 m) so that there was no contribution from the refolding region. The data for each of the proteins could be described using a single exponential equation and a plot of log k U versus GdnHCl concentration was performed (Fig. 6). It was found that log k U was linearly dependent on denaturant concentration. Extrapolation of the data allowed kUH2O, the unfolding rate in water, to be determined. It should be noted, however, that the extrapolation from 4.5 to 0 m GdnHCl is long and therefore prone to error. The two proteins exhibited similar kUH2O values, at 0.35 s−1 (ACT) and 0.36 s−1(α1-AT) (Table I). The dependence of logk U on denaturant concentration,mku, was also the similar for the proteins, at 0.80 m−1 (ACT) and 0.76m−1 (α1-AT) (Table I). This rate of unfolding in water is extremely high and indicates that both ACT and α1-AT possess high conformational instability. Understanding the conformational changes involved in protein folding is essential if we are to one day solve the so called “protein folding problem.” This information is also fundamental to understanding many disease states. The ability to undergo conformational change is crucial for the physiological function of serpins and is the basis for their metastability (29Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This conformational property, however, makes the serpins exceptionally susceptible to mutation and predisposes carriers to disease (2Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 15Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Many different mutations may cause a serpin to self-associate during folding, which leads to tissue deposition. The aim of this study was to characterize the folding pathway of ACT, which has been implicated in numerous disorders, to provide the essential background for understanding how mutations can have such deleterious effects. Data presented here showed that the equilibrium unfolding reaction of ACT as monitored by fluorescence and CD did not coincide, indicating a multistep process. The unfolding transitions observed by both techniques are compatible with a four-state model, involving at least two stable, partially unfolded intermediates in addition to the native and unfolded states that can best be described by the pathway N ↔ I1 ↔ I2 ↔ U. The presence of two intermediates in a serpin folding pathway is, so far, unique to ACT, because α1-AT and other serpins that have been studied to date possess a single equilibrium intermediate (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,9Liu T. Pemberton P.A. Robertson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29628-29632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Wang Z. Mottonen J. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16443-16448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Villanueva G.B. Allen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11010-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native state structure of ACT has been solved by crystallography and is well characterized (11Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The spectral properties of the unfolded state strongly indicate that it lacks any secondary structure and the tryptophan residues are fully exposed to solvent. From the data presented here we can begin to comment on the structure of both I1 and I2, and compare them to previously reported intermediates in the serpin folding pathway. I1 was observed by CD spectroscopy and possesses only 80% of the far-UV signal of native ACT. From the fluorescence data it is clear that this loss of structure does not involve regions around the three Trp residues, Because their fluorescence properties are unchanged. Our previous study with α1-AT indicated that this loss of structure involved movement around the A and C β-sheets (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the recent structure of an inactive variant of ACT (termed δ Leu-55-Pro ACT), in which the RCL is partially inserted into the A β-sheet, and the F-helix partially unwound, may approximate to the intermediate state in polymerization (14Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The conformational change required to form this structure from the native state would cause no significant change in the environment of the tryptophan residues, and the change in secondary structure from α-helix to β-sheet would lead to a decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm. This suggests that I1 may indeed have some of the structural characteristics of δ ACT, although further structural studies will be required to confirm this. The transition from the I1 to I2 state, perhaps surprisingly, does not involve any loss of secondary structure. The conformational changes are more subtle, involving a combination of increased solvent exposure and alteration of side chain conformations around the Trp residues. Although the I1 state involves a loss of secondary structure, I2 results from a loss of tertiary interactions suggesting that I2 has some of the properties of a molten globule state as defined by Ptitsyn (28Uversky V.N. Ptitsyn O.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar),i.e. it possesses substantial secondary structure but lacks rigid tertiary structure. From the position of the Trp residues we propose that these changes are around Trp-194 and Trp-276. Trp-215 is fully solvent-exposed on the C β-sheet (Fig. 1), and it is unlikely that it would contribute to fluorescence changes as the protein unfolds. Trp-194 and Trp-276 are buried against different faces of the B β-sheet. In our previous study with α1-AT, we proposed that the B β-sheet was the last secondary structural element to unfold (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data support this hypothesis, suggesting that the structural transition from I1 to I2 involves loss of tertiary interactions around this critical β-sheet, which precede total unfolding. One important observation in our study came from the examination of the rate constants for unfolding. We examined the unfolding rate at high denaturant concentration (GdnHCl > 4 m) so that the folding reaction played no part. In doing so we were able to estimate kUH2O, the rate of unfolding in the absence of denaturant. For both ACT and α1-AT, this value was around 0.4 s−1, which is a relatively fast rate even more so considering their relatively large size (400 amino acid residues). The unfolding rate of most small proteins (>150 amino acid residues) in the absence of denaturant is very slow, generally around 10−3 to 10−5s−1 (16Jackson S.E. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Exceptions to this at 25 °C are the cold shock family of proteins (12 s−1; approximately 66 amino acid residues) and tumor supressor protein p16 (0.8 s−1; 156 amino acid residues) (32Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1869-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Schindler T. Herrler M. Marahiel M.A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is proposed that these fast rates are indicative of flexibility within the protein that is required for normal function (32Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1869-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The data presented here agree with this model. Serpins undergo dramatic conformational change for inhibition in which the A β-sheet opens and the RCL inserts, resulting in a translocation of the proteinase from one pole of the molecule to another (30Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Possessing a high kUH2Oimplies conformational flexibility that would facilitate such conformational changes. The structure and folding of serpins are well known to be highly sensitive to point mutations (2Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 15Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 35Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may be due to their inherently low barrier to unfolding. There is some evidence (36Yu M.H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that in the case of Z α1-AT the mutation causes a preferential stabilization of the intermediate, I1. This may be a consequence of the conformational flexibility of the wild type protein being reduced. Previous work on serpin folding has identified one intermediate and indicated that the serpin folding pathway is conserved (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Liu T. Pemberton P.A. Robertson A.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16443-16448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The fluorescence and CD data presented here for α1-AT only identified I1, which may indicate that ACT and α1-AT are unfolding via different pathways or that I2 was only detected because of the different tryptophan location within ACT. This latter option appears probable given the almost identical far-UV CD unfolding traces for ACT and α1-AT. A substantial body of work, however, has been performed on the unfolding pathways of α1-AT mutants, using probes placed at various sites around the molecule, and no second intermediate has been detected by these methods (6James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is possible that the unique optical properties of the stable intermediates of ACT have allowed the identification of an additional intermediate, I2. I2, although possessing a similar amount of secondary structure, lacks crucial tertiary interactions that presumably maintain the serpin fold. It would be very interesting to introduce the same optical probes into other serpins to determine whether I2 exists in their pathways. If so, it would suggest that the folding pathway of the serpin superfamily is conserved. We thank Drs. Craig Morton and Phillip Bird for their useful comments."

Twenty-three years ago, with the discovery of splicing, the basic idea of a gene as a “block” of DNA was challenged. Today, exciting new observations are being made.

About 25% ofC. elegans genes are in operons (for a review see Ref. 7Blumenthal T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25328-25334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ouzounis C.A. Kyrpides N.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In terrestrial vertebrates (ureotelic), two forms of the enzyme are produced, arginase I (A-I), a cytosolic form specific for liver and red cells, and arginase II (A-II), a ubiquitous mitochondrial form found in particular in kidneys and brain. A-I is a key enzyme for the hydrolysis of arginine in the urea cycle, producing urea that enables the elimination of excess ammonia. The A-I form contributes 98% of the arginase activity in liver and is absent in clinical arginemia. Patients with arginemia have low levels of arginase activity in red cells, accumulate arginine in their blood and spinal fluid, and have higher than normal blood levels of ammonia. Accumulation of ammonia has very toxic effects in animals, and although patients with moderate decreases of A-I levels respond well to dietary treatments, severe A-I deficiencies cause severe mental and psychomotor retardation, mental disorders, epileptic seizures, coma, and early death. The effect of alteration in the activity of extrahepatic A-II has not been described. It has been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of polyamines, amino acids, and neurotransmittors and competes with nitric-oxide synthase in macrophages, but its role remains poorly defined (for reviews see Refs. 14Jenkinson C.P. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 114: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar and 17Boucher J.L. Moali C. Tenu J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1015-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the mitochondrial A-II is the surviving form of the ancestral arginase, because the cytosolic A-I is restricted to a subset of more recently evolved species (14Jenkinson C.P. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 114: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Aside from ureotelic organisms, most others produce only one form of arginase. In particular, in S. cerevisiae, arginase is encoded by the CAR1 gene, which has been extensively characterized (18Jauniaux J.C. Dubois E. Vissers S. Crabeel M. Wiame J.M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Green S.M. Eisenstein E. McPhie P. Hensley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAR1 encodes a cytosolic arginase that converts arginine to urea and ornithine. Although S. cerevisiae produces all the enzymes required to complete the urea cycle, compartmental separation of metabolic pathways and sophisticated regulation lead to the absence of a functional urea cycle. Sequencing of the S. cerevisiae genome did not reveal any additional arginase-related sequences (1Mewes H.W. Albermann K. Bahr M. Frishman D. Gleissner A. Hani J. Heumann K. Kleine K. Maierl A. Oliver S.G. Pfeiffer F. Zollner A. Nature. 1997; 387 (suppl.): 7-65Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, whose entire genome has also been sequenced (2C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar), only one gene showing significant relationship with known arginase genes has been identified (20Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris S.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 15: 23-37Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). No biological information is available yet on the function of this gene. Animals have evolved pathways adapted to their lifestyle for the excretion of urea, uric acid, or ammonia as the major nitrogeneous end product. The excretion of urea produced through the urea cycle is specific for ureotelic organisms. Insects (uricotelic) convert most of their excess ammonia to uric acid, an oxidized purine, via an arginase-independent pathway. Thus, the arginase function in uricotelic organisms, and more generally in organisms that do not have a functional urea cycle, is not centered on ammonia detoxification and remains poorly understood. Analysis of the arginase gene ofDrosophila, amenable to molecular and genetic analysis, should give insights into this other aspects of arginase activity. A Drosophilahead cDNA library in the λgt11 vector (a gift from Paul Salvaterra; Ref. 21Itoh N. Salvaterra P. Itakura K. Drosophila Information Service. 1985; 61: 89Google Scholar) was screened with a genomic probe corresponding to a mixture of two radiolabeled BamHI restriction fragments (kb 8–18 on the scale in Fig. 1) to obtain elav cDNAs clones. Among the cDNAs isolated in this screen, one clone (cDNA-30h) originated from a transcription unit different fromelav. Its analysis is reported in this paper. cDNA-30h phage lysates were prepared on plates and used to generate PCR products corresponding to the cDNA insert. Amplification mixtures were as perTaq DNA polymerase manufacturer's specifications (Promega), with 2 μl of lysate/25-μl reaction, using a pair of primers hybridizing to regions flanking the cDNA insert in λgt11, respectively gt11F (5′-GGTGGCGACGAGTCCTGGAGC) and gt11R (5′-GACACCAGACCAACTGGTAAT). Amplification yield was not affected by the lysate titer in the 108–1011 plaque-forming unit/ml range. Taq polymerase addition to the PCR mixture was performed after the initial step of hot start (95 °C for 1 min and 80 °C for 15 min). Amplification was performed with 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. After purification on the Wizard PCR preps purification system (Promega), the PCR product was sequenced using gt11 primers and subsequently primers hybridizing in the cDNA sequence. When cDNA-30h was originally characterized, the genomic sequence upstream of the BamHI restriction site at position 1 (see Fig. 1) had not yet been determined. To verify the predicted structure of cDNA-30h and determine the distance between 3′ elavgenomic sequences and the genomic region corresponding to cDNA-30h, genomic PCR (with DNA from the wild type strain CantonS) were performed, using oligonucleotides ARG2 (5′-GTCGCGCTCGCTGCCTAG) and ARG3 (5′-GATAGGCACTCCAGCGAAC), as shown on Fig. 1. Amplification mixtures included 50 ng of genomic DNA in a 25-μl reaction. Enzyme addition to the PCR mixture was performed after the initial step of hot start (95 °C for 1 min). Amplification was performed with 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. Sequence determination of phage and genomic PCR products were performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center/Eppley molecular biology core facility on Applied Biosystems and Li-Cor sequencers. The sequence of the Drosophila arginase is available from GenBankTM under accession number AF228517. Sequence analysis and comparisons were performed with the Wisconsin Package (version 10.0; Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Protein sequences were obtained from the following Swiss Protein Data Base accession numbers: P78540(A-II Homo sapiens), O08691 (A-II Mus musculus),Q91553 (A-II Xenopus laevis), P05089 (A-I H. sapiens), Q61176 (A-I M. musculus), X69820 (A-IX. laevis), P00812 (S. cerevisiae), and GenBankTM accession numbers: AF228517 (D. melanogaster) and U56959 (C. elegans). The Wisconsin Package was used to generate sequence alignments. Total CantonS RNA was prepared from frozen tissues by the guanidine-HCl method (22Cox R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 120-129Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar) for developmental Northern blot analysis. Total RNAs produced from arg andelav mutants stocks was purified from whole flies with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed as described in Ref. 8Yao K.-M. Samson M.-L. Reeves R. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 723-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-substituted dUTP, essentially as in Ref. 23Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, using cDNA-30h as a template for transcription. All crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal medium at 25 °C. Stockelav 4 w/FM6, w/Dp(1;Y)y + sc was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. It carries a double mutation (elav 4) affecting both elav andarg, FM6 is a X chromosome balancer, andDp(1;Y)y + sc is a Y chromosome carrying a translocation of the distal region of the X chromosome including elav. Mutant arg stocks (elav 4/elav 4/Y;350-83-1/350-83-1) were built with standard genetic techniques by combining the double mutationelav 4 with a transposon (350-83-1, Ref. 24Samson M.-L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 723-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying a functional elav gene, but no argcoding sequence. elav e5 is a loss of functionelav allele (8Yao K.-M. Samson M.-L. Reeves R. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 723-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Transposon 353-66-2, similar to350-83-1 carries a functional elav gene but noarg coding sequence (24Samson M.-L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 723-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental delay of the flies carrying the arginasemutation was shown by crossing femaleselav 4/elav 4;350-83-1/350-83-1 with males y w sn. Recombination occurs in the resulting y w sn/elav 4; 350-83-1/+ daughters, providing an opportunity to separate elav 4(hence arg −) from other possible alterations on the X chromosome and thus homogenizing the genetic background. These females were crossed with y w/Y; Tf (2C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)DmORF3/T (2;3)ap Xa males, where Tf (2C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)DmORF3 is a transposon providing elav + function (25Yao K.-M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2994-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but noarg function and T (2;3)ap Xa is a balancer. The parents were removed from the vials after 4 days. The latter cross yields hemizygous arg − andarg + males, homozygousarg +/arg + and heterozygous arg −/arg +females, all segregant brothers and sisters. The yellow(y) and elav genes are very closely spaced on the X chomosome (about 150 kb apart, based upon data from Ref. 6Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and are at the same coordinates (1–0.0) on the genetic map (10FlyBase Consortium Nucleic Acid Res. 1999; 27: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). They recombine at a frequency significantly inferior to 1%. Thus, in the vast majority, y + male progeny areelav 4 (arg −), whereas y males progeny are elav +(arg +). Heterozygousarg +/arg − females were identified as y+ females and homozygousarg +/arg + females asy females. A head cDNA library was screened with a genomic probe corresponding to the presumptive 3′-untranslated region of the elav gene (kb 8–18 on the scale in Fig. 1). Sequencing of the cDNA clones recovered in the screen identified a new transcription unit. The cDNA corresponding to the new transcription unit (cDNA-30h) is 1170 base pairs long. It contains a 349-amino acid-long open reading frame (nucleotides 2–1051), which begins with a tryptophan, indicating that the 5′ region of the mRNA is truncated in cDNA-30h. Searches of protein sequence data bases with the ORF present in cDNA-30h revealed its similarity with arginases. The arginase sequences of ureotelic (H. sapiens, M. musculus, and X. laevis) and nonureotelic (S. cerevisiae and C. elegans) organisms were compared with the Drosophila putative arginase sequence. Arginases contain about 300 amino acids. They include three conserved regions (arginase signatures 1, 2, and 3 from the N terminus to the C terminus) with charged residues involved in the binding of two manganese ions to histidines and aspartic acids in the motifs (26Kanyo Z.F. Scolnick L.R. Ash D.E. Christianson D.W. Nature. 1996; 383: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Comparison of protein sequences highlights the presence of these three arginase family signatures in the Drosophila sequence (Fig.2). The motifs are present in all the compared sequences, and all the invariant residues of the signatures are present. However some positions do not match the defined signature sequences. First, in arginase signature 1, Cys is found in C. elegans where Leu, Ile, Val, Met, or Thr is expected, and Gly is found in D. melanogaster where Ser, Thr, Ala, or Val is expected. Second, in arginase signature 3, Ser is found in D. melanogaster and Val is found in C. elegans where Pro, Ala, or Gln is expected. Extensive alignments of arginase sequences from different species highlight invariant residues (14Jenkinson C.P. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 114: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 20Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris S.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 15: 23-37Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sequences from 19 arginases from vertebrates and procaryotic/eucaryotic unicellular organisms share 37 invariant amino acids (20Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris S.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 15: 23-37Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), with 36 of them present in the D. melanogaster arginase and 27 of them present in the C. elegans arginase-related sequence (Fig.2). Pairwise comparisons (Fig. 3) of vertebrate A-II show that their sequences are 71–85% identical. A-I arginases are 64–87% identical. However, comparisons between the A-I and A-II arginases shows a lower degree of similarity, with 54–67% identity. This is consistent with the model of an arginasegene duplication giving rise to the genes for A-I and A-II (15Patterton D. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25328-25334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris S.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 15: 23-37Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the three proteins from invertebrates similarly resemble hepatic and nonhepatic vertebrate arginases, the identity levels with vertebrate arginases being, respectively, 39–40% for D. melanogaster arginase, 40–45% for S. cerevisiae, and 26–31% for C. elegans. This is consistent with a duplication of the arginase gene giving rise to the genes producing hepatic and extrahepatic arginases after divergence between the vertebrates and the invertebrates (15Patterton D. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25328-25334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris S.M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The predicted N-terminal of the D. melanogaster arginase ORF includes two additional amino acids (M and W) upstream of cDNA-30h ORF (see text), shown in parentheses. Below the alignment, a consensus sequence (plurality 7) is shown, where residues present in all nine compared species are in bold type. The threeblack boxes frame the arginase family signatures.

Based upon the polarity of the arg ORF in cDNA-30h, complementary strands of DNA are transcribed to give rise to the elav and arg transcripts. Limited sequence information was available when the cDNA was first identified (kb 0–18 on scale in Fig. 1; GenBankTM Accession NumberAF047180; Ref. 27Robinow S. Campos A.R. Yao K.-M. White K. Science. 1988; 242: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), 2M.-L. Samson, unpublished observations. and the data suggested that the 3′ end of cDNA-30h derived from a region of DNA upstream of the elav gene. Genomic PCR ofD. melanogaster DNA using primers ARG2 (designed according to cDNA-30h sequence) and ARG3 (designed according to the genomic sequence, see Fig. 1) was performed to demonstrate that elavis within an arg intron. A 1-kb-long PCR product was obtained and sequencing of its ends proved its specificity (not shown). Subsequent genomic sequencing of the entire region (6Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), with data from cosmid 171D11 (accession AL009147) and from cosmid 65F1 (accessionAL022139) around position kb 14 of the scale in Fig. 1, is in agreement with these data. The cDNA-30h clone is truncated at its 5′ end, because the ORF that it contains begins with a tryptophan at nucleotide 2 of the sequence. Four arg expressed sequence tags (ESTs) fromDrosophila adult head tissues have been reported (4Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. George R.A. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Henderson S.N. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). ESTs are sequences of the 5′ or 3′ end of a cDNA that are generated to rapidly identify expressed genes in the genome. None of these ESTs overlaps the junction between exon 3 and 4, but they provide useful information about the 5′ and 3′ ends of the arg RNA. Two of the reported 5′ ESTs (GH02581 and GH02569) begin 99 nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide of cDNA-30h, where their sequence is colinear with genomic DNA sequence. They are likely to define the actual 5′ end of the transcript, which generated CDNA-30 h. Their structure was taken into account to predict the true N terminus of thearg ORF, which includes two amino acids (methionine initiation codon, then tryptophan) upstream of the cDNA-30h ORF, as shown in Fig. 1. The ORF in cDNA-30h is followed by 119 nucleotides, ending with a stretch of eight A residues, likely corresponding to the complete 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA. This is consistent with the structure of the 481-base pair-long arg 3′ EST (GH02581), which identifies the same 3′ end for the arg RNA. The expression of arg was examined during the course of development using single-stranded RNA probes on Northern transfers. A single 1.3-kb-longarg transcript was identified (Fig.4) whose size is consistent with cDNA-30h sequencing and EST data. arg transcripts start accumulating during the last stages of embryogenesis (16-h-old embryos), quickly reach a plateau at 20 h of development, and are thereafter found at relatively high levels. Not surprisingly, thearg transcript is present, but not significantly enriched, in adult head RNA extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 10 and11), consistent with the fact that cDNA-30h and the four arginase ESTs derive from head cDNA libraries. The arg and elav mRNAs arise from transcription of the same genomic region in opposite directions. Based upon data from cDNA-30h, genomic DNA, and thearg ESTs, the structure of the mature argmRNA is well defined. In contrast, multiple developmentally regulated elav mRNA are produced from theelav gene (8Yao K.-M. Samson M.-L. Reeves R. White K. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 723-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Campos A.R. Rosen D.R. Robinow S.N. White K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and their precise structure has not been determined. Thus, it is unclear how much overlap may exist between mature transcripts of arg and elav. An attempt was made to re-evaluate the proposal (based upon Northern blot analy"

Both dietary sodium and dietary potassium depletion substantially increase active potassium absorption. We have recently reported that sodium depletion up-regulates H,K-ATPase α-subunit mRNA and protein expression, whereas potassium depletion up-regulates H,K-ATPase β-subunit mRNA and protein expression. Because overall potassium absorption is non-conductive, K-Cl cotransport (KCC) at the basolateral membrane may also be involved in potassium absorption. Although KCC1 has not been cloned from the colon, we established, in Northern blot analysis with mRNA from the rat distal colon using rabbit kidney KCC1 cDNA as a probe, the presence of an expected size mRNA in the rat colon. This KCC1 mRNA is substantially increased by potassium depletion but only minimally by sodium depletion. KCC1-specific antibody identified a 155-kDa protein in rat colonic basolateral membrane. Potassium depletion but not sodium depletion resulted in an increase in KCC1 protein expression in basolateral membrane. The increase of colonic KCC1 mRNA abundance and KCC1 protein expression in potassium depletion of the rat colonic basolateral membrane suggests that K-Cl cotransporter: 1) is involved in transepithelial potassium absorption and 2) regulates the increase in potassium absorption induced by dietary potassium depletion.

Although KCC1 and KCC2 exhibit approximately 67% sequence homology, they are differentially expressed in rat tissues.

The neuron-specific K-Cl cotransporter isoform KCC2 has recently been characterized as a K-Cl cotransporter and is a primary chloride extruder that promotes fast hyperpolarizing post-synaptic inhibition in the brain (13Rivera C. Viopio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). K-Cl cotransport is also responsible for electroneutral K-Cl absorption in both proximal tubules and the cortical thick ascending limb of rabbit kidney (14Liapis H. Nag M. Kaji D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1432-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potassium transport is an important function of the mammalian large intestine, with evidence of both active potassium absorption and secretion in the distal colon. Active potassium absorption is electroneutral, Na+-dependent, chloride-dependent (in part), and is generally believed to be energized by an apical membrane H,K-ATPase (15DelCastillo J.R. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar, 16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J.

Because overall transepithelial potassium absorption is not conductive (18Sweiry J. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the involvement of an electroneutral process (e.g. K-Cl cotransport) at the basolateral membrane has been proposed (19Binder H.J. Sandle G.I. Johnson L. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 2133-2172Google Scholar). Both dietary sodium depletion (as a result of an increase in serum aldosterone) and dietary potassium depletion enhance active potassium absorption in the rat distal colon (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar, 17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G619-G626PubMed Google Scholar). Apical membrane H,K-ATPase activity is increased in dietary sodium depletion but not in dietary potassium depletion (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the increase in H,K-ATPase activity in sodium depletion, we have recently demonstrated that an up-regulation of colonic H,K-ATPase α subunit mRNA and protein expression may be responsible for the increase in active potassium absorption in dietary sodium depletion. Although an increase in either H,K-ATPase activity or its α subunit was not observed in potassium depletion, an up-regulation of H,K-ATPase β subunit expression at both mRNA and protein levels in dietary potassium depletion may be one of the factors responsible for the enhancement of potassium absorption in potassium depletion (21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the increase in active potassium absorption by dietary potassium depletion that is observed in in vitro studies requires the presence of chloride (17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G619-G626PubMed Google Scholar), a role for basolateral K-Cl cotransport in transepithelial potassium movement is an interesting possibility (19Binder H.J. Sandle G.I. Johnson L. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 2133-2172Google Scholar). It is not known whether other factor(s) also contribute to the enhanced potassium absorption induced by dietary potassium depletion in the rat distal colon. To date, there are no reports of K-Cl cotransport protein expression in the rat distal colon, although the rabbit kidney KCC1 cDNA identified a mRNA in the rat distal colon (8Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Because the up-regulation of active potassium absorption in dietary potassium depletion is chloride-dependent, suggesting that K-Cl cotransport may have a physiological role in colonic potassium absorption, the present study was designed to examine K-Cl cotransport protein expression in normal conditions and in dietary potassium depletion. These present experiments report the expression of KCC1 message and protein in the rat distal colon and its up-regulation by dietary potassium depletion. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼200–250 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were divided into three groups. The control group was fed normal rat food that contained 4.4 g of sodium/kg and 9.5 g of potassium/kg. The sodium-depleted group was given a sodium-free diet for 1 week. The potassium-depleted group was given a potassium-free diet (0.6 mg of potassium/kg) for 3 weeks. All rats were allowed free access to water. On the last day of the experimental diet periods, the animals were killed, and their distal and proximal colons were immediately removed and washed with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated sterilized saline. Colonocytes were prepared as described previously (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from colonocytes using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from total RNA using Oligotex reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Northern blot analyses were performed using poly(A)+ mRNA as described previously (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that a 32P-labeled 1.5-kilobaseBamHI and EcoRI fragment of rabbit KCC1 cDNA was used as a probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in a Hybaid oven for 18 h. Blots were washed for 15 min in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, exposed to x-ray film, and developed. Apical and basolateral membranes were isolated by methods previously described in detail (22Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18638-18644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rajendran V.M. Oesterlin M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purity of apical membranes was assessed by H,K-ATPase (10–12-fold enrichment compared with homogenate) (15DelCastillo J.R. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rajendran V.M. Sangan P. Geibel J. Binder H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13035-13040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas that of basolateral membranes was assessed by Na,K-ATPase (12–15-fold enrichment) (24Rajendran V.M. Sangan P. Geibel J. Binder H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13035-13040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). H,K-ATPase activity was not detected in basolateral membranes, and Na,K-ATPase activity was only minimally present in apical membranes (15DelCastillo J.R. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rajendran V.M. Sangan P. Geibel J. Binder H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13035-13040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except for the use of rabbit KCC1 polyclonal antibody. 2S. R. Brill and B. Forbush III, unpublished data. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the 42-kDa C terminus of rabbit KCC1 protein was bacterially expressed as a GST-KCC1 fusion protein. The affinity purified GST-KCC1 fusion protein was used to raise antibodies in goats. This antibody was specific for KCC1, as determined by Western blot analysis including an immunocompetition experiment with the GST-KCC1 fusion protein, and did not react with related Na-K-2Cl constransport proteins. The KCC1-specific antibody identified an ∼150-kDa protein in rabbit kidney, colon, lung, heart, and brain that correlated with the distribution of KCC1 mRNA (8Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The details of KCC1 antibody production and specificity will be presented elsewhere.2 However, a competition experiment using the C-terminal 42-kDa peptide and the KCC1 antibody was performed. A preincubated mixture of this peptide with the antibody in a 1:1 molar ratio completely prevented the identification of KCC1 protein in basolateral membranes of the distal colon (data not shown). Apical and basolateral membrane proteins (50 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with 1:2000 diluted KCC1 antibody in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk; anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. KCC1-specific protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure. mRNA and protein abundances in colonic membranes from normal, dietary sodium-depleted, and dietary potassium-depleted animals were quantitated on Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively, using a personal densitometer SI with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA). Statistical analyses were performed to compare the control and the two experimental groups using Student'st test. Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from the distal colons of control, sodium-depleted, and potassium-depleted rats using KCC1 cDNA as a probe is shown in Fig. 1 A, and a densitometric analysis is presented in Fig. 1 B. mRNA expression of KCC1 in the distal colon of potassium-depleted rats was substantially increased compared with that of controls (p < 0.001). KCC1 mRNA expression in the distal colon of sodium-depleted rats was minimally increased compared with that of controls (p < 0.05). The abundance of mRNA prepared from rat proximal colons of control, sodium-depleted, and potassium-depleted rats using KCC1 cDNA as a probe was assessed by Northern blot analysis and is shown in Fig.2 A; a densitometric analysis is presented in Fig. 2 B. mRNA expression of KCC1 in the proximal colon of potassium-depleted rats was not altered compared with that of controls. KCC1 mRNA expression in the proximal colon was also not affected by dietary sodium depletion compared with that of controls. Western blot analysis was performed with basolateral membranes using an antibody raised against the entire C terminus of rabbit KCC1. The KCC1 antibody identified a protein in the rat distal colon that was identical in size to that previously seen in the rabbit colon.2 This protein was therefore designated as KCC1 protein. The Western blot analysis of KCC1 protein expression in basolateral membranes of the distal colons of normal, dietary sodium-depleted, and dietary potassium-depleted rats is presented in Fig. 3 A, and a densitometric analysis is shown in Fig. 3 B. KCC1 protein expression was increased in basolateral membranes of dietary potassium-depleted rats compared with those of controls (comparelanes 7–9 with lanes 1–3 of Fig. 3 A) (p < 0.002). In contrast, KCC1 protein expression was reduced (p < 0.01) in basolateral membranes of sodium-depleted rats compared with those of controls (comparelanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3 of Fig.3 A). Fig. 4 presents the Western blot analyses of KCC1 protein in the apical membranes of the rat distal colon in control, sodium-depleted, and potassium-depleted conditions. Although KCC1 protein was not identified in apical membranes of normal or dietary sodium-depleted distal colons, a faint band was seen in apical membranes of dietary potassium-depleted animals, suggesting that this band probably represents contamination by basolateral membranes. The mammalian distal colon serves as an important regulatory system for the maintenance of overall potassium balance with the presence of both potassium absorptive and secretory processes (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar, 17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J.

Potassium transport in the distal colon is the result of both potential-dependent potassium secretion and active potassium absorption and secretion (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar). Studies under voltage clamp conditions have characterized active potassium transport processes. In normal animals active potassium absorption is present and is electroneutral, Na+-independent, and, in part, chloride-dependent. Active potassium absorption involves both apical and basolateral membrane transport processes and is generally believed to be energized by an apical membrane H,K-ATPase (15DelCastillo J.R. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that there are at least two different H,K-ATPase isoforms, one that is ouabain-sensitive and one that is ouabain-insensitive (26Rajendran V.M. Singh S.K. Geibel J. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G424-G429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol.

The ouabain-insensitive H,K-ATPase is present exclusively in surface cells and is the H,K-ATPase that has been cloned and expressed (26Rajendran V.M. Singh S.K. Geibel J. Binder H.J. Am. J.

Invest. 1995; 96: 2001-2008Google Scholar). The mechanism of potassium movement across the basolateral membrane is not known. Because potassium absorption is partially chloride-dependent, models of potassium absorption have proposed either a coupling of K+-H+ exchange to a chloride-anion exchange at the apical membrane or K-Cl cotransport at the basolateral membrane (19Binder H.J. Sandle G.I. Johnson L. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 2133-2172Google Scholar). The latter possibility is consistent with the experimental evidence that transepithelial potassium absorption is not conductive, because the addition of potassium channel blockers to the serosal bath did not alter mucosal-to-serosal potassium fluxes (18Sweiry J. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Potassium transport in the rat distal colon is altered by changes in dietary potassium balance (17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G619-G626PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in dietary potassium stimulates potassium secretion but does not alter active potassium absorption, whereas dietary potassium depletion enhances active potassium absorption but does not affect potassium secretion (17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G619-G626PubMed Google Scholar). Active potassium absorption is also substantially increased by aldosterone in experiments with dietary sodium depletion or with aldosterone administered via subcutaneous infusion (33Turnamian S.G. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Only after aldosterone-induced potassium secretion is inhibited is the increase in active potassium absorption demonstrated or unmasked (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms by which dietary potassium depletion and aldosterone increase active potassium absorption differ (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aldosterone increases both apical membrane H,K-ATPase activity and H,K-ATPase α subunit (HKcα) mRNA and protein but does not alter H,K-ATPase β subunit (HKcβ) mRNA and protein (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, dietary potassium depletion does not affect H,K-ATPase activity or HKcα mRNA and protein expression but increases HKcβ mRNA and protein expression (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how the changes in the β subunit of H,K-ATPase induced by dietary potassium depletion are linked to the increase in active potassium absorption or whether another mechanism(s) is responsible for the increase in potassium absorption by dietary potassium depletion. The stimulation of active potassium absorption both by dietary potassium depletion and aldosterone is dependent on chloride. In the absence of chloride neither potassium depletion nor aldosterone enhances active potassium absorption (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar, 17Foster E.S. Sandle G.I. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G619-G626PubMed Google Scholar). This observation and the non-conductive nature of active potassium absorption initially suggested a possible role for basolateral K-Cl cotransport. The present results provide compelling supportive evidence that the chloride-dependent potassium absorption induced by dietary potassium depletion may be mediated by K-Cl cotransport at the basolateral membrane. Figs. 1 and 3 demonstrate that dietary potassium depletion increases KCC1 mRNA and protein expression at the basolateral membrane. The increase in potassium absorption that is induced by aldosterone does not appear to involve basolateral membrane K-Cl cotransporter, because KCC1 mRNA abundance was increased modestly, but KCC1 protein expression was reduced by dietary sodium depletion (Figs. 1 and 3). Furthermore, KCC1 mRNA is not increased by dietary potassium depletion in the proximal colon, where active potassium absorption is neither present nor induced by dietary potassium depletion (16Foster E.S. Hayslett J.P. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G611-G617PubMed Google Scholar). There is limited additional evidence of the regulation of K-Cl cotransport by potassium. K-Cl cotransport is enhanced byN-ethylmaleimide in sheep erythrocytes when exposed to low [K+] (25Lauf P.K. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1981; 56: 13-34PubMed Google Scholar). Although dietary potassium absorption also increases renal potassium absorption, a specific role for K-Cl cotransport in the enhancement of renal tubular potassium absorption by potassium depletion has not been established. In contrast, preliminary studies revealed that KCC1 protein expression in the rat renal cortex was substantially enhanced in dietary potassium depletion. 3P. Sangan, S. R. Brill, S. Sangan, B. Forbush III, and H. J. Binder, unpublished observations. These present results establish that the increase in active potassium absorption induced by dietary potassium depletion is associated with an increase in KCC1 protein expression in the basolateral membranes of the distal colon. Therefore, our previous experiments (20Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sangan P. Kolla S.S. Rajendran V.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C350-C360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this present study permit the conclusion that active potassium absorption in the rat distal colon is regulated by both apical and basolateral transport proteins: H,K-ATPase at the former and KCC1 at the latter.

In Con8 mammary epithelial tumor cells, we have previously documented that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, induces the reorganization of the tight junction and adherens junction and stimulates the monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), a reliable in vitro measurement of tight junction sealing. Western blots demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment rapidly and strongly stimulated the level of the Id-1 protein, which is a serum-inducible helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor. The steroid induction of Id-1 was robust by 4 h of treatment and maintained over a 24-h period. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of exogenous Id-1 in Con8 cells was shown to strongly facilitate the dexamethasone induction of TER in the absence of serum without altering the dexamethasone-dependent reorganization of ZO-1, β-catenin, or F-actin. Ectopic overexpression of Id-1 in the SCp2 nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, which does not undergo complete dexamethasone-dependent tight junction reorganization, enhanced the dexamethasone-induced ZO-1 tight junction localization and stimulated the monolayer TER. Moreover, antisense reduction of Id-1 protein in SCp2 cells prevented the apical junction reorganization and dexamethasone-stimulated TER. Our results implicate Id-1 as acting as a critical regulator of mammary epithelial cell-cell interactions at an early step in the glucocorticoid-dependent signaling pathway that controls tight junction integrity.

These contacts are critical in forming selectively permeable epithelial sheets, which are immobile, by virtue of their being closely linked to the adjacent cell. Through a series of junctional complexes located along the lateral plasma membrane surfaces, epithelial cells are able to derive their characteristic morphology, linking tissue integrity with physiological functions such as adhesion, polarized secretion, and compartmentalized barrier (1Matter K. Balda M.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 117-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The tight junction and the adherens junction are located at the apical region of the junctional complex (1Matter K. Balda M.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 117-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The combined capabilities of both junctions help to establish and maintain cellular polarity by separating the plasma membrane into two compositionally distinct domains that are involved in spatially restricted biochemical reactions.Assembly and stability of the intercellular junction is dependent on the binding of calcium ions to the extracellular region of E-cadherin, thereby initiating homophilic interaction between cadherin molecules on neighboring cells (5Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). On the intracellular side, β-catenin or plakoglobin (γ-catenin) associates with the cytoplasmic region of E-cadherin, and binding of α-catenin to this adherens junction complex allows the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (6Ozawa M.

Subsequently, the formation of tight junctions is thought to occur through the recruitment and assembly of the highly related PDZ-containing proteins, ZO-1,1 ZO-2, and ZO-3, tethered to the integral membrane protein, occludin (1Matter K.

The importance of the adherens junction and tight junction in the acquisition and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype is well established. However, little is known about the cell signaling networks that utilize transcriptional regulators to control the formation and integrity of epithelial cell junctions.Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are important regulators of differentiation in various cell systems (16Wright W.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Kadesch T. Immunol.

Another class of helix-loop-helix proteins, the Id proteins, interferes with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (21Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Id proteins lack the basic domain responsible for DNA binding but interact with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors through their own helix-loop-helix region (22Norton J.D. Deed R.W.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1726-1730Google Scholar). Thus, Id proteins function as negative regulators of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors by forming heterodimers and blocking the binding to specific DNA sequences, E boxes, found in the regulatory regions of target genes. Four id (inhibitor of DNA binding) genes, id-1 to id-4, have been identified in mammals (21Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

However, several reports have contradicted this viewpoint by showing id gene expression present or induced in differentiated cells (36Ishiguro A. Spirin K. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Norton J.D.

Commun. 1999; 256: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic studies of Drosophila id, extramacrochaetae (emc), suggest that emcinteracts genetically with the Ras signaling pathway and is required in both cell proliferation and cell differentiation processes during wing morphogenesis (44Baonza A. Garcia-Bellido A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, emc gene expression was identified as a target of an uncharacterized signaling pathway involving the Drosophila ZO-1 protein, TAMOU, which is localized to epithelial cell junctions (45Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using mammary epithelial cells as a model system to study the hormonal control of cell-cell interactions, we have uncovered a novel role for the Id-1 protein in mediating the glucocorticoid regulation of tight junctions.Our previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids can induce the reorganization of the tight junction and adherens junction in the Con8 mammary epithelial tumor cells, leading to enhanced cell-cell adhesion and decreased paracellular permeability (46Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 47Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The induction of the differentiated phenotype coincides with a G1 cell cycle arrest (46Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the glucocorticoid induction of tight junction sealing requires functional Ras activity (48Woo P.L. Ching D. Guan Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32818-32828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and corresponds to a decrease in the actin-bundling protein, fascin (47Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Forced expression of dominant-negative Ras or the fascin protein inhibits the glucocorticoid stimulation of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cell monolayers grown on filter inserts. Here we show that Id-1 expression increased as the tight junction begins to differentiate in response to glucocorticoids and that the ectopic overexpression of Id-1 enhanced the capacity of glucocorticoid to trigger tight junction sealing. Also, in the SCp2 mammary epithelial cell line, antisense ablation of Id-1 protein expression inhibited the glucocorticoid stimulation of tight junction structure and function.DISCUSSIONRegulation of epithelial cell-cell interactions is a fundamental process that is essential for normal tissue development, yet the mechanisms that control this process are not clearly understood. We have used mammary epithelial cells as a system to study the regulation of junctional plasticity. Mammary cells are able to dynamically modulate intercellular interactions during normal mammary gland development, pregnancy, lactation, and involution. These morphological and functional changes are regulated by hormones and growth factors, some of which are known to target transcriptional modulators. Our previous studies have indicated that the lactogenic hormone, glucocorticoids, activates tight junction sealing by stimulating the formation of continuous and stable intercellular contacts between mammary epithelial cells (46Buse P.

Studies in dedifferentiated rat hepatoma cells have also shown that the glucocorticoid induction of the epithelial phenotype, characterized by tight junction formation, involves the cooperativity of the glucocorticoid receptor and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (59Spath G.F. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Given the known transcriptional mechanism of the glucocorticoid receptor, it is likely that one or more glucocorticoid-regulated genes are responsible for its effects on cell-cell interactions in mammary cells. In this study, we provide evidence that the Id-1 helix-loop-helix protein is a potential regulator of transcription that mediates the glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of tight junction sealing.Through our work, as well as the work of others, it is well established that the regulation of cell-cell interactions occurs at multiple levels and by diverse sets of signal transduction pathways (2Stevenson B.R.

We have demonstrated that the helix-loop-helix protein, Id-1, accumulates within 4 h after treatment of serum-starved Con8 mammary epithelial tumor cells with dexamethasone and that ectopic production of Id-1 facilitates the ability of glucocorticoids to induce a highly sealed tight junction. The expression of Id proteins has been shown to be stimulated by several extracellular growth factors and mitogens, including serum, and serves a general function to activate cell proliferation and apoptosis, while inhibiting differentiation in diverse cell types (22Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Israel M.A. Hernandez M.C. Florio M. Andres-Barquin P.J. Mantani A. Carter J.H. Julin C.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1726-1730Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of Id-1 in regulating tight junction dynamics, we have observed that the dexamethasone stimulation of tight junction sealing is enhanced in the presence of serum. 2P. L. Woo and G. L. Firestone, unpublished result.At a molecular level, Id proteins function as dominant-negative antagonists of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors through protein-protein interaction, mediated by the helix-loop-helix region. The formation of the inactive protein complex would presumably prevent the transcription of genes thought to negatively regulate growth (61Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or activate differentiation. We now show that Id-1 protein levels significantly rise prior to the onset of the glucocorticoid induction of tight junction formation that occurs after 24 h of dexamethasone treatment. At later time points, the glucocorticoid up-regulation of Id-1 protein over basal levels is no longer observed, in part due to a significant increase in basal Id-1 between 24 and 48 h. Given the 24-h time lag required to detect the glucocorticoid increase in TER formation (46Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 47Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the activation and coordination of early and late glucocorticoid-regulated events are necessary to induce the tight junction sealing response. Interestingly, id genes have been reported to increase during preadipocyte differentiation by 24 h and decline by 8 days of hormone treatment when maturation of adipose cells is complete (43Chen H. Weng Y.C. Schatteman G.C. Sanders L. Christy R.J. Christy B.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this system, dexamethasone has been implicated in the early induction of the id genes, prior to differentiation, which occurs over a period of 4–7 days (62Moldes M. Lasnier F. Feve B. Pairault J. Djian P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 63Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). After 24 h, when the glucocorticoid stimulation of tight junction formation was most obvious, Id-1 levels were unchanged over the high basal levels in Con8 mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that Id-1 acts early in this process and that additional regulation occurs at later time points to maintain tight junction sealing. In fact, our previous studies have shown that the down-regulation of the actin-bundling protein, fascin, is a late but essential glucocorticoid-regulated event that controls cell-cell interactions (47Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fascin protein decreases after at least 24 h of dexamethasone treatment. Therefore, we propose that the glucocorticoid-stimulation of Id-1 is an early event that would serve to ensure the proper initiation and completion of downstream events involved in the glucocorticoid induction of proper cell-cell interactions.The functional consequence of Id-1 on tight junction formation was investigated using both tumorigenic and nontumorigenic rodent mammary epithelial cell lines. We have utilized the lacoperator-repressor system to regulate the expression of the mouse Id-1 cDNA by the addition of IPTG in the Con8 rat mammary tumor cells. Clones, which expressed Id-1 in response to IPTG, exhibited an enhanced potential to establish a tight electrical seal in response to dexamethasone, directly correlating ectopic Id-1 expression to the glucocorticoid-induced transepithelial electrical resistance. However, the conditionally expressed Id-1 alone did not mimic the glucocorticoid stimulation of tight junctions, suggesting that Id-1 is not sufficient for, but supportive of, signaling to the tight junction. Moreover, the enhanced effects of Id-1 on transepithelial electrical resistance did not correlate with changes in the glucocorticoid-induced tight junction and adherens junction organization, suggesting that Id-1-regulated events target the tight junction after the glucocorticoid-stimulated junctional rearrangement in Con8 cells. ZO-1 and F-actin were reorganized to the cell periphery in response to dexamethasone, regardless of whether Id-1 was ectopically overexpressed. In addition, the glucocorticoid-induced recruitment of β-catenin from a nuclear location to the plasma membrane, in the vicinity of ZO-1, was also unaffected by inducible Id-1. Nuclear β-catenin has been associated with undifferentiated and exponentially growing cells (64Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In the case of the Con8 rat mammary tumor cells, nuclear β-catenin most likely contributes to the undifferentiated profile, since these cells were cultured in the absence of serum and under confluent conditions for over 5 days. It appears that the capacity of glucocorticoids to induce a more differentiated profile with regard to ZO-1, β-catenin, and actin cytoskeletal organization is sufficient alone, whereas Id-1 would act to maintain a higher degree of tight junction sealing, rather than directly stimulate tight junction formation.Id-1 has been previously described as an inhibitor of mammary differentiation in the SCp2 mammary epithelial cell line (19Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Stable overexpression of Id-1 prevented the hormonally regulated production of the milk protein, β-casein, whereas diminished Id-1 expression in an antisense-transfected population of cells did not affect β-casein expression. Consistent with these results, the morphology of SCp2 cells overexpressing Id-1 (SCp2-Id-S) appeared more fibroblastic than the control SCp2 cells or the Id-1 antisense cell population (SCp2-Id-A) under low density conditions. On the other hand, at confluent conditions, differences in the morphology of the SCp2-derived cell lines were less obvious. In fact, even under nonconfluent conditions, the SCp2-Id-S appeared to form tight junctions and adherens junctions, as evident by the presence of ZO-1 and β-catenin in regions where neighboring cells physically interacted. Maturation of the cell junction has been reported to affect the responsiveness of signaling pathways that control junction formation. For instance, inhibition of the Rac and Rho GTPases removes E-cadherin from keratinocyte cell-cell contacts in newly formed junctions but not in mature junctions (65Braga V.M. Del Maschio A. Machesky L. Dejana E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have also documented that the ability of TGF-β to disrupt junction organization in a nontransformed mammary epithelial cell line is dependent on the maturation status of the glucocorticoid-stimulated tight junction (52Woo P.L. Cha H.H. Singer K.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

To further explore the cellular functions of these two highly related tyrosine kinases, their subcellular distribution profiles and in vivophosphorylation activity were followed using double immunofluorescence assay. When combined with immunoprecipitation analysis, this assay showed that p94fer can lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 but not of Stat1 or Stat2. Native p94fer exerted this activity when residing in the cytoplasm. However, modified forms of p94fer, which are constitutively nuclear, could also lead to the phosphorylation of Stat3. Endogenous Stat3 and p94fer co-immunoprecipitated with each other, thus proving the interaction of these two proteinsin vivo. Unlike p94fer, p51ferT did not induce the phosphorylation of Stat3 but led to the phosphorylation of other nuclear proteins. Replacing the unique 43-amino acid-long N-terminal tail of p51ferT with a parallel segment from the N-terminal tail of p94fer did not change the subcellular localization of p51ferT but enabled it to activate Stat3. Thus the different N-terminal sequences of p94fer and p51ferT can affect their ability to induce phosphorylation of Stat3 and most probably direct their different cellular functions. p94fer and p51ferTare two tyrosine kinases that share identical SH2 and kinase domains but differ in their N-terminal regions.

Endogenous Stat3 and p94fer co-immunoprecipitated with each other, thus proving the interaction of these two proteinsin vivo. Unlike p94fer, p51ferT did not induce the phosphorylation of Stat3 but led to the phosphorylation of other nuclear proteins. Replacing the unique 43-amino acid-long N-terminal tail of p51ferT with a parallel segment from the N-terminal tail of p94fer did not change the subcellular localization of p51ferT but enabled it to activate Stat3. Thus the different N-terminal sequences of p94fer and p51ferT can affect their ability to induce phosphorylation of Stat3 and most probably direct their different cellular functions. amino acid(s) hemagglutinin nuclear localization sequence Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphotyrosine Non-receptor tyrosine kinases are localized in various subcellular compartments, where they exert specific functions. These include receptor-associated kinases that mediate signals for cell growth and differentiation (1Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y.

The Fes/FER family includes c-fes and the FER tyrosine kinases whose kinase domains are 70% homologous to the kinase domain of c-fes (11Letwin K. Yee S.-P. Pawson T.

Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar,19Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These have been implicated in directing the subcellular localization (10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar) and oligomerization (20Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) of this molecule. In p51ferT, the N-terminal 412 aa of p94fer are replaced via differential splicing, with a novel 43-aa-long N-terminal tail (17Fischman K. Edman J.C. Shackleford G.M. Turner J.A. Rutter W.J. Nir U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The FER kinases also differ in their tissue distribution profiles. Although the presence of p94fer was documented in most mammalian cell lines analyzed (11Letwin K. Yee S.-P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hao Q.-L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), except for pre-B, pre-T, and T cells (21Halachmy S. Bern O. Schreiber L. Carmel M. Sharabi Y. Shoham J. Nir U. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2871-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), p51ferT was shown to accumulate solely in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes (18Keshet E. Itin A. Fischman K. Nir U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Hazan B. Bern O. Carmel M. Lejbkowicz F. Goldstein R.S. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar). The two FER enzymes not only accumulate in different tissues, but they also exhibit different subcellular distribution patterns. p94fer is mainly cytoplasmic though it enters the nucleus upon transition of cells from G1 to the S phase (10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, p94fer associates with cell-cell adhesion molecules (23Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,24Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and its activity is induced in growth factor-stimulated cells (19Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover p94fer was shown to associate with activated epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors in fibroblasts (19Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and with the FcεRI receptor in mast cells (25Penhallow R.C. Class K. Sonoda H. Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23362-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus p94fer is linked to growth promoting processes. Unlike p94fer, the meiotic FER tyrosine kinase p51ferT has not been detected in the cytoplasm of cells that express it, and it accumulates constitutively in the cell nucleus (10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hazan B. Bern O. Carmel M. Lejbkowicz F. Goldstein R.S. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar). The functional implications of these differences between p94fer and p51ferT have not been explored. Downstream effectors of these enzymes have not been identified, and their cellular roles in somatic or meiotic cells are not well understood. To further understand the cellular role of these tyrosine kinases, and to learn whether they can phosphorylate similar repertoire of cellular substrates, a panel of FER variants was subjected to double immunofluorescence assay, in addition to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. These assays allowed the characterization of the subcellular distribution and in vivo phosphorylation activity of the FER kinases. This approach revealed that the N-terminal regions of the two FER kinases direct their different substrate specificity, and it implied that p94fer could serve as a novel activator of Stat3. The construction of the expression plasmids that were used in this study has been previously described (10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar). Native p94fer, fused to a single influenza HA epitope at its NH2-terminal tail, was expressed from the pCDNA3 fer vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. HA-p94fer devoid of a functional NLS (see Fig. 1, fer KR652/3NQ and Ref. 10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar) was also expressed from the pCDNA3 plasmid under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The HA-tagged p94fer variants, ferΔ1–299, fer1–315, ferΔ1–376, and ferΔ1–427, were expressed from the PECE vector under the control of the SV40 early promoter. HA-p51ferT was also expressed from the PECE vector (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar). COS1 and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS1 cells (5.5 × 105) were transfected with 7 μg of DNA mixed with 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100-mm dishes. CHO cells (7.5 × 105) were transfected with 5 μg of DNA mixed with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE in 100-mm dishes. During transfection the cells were grown in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two or three dishes were taken for each sample. The murine myogenic C2C12 cells (26Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15 (C2C12) or 10% (NIH3T3) fetal calf serum. Whole cell proteins were extracted in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 mmNa2VO4 and were stored on ice for 1 h. The proteins were cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The amount of protein was determined by Bradford analysis. For Western blot analysis, 25 μg of protein from each sample was resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE. Electroblotted proteins were detected using monoclonal αHA (Babco), α phosphotyrosine (PT) monoclonal antibody (PT-66, Sigma), p94fer-specific αFER/C2 antibodies (27Bern O. Hazan B. Nir U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and αStat1, αStat2, and αStat3 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Extracted proteins (750–1000 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:350 diluted 4G10 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 1:25 dilution of αStat3 monoclonal antibody, or 1:125 polyclonal αFER antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and were washed four times with HNTG buffer, which contained 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The first two washes were carried out with HNTG buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, and the third wash was done with HNTG containing 80 mm NaCl. The last wash was done with HNTG buffer lacking NaCl. Precipitated proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and were then reacted with monoclonal αHA (Babco), αFER/C2, αPT-66, or monoclonal αStat1, αStat2, and αStat3 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of p94ferand Stat3 was carried out as follows: cell lysates (0.8–1 mg of protein) were incubated with 1:125 diluted pre-serum or αFER antibody (directed against the SH2 domain of p94fer) for 4 h at 4 °C. The reactions were then transferred for overnight incubation at 15 °C to avoid nonspecific association of cellular proteins. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated as described above. COS1 (3 × 104) cells or CHO (3.5 × 103) cells were seeded in eight-well chamber slides with well areas of 1 cm2 and were then transfected with 125 ng of DNA mixed with 0.5 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent and 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE, in a total volume of 125 μl. Cells were fixed 40 h post-transfection using 4% paraformaldehyde and were subsequently treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Blocking was carried out with 6% skim milk, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Tween 20 in 100% fetal calf serum. Cells were then exposed overnight at 4 °C to the following antibodies: 1:500 diluted monoclonal αHA and 1:500 diluted polyclonal αPT (Transduction Laboratories) and 1:500 diluted αpStat3 or αpStat1 (New England BioLabs) antibodies. Reacting antibodies were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Lyssamine Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 upright confocal microscope with a krypton-argon ion laser. Confocal microscope image analysis was performed using Bio-Rad software, and figures were complied using the Laser Sharp 3.0 software package. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described before (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, spun down, and resuspended in buffer containing the following: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl Pefabloc, 0.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 0.5 μg/μl leupeptin, and 1 μg/μl benzamidine. Cells were stored for 10 min on ice to prevent swelling and were then lysed in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were spun down by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 15 s and suspended in high salt extraction buffer containing the following: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl Pefabloc, 0.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 0.5 μg/μl leupeptin, and 1 μg/μl benzamidine. Nuclear proteins were extracted by rotating the nuclei for 30 min in the extraction buffer at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, divided into aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. A double-stranded synthetic fragment that carries the Stat3 binding site (29Nelson K.L. Rogers J.A. Bowman T.L. Jove R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7072-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was labeled with [α-32P]αATP by fill in reaction using Klenow fragment and was then purified on 12% acrylamide gel (30Katcoff D.J. Yona E. Hershkovits G. Friedman H. Cohen Y. Dgany O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 10-μg nuclear protein extracts were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min with 400 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 0.1 ng of labeled probe in the following binding buffer: 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol in total volume of 25 μl. The assay mixture was then separated on 4% acrylamide Tris-borate EDTA gel at 100 V for 2–3 h. The gel was dried and exposed overnight on Kodak film (X-OMAT AR). To follow the subcellular distribution of the p94fer kinase and the tyrosine phosphorylation that it induces, we utilized double immunofluorescence staining. This assay allows one to follow the subcellular distribution and phosphorylation activity of a kinase at the single cell level, thus enabling the dissection of a mixed population of cells. A native HA-tagged p94fer protein (see Ref. 10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.1) was transiently expressed in COS1 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal αHA antibody revealed the presence of the ectopically expressed p94ferin the cytoplasm of most transfected cells (Fig.2, A and B). To test whether the subcellular localization of the enzyme parallels the distribution of its induced tyrosine phosphorylation, the transfected cells were also co-stained with αPT antibodies. A prominent αPT signal high above the background was obtained in HA-p94fer-expressing cells (Fig. 2). The induced phosphotyrosine staining was dependent on the kinase activity of p94fer, because an inactive HA-p94fer mutant (Fig. 1, ferΔ685–756) did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected cells (Fig. 2 C). The subcellular distribution profile of the phosphotyrosine staining varied, however, among different transfected cells and could be seen in two typical patterns. In the majority of the cells, both HA-p94fer and the induced phosphorylation signal were located in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 A). However, in around 30% of more than 200 αPT-positive cells, while p94fer was localized in the cytoplasm, the induced phosphorylation signal was mainly in the nucleus (Fig.2 B). We could never see clear cytoplasmic and nuclear phosphorylation signals combined in the same cell. Moreover, one could clearly see that native p94fer led to the accumulation of cytoplasmic or nuclear phosphorylation signals when the kinase was expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3,A and B). About 30% of the transfected cells did not show an obvious induced tyrosine phosphorylation signal. A similar heterogeneous subcellular distribution profile of phosphotyrosine staining was also seen in CHO cells that transiently expressed the HA-p94fer protein (data not shown).Figure 3In situ immunofluorescence staining of induced tyrosine phosphorylation in COS1 cells transiently overexpressing HA-fer mutants. Cells transiently overexpressing HA-fer-NLS (A and B), HA-ferΔ1–315 (C), or HA-ferΔ1–299 (D) were double stained with monoclonal αHA, which detects the ectopic HA-p94fermutated protein (green) and polyclonal αPT (red).

Representative photographs are shown. Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the p94fer kinase activity requires cytoplasmic localization, the cellular phosphorylation activity of three HA-tagged modified forms of p94fer were compared. These included fer KR652/3NQ, which bears a mutated NLS (see Ref.10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Mutating the monopartite NLS of p94ferexcludes the protein from the nucleus without compromising its kinase activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Another cytoplasmic variant of p94fer that was tested was ferΔ1–315, which lacks the first, and part of the second, N-terminal coiled-coil domains of the enzyme (see Ref. 10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The in situphosphorylation profiles of these cytoplasmic forms of fer were compared with the phosphorylation profile of ferΔ1–299. Deleting the first N-terminal coiled-coil domain of p94fer in ferΔ1–299 (see Ref. 10Ben-Dor I. Bern O. Tennenbaum T. Nir U. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1, ferΔ1–299) leads to its nuclear accumulation without affecting its kinase activity (Fig.3 D). The three kinases were transiently expressed in COS1 cells. Unlike the native p94fer, the accumulation of the NLS negative FER variant (KR652/3NQ) was mainly cytoplasmic, and no preferential accumulation of this protein in the nucleus of any transfected cell could be found. However, as seen with the native p94fer, transient expression of this variant led to the accumulation of cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine in some transfected cells and to nuclear accumulation of phosphotyrosine in others (Fig. 3,A and B). Transiently expressed ferΔ1–315 also accumulated in the cytoplasm. This resulted in a perinuclear accumulation of a phosphotyrosine signal in some cells (Fig.3 C). The constitutively nuclear FER variant ferΔ1–299 exhibited exclusive nuclear accumulation and induced nuclear phosphorylation signal in the transfected cells (Fig. 3 D). It therefore appears that both modified forms of p94ferexpressed in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus can elicit the accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell nucleus. This profile differs from the activity exhibited by the native p94fer, which induces phosphorylation only when residing in the cytoplasm. To further identify the cellular substrates of p94fer, whole cell proteins from HA-p94fer-transfected CHO cells were immunoprecipitated with αPT antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then probed with αPT antibodies by Western blot analysis. Several proteins were found to be highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in transfected but not in untransfected cells. The sizes of these proteins clustered between 75 and 95 kDa and between 97 and 110 kDa, respectively (Fig.4, upper panel). Similar results were obtained when HA-p94fer was transiently expressed in COS1 cells (data not shown). Based on the migration distances of the phosphorylated proteins seen in SDS-PAGE, the overlapping accumulation of pHA-94fer, and the in situ phosphotyrosine signals in the cytoplasm, one would predict the presence of phosphorylated HA-p94fer in the 97–110-kDa cluster of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands (Fig. 4, upper panel). Indeed reacting the αPT precipitates with αHA antibody in a Western blot revealed the immunoprecipitation of a phosphorylated HA-p94fer form that migrated slightly above the 97-kDa marker (Fig. 4, bottom panel, lane 1). The accumulation of nuclear phosphotyrosine signals in cells overexpressing cytoplasmatic forms of FER suggests the transduction of the phosphorylation activity of FER from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Possible downstream effectors in this process could be the signal transducers and activators of transcription, which were shown to be phosphorylated by several non-receptor tyrosine kinases (31Ihle J.N. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W. Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Stem Cells (Dayt.). 1997; 15: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). These proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and are then translocated to the cell nucleus (33Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of these proteins varies between 84 and 113 kDa (33Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar), a size range that coincides with the size of some of the phosphorylated proteins seen in Fig. 4 (upper panel). To test the possible link between p94fer and signal transducers and activators of transcription, phosphotyrosine precipitates from COS1 cells transfected with various FER variants were exposed to αStat1, αStat2, αStat3 (Fig.5, A and C), and αHA antibodies (Fig. 5 B, top panel). The phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 5 A, lane 1), but not that of Stat1 and Stat2 (Fig. 5 C), was specifically induced by the native HA-p94fer enzyme. Both cytoplasmic (ferΔ1–315 and ferKR653/3NQ) and nuclear (ferΔ1–299) modified forms of p94fer also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). The phosphorylation was dependent on the kinase activity of the fer enzymes, because an inactive mutated form of p94fer (ferΔ685–756, Fig.5 A, upper panel, lane 5) could not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. Similarly, native or nuclear forms of FER overexpressed in CHO cells were able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (data not shown). To verify the specificity of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in p94fer-overexpressing cells, Stat3 was directly immunoprecipitated utilizing αStat3 antibodies, and precipitates were reacted with αPT antibody. Stat3 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from transfected, as well as from untransfected, cells. Again both native and nuclear forms of FER (ferΔ1–299) efficiently induced the accumulation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 (Fig.6). This experiment confirmed the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in cells overexpressing a FER kinase.Figure 6The tyrosine phosphorylation level of precipitated Stat3 is increased in COS1 cells overexpressing HA-p94fer and HA-ferΔ1–299.Stat3 was immunoprecipitated from COS1 cells overexpressing HA-p94fer (lane 1), HA-ferΔ1–299 (lane 2), and from non-transfected cells (lane 3). It was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and reacted with αStat3 antibody (upper panel) or with αPT (lower panel) in a Western blot analysis. Arrows on the leftindicate the migration distances of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 (p.Stat3) and non-phosphorylated Stat3. IP, immunoprecipitations; IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After identifying Stat3 as a downstream effector of p94fer, we turned to check to what extent does the tyrosine phosphorylation signal induced by p94fer in transfected COS1 cells reflect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. COS1 cells were transiently transfected with the HA-p94ferexpression vector and were then co-stained with αHA and αpStat3 antibodies. The αpStat3 specifically detects Stat3, which became phosphorylated on Tyr-705. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 was detected in 70% of more than 200 HA-p94fer-expressing cells, which were scored (Fig. 7). This signal was prominent in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the HA-p94fer-expressing cells (Fig. 7, A andB). αpStat1 antibodies, on the other hand, gave only a faint signal, which was barely detected under the experimental conditions used in this work (Fig. 7, C and D). Thus, both cytoplasmic and nuclear phosphotyrosine signals elicited in HA-p94fer-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A andB) could reflect the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3, and Stat3 is therefore activated in most cells expressing the exogenic p94fer. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 was not detected in cells expressing the inactive p94fer mutant, ferΔ685–756 (data not shown). These experiments were repeated in HeLa cells and in the murine myogenic cell line, C2C12 (26Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), and gave similar results (data not shown). Thus, p94fer can activate Stat3 in various cell types. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 lead to their dimerization via reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. The signal transducers and activators of transcription dimers then enter the nucleus and bind specific DNA elements involved in activation of specific gene transcription (34Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). To test whether ectopic expression of an FER kinase leads to the activation of Stat3, the DNA binding activity of Stat3 was analyzed in COS1 cells expressing or non-expressing an ectopic FER ki"
https://openalex.org/W2080468303,"Triplet repeat sequence (TRS) inserts containing (CTG.CAG)(n) (17-175 units in length) were tandemly duplicated when propagated in plasmids in Escherichia coli. The products of this novel type of TRS genetic instability are tracts of as many as 34 multiple units, which contain the entire TRS as well as 129 base pairs of nonrepetitive flanking sequence. The duplication process required the presence of two or more TRS-containing units. Close proximity (170 base pairs) of the TRS to the R6K gamma origin of replication of the pUTminiTn5Cm-derived constructs stimulated the tandem duplication process. These events are proposed to occur due to secondary structure formation, stalling of DNA synthesis, and slippage-mediated misalignment of the complementary strands relative to each other during DNA replication. This mechanism may account for the TRS-associated duplications in protein kinase and metalloprotease genes in neuroblastomas and melanomas, as well as the massive repeat expansions in type II triplet repeat neurological diseases."

One way in which coexpression might be achieved is through the regulation of promoters in the cluster by neuron-selective enhancers. The β43′ enhancer is located between the β4 and α3 promoters and it directs cell type-specific expression in cell lines. It is not known, however, whether β43′ is active in neurons. Therefore, we assayed β43′ in dissociated rat sympathetic ganglia cultures, which contain nAchR-positive neurons as well as nAchR-negative non-neuronal cells. Reporters controlled by the α3 promoter and β43′ were expressed in a neuron-selective manner; greater than 90% and up to 100% of luciferase expression was detected in neurons. Neuron selectivity was maintained when β43′ was placed next to ubiquitously active viral promoters. In contrast, replacing β43′ with the SV40 enhancer eliminated neuron selectivity. The enhancer is composed of at least two separate but functionally interdependent elements, each of which interacts with a different type of ETS domain factor. These findings support a model in which β43′ controls neuronal expression of one or more genes in the cluster through interactions with a combination of ETS factors.

Selective expression is likely to occur through a combinatorial interaction of transcriptional activators and repressors with specific regulatory sequences in or near a particular gene (1He X. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 183-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A rich assortment of transcriptional activator proteins are expressed in the nervous system. However, little is known about the sequences they interact with to direct expression of their target genes to certain kinds of neurons. Elucidating these interactions is likely to provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation and development of neuronal diversity. The family of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR)1 subunit genes is an example of genes whose members are expressed in different populations of neurons. The subunits encoded by these genes are assembled into different heteromeric excitatory ligand-gated ion channels (2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). These neurotransmitter receptors mediate and modulate synaptic communication between a wide variety of central and peripheral neurons (3Wonnacott S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 4Jones S. Sudweeks S. Yakel J.L. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Three of these genes are clustered in the order β4,α3, and α5 in the vertebrate genome (5Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D. Ballivet M. Deneris E.S. McKinnon D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4472-4482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are coexpressed in sympathetic neurons, adrenal chromaffin cells, and probably in some central neuron cell types (6Mandelzys A. Pié B. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Campos-Caro A. Smillie F.I. Dominguez del Toro E. Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agullo F. Chapuli J. Juiz J.M. Sala S. Sala F. Ballesta J.J.

The three encoded subunits are likely assembled together into at least one heteromeric neurotransmitter receptor subtype (9Conroy W.G. Berg D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 9: 4424-4431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Gene targeting suggests that the α3 and β4 genes are essential for the expression of the majority of nAChRs in autonomic neurons (10Xu W. Gelber S. Orr-Urtreger A. Armstrong D. Lewis R.A. Ou C.-N.

In contrast to the well known function of these genes in the peripheral nervous system, the mechanisms that direct synthesis of their RNAs to neurons are largely unknown. Using adrenal chromaffin cell-derived PC12 cells, which express the clustered genes, we identified an enhancer positioned within the β4 3′-untranslated exon. This enhancer, β43′, is responsible for cell-type specific activity in cell lines of a 2.8-kilobase pair fragment that constitutes the immediate α3 upstream region (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Yang F. Fyodorov D. Wang F. McDonough J. Herrup K. Deneris E. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). β43′ contains consensus ETS domain transcription factor-binding sites and can be activated in co-transfection assays by the ETS factor Pet-1 (14Fyodorov D. Nelson T. Deneris E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several ETS factors are expressed in the vertebrate nervous system during development and in the adult (14Fyodorov D. Nelson T. Deneris E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10348-10356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but their function in neurons has not yet been determined. Although β43′ is active in the PC12 neuroendocrine line it is not clear whether it is active in normal neurons that express the clustered genes. To investigate this, we assayed β43′ activity in dissociated sympathetic ganglia cultures. Electroporation was used to introduce β43′-controlled luciferase reporters into these cultures and reporter expression was scored immunocytochemically with an antibody specific for luciferase protein. We also investigated whether β43′ directly interacts with ETS factors. The findings presented indicate that β43′ is a neuron-selective enhancer and is a target of ETS factors. Thus, β43′ and its interaction with ETS factors are likely to be important for neuronal expression of the cluster. Reporters for cell line transfections were prepared using pGL2 series vectors and those used for sympathetic ganglia culture transfections were prepared using pGL3 series vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). The β43′ enhancer and α3 promoter reporters used here were derived from the −2732/+47 region of the α3 gene (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For most reporters, enhancer sequences were placed upstream of either the SV40 or α3 promoters using synthetic oligonucleotides and convenient restriction sites or by polymerase chain reaction. The α3 promoter used in this article is the minimal promoter, which includes −238/+47 sequences (19Yang X. Fyodorov D. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The β43′/α3P reporter in which β43′ is upstream of the α3 promoter was made by cloning β43′ sequences 1–107 obtained from (107)α3-luc (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pGL3b. The same enhancer fragment was cloned upstream of SV40P or AdMLP. The AdMLP construct contains sequences −55/+10 of the adenovirus 2 major late promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter. To prepare the SV40E/α3P construct, an α3 promoter restriction fragment was cloned into pGL3c in place of the SV40p. Luciferase reporters containing four GAL4-binding sites upstream of the α3 promoter (4XG-α3P) or AdMLP (4XG-AdMLP) were prepared from pGL2–4XG (20Fyodorov D. Deneris E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5004-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using convenient restriction sites. β43′ reporters prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other constructs were confirmed by restriction digests. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) and plasmids for transfections were prepared using Qiagen reagents (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). At least two different plasmid preparations were used for each construct and all constructs were tested in at least three independent experiments. GAL4-VP16 effector construct was obtained from Dr. Hsing-Jien Kung. The CGS-ETS-2 expression construct, encoding ETS-2 amino acid residues 281–445, was made by subcloning anXbaI/SmaI fragment of the ETS-2 cDNA into a cytomegalovirus promoter-containing plasmid (18Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using standard methods. The PC12 and Rat 2 cell lines were maintained in culture, transfected, and assayed for reporter activity as described previously (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superior cervical and Stellate ganglia were dissected from postnatal day 1 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Zivic Miller, Portersville, PA) into HBSS (Life Technologies). Ganglia were dissociated in 5 mg/ml dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Burlington, NC), 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) (D/C) for 1 h and 15 min. The digestion was stopped by addition of excess medium. Ganglia were triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes and cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with no additives. For each transfection, approximately 3 × 105 cells (ganglia from two pups) were resuspended in a total volume of 150–180 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Celox, St. Paul, MN) and mixed with 10 μg of reporter DNA. In some cases, 10 μg of empty cloning vector (pSP64, Promega) were included as carrier, and 0.5 μg of RSV-βgal as an internal control for transfection efficiency. SG cells were transfected by electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) using a single 200 mV/960 μF pulse in chilled 0.4-cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Immediately after transfection, cells were plated in L-15 medium (Life Technologies) with 1:1:2, SVM, FVM, 2.88 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 72 mg/liter imidazole (Sigma), 5% heat inactivated rat serum (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), and 10% heat inactivated horse serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) (21Hawrot E. Patterson P.H. Meth. Enzymol. 1979; 58: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) in 24-well plates or on glass coverslips (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Plates and coverslips were coated sequentially with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml laminin (Life Technologies or Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Transfected cells were fixed for 25–30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described (22Francis N.J. Asmus S.E. Landis S.C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the following antibody dilutions: rabbit anti-luciferase (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) 1:1000, mouse anti-βIII tubulin (Sigma) 1:3000, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine beta isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC) 1:200. Coverslips were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol. Immunocytochemistry data were analyzed on a Nikon microscope. Cell counts were performed directly from immunostained coverslips. Photomicrographs were digitally processed from color slides using Adobe Photoshop. To express Pet-1 in bacteria, the Pet-1 cDNA from p73–7Z (14Fyodorov D. Nelson T. Deneris E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGEM-3Z and modified to optimize the translation start site (23Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) creating an NcoI site. Convenient restriction sites were used to clone the Pet-1 coding sequence into pQE-210 (Qiagen) that had been modified to include an HA epitope tag downstream of the hexahistidine tag, creating plasmid pHH-Pet. Pet-1 was purified on Ni+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) from XL1 Blue Escherichia coli under native conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. After elution with 250 mm imidazole, Pet-1 was dialyzed into 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Pet-1 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels and Western blotted with antisera to Pet-1. Pet-1 purified from bacteria consists of a major band at about 33 kDa, and a minor band at 21.5 kDa. The 33-kDa band was recognized on Western blots with anti-Pet-1 antiserum and both the 33- and 21.5-kDa bands were recognized by an antiserum that recognizes the conserved ETS domain (data not shown). Other minor bands from ∼40–35 kDa were also recognized by both antisera, suggesting the 33-kDa band may be a partially degraded form of Pet-1. Sequences encoding ETS-2 amino acids 281–485 (DNA-binding domain) were amplified from pBKCMV-ETS-2, containing the complete ETS-2 coding sequences, with 5′-GCTTCTAGAGGTGGGGACAGCTTCGAG and 5′-GCTCCCGGGTCACATACGAAACGGTAC. The product was digested withXbaI and SmaI and ligated intoXbaI/SmaI-digested pGEM7Z. The pGEM7Z contained the ATG start oligo with a consensus Kozak sequence (23Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-CAACCATGGCCTACCCATACGACGTGCCAGACTACGCCT cloned into theXbaI and SphI sites and a downstream stop oligo 5′-GGTGATTGATTGA cloned into the SmaI/BamHI sites. In vitro translated ETS-2 was prepared using T7 polymerase from the pGEM7Z ETS-2 plasmid and the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.). PC12 and Rat 2 nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained protease inhibitors, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin. EMSAs were performed using double stranded oligonucleotides (Life Technologies) containing different segments of the enhancer and various competitor sequences (Table II).

Oligonucleotide probes were prepared by end labeling with [32P]ATP and T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Binding reactions (20 μl, 30 min, 4 °C or room temperature) contained 100,000 cpm probe, 4–5 μg of nuclear extract, 20% glycerol, 2 μg of dI-dC in 0.5 × Tris glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Binding reactions containing transcription factor antisera were performed in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1–2 μl ETS-1/ETS-2 or Oct-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C before adding probe. Oligonucleotide competitions were performed for 10 min with the indicated fold molar excess of unlabeled double stranded sequences (Table II) at 4 °C or room temperature before addition of probe. Complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris glycine buffer at 4 °C. For EMSA with recombinant Pet-1, approximately 200 ng of Pet-1 was incubated with competitors for 20 min at room temperature in 1 × TGE, 30 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, with 10.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of dI-dC; total reaction volume was adjusted to 14 μl with water. Radiolabeled probe (0.1 pmol) was added and the reactions further incubated 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were separated on 6% acrylamide, 2% glycerol, 0.5 × TGE gels as described above and exposed 12–24 h to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Table IIOligonucleotides used for EMSARepeat 1, R1 GGCTTATACAAGGAAGTGGCATTGGAMutR1GATCATGGGAAGGCTTATACAAtacAGTGGCATTGGAGCAGAGCSpacerGGAGCAGAG GATCATGGGAAGGCTTATMutSpacerGGAGCAGAt acaCATGGGAAGGCTTATPEA3CTCGAGCAGGAAGTTCGAMutPEA3CTCGAGCAtactGTTCGATCRαCCTCTTCTTTCCAGAGGATGTGGCTTCTGCGAMutTCRαCCTCTTCTTTCCAGAtacTGTGGCTTCTGCGALower-case letters in oligonucleotides indicate substitutions of the GGA core ETS-binding sites.

DNase I footprinting was carried out with a footprinting probe that was derived from plasmid β43′FP, containing the sequence −2816/−2545 of the α3 gene cloned into theXbaI site of pGEM-7Z (18Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To label the antisense strand (GGA-containing), 10–15 μg of plasmid was cut with XbaI and NsiI. The β43′ enhancer fragment was gel purified and the XbaI site filled in with Klenow (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by G-50 spun column chromatography. Binding reactions were carried out in 50 μl of EMSA binding buffer with approximately 800 ng of recombinant Pet-1 prepared in bacteria. Radiolabeled probe (20–40,000 cpm) was added and the reactions incubated 30 min at room temperature followed by 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were brought to room temperature, and DNase I added in 50 μl of cofactor solution (12.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2) for 2 min. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of stop solution (1% SDS, 30 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA), extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitated. Reactions were separated on denaturing (8 m urea) 6% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TBE for 2.5 h at 55 watts. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 1–4 days. Methylation interference assays were carried out exactly as described (26Baldwin A.S.J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.

The activity of luciferase reporters in which β43′ is placed immediately upstream of the α3 promoter (β43′/α3P) was determined immunocytochemically in neurons and non-neuronal cells of dissociated SG cultures. About 30% of the cells in these cultures were neurons based on their immunoreactivity with antibodies to neuron-specific tubulin; the remainder consist of GFAP-immunoreactive glial cells and a small number of contaminating fibroblasts. In experiments where the β43′/α3P luciferase reporter was transfected between 93 and 100% of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons (Fig. 1, A, B, andE; Table I). To demonstrate that both neurons and non-neuronal cells were efficiently transfected, sister aliquots of cells in each experiment were transfected with a reporter driven by SV40 promoter and its own enhancer (SV40E/P). As expected for these viral elements, both neurons and non-neuronal cells expressed SV40PE/P driven luciferase (Fig. 1, C andD) so that only about 30% of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons (Fig. 1 E; Table I).Table ICumulative data for luciferase-expressing neurons and non-neuronal cells in SG culturesReporterNo. neuronsNo. non-neuronalTotalnSV40E/P4071066147316β43′/α3P728587869β43′/AdMLP201611321299β43′/SV40P96618611528rβ43′/α3P12401244rβ43′/SV40P263162794rβ43′/AdMLP202172192SV40E/α3P4995144114XG-AdMLP + GAL4-VP161662030219674XG-α3P + GAL4-VP16205164518507Counts represent the total number of neurons and non-neuronal cells that were positive for luciferase in n experiments. “r” indicates enhancer was tested in reverse orientation.

Analysis of the α3 promoter in several cell lines has suggested that it does not possess cell type-specific activity (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J.

Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show neuron-selective characteristics when assayed in primary neuronal cultures. Therefore, we wanted to assay the cell selective activity of the α3 promoter in SG cultures. The α3 promoter is only weakly active in primary cultures, as are the ubiquitously active AdMLP and the SV40 promoter, so that too few cells were positive by the immunocytochemistry assay to reliably characterize the expression pattern directed by any of these promoters on their own. Therefore, to determine the possible contribution of the minimal α3 promoter to neuron-selective reporter expression, several additional constructs were tested. First, the α3 promoter was placed in cis to the SV40 enhancer (SV40E/α3P). When SG cells were transfected with SV40E/α3P, more non-neuronal cells than neurons expressed detectable luciferase, similar to what was seen with SV40E/P, although fewer luciferase-expressing cells were detected with SV40E/α3P than with SV40E/P (Fig. 2 A; Table I). This indicates that the presence of the α3 promoter is not sufficient to direct a neuronal pattern of gene expression. A second approach to evaluate the α3 promoter was to amplify its activity using the herpes simplex virus VP16-activation domain. Four binding sites for the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain were cloned upstream of the α3 promoter or the AdMLP and these luciferase reporters were co-transfected into SG cultures with an effector construct encoding the chimeric activator GAL4-VP16. Using immunocytochemistry, we found relatively large numbers of luciferase positive cells in each experiment with either reporter when co-transfected along with the effector construct. However, the majority of these luciferase-expressing cells were non-neuronal (Fig. 2 A, Table I). We then tested the ability of β43′ to direct neuron-selective expression from heterologous promoters by placing β43′ in each orientation upstream of either SV40 promoter or AdMLP and assessing reporter activity with immunocytochemistry. In SG cultures transfected with either reporter, the majority of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons (Fig. 2 B, Table I) indicating that the neuron-selective activity of β43′ does not require the α3 promoter. The comparison between β43′/SV40P and SV40E/P is of particular interest because it demonstrates the differential cell type selectivity of the two enhancers in the context of the same promoter (Figs.1 E and 2; Table I). Thus β43′ is a neuron-selective enhancer and this property is not dependent on the presence incis of its natural promoter. β43′ was originally defined as being composed of two 37-bp direct repeats separated by a 6-bp spacer sequence (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which of these subregions are important for its activity, a series of reporters were prepared which contain different portions of the enhancer placed upstream of either the SV40 promoter or the α3 promoter (Fig. 3). Because of the relatively small number of neurons present in sympathetic ganglia we found it difficult to quantitate the activity of large numbers of reporters and to perform biochemical assays of protein/DNA interactions in these cells. Therefore, PC12 cells were chosen for these assays because: 1) each of the clustered genes are expressed in these cells whether or not they are differentiated with NGF (5Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D. Ballivet M. Deneris E.S. McKinnon D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4472-4482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) These genes are expressed in undifferentiated PC12 cells at levels that are comparable to those in sympathetic neurons (6Mandelzys A. Pié B. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3) Our previous findings showed optimal β43′ activity in undifferentiated PC12 cells relative to several other neural and non-neural lines (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, β43′ activity correlates well with expression of the cluster in cell lines. 4) We have shown that the sites of α3 transcription initiation and their relative levels of usage are virtually identical in PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons (18Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fyodorov D. Deneris E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5004-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which supports similar mechanisms of α3 transcription in these cells types. 5) Data presented in Table I and Figs. 1, and 2 indicate that the cell type specific activity of β43′ in PC12 cells is not simply an artifact of the transformed state of these cells. We found that a single copy of either isolated repeat sequence was unable to stimulate reporter activity when cloned upstream of either α3 promoter or SV40 promoter (Fig. 4,reporters 3 and 4). However, a spacer-containing fragment, which includes the spacer sequences plus a small part of each repeat (Fig. 3) retained about 40% of full enhancer activity (Fig. 4,reporter 2). This fragment was active in a cell type-specific manner as it showed no activity in Rat 2 cells, which do not express any of the clustered genes (12McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that β43′ is dependent on interactions between factors bound to the spacer region and those bound to the repeats. This conclusion is consistent with the lack of any enhancer activity in an additional reporter in which a 4-bp insertion was placed in the spacer sequence (Fig. 4, reporter 5). The insertion most likely disrupted elements in the spacer region evident in reporter 2 and obligatory interactions between essential spacer and repeat elements. These findings suggest further that the activity of the repeat element(s) depen"

Gaillard J. Lutz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In anaerobic as well as aerobic bacteria, rubredoxin acts as a cofactor in several biochemical pathways. For example, in Azotobacter vinelandiirubredoxin participates in hydrogen oxidation (2Chen J.C. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and, as recently described, it acts as an electron acceptor for pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase in Chlorobium tepidum (3Yoon K.-S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown by the sequencing of the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome (4Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar), a rubredoxin gene is encoded in the cyanobacterial genome as well. In contrast to other bacterial rubredoxins, the Synechocystisgene encodes a C-terminal extension, which was predicted to be a membrane anchor. Cryptomonads are small unicellular biflagellated algae. In addition to the nucleus, the plastid, and the mitochondrion, a fourth DNA-containing organelle, the nucleomorph, was identified (5Gibbs S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genome of the nucleomorph ranges from 520 to 660 kilobases and is arranged in three tiny chromosomes. 1Maier, U.-G., Douglas, S. E., and Cavalier-Smith, T. (2000) Protist, in press. Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the nucleomorph represents the vestigial nucleus of a former free living red algae, which was engulfed and reduced to a secondary endocytobiont.1 In the course of an international effort to sequence the nucleomorph genome of the cryptomonad Guillardia theta (7Gilson P.R. Maier U.-G. McFadden G.I. Cur. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a nucleomorph-located and therefore eukaryotically encoded rubredoxin gene was identified (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Zauner S. Fraunholz M. Wastl J. Penny S. Beaton M. Cavalier-Smith T. Maier U.-G. Douglas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we present data concerning the characterization of the encoded protein by means of immunological and biochemical methods and show the intracellular localization of rubredoxin as well as its redox properties. We present evidence that G. theta rubredoxin shows similar EPR2 spectra to those of the bacterial paralogous proteins, indicating a redox active iron atom. Measurements of its redox potential gave a value of +125 mV, which is the highest potential of all rubredoxins investigated so far. Furthermore we demonstrate that rubredoxin is plastid-located and anchored into the thylakoid membranes. Additionally, we present evidence that rubredoxin is associated with photosystem II (PSII) by co-localization of rubredoxin in BBYs and OG and DM cores. Overexpression and purification of a 70-amino acid recombinant rubredoxin was done as described previously (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To raise a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant rubredoxin, 1 mg of the purified protein was used to immunize a rabbit. Protein extracts were prepared by boiling the samples in extraction buffer containing 3% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Subsequently, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, 0.2 μm) by semidry blotting. The primary antibody was detected by a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunodetection was undertaken with the ECL system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plastids from Pisum sativum were purified by means of density gradient centrifugation according to Wastl and Maier (11Wastl J. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23194-23198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intact thylakoid membranes from P. sativum were isolated by purification of chloroplasts (12Schindler C. Hracky R. Soll J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 103-108Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and subsequent “smooth” disruption of the chloroplasts (0.1% Triton X-100) for 5 min on ice. PSII-enriched membrane fragments were prepared as described previously (13Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The protocol for the preparation of n-octyl-β-d-glycoside-solubilized PSII core particles (“OG cores”) and PSII core dimers described by Hankamer et al. (14Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was modified in that the osmoprotective agent glycine betaine (GlyB) was used throughout the preparation. The modified procedures for OG cores are described in Dörner et al. (15Dörner W. Dittmer J. Iuzzolino L. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1343-1346Google Scholar). For PSII core dimers 1 m GlyB was present in the resuspension and solubilization buffer (1 m GlyB, 25 mm MES, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 6.0), whereas the sucrose gradient solution contained 2 m GlyB (2 m GlyB, 25 mmMES, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 6.0, and 0–10% sucrose) (16Catucci L. Dörner W. Nield J. Hankamer B. Vass I. Barber J. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 973-976Google Scholar). PSII dimer samples were concentrated by means of a Microsep membrane concentrator (100-kDa cutoff, Pall Filtron). Cells from G. theta and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as well as thylakoid preparations were embedded in Lowicryl K4M (Chemische Werke Lowi) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After ultrathin cutting, the sections were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant G. theta rubredoxin. Gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection of the primary antibodies as described in Fraunholz et al. (17Fraunholz M.J. Mörschel E. Maier U.-G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transport-competent plastids were isolated by means of differential density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (11Wastl J. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23194-23198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation of the constructs were performed using the coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation system (TNT system, Promega). Translation of the template was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Posttranslational import of labeled precursor proteins into P. sativum plastids took place in 100-μl assays containing plastids (equivalent to 15 μg of chlorophyll) in import buffer containing 2 mm ATP, 20 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm methionine, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 2% bovine serum albumin. After addition of labeled in vitro translation product, the import mixture was incubated 30 min at 25 °C with pea plastids. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation of the chloroplasts for 1 min at 1000 × g. After washing in import buffer, chloroplasts were resuspended in 100 μl of import buffer and subjected to thermolysin treatment (0.1% (w/v) thermolysin, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a 1 mm CaCl2 final concentration for 10 min on ice to digest external protein of the import mixture. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm; this was followed by centrifugation through a 40% percoll cushion (4500 × g, 5 min) to recover intact plastids. After washing and centrifuging the plastids, harvested chloroplasts were resuspended immediately in sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. EPR spectra at X-band (9 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker EMX-6/1 EPR spectrometer composed of the EMX 1/3 console, ER 041 X6 bridge with built-in ER-0410–1161 microwave frequency counter, ER-070 magnet, and ER-4/02 st standard universal TE102 rectangular cavity. All spectra were recorded with a field modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Cooling of the sample was performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 cryostat with a ITC4 temperature controller. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a nitric acid-modified glassy carbon electrode using the setup described by Hagen (18Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To remove O2, the assembled cell was flushed with argon. A 12-μl sample of approximately 100 μmprotein in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, was inserted through a septum and placed so that it formed a drop between the working, reference, and counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammograms of rubredoxin were recorded at scan rates of 10–100 mV/s using a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT-10 potentiostat. Midpoint potentials were determined from the anodic and cathodic peak potentials. As recently published, we have isolated a gene encoding rubredoxin from the cryptomonad G. theta. It is localized on chromosome II of the remnant nucleus of the secondary endosymbiont, the nucleomorph (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Zauner S. Fraunholz M. Wastl J. Penny S. Beaton M. Cavalier-Smith T. Maier U.-G. Douglas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the conserved positions rubredoxin (nmRub) has high identity to prokaryotic paralogous molecules (Fig.1), which were identified in several anaerobic and aerobic eubacteria (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterium Synechocystis harbors a rubredoxin gene that encodes a hypothetical protein with an additional C-terminal extension (Fig. 1). This extension was predicted to be a membrane anchor. A similar C-terminal membrane anchor was also identified in the cryptomonad rubredoxin protein as well as in an Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag clone (Swiss-Prot accession numberAAD25628). Unique to the eukaryotically encoded rubredoxins in G. theta and Arabidopsis is an N-terminal extension (Fig. 1), which resembled a transit peptide. Nevertheless, data base searches failed to predict the N-terminal extension of the G. theta rubredoxin as a transit peptide. Because the N-terminal extension of the nmRub is not predicted to be a transit peptide, we undertook in vitro import assays into isolated plastids. As shown in Fig. 2, rubredoxin precursors can be imported into chloroplasts from P. sativum. This is demonstrated by the finding that the in vitro translation product, when incubated with chloroplasts, was processed to the mature protein, which was thermolysin-resistant as long as the chloroplasts were intact but was digested if thermolysin and Triton X-100 were added to the reaction mixture. Therefore, the N-terminal extension of the nucleomorph-encoded rubredoxin represents a transit peptide, and nmRub has a plastid destination at least in in vitro experiments. In addition to the import studies presented above, further experiments to localize rubredoxin were done. We used a recombinant and purified cryptomonad rubredoxin protein (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. In Western blot experiments with these antibodies a single band of approximately 11 kDa could be identified in G. theta protein extract, which corresponded to the size of mature rubredoxin (Fig.3). By the use of this antibody, a band of identical molecular mass was also detectable in Synechocystis and Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly, in protein extracts from Chilomonas paramecium, a heterotrophic cryptomonad alga with a photosynthetic inactive leucoplast, the polyclonal antiserum did not detect any protein (data not shown). To localize the protein within the algal cell, electron microscopical immunolocalization experiments were undertaken. Cells were embedded in ultrathinly cut Lowicryl, and the localization of rubredoxin was visualized by means of the immunogold technique. A specific label at the internal membrane system, the thylakoids, was detected in G. theta as well as in Synechocystis (Fig. 4,A and B). A similar result was obtained in immunogold experiments with isolated pea thylakoids. As shown in Fig. 4 C, both stroma and grana thylakoids were labeled. Counting the labels of both types of thylakoids separately, 80% of the gold particles were associated with the grana thylakoids, and 20% had a stroma thylakoid localization. This observed grana to stroma ratio of nmRub corresponded to the distribution of PS II complexes in the thylakoid membrane system of chloroplasts (19Staehelin L.A. DeWit M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whole cells, isolated plastids, and thylakoids were used to specify the orientation of rubredoxin within the thylakoid system. For these experiments the extracts were incubated with and without thermolysin and Triton X-100, and the presence of rubredoxin was analyzed by Western blotting and immunodetection. Our data suggest that rubredoxin is an integral thylakoid protein whose soluble domain is exposed to the stroma (data not shown). The localization of rubredoxin in thylakoids, as well as the fact that rubredoxin has a similar distribution to that of photosystem II complexes, suggested a co-localization of rubredoxin with PS II. To test if rubredoxin is attached to the photosynthesis machinery or is a part of it, we isolated PS II-enriched complexes from spinach thylakoids. One fraction consisted of the so-called BBYs, which are enriched in photosystem II but nearly free of photosystem I components (20Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Depletion of light-harvesting complex II from the BBYs using detergents led to OG cores (21Ghanotakis D.F. Demetriou D.M. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 15-21Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and light-harvesting complex II-free DM cores. The latter resembled the purified PSII core complex (14Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These particles still showed O2-evolving activity (data not shown). In Western blots the anti-rubredoxin antibody specifically detected a protein with identical molecular mass as nmRub in BBYs and OG and DM cores, indicating that rubredoxin is associated with the photosystem II machinery (Fig.5). In previous studies we could show that nmRub is an iron-containing protein (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, neither by UV-visible spectroscopy nor by 1D NMR analysis was it possible to determine the coordination state of the iron cofactor of nmRub. Therefore we determined the state of the iron cofactor in the oxidized recombinant cryptomonad rubredoxin by EPR. As shown in Fig.6, the cryptomonad protein had peaks at g = 9.6 and g = 4.3, identical to those of Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin. Thus, the four cysteines of nmRub probably coordinate an iron atom tetrahedrally and therefore in the same manner as prokaryotic rubredoxins (e.g. Ref. 22Eidsness M.K. Burden A.E. Richie K.A. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Scott R.A. Smith E.T. Ichiye T. Beard B. Min T. Kang C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14803-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The presented immunological data (see “Detection and Localization of Rubredoxin by Use of an Antiserum”) supposed a co-localization of rubredoxin with PSII. Previous EPR studies on enriched PS II complexes revealed an additional characteristic iron peak at g = 4.3, which has been explained as iron contamination (23Miller A.-F. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that this signal, or part of it, is due to the rubredoxin. The shape of the signal having a g value of 4.3 is predominantly rhombic. This might be because of the association of the rubredoxin to the membranes. Saturation studies (data not shown) of the signals with g values of 4.3 in the nmRub preparation and the enriched PS II preparation show very similar behavior, and for example at 4.6 K the signals start to saturate at around 2 milliwatts. In comparison the signals with a g value of 4.3 of adventitiously bound iron in bovine serum albumin or lysozyme preparations start to saturate at around 0.2 milliwatts and 20 microwatts, respectively. Adventitiously bound iron is expected to be coordinated by less than four ligands, which are probably oxygen or nitrogen, and will behave differently in saturation and temperature studies than iron coordinated by four cysteine ligands. More evidence is required, however, and EPR-monitored redox titration should be able to prove whether this signal with a g value of 4.3 in the enriched PSII preparation is due to rubredoxin. To characterize the electrophysiological properties of the cryptomonad rubredoxin, we determined its redox potential under the same conditions as in Eidsness et al.(22Eidsness M.K. Burden A.E. Richie K.A. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Scott R.A. Smith E.T. Ichiye T. Beard B. Min T. Kang C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14803-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant rubredoxin (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used to measure the redox potential. The midpoint reduction potential of recombinant G. theta rubredoxin was determined as +125 mV. In comparison to all other known rubredoxins, which yield redox potentials of approximately −50 mV to +50 mV, the cryptomonad rubredoxin revealed the highest redox potential known so far. Interestingly, the redox potential of the cryptomonad rubredoxin is similar to those of the cytochrome b6/f complex and plastoquinone. Rubredoxin is a small non-heme iron protein known from anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The identification of the first eukaryotically encoded rubredoxin gene in the nucleomorph of cryptomonads (9Zauner S. Fraunholz M. Wastl J. Penny S. Beaton M. Cavalier-Smith T. Maier U.-G. Douglas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) raised the question whether this polypeptide is similar in function to the bacterial ones. Analysis of the primary structure revealed an N- and C-terminal extensions of the cryptomonad protein in comparison to prokaryotically encoded rubredoxins. The N-terminal extension was shown to be a transit peptide in the homologous system (11Wastl J. Maier U.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23194-23198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a heterologous system (this study), and this extension directs the protein to G. theta plastids. According to our results the C-terminal domain acts as a membrane anchor. This membrane anchor is a characteristic feature of all other known rubredoxin genes in all known photosynthetic organisms, supporting a conserved linkage of rubredoxin to a plastid membrane. Because only a limited set of data exists concerning the existence of rubredoxin in other organisms, we used a polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant G. theta rubredoxin to determine whether rubredoxin is common in higher plants. As shown in Fig. 3, a cross-reacting band with a molecular mass identical to that of mature rubredoxin was present in cyanobacteria, cryptomonads, and higher plants, whereas it was missing in a non-photosynthetic cryptomonad. Thus, this is the first evidence that rubredoxin is common to photosynthetically active eukaryotes and cyanobacteria. By the use of an anti-rubredoxin antibody and an immunogold-labeled secondary antibody as well as Western experiments, we demonstrated that rubredoxin is integrated into the thylakoid membranes and exposed to the stroma. In Synechocystis, rubredoxin is located in an operon together with components of PSII. This fact, together with our electron microscopical immunolocalizations, which show that rubredoxin is mainly located in grana thylakoids, suggested that rubredoxin is attached to PSII. To test this we prepared thylakoid membranes from Spinacia oleracea and from these enriched PSII preparations. Whereas the BBYs contain PSII together with the light-harvesting complexes, plastoquinone, and partial cytochrome b6/f complexes, the DM core complexes are membrane-free and resemble pure PSII complexes without the light-harvesting complexes, cytochrome b6/f complex, or plastoquinone. In these preparations the anti-nmRub antibody detected a protein with the molecular mass of rubredoxin, strongly indicating that the iron protein is connected to PSII. Interestingly, in PSII-enriched membrane particles an EPR signal characterized by a g value around 4 is always observed. Previously, this EPR signal was thought to result from adventitious iron contamination (23Miller A.-F. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, we detected a narrow EPR signal exactly at the rubredoxin g value of 4.3 in repeatedly washed PSII membrane particles (not shown) as well as in the even more purified PSII core complexes (Fig. 6). Thus the observed EPR signal with a g value of 4.3 is not an iron artifact but is probably related to rubredoxin, which is closely associated with PSII. These facts raised a question concerning the function of rubredoxin in PSII. Ycf48, formerly known as Hcf136, is essential for the assembly of the PSII components in the thylakoid membrane (24Meurer J. Plucken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, PsbE is essential in the process of PSII assembly, as shown by Morais et al. (25Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) for a psbE null mutant from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Both proteins are involved in the assembly process but could not be detected in mature PSII complexes. Our immunological data showed that rubredoxin is associated with mature PSII in stroma and grana thylakoids. Thus rubredoxin seems not to be involved, at least in the early steps of PSII assembly. The characterization of the central iron ligation domain is essential for the understanding of the function of rubredoxins in photosynthetic organisms. An alignment of different rubredoxins suggested the chelation of an iron molecule by four highly conserved cysteines (8Wastl J. Sticht H. Maier U.-G. Rösch P. Hoffmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This iron is responsible for the ability of rubredoxins to take part in redox reactions, as it was shown e.g. for A. vinelandii rubredoxin (2Chen J.C. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). EPR spectroscopy of recombinant nmRub gave the same g values as those observed for other rubredoxins, indicating that nmRub contains high spin Fe3+ in almost tetrahedral coordination. Because rubredoxin acts as an electron carrier, knowledge of its redox potential is important. We showed that its redox potential was +125 mV and therefore the highest redox potential of all rubredoxins known so far. This redox value, which is similar to those of the cytochrome b6/f complex and plastoquinone, implies that rubredoxin is able to branch electrons from, or replace components of, PSII. According to Eidsness et al. (22Eidsness M.K. Burden A.E. Richie K.A. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Scott R.A. Smith E.T. Ichiye T. Beard B. Min T. Kang C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14803-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Xiao et al. (26Xiao Z. Maher M.J. Cross M. Bond C.S. Guss J.M. Wedd A.G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), all rubredoxins can be divided into two groups with respect to their redox potentials. The reason for this is a crucial amino acid at a conserved position (amino acid residue 44, referring to C. pasteurianum rubredoxin). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that changes from valine to the more polar alanine (and vice versa) correlate with the change of midpoint redox potential (22Eidsness M.K. Burden A.E. Richie K.A. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Scott R.A. Smith E.T. Ichiye T. Beard B. Min T. Kang C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14803-14809Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Exclusively, the G. theta rubredoxin sequence has a serine at this position. Further structural characterization of the recombinant G. theta rubredoxin by NMR showed the closeness of the neighborhood of the serine to the four iron-ligating cysteines. 3Schweimer, K., Hoffmann, S., Wastl, J., Maier, U.-G., Rösch, P., and Sticht, H. (2000) Protein Sci., in press. Therefore it is likely that the presence of serine (which is even more polar than alanine) in this position is responsible for the high midpoint potential of nmRub. Similar effects have been observed in the case of 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins (6Kyritsis P. Hatzfeld O.M. Link T.A. Moulis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15404-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that rubredoxin found in organisms with oxygenic photosynthesis is a plastid-located protein integrated into the thylakoid membranes and exposed to the stroma. Immunogold localizations gave hints that rubredoxin is associated with photosystem II, which was confirmed by co-localizations of rubredoxin with purified PSII core complexes. The typical arrangement of the central iron atom and the determined redox potential of +125 mV led to the conclusion that rubredoxin could act as an electron transfer molecule branching electrons from PSII to plastid membrane-located pathways (e.g. xantophyll cycle and fatty acid biosynthesis) or could replace the cytochrome b6/fcomplex or plastoquinone of the photosynthesis machinery under some circumstances.

https://openalex.org/W4244645165,"We examined the effect of urokinase (uPA) and its fragments on vascular smooth muscle cell contraction. Single-chain uPA inhibits phenylepherine (PE) -induced contraction of rat aortic rings, whereas two-chain uPA exerts the opposite effect. Two independent epitopes mediating these opposing activities were identified. A6, a capped peptide corresponding to amino acids 136-143 (KPSSPPEE) of uPA, increased the EC(50) of PE-induced vascular contraction sevenfold by inhibiting the release of calcium from intracellular stores. A6 activity was abolished by deleting the carboxyl-terminal Glu or by mutating the Ser corresponding to position 138 in uPA to Glu. A single-chain uPA variant lacking amino acids 136-143 did not induce vasorelaxation. A second epitope within the kringle of uPA potentiated PE-induced vasoconstriction. This epitope was exposed when single-chain uPA was converted to a two-chain molecule by plasmin. The isolated uPA kringle augmented vasoconstriction, whereas uPA variant lacking the kringle had no procontractile activity. These studies reveal previously undescribed vasoactive domains within urokinase and its naturally derived fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2088567451,"RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for G protein α-subunits. This GAP activity is mediated by the interaction of conserved residues on regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins and Gα-subunits. We mutated the important contact sites Glu-89, Asn-90, and Asn-130 in RGS16 to lysine, aspartate, and alanine, respectively. The interaction of RGS16 and its mutants with Gαt and Gαi1 was studied. The GAP activities of RGS16N90D and RGS16N130A were strongly attenuated. RGS16E89K increased GTP hydrolysis of Gαi1 by a similar extent, but with an about 100-fold reduced affinity compared with non-mutated RGS16. As Glu-89 in RGS16 is interacting with Lys-210 in Gαi1, this lysine was changed to glutamate for compensation. Gαi1K210E was insensitive to RGS16 but interacted with RGS16E89K. In rat uterine smooth muscle cells, wild type RGS16 abolished Gi-mediated α2-adrenoreceptor signaling, whereas RGS16E89K was without effect. Both Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E mimicked the effect of α2-adrenoreceptor stimulation. Gαi1K210E was sensitive to RGS16E89K and 10-fold more potent than Gαi1. Analogous mutants of Gαq(GαqK215E) and RGS4 (RGS4E87K) were created and studied in COS-7 cells. The activity of wild type Gαq was counteracted by wild type RGS4 but not by RGS4E87K. The activity of GαqK215E was inhibited by RGS4E87K, whereas non-mutated RGS4 was ineffective. We conclude that mutation of a conserved lysine residue to glutamate in Gαi and Gαq family members renders these proteins insensitive to wild type RGS proteins. Nevertheless, they are sensitive to glutamate to lysine mutants of RGS proteins. Such mutant pairs will be helpful tools in analyzing Gα-RGS specificities in living cells.

Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 177-198PubMed Google Scholar). To elicit an appropriate cellular response the strength and duration of intracellular signals must be tightly regulated. The duration of G protein activation itself is controlled by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα-subunits. GTP hydrolysis converts the active GTP-bound Gα-subunit to the inactive GDP-bound form, which then reassembles with the Gβγ dimer, and thus terminates signaling. Recently, a novel superfamily of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Gα-subunits, termed “regulators of G protein signaling” (RGS) proteins, with at least 21 different mammalian members, has been discovered (for review see Refs. 4Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 6Wieland T. Chen C.K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Besides their obvious role in regulation of signal strength and duration, RGS proteins have been shown to be involved in desensitization processes. In in vitro reconstitution experiments, a variety of RGS proteins exerts GAP activity for members of the Gαi and Gαq subfamilies with a limited degree of specificity (for review see Ref. 6Wieland T. Chen C.K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the molecular level, this lack of specificity is not very surprising. When the structure of the RGS4-Gαi1complex was solved by crystallization and x-ray diffraction (7Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), it became evident that interaction of these molecules involved the Gαi1 amino acids Thr-182, Gln-204, Glu-207, Lys-210, and RGS4 amino acids Glu-87, Asn-88, and Asn-128. These important contact sites are highly conserved in many of the RGS proteins and all members of the Gαi and Gαq subfamilies. Nonetheless, there appears to be specificity with regard to G protein and receptor so that certain RGS proteins are part of particular signaling circuits (8Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To explore such specificities in cells, it would be helpful to have mutants of RGS proteins available that do not interact with wild type Gα-subunits but are still able to interact with a specific mutant of the Gα-subunits. We report herein that mutation of the RGS16 amino acids Asn-90 and Asn-130 to aspartate and alanine, respectively, causes a large reduction of GAP activity for the Gαi subfamily members Gαt and Gαi1. Mutation of Glu-89 to lysine, reduces only the potency of RGS16 about 100-fold. In addition, mutation of Lys-210 in Gαi1 to glutamate renders this Gα-subunit insensitive to wild type RGS16, whereas this mutant is fully responsive to the mutant RGS16E89K with regard to maximal GAP activity. By generating analogous mutations in Gαq and RGS4, we could demonstrate that functionally active mutant pairs can be generated from several members of RGS proteins and Gα-subunits. They can be studied in living cells, where they interact with each other but not with their wild type counterparts. Female Wistar rats were obtained from a colony bred and maintained at the animal house of the University Hospital Eppendorf. Myometria were dissected from the rats after anesthesia with halothane followed by cervical dislocation. All experimental procedures were carried out according to the animal welfare guidelines of the University Hospital Eppendorf. Mutations of mouse RGS16 cDNA were performed by polymerase chain reaction using pET15B-His6-RGS16 (9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutants were subcloned into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET15B (Novagen). Gαi1 mutant proteins were generated from the cDNA coding for internally His6-tagged rat Gαi1(10Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Mutations of mouse GαqR183C and of human RGS4 were performed using QuikChange (Stratagene) with pCis-GαqR183C and pCR3-RGS4 as template, respectively, and specific mutagenic primers (GαqR183C/K215E, primer 1, TCAGAGAGAAGAGAATGGATACACTGC, primer 2, GCAGTGTATCCATTCTCTTCTCTCTGA; RGS4E87K, primer 1, GAATATAGTGAGAAGAATATTGACTTCTGG, primer 2, CCAGAAGTCAATATTCTTCTCACTATATTC). The sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing. His6-RGS16, His6-Gαi1, and their mutants were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified in a single step on a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) as described before (9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Gαi1 and RGS16 proteins were stored at −80 °C in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0, respectively. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with IgG as standard. The activity of Gαi1 was determined by binding of the metabolically stable GTP analog GTPγS (13Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 238-2444Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Transducin (Gt) was eluted from the membranes by hypotonic elution in the presence of 100 μm GTP, and the subunits were separated by affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose (Bio-Rad) (15Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared as described (16Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Hall A. Aktories K. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The multiple turnover GTPase and single turnover GTPase of Gt were determined as described before (9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(18Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Briefly, GαI-subunits (250 nm) were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm, 0.2 μCi) in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 50 mmtriethanolamine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 30 °C and then cooled for 5 min at 0 °C. GTP hydrolysis was initiated by addition of the GTP-loaded Gα-subunits to 10 μl of a mixture containing MgCl2 (15 mm final concentration), if indicated, RGS proteins, and an excess of unlabeled GTP (150 μm final concentration) to prevent reloading of Gα-subunits with [γ-32P]GTP. If not otherwise indicated, the reaction was conducted for 1 min at 0 °C and then stopped by addition of 750 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) charcoal in 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.0. Released32Pi was quantified as described before (17Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The 32Pi release observed in the absence of MgCl2 was regarded as unspecific. As recombinant Gαi1 and its mutants contain an internal His6 tag (10Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), their ability to form G protein heterotrimers was assayed by trapping purified transducin βγ dimers (Gβγt) to a Ni2+-NTA matrix. Briefly, 2.5 μmGβγt was incubated without and with 2.5 μm Gαi1 or Gαi1K210E in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 μm GDP for 10 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA superflow beads were added and incubated for another 10 min at 30 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of the above described buffer including 25 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by addition of 20 μl of sample buffer and boiling (5 min, 95 °C). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel). Rat myometrial smooth muscle cells were isolated from the uterus as described before (19Zhou X.-B. Wang G.-X. Hüneke B. Wieland T. Korth M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 339-352Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). BKCa activity was recorded using the whole-cell patch configuration. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed into the cells via the patch pipette. All experimental procedures were performed essentially as reported before (19Zhou X.-B. Wang G.-X. Hüneke B. Wieland T. Korth M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 339-352Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in 12-well tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection. The amount of DNA used for transfection with pCis-GαqR183C and pCis-GαqR183C/K215E was 0.2 μg, for pCR3-RGS4 and pCR3-RGS4E87K 0.8 μg. A plasmid expressing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCis-LacZ) was cotransfected to keep the total amount of DNA in each transfection constant at 1 μg; 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the DNA along with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to each well. Twelve hours later, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were labeled with 10 μCi ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products) per ml in 0.5 ml of inositol-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Forty eight hours post-transfection, the levels of [3H]inositol phosphate were determined as described (20Wu D. Lee C.-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For detection of recombinant protein expression, cells were kept for the same time in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after replacing the transfection medium and then harvested in sample buffer (21Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel) and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Gαq/11 proteins were visualized with an anti-Gαq/11 antiserum raised against a C-terminal epitope (Calbiochem) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The crystal structure of the Gαi1-RGS4 complex (7Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) indicated that side chains of several amino acids are required for the interaction of RGS proteins with Gα-subunits of the Gαi and Gαqsubfamily members. We therefore mutated three amino acids corresponding to these important contact sites (Fig.1), Glu-89, Asn-90, and Asn-130 in RGS16 to lysine, aspartate, and alanine, respectively. Wild type RGS16 and the mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified as described before (9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ability of recombinant RGS16 mutants to act as GAP was studied in the multiple turnover GTPase assay for Gαt that was originally used to characterize RGS16 GAP activity (9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A maximal effective concentration of RGS16 (1 μm) increased GTP hydrolysis by Gαt7–8-fold (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the GAP activity of RGS16N130A (1 μm) was reduced by 90–95%. RGS16E89K and RGS16N90D did not exhibit any significant GAP activity. Single turnover GTPase of Gαt, however, revealed a different pattern (Fig. 2 B). When measured for 15 s at 0 °C, RGS16 (100 nm) stimulated GTP hydrolysis by about 7-fold. RGS16E89K (2 μm each) increased Pi release by about 5-fold, whereas RGS16N130A and RGS16N90D (2 μM each) displayed also in this assay a largely reduced (about 90%) GAP activity, which reached statistical significance in the case of RGS16N130A.Figure 2GAP activities of RGS16, RGS16E89K, RGS16N90D, and RGS16N130A for Gαt. Multiple turnover (A) and single turnover (B) GTPase of Gαt was measured for 10 min at 30 °C and 15 s at 0 °C, respectively, in the absence (Con) and presence of RGS16 (WT, 1 μm in A, 100 nm in B), RGS16N90D (N90D, 1 μm inA, 2 μm in B), RGS16E89K (E89K, 1 μm in A, 2 μm inB), and RGS16N130A (N130A, 1 μm inA, 2 μm in B).

When measured for 1 min at 0 °C, basal Pi release of 250 nmGαi1 was about 1 pmol. RGS16 increased GTP hydrolysis about 3-fold (Fig. 3). The half-maximal and maximal increase in Pi release was observed at 20 and 100 nm RGS16, respectively. In contrast, RGS16N130A exhibited only marginal GAP activity for Gαi1 (Fig.3). The maximal increase (about 1.5-fold, p < 0.05) was observed at 3–10 μm RGS16N130A. Similarly, when compared at a concentration of 1 μm, the GAP activities of RGS16E89K and RGS16N90D were largely reduced or abolished (Fig.4). The crystallographic data on the Gαi1-RGS4 interaction surface (7Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) indicated that Glu-89 of RGS16 most likely interacts with Lys-210 of Gαi1. Asn-90 interacts with Thr-182 in Gαi1 and Thr-182 in this conformation with Gln-207 in Gαi1. Thus, it could be possible to introduce compensating mutations into Gαi1that restore the interaction with Lys-89 and Asp-90 in these RGS16 mutants. Therefore, we expressed and purified the mutants Gαi1E207Q and Gαi1K210E. Both mutants exhibited a similar basal rate of single turnover GTPase (see Fig. 4) and binding of the GTP analog GTPγS (data not shown). The GAP activities of RGS16 and its mutants (1 μm) for Gαi1E207Q were similar to those for unmutated Gαi1 (Fig. 4). RGS16 increased Pi release from Gαi1E207Q about 2.8-fold, whereas GAP activities of RGS16E89K and RGS16N90D were not evident on this Gαi1 mutant. In contrast, Gαi1K210E displayed sensitivity toward RGS16 mutants but not the wild type protein. RGS16E89K (1 μm) increased GTP hydrolysis by Gαi1K210E about 2-fold. A weak GAP activity (1.4-fold increase in Pi release) was observed for RGS16N90D. The interaction of RGS16 and RGS16E89K with Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E was studied in more detail. In contrast to RGS16N130A (see Fig. 3), the efficacy of RGS16E89K toward Gαi1 was not altered (Fig.5 A). RGS16E89K increased Pi release by Gαi1 about 3-fold, however, with a largely reduced potency. Half-maximal GAP activity of RGS16E89K was observed at about 2 μm. Wild type RGS16 did not display any GAP activity for Gαi1K210E even when used at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 5 B). RGS16E89K showed similar GAP activity for Gαi1K210E as for wild type Gαi1; however, its potency was reduced compared with the RGS16-Gαi1 interaction. Half-maximal increase was observed at about 1 μm. Similarly effective concentrations of RGS16 (0.1 μm) and RGS16E89K (10 μm) were used to determine the extent of GTP hydrolysis acceleration (Fig. 6). The calculated rate constants for the basal GTPase activity were 7.9 ± 0.2 × 10−3 s−1 and 4.6 ± 0.3 × 10−3s−1 for Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E, respectively. In the presence of RGS16 and RGS16E89K, the rate constant for Gαi1 increased to 94.5 ± 1.1 × 10−3s−1 and 16.2 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. The rate constant for Gαi1K210E increased to 42.7 ± 0.4 × 10−3s−1 in the presence of RGS16E89K, indicating that under the experimental conditions used, maximal acceleration of GTP hydrolysis is similar (about 10-fold) for the interaction of Gαi1 with RGS16 and of Gαi1K210E with RGS16E89K, respectively.Figure 4GAP activities of RGS16, RGS16E89K, and RGS16N90D for Gαi1, Gαi1E207Q, and Gαi1K210E.

First, we generated the double mutant pair RGS16E89K/N90D and Gαi1E207Q/K210E. Second, as Gαi1K210E apparently has a rather acidic surface consisting of Glu-207 and Glu-210, a more basic counterpart was created with the double mutant RGS16E89K/N90K. Finally, as in this mutant the side chain of Lys-90 has two more carbon atoms than that of the original asparagine, and the side chain of Glu-207 was shortened in the double mutant Gαi1E207D/K210E for compensation. All the Gαi1 double mutants exhibited an unaltered rate of basal GTP hydrolysis and GTPγS binding (data not shown). They failed, however, to be stimulated in their rate of GTP hydrolysis by RGS16 or any of its mutants. Also the double mutants of RGS16 did not increase the GTPase activity of Gαi1, Gαi1E207Q, or Gαi1K210E (TableI).Table IMaximal GAP activities of RGS16 and its mutants for Gα i1 and its mutantsGαi1Gαi1E207QGαi1K210EGαi1E207Q/K210EGαi1E207D/K210ERGS163.17 ± 0.341-ap < 0.001versus basal activity.2.20 ± 0.551-bp < 0.05 versusbasal activity.1.10 ± 0.090.97 ± 0.101.14 ± 0.20RGS16E89K2.86 ± 0.881-ap < 0.001versus basal activity.1.10 ± 0.103.04 ± 0.231-ap < 0.001versus basal activity.0.78 ± 0.131.00 ± 0.20RGS16N90D1.05 ± 0.051.07 ± 0.061.43 ± 0.200.86 ± 0.041.21 ± 0.21RGS16E89K/N90D0.96 ± 0.131.08 ± 0.201.00 ± 0.400.85 ± 0.091.09 ± 0.19RGS16E89K/N90K1.1 ± 0.091.32 ± 0.321.13 ± 0.211.09 ± 0.201.05 ± 0.04Single turnover GTPase of Gαi1, Gαi1E207Q, Gαi1K210E, Gαi1E207Q/K210E, and Gαi1E207D/K210E (250 nm each) was measured for 1 min at 0 °C in the absence and presence of RGS16 (1 μm), RGS16N90D, RGS16E89K, RGS16E89K/N90D, and RGS16E89K/N90K (10 μm each).

Basal GTP hydrolysis for all Gαi1proteins was about 1 pmol. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance. If RGS16E89K and Gαi1K210E bare the potential to serve as tools in analyzing Gα-RGS protein interaction, the differences between the mutants and their wild type counterparts observed in the in vitro GAP assay have to cause distinguishable differences in the modulation of signaling pathways by the mutants and wild type proteins on the background of a living cell. To test this hypothesis we chose the model of the BKCa channel regulation via the adenylyl cyclase (AC)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in uterine smooth muscles cells. As shown before (19Zhou X.-B. Wang G.-X. Hüneke B. Wieland T. Korth M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 339-352Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), under the experimental conditions chosen, the BKCa channel activity is a very sensitive probe to follow AC-PKA activation and even more important, defined concentrations of purified proteins can be dialyzed into the cell via the patch pipette. Therefore, this method allows us to study the influence of these proteins on regulatory components of the AC activity in detail. As shown in Fig.7, stimulation of the Gs-coupled β-adrenoreceptors on these cells by isoproterenol (10 μm) caused a pronounced decrease of the outward current through BKCa channels (Iout) by about 50%. Co-stimulation of the Gi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptors by the selective agonist clonidine (10 μm) antagonized the effect of isoproterenol by partially restoring Iout to about 80% of the drug-free control. After dialysis of 1 μm RGS16 into the cells, the Gs-mediated effect of isoproterenol was unaffected. The Gi-mediated effect of clonidine, however, was totally abolished. In contrast, RGS16E89K, even when used in a concentration of 10 μm, was without effect on the isoproterenol- and clonidine-evoked signals. As the inhibitory effect of α2-adrenoreceptors on AC activity is mediated by Gαi-subunits (19Zhou X.-B. Wang G.-X. Hüneke B. Wieland T. Korth M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 339-352Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this inhibition should be mimicked by dialyzing recombinant Gαi1 into the cells. As shown in Fig.8, 1 μm Gαi1completely antagonized the inhibition of Iout caused by isoproterenol, whereas the currents in the presence of 0.1 μm Gαi1 were virtually unaltered. Interestingly, Gαi1K210E was about 10-fold more potent than wild type Gαi1. At 0.1 μmGαi1K210E the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol was completely blunted. In contrast to its inability to regulate endogenous Gi proteins (see Fig. 8), RGS16E89K (10 μm) completely reversed the effect of 0.1 μmGαi1K210E when both proteins were applied simultaneously to the cells. The difference in potency of Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E to inhibit AC activity in the uterine smooth muscle cells might be explained by an impaired ability of the mutant to form heterotrimers with Gβγ. To exclude this possibility we tested heterotrimer formation of GDP-liganded Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E (2.5 μm) with an equimolar concentration of Gβγt. As shown in Fig.9, Gαi1 and Gαi1K210E similarly trapped Gβγt in an apparent 1:1 proportion to Ni2+-NTA beads via their internal His6 tag. Gβγt alone did not bind to the matrix. Thus, the ability of heterotrimer formation is apparently not impaired by the Lys to Glu mutation"
https://openalex.org/W2038027577,"We examined the effect of urokinase (uPA) and its fragments on vascular smooth muscle cell contraction. Single-chain uPA inhibits phenylepherine (PE) -induced contraction of rat aortic rings, whereas two-chain uPA exerts the opposite effect. Two independent epitopes mediating these opposing activities were identified. A6, a capped peptide corresponding to amino acids 136-143 (KPSSPPEE) of uPA, increased the EC(50) of PE-induced vascular contraction sevenfold by inhibiting the release of calcium from intracellular stores. A6 activity was abolished by deleting the carboxyl-terminal Glu or by mutating the Ser corresponding to position 138 in uPA to Glu. A single-chain uPA variant lacking amino acids 136-143 did not induce vasorelaxation. A second epitope within the kringle of uPA potentiated PE-induced vasoconstriction. This epitope was exposed when single-chain uPA was converted to a two-chain molecule by plasmin. The isolated uPA kringle augmented vasoconstriction, whereas uPA variant lacking the kringle had no procontractile activity. These studies reveal previously undescribed vasoactive domains within urokinase and its naturally derived fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2088855137,"The receptor responsible for CGRP-induced ion transport and permeability was examined in tissues from animals treated 7 days previously with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to induce colitis or in controls. CGRP caused a concentration-dependent increase in short circuit current (I(sc), EC(50) 21 nM), which was abolished in chloride-free buffer but was not blocked by CGRP(8-37) or tetrodotoxin (TTX). Amylin and adrenomedullin caused only a modest increase in I(sc). The responses to the linear CGRP(2) receptor agonists [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRPalpha and [Cys(Acm)(2,7)] hCGRPalpha were considerably smaller than the response to CGRP. These responses were abolished in chloride-free buffer and were TTX sensitive. Atropine, doxantrazole, and indomethacin did not block the effects of CGRP or the CGRP(2) agonists. The response to [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRPalpha was not affected by prior desensitization of the CGRP receptor and vice versa. Inflamed rats had a similar secretory response to CGRP (I(sc), EC(50) 15 nM) and [Cys(Et)(2,7)] hCGRPalpha as control tissues, while being hyporesponsive to carbachol. CGRP application increased electrical conductance of inflamed preparations. Taken together, these data suggest that CGRP may play an important role in the maintenance of host defense in colitis through an apparently novel CGRP receptor located on the colonic enterocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1988812882,"It is believed that an inflammation-induced activation of the CNS leads to an inhibition of overshooting immune responses to prevent extensive local cytokine secretion. However, immunosuppression by the sympathetic nervous system may be unfavorable when bacteria are present locally and when TNF-α is necessary to overcome infection. We now report in a superfusion model, using mouse spleen slices, that although local Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased splenic TNF-α and IL-6 secretion severalfold over basal levels, electrically released neurotransmitters attenuated cytokine secretion to similar basal level as under bacteria-free conditions. Bacteria reversed noradrenergic inhibitory effector mechanisms: Under bacteria-free conditions, TNF-α secretion was very low and IL-6 secretion was mainly inhibited by α2-adrenoreceptor ligation. In the presence of bacteria, TNF-α and IL-6 secretion were high and IL-6 secretion was mainly inhibited by β-adrenoreceptor ligation. The α- to β-adrenoswitch of IL-6 inhibition in the presence of bacteria was mediated by the prior adrenergic regulation of TNF-α. In vivo, chemical abrogation of sympathetic inhibition reduced accumulation of bacteria in the spleen, which depended at least in part on TNF-α. This suggests that activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a forerunner for accumulation of bacteria in tissue and consecutively sepsis due to intensified inhibition of TNF-α secretion.—Straub, R.

https://openalex.org/W2128558242,"A human cellular factor (OF-1) has been previously implicated in replication of herpes simplex virus, type 1. This protein binds to three conserved regions (Boxes I, II, and III) in the viral replication origin and appears to be required for viral DNA synthesis (Dabrowski, C. C., Carmillo, P.

This protein appears to consist of a tetramer composed of two heterodimers with subunits of 73 and 90 kDa. The smaller subunit contains the DNA binding activity. We have investigated the binding specificity of OF-1 using a mobility shift analysis. These studies reveal that binding is specific for both duplex and single-stranded Box I sequences and that the strongest preference is for the bottom strand of Box I.

Implications of these findings for the initiation step in viral replication are discussed. herpes simplex virus type 1 dithiothreitol Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells occurs within localized chromosomal regions and involves binding by a series of origin-binding proteins. Although initiation occurs at specific DNA sequences in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (1Toone W.M. Aerne B.L. Morgan B.A. Johnston L.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 51: 125-149Google Scholar), the corresponding process in higher eukaryotes is less well understood (2Francon P. Maiorano D. Mechali M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and only recently has evidence for the existence of specific origin sites in mammalian cells been presented (3Aladjem M.I. Rodewald L.W. Kolman J.L. Wahl G.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, studies of human DNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1),1 have been useful as models for understanding the role of origin recognition sequences in the initiation of DNA synthesis in human cells. HSV-1 replication (reviewed in Refs. 4Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and 5Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) initiates at one of three viral replication origins, called oriL and oriS (present in two copies). This process requires the viral initiator protein, UL9, which binds the origins in a sequence-specific manner. The minimal sequence necessary for origin function contains three homologous sequences, designated Boxes I, II, and III (see Fig.1). Dimers of UL9 bind specifically to Boxes I and II and are thought to form a nucleoprotein complex by protein-protein interactions between the dimers bound at both sites. This structure presumably promotes origin unwinding utilizing the ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity associated with UL9 (6Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The unwound origin then facilitates the recruitment of additional replication proteins to initiate replication. Viral replication also appears to require host factors, since attempts to establish replication of oriS-containing plasmids in vitro with purified viral replication proteins have been unsuccessful (discussed in Ref. 4Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A recently identified human host protein, OF-1 (8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), appears to be one of these required factors. This possibility is based on observations that OF-1 specifically binds the viral replication origins at the Box I, II, and III sites and that plasmids carrying oriS mutations that inhibit OF-1 binding, but not UL9 binding, fail to replicate efficiently in virally infected cells. Hence, OF-1 likely plays a role in viral replication in vivo. The binding properties of OF-1 implicate this factor during the initiation step of replication. OF-1 specifically binds within oriS (8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to sequences that overlap the sites bound by UL9. The finding that OF-1 interacts with multiple origin sites suggests that OF-1, like UL9, may also participate in a nucleoprotein complex at the origin. However, although both OF-1 and UL9 bind with the highest affinity to the Box I site, their relative affinity for the other boxes differs significantly (4Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Binding by OF-1 shows decreasing relative affinities of Box I > Box III > Box II, whereas binding by UL9 shows affinities of Box I > Box II ≫ Box III. Thus, the complexes formed by UL9 and OF-1 are likely to differ and may play distinct roles during viral replication. We describe the first partial purification and physical characterization of OF-1 from human cells. We have characterized the binding specificity of this protein, and we find that it binds to the Box I site in oriS in a manner that involves specific interactions with one of the two DNA strands. This binding appears to be enhanced in the presence of UL9. Our results support the possibility that OF-1 participates in the initiation step of viral replication. Oligonucleotides (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) had the sequences shown in Fig. 1. Duplex oligomers were prepared by mixing the complementary top and bottom strands for a given set of oligomers in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 1 mmEDTA, heating the mixture to 95 °C, and allowing the mixture to cool slowly to room temperature. Where indicated, duplex or single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Purity was 95% as determined by densitometry of a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel loaded with approximately 6 μg of protein. Throughout the purification, OF-1 activity was monitored by a mobility shift assay showing specific binding to a duplex Box I oligomer (see “Mobility Shift Assays in Non-denaturing Gels”), and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the species of protein present in a given fraction were visualized by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, followed by silver staining (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Gels were scanned by a Hewlett-Packard optical scanner to create a digitized image.

Cell suspensions were frozen (−80 °C) and thawed 3 times. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and the debris pellet extracted 3 times by resuspension in 2 ml of Buffer A followed by centrifugation, as above. The four supernatant fractions were then pooled, mixed with (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 20% (w/v), held on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was collected. To recover additional OF-1, the pellet was re-extracted three times with 1 ml of Buffer B, containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and supplemented with 20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4. Each extraction was followed by centrifugation. The four supernatants were then combined and diluted with an equal volume of Buffer B to bring the final concentration of (NH4)2SO4 to 10%. The protein suspension was then loaded onto a 150-ml phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in Buffer B containing 10% (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 600 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (10 to 0%) in Buffer B. OF-1 eluted between 7 and 3% (NH4)2SO4. Fractions containing peak OF-1 activity were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a 50-ml phosphocellulose column that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 150 ml of Buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 700 mm NaCl in Buffer B. OF-1 eluted between 150 and 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing peak OF-1 activity were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Pooled fractions were thawed, diluted in Buffer B to bring the salt concentration to 300 mm NaCl, and separated into two equal portions. Each portion was loaded onto a 3-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in Buffer B containing 325 mm NaCl. The columns were washed with 15 ml of the equilibration buffer and eluted with a linear gradient from 325 to 1000 mm NaCl in Buffer B. OF-1 eluted between 375 and 600 mm NaCl. Fractions containing peak OF-1 activity were pooled, concentrated, de-salted in Centricon-100 spin cartridges, and stored in Buffer B at −80 °C. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained heparin-Sepharose-purified OF-1 protein (0.175 μg) and 32P-labeled oligomers at the indicated concentrations in DNA-binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mmNaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min. When included, competitor DNA was added after the first 20 min, and incubation was then continued for the remaining 10 min. Bromphenol blue gel loading buffer type I (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added, and samples were subjected to non-denaturing electrophoresis at 4 °C on 6% polyacrylamide gels (Hoeffer/ Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 45 mm boric acid, and 50 mm EDTA. Gels were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the bands quantified using the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). A mobility shift assay was performed as described above using heparin-Sepharose-purified OF-1 (3 μg) and a 32P-labeled duplex Box I oligomer. The radioactive band containing OF-1-DNA complexes was visualized by scanning on the PhosphorImager. A gel slice containing the OF-1 complex was then excised from the gel and soaked briefly in SDS-gel running buffer (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel slice was then placed into the well of a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and subjected to electrophoresis. Molecular weight markers were run in the same gel, and protein bands were visualized by staining with silver salts (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained32P-labeled oligomer and OF-1 and/or UL9 in DNA-binding buffer. In these reactions, the total volume of UL9 plus UL9 storage buffer remained constant. Reactions were incubated 30 min on ice and then cross-linked by exposure to ultraviolet light (254 nm) for 15 min at an intensity of 48 milliwatts/cm2. SDS-loading buffer (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added; the samples were boiled for 3 min, and the reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were visualized by scanning on a PhosphorImager. Pre-stained protein molecular weight markers were run on each gel, and their positions were used to determine the molecular weights of protein-DNA complexes. Where indicated, the 75-kDa OF-1-associated band was quantitated using the program ImageQuant, after adjusting the contrast to allow resolution of individual bands. Protein molecular weight markers (Sigma) of sizes 650 (thyroglobulin), 443 (apoferritin), 200 (β-amylase), 150 (alcohol dehydrogenase), and 66 kDa (bovine serum albumin) were applied to an 18-ml Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (height 22 cm, diameter 1 cm) equilibrated in Buffer B. Proteins were detected during elution by absorbance at 280 nm using a UV-visible detector (ISCO), and a standard plot of log molecular weight versus fraction number was generated from the elution pattern. OF-1 (20 μg) was cross-linked for 30 min to 625 pmol (3.1 μm) of 32P-labeled duplex Box I DNA in Buffer B, as described above. The cross-linked material was then applied to the same column, and the elution positions of OF-1-DNA complexes were detected by scintillation counting of the resulting fractions. The DNA-dependent formation of inorganic phosphate was determined as described (12Murata L.B. Dodson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37079-37086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-μl reactions containing 40 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.3), 4 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 nm UL9, varying amounts of Box I DNA, and OF-1 or OF-1 buffer were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, treated with acidic molybdenum/malachite green solution and sodium citrate to develop color, and subjected to measurement of absorbance at 650 nm. A reaction without DNA was used as a blank. Amounts of bound and unbound oligomer from electrophoretic analyses on non-denaturing (mobility shift assays) and denaturing (cross-linking assays) gels were determined using ImageQuant. Where more than one bound complex was observed (e.g. in cross-linking analyses), the intensities of the bound complexes were combined. As appropriate, lines of best fit were applied to the data points, using the curve-fit function of Kaleidograph (Synergy Software). Where indicated, Scatchard plots were produced, and Kd or Kd (app) values were calculated from the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the lines. For analysis of the kinetic data from the ATPase assay, the data were fit to a sigmoidal curve derived from a rearrangement of the Hill equation (13Voet D. Voet J.D. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 218-219Google Scholar). The equation used was v = (Vmax[S] n )/K0.5 n + [S] n ), where v = reaction velocity,Vmax = maximum reaction velocity,K0.5 = substrate concentration at one-half Vmax, [S] = substrate concentration, and n = the Hill coefficient, a measure of the cooperativity of the system. To gain insight into the role of host factor OF-1 in HSV-1 replication, we have purified this factor from human cells and characterized it with respect to polypeptide composition, DNA binding specificity, and its potential interaction with the HSV-1 origin-binding protein, UL9. OF-1 activity was isolated from HeLa cell extracts as shown in TableI and was purified 3400-fold. It was detected by its ability to produce a mobility shift during electrophoresis of a duplex Box I oligomer. This activity remained in the supernatant after ammonium sulfate (20% w/v) precipitation of crude extracts. Further purification was achieved by sequential chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and heparin-Sepharose, as shown in Fig. 2,panel A. We noticed that early steps in the purification resulted in an increase in total activity (see Table I), most likely due to removal of contaminating nucleases. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography resulted in substantial loss of activity but removed several major contaminating polypeptides. Since only a single peak of activity was recovered from this purification step (see Fig. 2,panel A), and since we observed only a single band in our mobility shift assay throughout the purification (not shown), we believe that OF-1 represents a single DNA binding activity.Table IPurification of OF-1Purification stepTotal proteinTotal activity (relative yield)Specific activityPurificationmgnmol DNA bound/mg protein-foldCrude extract787.531.5 (1.00)0.0401Ammonium sulfate99.047.7 (1.51)0.48212.1Phenyl-Sepharose51.376.7 (2.43)1.5037.6Phosphocellulose1.7063.1 (2.00)37.1928Heparin-Sepharose0.01822.48 (0.08)1363410OF-1 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on the indicated matrices, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After each step, peak OF-1 fractions were pooled and assayed for protein concentration and specific activity. To measure specific activity (nmol of DNA bound/mg of protein), protein was diluted and assayed for a mobility shift using a 32P-labeled duplex Box I oligomer (12.5 nm), and the fraction of shifted DNA was determined from scans of the gels. For each measurement, several protein dilutions were used, and specific activity was determined with those dilutions that showed a linear increase in binding proportional to concentration. Since nucleases may have been present during purification and since the DNA concentrations used did not exceed the subsequently determined Kd value for binding, the specific activity determined at each step is a minimal estimate of activity.

For each measurement, several protein dilutions were used, and specific activity was determined with those dilutions that showed a linear increase in binding proportional to concentration. Since nucleases may have been present during purification and since the DNA concentrations used did not exceed the subsequently determined Kd value for binding, the specific activity determined at each step is a minimal estimate of activity. The protein species present after each purification step were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis, as shown in Fig. 2, panel B. Four major polypeptide species predominated after heparin-Sepharose purification (Fig. 2, panel B, lane 5). As discussed below, OF-1 consists of two of these polypeptides (73 and 90 kDa), designated by arrows in Fig. 2, panel B. Based on densitometry scans of these protein bands, we estimate that the OF-1 polypeptides comprised 28% of the total protein in the heparin-purified sample. To determine which of the peptides in our OF-1 preparation are involved in binding to HSV-1 origin (Box I) sequences, we employed a modified two-dimensional electrophoresis protocol. OF-1 protein was first run on a non-denaturing gel in the presence of labeled duplex Box I oligomer under mobility shift conditions. Polypeptides associated with the shifted band were then separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.3, this analysis resulted in recovery of two polypeptides of 73 and 90 kDa. These peptides correspond to two of the four species seen in the purified OF-1 preparation (arrows in Fig. 2, panel B). Densitometry of the OF-1-associated bands showed that the two polypeptides are present in approximately equimolar amounts, suggesting that OF-1 exists as a heterodimer. Further insight into the subunit structure of OF-1 was obtained using gel filtration chromatography. A 32P-labeled duplex Box I DNA oligomer was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-4B either alone or after being cross-linked to OF-1. As shown in Fig.4, a comparison of these two chromatographs revealed a large peak from both columns representing the free DNA and two additional smaller peaks from the column loaded with the cross-linked material. These smaller peaks presumably represent OF-1-DNA complexes and exhibit apparent molecular masses of 165 (fraction 30) and 395 (fraction 27) kDa. The 165-kDa peak is consistent with a complex containing a protein heterodimer with both the 73- and 90-kDa subunits plus DNA (13 kDa). The 395-kDa peak may represent a tetramer consisting of two heterodimers plus one or more copies of Box I DNA. Hence, we conclude that OF-1 most likely exists as a tetramer containing two heterodimers. Dabrowski et al. (8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) previously showed that OF-1 from crude extracts binds specifically to the Box I region of oriS. Consequently, we wished to know whether our partially purified preparation of OF-1 retained this binding specificity and to determine the substrate requirements for binding. In particular, since replication origins must unwind to initiate replication, we considered the possibility that OF-1 might bind to single-stranded DNA sequences within oriS. For this analysis, we conducted a series of binding experiments with32P-labeled single-stranded or duplex Box I oligomers. To demonstrate specificity of binding, excess unlabeled competing DNA was added, as indicated. This competitor DNA consisted of single-stranded or duplex sequences corresponding to either Box I, a randomized sequence with an overall base composition similar to Box I (Random Box I), or poly(dC)-oligo(dG). Reaction products were then analyzed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Consistent with the previous results of Dabrowski et al.(8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we find that OF-1 binds specifically to duplex Box I DNA. As shown in Fig. 5, OF-1 bound to the labeled Box I probe yielding a single-shifted band, in the absence of competing DNA (lane 1). Specificity of binding was revealed in competition experiments that showed no shift when the competing DNA was the same duplex Box I sequence (lane 2) but a complete shift when the randomized duplex oligo (lane 3) or poly(dC)-oligo(dG) homopolymer (lane 4) was used. Our results also indicate that OF-1 binds specifically to single-stranded Box I sequences. For this analysis, we conducted similar mobility shift experiments to those described above, except that the labeled probe consisted of the bottom strand of Box I, and the competing DNA was also single-stranded. As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of competition, OF-1 bound to the single-stranded probe producing a mobility shift (lane 5). This binding is specific, since it was eliminated by an excess of unlabeled Box I bottom strand (lane 6) but not by an excess of the randomized duplex oligomer which had been denatured prior to addition to the reaction (lane 7). A similar mobility shift analysis with a related Box I sequence revealed that residues at the 3′ end of Box I are critical for binding. This related sequence (called Alternate Box I in Fig. 1) is shifted to the left relative to the original Box I sequence and, hence, lacks three nucleotides from the right end (AAT). As shown in Fig. 5, whereas OF-1 bound strongly to Box I DNA (lane 8), it bound very poorly to this alternate duplex (lane 9). This result is significant since Dabrowski et al. (8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that OF-1 from crude extracts fails to bind an oligomer carrying deletions or mutations in the residues CAAT at the 3′ end of the Box I sequence. They further showed that base substitutions at the 3′ CA residues eliminated replication of oriS-containing plasmids transfected into HSV-1-infected cells. Our finding indicates that our purified OF-1 retains a binding requirement for the 3′ AAT residues in this sequence and further suggests that these residues may be critical for OF-1 function during viral replication. To define and quantitate the binding preferences of OF-1, we conducted the experiments shown in Fig.6. Mobility shift assays similar to those described above were performed, and dissociation constants (Kd values) were calculated from Scatchard plots of the data. The plots obtained were biphasic (except for panel F), suggesting that OF-1 contains two sites with different affinities for DNA. Since the Kd value for the higher affinity site in each case is substantially lower than that for the second site, we have reported only the higher affinity values. First, we examined the preference of OF-1 for Box I and III duplex sequences, since Dabrowski et al. (8Dabrowski C.E. Carmillo P.J. Schaffer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) had previously shown that OF-1 from crude extracts binds preferentially to Box I duplexes. Our results confirm this finding using partially purified OF-1 and indicate that OF-1 has a 3.2-fold higher affinity for duplex Box I (panel A) than for duplex Box III (panel D) (Kd = 24 nm and 78 nm, respectively). Next, we compared the binding affinities of OF-1 for duplex and single-stranded Box I DNAs. This comparison reveals that OF-1 binds with the strongest affinity to the bottom strand of Box I. The Kd value for binding to the Box I bottom strand was 10 nm (panel C) and was 2.4-fold lower than that seen for duplex Box I (Kd = 24 nm,panel A) and 6.2-fold lower than seen for the top strand of Box I (Kd = 62 nm, panel B). Hence, we suspect that OF-1 may prefer a single-stranded Box I site for binding in vivo. Finally, we observed that OF-1 also binds to single-stranded Box III sequences but greatly prefers the top strand. In this case, we obtained Kd values of 61 nm for the Box III top strand (panel E) and 780 nm for the bottom strand (panel F). Since Box I and Box III are inverted with respect to each other in oriS (see Fig. 1), OF-1 shows a preference for the equivalent strand in each case. The affinity of OF-1 for the preferred Box III strand is higher than that seen for the Box III duplex DNA, although the preference in this case is not as striking as that seen with Box I DNA. To identify the polypeptide(s) in OF-1 that directly contact DNA in OF-1-DNA complexes, we cross-linked OF-1 to 32P-labeled duplex Box I or Box III oligomers, boiled the complexes in SDS to denature the protein and DNA, and analyzed the products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, as shown in Fig. 7, panel A. OF-1 formed three major bands following cross-linking to either Box I or Box III DNA (lanes 2 and 7, respectively). The most intense band (lowest arrow) had an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, suggesting that i"
