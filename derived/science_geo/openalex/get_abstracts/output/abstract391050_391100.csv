https://openalex.org/W2143296478,"Using a sequence of growth-factor manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development in culture, a new study has successfully generated human intestinal tissue in vitro from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. The resulting epithelium was uniformly intestinal, with villus-like structures and progenitor domains, and contained all of the functional cell types of the gut, including brush borders that were indistinguishable from adult intestine. This approach may provide therapeutic benefit for disease studies. Using a temporal series of growth factor manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development in culture, this study has successfully directed the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells) into intestinal tissue. This approach may provide therapeutic benefit for disease studies. Studies in embryonic development have guided successful efforts to direct the differentiation of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into specific organ cell types in vitro1,2. For example, human PSCs have been differentiated into monolayer cultures of liver hepatocytes and pancreatic endocrine cells3,4,5,6 that have therapeutic efficacy in animal models of liver disease7,8 and diabetes9, respectively. However, the generation of complex three-dimensional organ tissues in vitro remains a major challenge for translational studies. Here we establish a robust and efficient process to direct the differentiation of human PSCs into intestinal tissue in vitro using a temporal series of growth factor manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development10. This involved activin-induced definitive endoderm formation11, FGF/Wnt-induced posterior endoderm pattering, hindgut specification and morphogenesis12,13,14, and a pro-intestinal culture system15,16 to promote intestinal growth, morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. The resulting three-dimensional intestinal ‘organoids’ consisted of a polarized, columnar epithelium that was patterned into villus-like structures and crypt-like proliferative zones that expressed intestinal stem cell markers17. The epithelium contained functional enterocytes, as well as goblet, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells. Using this culture system as a model to study human intestinal development, we identified that the combined activity of WNT3A and FGF4 is required for hindgut specification whereas FGF4 alone is sufficient to promote hindgut morphogenesis. Our data indicate that human intestinal stem cells form de novo during development. We also determined that NEUROG3, a pro-endocrine transcription factor that is mutated in enteric anendocrinosis18, is both necessary and sufficient for human enteroendocrine cell development in vitro. PSC-derived human intestinal tissue should allow for unprecedented studies of human intestinal development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2001730700,"A 42 kb region on human chromosome 9p21 encodes for three distinct tumor suppressors, p16INK4A, p14ARF and p15INK4B, and is altered in an estimated 30–40% of human tumors. The expression of the INK4A-ARF-INK4B gene cluster is silenced by polycomb during normal cell growth and is activated by oncogenic insults and during aging. How the polycomb is recruited to repress this gene cluster is unclear. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic Ras, which stimulates the expression of p15INK4B and p16INK4A, but not p14ARF, inhibits the expression of ANRIL (antisense non-coding RNA in the I NK4 locus), a 3.8 kb-long non-coding RNA expressed in the opposite direction from INK4A-ARF-INK4B. We show that the p15INK4B locus is bound by SUZ12, a component of polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2), and is H3K27-trimethylated. Notably, depletion of ANRIL disrupts the SUZ12 binding to the p15INK4B locus, increases the expression of p15INK4B, but not p16INK4A or p14ARF, and inhibits cellular proliferation. Finally, RNA immunoprecipitation demonstrates that ANRIL binds to SUZ12 in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest a model in which ANRIL binds to and recruits PRC2 to repress the expression of p15INK4B locus."
https://openalex.org/W2116049552,"Individuals make choices and prioritize goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control."
https://openalex.org/W1978106706,"A fourth planet has been discovered orbiting the nearby star HR 8799. Three giant planets had been imaged directly in the near-infrared — thanks to their wide orbits and brightness. The fourth is interior to and about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models, as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown three giant planets. Here, the presence of a fourth planet, interior to and about the same mass as the other three, is reported. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown three giant planets1. Such images were possible because of the wide orbits (>25 astronomical units, where 1 au is the Earth–Sun distance) and youth (<100 Myr) of the imaged planets, which are still hot and bright as they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. An important area of contention in the exoplanet community is whether outer planets (>10 au) more massive than Jupiter form by way of one-step gravitational instabilities2 or, rather, through a two-step process involving accretion of a core followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of hydrogen and helium3. Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior to and of about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts4, the HR 8799 planetary system is a unique laboratory in which to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at wide (>10 au) separations."
https://openalex.org/W2002262418,"Estrogen receptor-α (ER) is the key feature of most breast cancers and binding of ER to the genome correlates with expression of the Forkhead protein FOXA1 (also called HNF3α). Here we show that FOXA1 is a key determinant that can influence differential interactions between ER and chromatin. Almost all ER-chromatin interactions and gene expression changes depended on the presence of FOXA1 and FOXA1 influenced genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, we found that CTCF was an upstream negative regulator of FOXA1-chromatin interactions. In estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells, the dependency on FOXA1 for tamoxifen-ER activity was absolute; in tamoxifen-resistant cells, ER binding was independent of ligand but depended on FOXA1. Expression of FOXA1 in non-breast cancer cells can alter ER binding and function. As such, FOXA1 is a major determinant of estrogen-ER activity and endocrine response in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971412744,"Medulloblastomas, a common type of malignant childhood brain tumour, are thought in the main to arise from the cerebellum, many of them involving aberrant signalling of a signalling pathway involving Sonic Hedgehog. There is substantial heterogeneity among medulloblastomas, however, and new work shows that a distinct subtype of medulloblastoma arises from the dorsal brainstem and is associated with altered Wnt signalling. Distinct molecular and clinical profiles of the subtypes have implications for future treatment. This suggests that subgroups of medulloblastoma are intrinsically different diseases, so therapeutic strategies may need to be tailored accordingly. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant childhood brain tumours and are thought to arise from the cerebellum. There is substantial heterogeneity among medulloblastomas and some are thought to arise following aberrant Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation. It is now shown that a distinct subtype of medulloblastoma arises from the dorsal brainstem and is associated with altered WNT signalling. Distinct molecular and clinical profiles of the subtypes have implications for future treatment. Medulloblastoma encompasses a collection of clinically and molecularly diverse tumour subtypes that together comprise the most common malignant childhood brain tumour1,2,3,4. These tumours are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH subtype)3,4,5,6,7,8. The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies. Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype)1,3,4 arises outside the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly proliferating Zic1+ precursor cells. These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins. Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH- and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2027576577,"Computation underlies the organization of cells into higher-order structures, for example during development or the spatial association of bacteria in a biofilm. Each cell performs a simple computational operation, but when combined with cell-cell communication, intricate patterns emerge. Here we study this process by combining a simple genetic circuit with quorum sensing to produce more complex computations in space. We construct a simple NOR logic gate in Escherichia coli by arranging two tandem promoters that function as inputs to drive the transcription of a repressor. The repressor inactivates a promoter that serves as the output. Individual colonies of E. coli carry the same NOR gate, but the inputs and outputs are wired to different orthogonal quorum-sensing 'sender' and 'receiver' devices. The quorum molecules form the wires between gates. By arranging the colonies in different spatial configurations, all possible two-input gates are produced, including the difficult XOR and EQUALS functions. The response is strong and robust, with 5- to >300-fold changes between the 'on' and 'off' states. This work helps elucidate the design rules by which simple logic can be harnessed to produce diverse and complex calculations by rewiring communication between cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969899640,"Of the 20 ribosomally coded amino acid residues, lysine is the most frequently post-translationally modified, which has important functional and regulatory consequences. Here we report the identification and verification of a previously unreported form of protein post-translational modification (PTM): lysine succinylation. The succinyllysine residue was initially identified by mass spectrometry and protein sequence alignment. The identified succinyllysine peptides derived from in vivo proteins were verified by western blot analysis, in vivo labeling with isotopic succinate, MS/MS and HPLC coelution of their synthetic counterparts. We further show that lysine succinylation is evolutionarily conserved and that this PTM responds to different physiological conditions. Our study also implies that succinyl-CoA might be a cofactor for lysine succinylation. Given the apparent high abundance of lysine succinylation and the significant structural changes induced by this PTM, it is expected that lysine succinylation has important cellular functions."

https://openalex.org/W2130473558,"Synaptic loss is the best pathological correlate of the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic failure are unknown. We found a non-apoptotic baseline caspase-3 activity in hippocampal dendritic spines and an enhancement of this activity at the onset of memory decline in the Tg2576-APPswe mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In spines, caspase-3 activated calcineurin, which in turn triggered dephosphorylation and removal of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA-type receptor from postsynaptic sites. These molecular modifications led to alterations of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity and correlated with spine degeneration and a deficit in hippocampal-dependent memory. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 activity in Tg2576 mice rescued the observed Alzheimer-like phenotypes. Our results identify a previously unknown caspase-3-dependent mechanism that drives synaptic failure and contributes to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. These findings indicate that caspase-3 is a potential target for pharmacological therapy during early disease stages."

https://openalex.org/W1971765707,"A subset of series B adenoviruses binds epithelial cells via a previously unknown receptor. Wang et al. now identify this receptor as desmoglein-2 (DSG-2), which has a role in intercellular adhesion. Binding of group B Ad3 to DSG-2 triggered an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, opened intercellular junctions and increased access to junction-localized proteins, which together may contribute to the spread of these viruses though epithelial tissues. We have identified desmoglein-2 (DSG-2) as the primary high-affinity receptor used by adenoviruses Ad3, Ad7, Ad11 and Ad14. These serotypes represent key human pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections. In epithelial cells, adenovirus binding of DSG-2 triggers events reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, leading to transient opening of intercellular junctions. This opening improves access to receptors, for example, CD46 and Her2/neu, that are trapped in intercellular junctions. In addition to complete virions, dodecahedral particles (PtDds), formed by excess amounts of viral capsid proteins, penton base and fiber during viral replication, can trigger DSG-2–mediated opening of intercellular junctions as shown by studies with recombinant Ad3 PtDds. Our findings shed light on adenovirus biology and pathogenesis and may have implications for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1979908884,"In contrast to other cytotoxic agents including anthracyclins and oxaliplatin (OXP), cisplatin (CDDP) fails to induce immunogenic tumor cell death that would allow to stimulate an anticancer immune response and hence to amplify its therapeutic efficacy. This failure to induce immunogenic cell death can be attributed to CDDP's incapacity to elicit the translocation of calreticulin (CRT) from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. Here, we show that, in contrast to OXP, CDDP is unable to activate the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK)-dependent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Accordingly, CDDP also failed to stimulate the formation of stress granules and macroautophagy, two processes that only occur after eIF2α phosphorylation. Using a screening method that monitors the voyage of CRT from the ER lumen to the cell surface, we identified thapsigargin (THAPS), an inhibitor of the sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase as a molecule that on its own does not stimulate CRT exposure, yet endows CDDP with the capacity to do so. The combination of ER stress inducers (such as THAPS or tunicamycin) and CDDP effectively induced the translocation of CRT to the plasma membrane, as well as immunogenic cell death, although ER stress or CDDP alone was insufficient to induce CRT exposure and immunogenic cell death. Altogether, our results underscore the contribution of the ER stress response to the immunogenicity of cell death."

An analysis of dayside multi-wavelength photometry of WASP-12b reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere abundant in carbon monoxide. Compared with model predictions, the atmosphere is depleted in water vapour and enhanced in methane content by two orders of magnitude. In addition, the absence of a strong thermal inversion or a prominent stratosphere challenges existing theories about the atmospheres of such exoplanets. A primordial carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) greater than 0.8 in an exoplanet causes a carbide-dominated interior, as opposed to the silicate-dominated composition found on Earth; the atmospheres also can differ from those in the Solar System. The solar C/O is 0.54. This study reports an analysis of spectra from the transiting hot Jupiter WASP-12b that reveals that C/O>1 in its atmosphere, based upon the observed concentrations of the prominent molecules CO, CH4 and H2O. The carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in a planet provides critical information about its primordial origins and subsequent evolution. A primordial C/O greater than 0.8 causes a carbide-dominated interior, as opposed to the silicate-dominated composition found on Earth1; the atmosphere can also differ from those in the Solar System1,2. The solar C/O is 0.54 (ref. 3). Here we report an analysis of dayside multi-wavelength photometry4,5 of the transiting hot-Jupiter WASP-12b (ref. 6) that reveals C/O ≥ 1 in its atmosphere. The atmosphere is abundant in CO. It is depleted in water vapour and enhanced in methane, each by more than two orders of magnitude compared to a solar-abundance chemical-equilibrium model at the expected temperatures. We also find that the extremely irradiated atmosphere (T > 2,500 K) of WASP-12b lacks a prominent thermal inversion (or stratosphere) and has very efficient day–night energy circulation. The absence of a strong thermal inversion is in stark contrast to theoretical predictions for the most highly irradiated hot-Jupiter atmospheres7,8,9."
https://openalex.org/W2017210187,"The main manifestations of nephrotic syndrome include proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia and lipiduria. Common causes of nephrotic syndrome are diabetic nephropathy, minimal change disease (MCD), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and membranous nephropathy. Among the primary glomerular diseases, MCD is usually sensitive to glucocorticoid treatment, whereas the other diseases show variable responses. Despite the identification of key structural proteins in the glomerular capillary loop which may contribute to defects in ultrafiltration, many of the disease mechanisms of nephrotic syndrome remain unresolved. In this study, we show that the glomerular expression of angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4), a secreted glycoprotein, is glucocorticoid sensitive and is highly upregulated in the serum and in podocytes in experimental models of MCD and in the human disease. Podocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of Angptl4 (NPHS2-Angptl4) in rats induced nephrotic-range, and selective, proteinuria (over 500-fold increase in albuminuria), loss of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) charge and foot process effacement, whereas transgenic expression specifically in the adipose tissue (aP2-Angptl4) resulted in increased circulating Angptl4, but no proteinuria. Angptl4(-/-) mice that were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nephritogenic antisera developed markedly less proteinuria than did control mice. Angptl4 secreted from podocytes in some forms of nephrotic syndrome lacks normal sialylation. When we fed the sialic acid precursor N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) to NPHS2-Angptl4 transgenic rats it increased the sialylation of Angptl4 and decreased albuminuria by more than 40%. These results suggest that podocyte-secreted Angptl4 has a key role in nephrotic syndrome."

The observations are challenging, though, because of the low expected signal strength (~10 mK), and contamination by strong (>100 K) foreground synchrotron emission in the Milky Way and extragalactic continuum sources2. If reionization happened rapidly, there should be a characteristic signature visible against the smooth foreground in an all-sky spectrum. Here we report an all-sky spectrum between 100 and 200 MHz, corresponding to the redshift range 6 < z < 13 for the 21-centimetre line.

https://openalex.org/W2147698885,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of risk loci for many complex disorders, including Crohn's disease. However, common disease-associated SNPs explain at most ∼20% of the genetic variance for Crohn's disease. Several factors may account for this unexplained heritability, including rare risk variants not adequately tagged thus far in GWAS. That rare susceptibility variants indeed contribute to variation in multifactorial phenotypes has been demonstrated for colorectal cancer, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, blood pressure, type 1 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and, in the case of Crohn's disease, for NOD2 (refs. 14,15). Here we describe the use of high-throughput resequencing of DNA pools to search for rare coding variants influencing susceptibility to Crohn's disease in 63 GWAS-identified positional candidate genes. We identify low frequency coding variants conferring protection against inflammatory bowel disease in IL23R, but we conclude that rare coding variants in positional candidates do not make a large contribution to inherited predisposition to Crohn's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2045534392,"Activity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is essential for normal sound localization behavior, but previous studies of the spatial sensitivity of neurons in A1 have found broad spatial tuning. We tested the hypothesis that spatial tuning sharpens when an animal engages in an auditory task. Cats performed a task that required evaluation of the locations of sounds and one that required active listening, but in which sound location was irrelevant. Some 26-44% of the units recorded in A1 showed substantially sharpened spatial tuning during the behavioral tasks as compared with idle conditions, with the greatest sharpening occurring during the location-relevant task. Spatial sharpening occurred on a scale of tens of seconds and could be replicated multiple times in ∼1.5-h test sessions. Sharpening resulted primarily from increased suppression of responses to sounds at least-preferred locations. That and an observed increase in latencies suggest an important role of inhibitory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1985670883,"Extension of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into dendritic spines of Purkinje neurons is required for cerebellar synaptic plasticity and is disrupted in animals with null mutations in Myo5a, the gene encoding myosin-Va. We show here that myosin-Va acts as a point-to-point organelle transporter to pull ER as cargo into Purkinje neuron spines. Specifically, myosin-Va accumulates at the ER tip as the organelle moves into spines, and hydrolysis of ATP by myosin-Va is required for spine ER targeting. Moreover, myosin-Va is responsible for almost all of the spine ER insertion events. Finally, attenuation of the ability of myosin-Va to move along actin filaments reduces the maximum velocity of ER movement into spines, providing direct evidence that myosin-Va drives ER motility. Thus, we have established that an actin-based motor moves ER within animal cells, and have uncovered the mechanism for ER localization to Purkinje neuron spines, a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2033961200,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix degradation are critical for the initiation and progression of tumor invasion. We have recently identified Krüppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) as a critical inducer of EMT and invasion. KLF8 induces EMT primarily by repressing E-cadherin transcription. However, how KLF8 promotes invasion is unknown. Here, we report a novel KLF8-to- matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 signaling that promotes human breast cancer invasion. To identify the potential KLF8 regulation of MMPs in breast cancer, we established two inducible cell lines that allow either KLF8 overexpression in MCF-10A or knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells. KLF8 overexpression induced a strong increase in MMP9 expression and activity as determined by quantitative real-time PCR and zymography. This induction was well correlated with the MMP inhibitor-sensitive Matrigel invasion. Conversely, KLF8 knockdown caused the opposite changes that could be partially prevented by MMP9 overexpression. Promoter-reporter assays and chromatin and oligonucleotide precipitations determined that KLF8 directly bound and activated the human MMP9 gene promoter. Three-dimensional (3D) glandular culture showed that KLF8 expression disrupted the normal acinus formation, which could be prevented by the MMP inhibitor, whereas KLF8 knockdown corrected the abnormal 3D architecture, which could be protected by MMP9 overexpression. KLF8 knockdown promoted MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation in suspension culture, which could be prevented by MMP9 overexpression. KLF8 knockdown inhibited the lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice. Immunohistochemical staining strongly correlated the co-expression of KLF8 and MMP9 with the patient tumor invasion, metastasis and poor survival. Taken together, this work identified the KLF8 activation of MMP9 as a novel and critical signaling mechanism underlying human breast cancer invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1995571717,"Hematopoietic cells normally require cell extrinsic signals to maintain metabolism and survival. In contrast, cancer cells can express constitutively active oncogenic kinases such as BCR-Abl that promote these processes independent of extrinsic growth factors. When cells receive insufficient growth signals or when oncogenic kinases are inhibited, glucose metabolism decreases and the self-digestive process of autophagy is elevated to degrade bulk cytoplasm and organelles. Although autophagy has been proposed to provide a cell-intrinsic nutrient supply for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and to maintain cellular homeostasis through degradation of damaged organelles or protein aggregates, its acute role in growth factor deprivation or inhibition of oncogenic kinases remains poorly understood. We therefore developed a growth factor-dependent hematopoietic cell culture model in which autophagy can be acutely disrupted through conditional Cre-mediated excision of the autophagy-essential gene Atg3. Treated cells rapidly lost their ability to perform autophagy and underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although Atg3 was essential for optimal upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative pathways in growth factor withdrawal, this metabolic contribution of autophagy did not appear critical for cell survival, as provision of exogenous pyruvate or lipids could not completely rescue Atg3 deficiency. Instead, autophagy suppressed a stress response that otherwise led to p53 phosphorylation and upregulation of p21 and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Puma. Importantly, BCR-Abl-expressing cells had low basal levels of autophagy, but were highly dependent on this process, and rapidly underwent apoptosis upon disruption of autophagy through Atg3 deletion or treatment with chemical autophagy inhibitors. This dependence on autophagy extended in vivo, as Atg3 deletion also prevented BCR-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis in a cell transfer model. Together these data demonstrate a critical role for autophagy to mitigate cell stress, and that cells expressing the oncogenic kinase BCR-Abl appear particularly dependent on autophagy for cell survival and leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089817267,"Our previous studies have found that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling resulted in mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). In the large probasin promoter directed SV40-large T-antigen (LPB–Tag) expressing mouse prostate, mPIN forms with rare areas of adenocarcinoma. Combining expression of both Wnt-signaling and Tag expression in the mouse prostate, we have studied the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the progression from mPIN to adenocarcinoma. Our results show that the prostates of mice expressing Tag alone or nuclear β-catenin alone developed mPIN, whereas the activation of both Tag and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway resulted in invasive prostate adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, Foxa2, a forkhead transcription factor, was induced by active Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the expression of Foxa2 was associated with the invasive phenotype in the primary prostate cancer. In the LPB–Tag/dominant active (DA) β-catenin prostates, MMP7, a Wnt/β-catenin target gene, was upregulated. Furthermore, we also assessed AR and AR signaling pathway in these LPB–Tag/DA β-catenin mice. Although β-catenin is a well-known AR co-activator in vitro, our study provides strong in vivo evidences indicating that both AR protein and the AR pathway were downregulated in the prostate of LPB–Tag/DA β-catenin mice. Histological analysis shows that prostate sections derived from the LPB–Tag/DA β-catenin mice display neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), but NE cancer does not develop. Together, our findings indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling has an important role in the progression of mPIN to prostate adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2160585478,"The conventional view of neurons is that synaptic inputs are integrated on a timescale of milliseconds to seconds in the dendrites, with action potential initiation occurring in the axon initial segment. We found a much slower form of integration that leads to action potential initiation in the distal axon, well beyond the initial segment. In a subset of rodent hippocampal and neocortical interneurons, hundreds of spikes, evoked over minutes, resulted in persistent firing that lasted for a similar duration. Although axonal action potential firing was required to trigger persistent firing, somatic depolarization was not. In paired recordings, persistent firing was not restricted to the stimulated neuron; it could also be produced in the unstimulated cell. Thus, these interneurons can slowly integrate spiking, share the output across a coupled network of axons and respond with persistent firing even in the absence of input to the soma or dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W1980223282,"Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) cause myeloproliferative neoplasms, clonal blood stem cell disorders with a propensity for leukaemic transformation. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling through the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway enables self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we show that mouse ES cells carrying the human JAK2V617F mutation were able to self-renew in chemically defined conditions without cytokines or small-molecule inhibitors, independently of JAK signalling through the STAT3 or phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathways. Phosphorylation of histone H3 tyrosine 41 (H3Y41) by JAK2 was recently shown to interfere with binding of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α). Levels of chromatin-bound HP1α were lower in JAK2V617F ES cells but increased following inhibition of JAK2, coincident with a global reduction in histone H3Y41 phosphorylation. JAK2 inhibition reduced levels of the pluripotency regulator Nanog, with a reduction in H3Y41 phosphorylation and concomitant increase in HP1α levels at the Nanog promoter. Furthermore, Nanog was required for factor independence of JAK2V617F ES cells. Taken together, these results uncover a previously unrecognized role for direct signalling to chromatin by JAK2 as an important mediator of ES cell self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2105089504,"The induction of mammalian autophagy, a cellular catabolic bulk-degradation process conserved from humans to yeast, was recently shown to require IκB kinase (IKK), the upstream regulator of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. Interestingly, it was shown that this response did not involve NF-κB. Thus, the mechanism by which IKK promotes stimulus-induced autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of IKK/NF-κB in response to nutrient deprivation, the well-understood autophagy-inducing stimulus. IKK and both the classic and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB are robustly induced in response to cellular starvation. Notably, cells lacking either catalytic subunit of IKK (IKK-α or IKK-β) fail to induce autophagy in response to cellular starvation. Importantly, we show that IKK activity but not NF-κB controls basal expression of the proautophagic gene LC3. We further demonstrate that starvation induces the expression of LC3 and two other essential autophagic genes ATG5 and Beclin-1 in an IKK-dependent manner. These results indicate that the IKK complex is a central mediator of starvation-induced autophagy in mammalian cells, and suggest that this requirement occurs at least in part through the regulation of autophagic gene expression. Interestingly, NF-κB subunits are dispensable for both basal and starvation-induced expression of proautophagic genes. However, starvation-induced activation of NF-κB is not inconsequential, as increases in expression of antiapoptotic NF-κB target genes such as Birc3 are observed in response to cellular starvation. Thus, IKK likely has multiple roles in response to starvation by regulating NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic gene expression as well as controlling expression of autophagic genes through a yet undetermined mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2003217138,"Gap junctions, the channels formed by the connexin (Cx) family of proteins, are responsible for direct intercellular communication. Although connexins are considered as tumor suppressors, their overall role in cancer onset, progression and metastasis is somewhat controversial. This study uses a novel Cx43 mutant mouse model (G60S mice) and cross-breeding strategies to determine the role of Cx43 in all stages of breast tumorigenesis. G60S mice were cross-bred with ErbB2 overexpressing mice, and spontaneous and 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA)-induced tumor development was evaluated. Mice were killed when tumors reached ∼1 cm(3) or when mice showed signs of critical illness. In both spontaneous and DMBA studies, onset of palpable tumors was delayed in G60S mice compared with mice in control groups. Moreover, while tumors from control mice reached the size threshold, most DMBA-exposed Cx43 mutant mice were killed prematurely because of labored breathing, independent of the presence of a palpable tumor. Reduced Cx43 levels in Cx43 mutant mice were accompanied by extensive mammary gland hyperplasia. Lung histology revealed that all Cx43 mutant mice exhibited mammaglobin-positive mammary gland metastases to the lung, and the number of metastases was increased by threefold in Cx43 mutant mice on treatment with DMBA. Thus, while reduced levels of Cx43 delayed the onset of palpable tumors, normal Cx43 levels inhibited mammary gland tumor metastasis to the lungs. Understanding the mechanisms of how Cx43, which is expressed primarily in myoepithelial cells, inhibits mammary gland tumor metastasis is critical as Cx43 is assessed as a candidate for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2156054486,"Bhang and colleagues have developed a tumor-specific imaging strategy that uses the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) promoter, known to be specifically associated with malignant transformation, to selectively drive the expression of luciferase or herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase reporters. Systemic delivery of PEG-3 promoter–driven constructs using a nonviral gene delivery vehicle allowed detection of both primary tumors and micrometastatic disease in mouse models of human melanoma and breast cancer. Molecular-genetic imaging is advancing from a valuable preclinical tool to a guide for patient management. The strategy involves pairing an imaging reporter gene with a complementary imaging agent in a system that can be used to measure gene expression or protein interaction or track gene-tagged cells in vivo. Tissue-specific promoters can be used to delineate gene expression in certain tissues, particularly when coupled with an appropriate amplification mechanism. Here we show that the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) promoter, derived from a rodent gene mediating tumor progression and metastatic phenotypes, can be used to drive imaging reporters selectively to enable detection of micrometastatic disease in mouse models of human melanoma and breast cancer using bioluminescence and radionuclide-based molecular imaging techniques. Because of its strong promoter activity, tumor specificity and capacity for clinical translation, PEG-3 promoter–driven gene expression may represent a practical, new system for facilitating cancer imaging and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2061690242,"Centromere-binding protein B (CENP-B) is a widely conserved DNA binding factor associated with heterochromatin and centromeric satellite repeats. In fission yeast, CENP-B homologues have been shown to silence long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons by recruiting histone deacetylases. However, CENP-B factors also have unexplained roles in DNA replication. Here we show that a molecular function of CENP-B is to promote replication-fork progression through the LTR. Mutants have increased genomic instability caused by replication-fork blockage that depends on the DNA binding factor switch-activating protein 1 (Sap1), which is directly recruited by the LTR. The loss of Sap1-dependent barrier activity allows the unhindered progression of the replication fork, but results in rearrangements deleterious to the retrotransposon. We conclude that retrotransposons influence replication polarity through recruitment of Sap1 and transposition near replication-fork blocks, whereas CENP-B counteracts this activity and promotes fork stability. Our results may account for the role of LTR in fragile sites, and for the association of CENP-B with pericentromeric heterochromatin and tandem satellite repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1994680857,"Migration of cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are required for efficient tumor cell invasion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially known. The PPFIA1 gene for liprin-α1 is frequently amplified in human breast cancers. We recently demonstrated that liprin-α1 is an important regulator of cell edge dynamics during motility. We show, herein, that the liprin-α1 protein is highly expressed in human breast tumors. Functional analysis shows that liprin-α1 is specifically required for the migration and invasion of highly invasive human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We used time-lapse analysis to demonstrate defects in the motility of liprin-α1-depleted cells that include a striking instability of the lamellipodia. Liprin-α1 levels altered by either RNA interference or overexpression affected also cell spreading and the number of invadopodia per cell, but not the density of invadopodia per unit of surface area. On the other hand, silencing of liprin-α1 inhibited the degradation of the ECM, whereas its overexpression enhanced degradation, resulting in significant negative or positive effects, respectively, on the area of degradation per invadopodium. Transfection of fluorescent-labeled cortactin revealed that depletion of liprin-α1 also affected the assembly and disassembly of invadopodia, with decrease of their lifetime. Our results strongly support a novel important role of liprin-α1 in the regulation of human tumor cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2156392197,"Species are endowed with unique sensory capabilities that are encoded by divergent neural circuits. One potential explanation for how divergent circuits have evolved is that conserved extrinsic signals are differentially interpreted by developing neurons of different species to yield unique patterns of axonal connections. Although nerve growth factor (NGF) controls survival, maturation and axonal projections of nociceptors of different vertebrates, whether the NGF signal is differentially transduced in different species to yield unique features of nociceptor circuits is unclear. We identified a species-specific signaling module induced by NGF and mediated by a rapidly evolving Hox transcription factor, Hoxd1. NGF promoted robust expression of Hoxd1 in mice, but not chickens, both in vivo and in vitro. Mice lacking Hoxd1 displayed altered nociceptor circuitry that resembles that normally found in chicks. Conversely, ectopic expression of Hoxd1 in developing chick nociceptors promoted a pattern of axonal projections reminiscent of the mouse. Thus, conserved growth factors control divergent neuronal transcriptional events that mediate interspecies differences in neural circuits and the behaviors that they control."

We have previously demonstrated that extracellular Cl− inhibits ENaC activity. To identify sites involved in Cl− inhibition, we mutated residues in the extracellular domain of α-, β-, and γENaC that are homologous to the Cl− binding site in acid-sensing ion channel 1a and tested the effect of Cl− on the activity of ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We identified two Cl− inhibitory sites in ENaC. One is formed by residues in the thumb domain of αENaC and the palm domain of βENaC. Mutation of residues at this interface decreased Cl− inhibition and decreased Na+ self-inhibition. The second site is formed by residues at the interface of the thumb domain of βENaC and the palm domain of γENaC. Mutation of these residues also decreased Cl− inhibition yet had no effect on Na+ self-inhibition. In contrast, mutations in the thumb domain of γENaC and palm of αENaC had little or no effect on Cl− inhibition or Na+ self-inhibition. The data demonstrate that Cl− inhibits ENaC activity by two distinct Na+-dependent and Na+-independent mechanisms that correspond to the two functional Cl− inhibitory sites. Furthermore, based on the effects of mutagenesis on Cl− inhibition, the additive nature of mutations, and on differences in the mechanisms of Cl− inhibition, the data support a model in which ENaC subunits assemble in an αγβ orientation (listed clockwise when viewed from the top).

https://openalex.org/W1995773521,"In V1 of cats and monkeys, activity of neurons evoked by stimuli within the receptive field can be modulated by stimuli in the extra-receptive field (ERF). This modulating effect can be suppressive (S-ERF) or facilitatory (F-ERF) and plays different roles in visual information processing. Little is known about the cellular bases underlying the different types of ERF modulating effects. Here, we focus on the morphological differences between the S-ERF and F-ERF neurons. Single unit activities were recorded from V1 of the cat. The ERF properties of each neuron were assessed by area-response functions using sinusoidal grating stimuli. On completion of the functional tests, the cells were injected intracellularly with biocytin. The labeled cells were reconstructed and morphologically characterized in terms of the ERF modulation effects. We show that the vast majority of S-ERF neurons and F-ERF neurons are pyramidal cells and that the two types of cells clearly differ in the size of the soma, in complexity of dendrite branching, in spine size and density, and in the range of innervations of the axon collaterals. We propose that different pyramidal cell phenotypes reflect a high degree of specificity of neuronal connections associated with different types of spatial modulation."
