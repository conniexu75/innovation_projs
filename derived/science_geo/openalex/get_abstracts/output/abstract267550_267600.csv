https://openalex.org/W2039373641,"A hole was drilled through the Ross Ice Shelf 450 kilometers from the barrier. Scientific sampling through this hole revealed a sparse population of crustaceans, fish, and microbial biomass. The seabed consists of mid-Miocene glaciomarine mud. Geothermal heat flow is average. Oceanographic data indicate an active circulation and melting at the base of the ice."
https://openalex.org/W2049912348,"Fluorimetry, a powerful research tool in the study of biological macromolecules, has a number of valuable applications in investigations of synthetic polymers. These techniques reveal the microscopically heterogeneous distribution of species in polymer systems, which is specially pronounced in solutions of polyelectrolytes. They also allow us to study conformational mobility of flexible chains, diffusion-controlled intermolecular reactions of macromolecular reagents, glass transition phenomena, and polymer compatibility."
https://openalex.org/W2043067765,Glaciomarine sediments with middle Miocene microfaunal assemblages are exposed at the sea floor below the southern Ross Ice Shelf. Plio-Pleistocene sediments are not present. Post-Miocene glacial sediments may have been deposited but removed by relatively recent ice shelf grounding. A meager Recent microfauna is present in some core tops.

Crutzen and Veerabhadran Ramanathan chart some of the courses by which atmospheric sciences evolved from their beginnings, with curious scientists teasing apart the complexity of the air they breathe, into an ever more multidisciplinary enterprise that routinely generates globally consequential knowledge. The authors chronicle developments in chemistry and meteorology up to the early 1970s, before the possibility of human influence beyond the local scale became actualized. To illustrate how humanity's hand has grown to have global effects, they zero in on two contemporary issues: atmospheric ozone and global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2079974414,"Fossil diatoms and pollen from sea-floor sediments beneath the Ross Ice Shelf indicate that a permanent ice cover was not present in the Ross Sea and that vegetation including angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns existed on at least some parts of the largely glaciated Antarctic mainland in the late middle Miocene."
https://openalex.org/W1597888181,"The transition from the last ice age to the current warm period was interupted by a ~1000-year return to glacial conditions. Most of the evidence for this Younger Dryas (YD) event comes from in and around the North Atlantic, and the geographical extent of the event remains uncertain. In his Perspective, Rodbell reviews the evidence for and against a YD event in the Southern Hemisphere and highlights the study by Bennett et al., who have found no evidence for a YD event in four lake records from southern Chile."
https://openalex.org/W1591508206,"A few years' perspective on the 1997-98 El Niño and a toughening of standards has dropped model forecast performance from spectacular to encouraging; some critics don't even give the models a passing grade. According to an analysis published in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the sophisticated models did a poor job of predicting the 1997-98 El Niño's full course; in fact, they did no better than a rudimentary model that can run on a desktop. Others won't go that far but agree that the models' reputation needs to be taken down a notch or two."

In his Perspective, Grossman explains why the fall of the Tagish Lake meteorite on 18 January 2000 in British Columbia, Canada, was a lucky event for meteorite researchers. The first analysis of the meteorite is reported by Brown et al. Well-preserved organic matter in the meteorite provides a unique opportunity to study the nature and origin of organic matter that may have accreted on early Earth and played a role in the origin of life."

https://openalex.org/W2080868619,"The growing need for science and math teachers might be met in part by employing recent science Ph.D.s, as Jeffrey Mervis discusses in his News Focus article “How to produce better science and math teachers” (1 Sept., p. [1454][1]). This idea is being tested in Montgomery County, Maryland, public schools in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The partnership program has been structured to respond to key recommendations of the National Research Council, which include providing a compressed certification process and the ability of the Ph.D. participants to retain ties to research.

The program was launched at the beginning of this school year. Two postdocs are first-year science teachers while involved in an intense in-service training program that not only provides teacher certification, but also support and mentorship. NIH will provide summer employment so they can keep their research skills current. Also during this academic year, other postdocs who are interested in teaching science or math will be given time away from their NIH duties to shadow teachers and visit classrooms. Thus far, response to the program from recent Ph.D.s, the students, other teachers, and the school administrators has been positive. The number of post-docs inquiring about the program is increasing ([1][2]), and the program will be expanding.

Mervis presents a well-balanced view of the strengths and weaknesses of recruiting Ph.D.s to teach kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) math and science in U.S. classrooms. I've been working with K-12 teachers for nearly 20 years in programs supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other agencies, and there is one principle I have learned: Placing math or science specialists into the classroom without appropriate content level for the class or successful teaching and motivational strategies is a recipe for disaster.

What could the federal government do to make such a program to recruit Ph.D.-level scientists for teaching a success? Set up teacher training institutes at a national level, where those selected to train the prospective teachers would be drawn from the nation's best K-12 mentor teachers and award-winning science professors. National fellowships could be offered for postdocs, recent Ph.D.s, or any math/science specialists to learn how to teach, at what level to teach, and how to motivate students to learn science and math. Such fellowships should carry the full prestige of NSF or NIH (like postdoctoral fellowships or R01 research grants) and provide substantial stipends to show prospective teachers that the United States considers K-12 teaching as important as, if not more so than, research. After all, teachers can exponentially improve the nation's research efforts by training thousands of prospective scientists.

I am a secondary school chemistry and physics teacher with a graduate degree in physical chemistry, and Mervis's article appealed to me in a personal way. He reports that the National Research Council is suggesting a shift in the burden of continuing teacher education from the local school districts to university faculty, but the responsibility does not lie with either of these—it lies with the individual. All professionals, in this case teachers, have the personal responsibility to keep current in their disciplines by reading relevant journals, attending conferences or seminars each year, and networking with colleagues. The only assistance that a teacher really needs is the time and money to pursue the endeavors, and here the employer—not the local school district or university—should be the primary facilitator.

https://openalex.org/W1497075560,"Academic scientists are hoping that two new reports calling for increased funding of research and education and an improved climate for commercializing new technology will finally boost an R&D budget that has been stagnant since 1996. One report argues for a variety of measures to reduce the country's reliance on such low-tech commodities as agriculture and precious metals and stimulate innovation. The second report, based on an innovation summit held in February, recommends spending $1.4 billion over 5 years on research, facilities, and education."
https://openalex.org/W1526300264,"Without fanfare, 600 Russian scientists here at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory, are playing key roles in building the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a machine that will explore fundamental questions such as why particles have mass, as well as search for exotic new particles whose existence would confirm supersymmetry, a popular theory that aims to unify the four forces of nature. In fact, even though Russia is not one of CERN's 20 member states, most top high-energy physicists in Russia are working on the LHC. Some say their work could prove the salvation of high-energy physics back home."

In addition, it provides more than $100 million to help NSF tackle what policy-makers say is the real problem: the need for more homegrown scientists and engineers."

Faced with that grim statistic and a plea for leniency from Bulgaria's government, CERN's governing council is considering slashing the country's membership dues for the next 2 years."
