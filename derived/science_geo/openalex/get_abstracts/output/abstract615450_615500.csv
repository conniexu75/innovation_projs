https://openalex.org/W2884743521,"To identify genetic variation underlying atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, we performed a genome-wide association study of >1,000,000 people, including 60,620 atrial fibrillation cases and 970,216 controls. We identified 142 independent risk variants at 111 loci and prioritized 151 functional candidate genes likely to be involved in atrial fibrillation. Many of the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations have been reported to cause serious heart defects in humans (GATA4, MYH6, NKX2-5, PITX2, TBX5)1, or near genes important for striated muscle function and integrity (for example, CFL2, MYH7, PKP2, RBM20, SGCG, SSPN). Pathway and functional enrichment analyses also suggested that many of the putative atrial fibrillation genes act via cardiac structural remodeling, potentially in the form of an 'atrial cardiomyopathy'2, either during fetal heart development or as a response to stress in the adult heart."
https://openalex.org/W2884730312,"Abstract Maize is an important crop with a high level of genome diversity and heterosis. The genome sequence of a typical female line, B73, was previously released. Here, we report a de novo genome assembly of a corresponding male representative line, Mo17. More than 96.4% of the 2,183 Mb assembled genome can be accounted for by 362 scaffolds in ten pseudochromosomes with 38,620 annotated protein-coding genes. Comparative analysis revealed large gene-order and gene structural variations: approximately 10% of the annotated genes were mutually nonsyntenic, and more than 20% of the predicted genes had either large-effect mutations or large structural variations, which might cause considerable protein divergence between the two inbred lines. Our study provides a high-quality reference-genome sequence of an important maize germplasm, and the intraspecific gene order and gene structural variations identified should have implications for heterosis and genome evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2883756413,"The maize W22 inbred has served as a platform for maize genetics since the mid twentieth century. To streamline maize genome analyses, we have sequenced and de novo assembled a W22 reference genome using short-read sequencing technologies. We show that significant structural heterogeneity exists in comparison to the B73 reference genome at multiple scales, from transposon composition and copy number variation to single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The generation of this reference genome enables accurate placement of thousands of Mutator (Mu) and Dissociation (Ds) transposable element insertions for reverse and forward genetics studies. Annotation of the genome has been achieved using RNA-seq analysis, differential nuclease sensitivity profiling and bisulfite sequencing to map open reading frames, open chromatin sites and DNA methylation profiles, respectively. Collectively, the resources developed here integrate W22 as a community reference genome for functional genomics and provide a foundation for the maize pan-genome."
https://openalex.org/W2884838339,"RNAs directly regulate a vast array of cellular processes, emphasizing the need for robust approaches to fluorescently label and track RNAs in living cells. Here, we develop an RNA imaging platform using the cobalamin riboswitch as an RNA tag and a series of probes containing cobalamin as a fluorescence quencher. This highly modular 'Riboglow' platform leverages different colored fluorescent dyes, linkers and riboswitch RNA tags to elicit fluorescence turn-on upon binding RNA. We demonstrate the ability of two different Riboglow probes to track mRNA and small noncoding RNA in live mammalian cells. A side-by-side comparison revealed that Riboglow outperformed the dye-binding aptamer Broccoli and performed on par with the gold standard RNA imaging system, the MS2-fluorescent protein system, while featuring a much smaller RNA tag. Together, the versatility of the Riboglow platform and ability to track diverse RNAs suggest broad applicability for a variety of imaging approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2885373046,"Building on the notion that people respond to media as if they were real, switching off a robot which exhibits lifelike behavior implies an interesting situation. In an experimental lab study with a 2x2 between-subjects-design (N = 85), people were given the choice to switch off a robot with which they had just interacted. The style of the interaction was either social (mimicking human behavior) or functional (displaying machinelike behavior). Additionally, the robot either voiced an objection against being switched off or it remained silent. Results show that participants rather let the robot stay switched on when the robot objected. After the functional interaction, people evaluated the robot as less likeable, which in turn led to a reduced stress experience after the switching off situation. Furthermore, individuals hesitated longest when they had experienced a functional interaction in combination with an objecting robot. This unexpected result might be due to the fact that the impression people had formed based on the task-focused behavior of the robot conflicted with the emotional nature of the objection."

Such a protein-rich co-product is a promising alternative to unsustainably sourced fishmeal in aquaculture diets. We report the first evaluation of co-product of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata (N. oculata co-product) for replacing fishmeal in diets of Nile tilapia, a globally important aquaculture species. We conducted a nutrient digestibility experiment with N. oculata dried whole cells and N. oculata co-product, followed by an 84-day nutritional feeding experiment with N. oculata co-product. N. oculata co-product, more nutrient-dense than whole cells, had the highest digestibility for lysine, an essential amino acid that is often deficient in terrestrial crop meals; and for 20:5 n-3 EPA, making it a good option for EPA supplementation in tilapia feed. N. oculata co-product, despite containing higher amounts of protein than whole cells, had significantly lower digestibility for crude protein than whole cells. Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of methionine were significantly lower in N. oculata co-product than in whole cells. The nutritional feeding experiment compared diets with N. oculata co-product that replaced fishmeal as follows: 0% replacement in reference diet (fishmeal as 7% of total diet) and test diets with 33%, 66% and 100% replacement of fishmeal (3%, 5.5%, and 8% of total diet, respectively). Results showed the 33% replacement diet yielded fish growth, feed conversion, and survival similar to the reference diet. Reduced digestibility and growth at greater N. oculata co-product inclusion levels may have been due to higher levels of anti-nutrients in co-product than whole cells. All diets yielded a n3:n6 ratio of tilapia fillet that is favorable for human consumption. Depositions of macro minerals and several trace elements in the fillet were not significantly different across diets. Thus, N. oculata co-product, when replacing 33% of fishmeal in tilapia feed, led to fish performance and flesh composition comparable to that of fish fed the reference diet, but its nutrient digestibility needs to be improved to achieve higher replacement levels."

https://openalex.org/W2884157915,"Amyloids adopt ‘cross-β’ structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with β-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-α structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted β-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-α amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170 Å to 200 Å. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities. Structural analysis reveals how certain designed peptides adopt unusual spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures and also rearrange to helical polymers upon mutation of small nonpolar residues that are critical for packing and stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2886915292,"The Norwegian government has decided that the aquaculture industry shall grow, provided that the growth is environmentally sustainable. Sustainability is scored based on the mortality of wild salmonids caused by the parasitic salmon lice. Salmon lice infestation pressure has traditionally been monitored through catching wild sea trout and Arctic char using nets or traps or by trawling after Atlantic salmon postsmolts. However, due to that the Norwegian mainland coastline is nearly 25 000 km, complementary methods that may be used in order to give complete results are needed. We have therefore developed an operational salmon lice model, which calculates the infestation pressure all along the coast in near real-time based on a hydrodynamical ocean model and a salmon lice particle tracking model. The hydrodynamic model generally shows a negative temperature bias and a positive salinity bias compared to observations. The modeled salmon lice dispersion correlates with measured lice on wild salmonids caught using traps or nets. This allows for using two complementary data sources in order to determine the infestation pressure of lice originating from fish farms on wild salmonids, and thereby provide an improved monitoring system for assessing risk and sustainability which forms the basis for knowledge-based advice to management authorities."
https://openalex.org/W2887569338,"Considerable geographic variation exists in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease across the United States. While some of this variability can be explained by differences in patient-level risk factors, substantial variability still exists. We hypothesize this may be due to understudied environmental exposures such as air pollution.Using data on 1.1 million persons from the 2010 5% Medicare sample and Environmental Protection Agency air-quality measures, we examined the association between county-level particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and the prevalence of diagnosed CKD, based on claims. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate associations (prevalence ratios [PR]) between county PM2.5 concentration and individual-level diagnosis of CKD, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, and urban/rural status.Prevalence of diagnosed CKD ranged from 0% to 60% by county (median = 16%). As a continuous variable, PM2.5 concentration shows adjusted PR of diagnosed CKD = 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02-1.05; p<0.001) for an increase of 4 μg/m3 in PM2.5. Investigation by quartiles shows an elevated prevalence of diagnosed CKD for mean PM2.5 levels ≥14 μg/m3 (highest quartile: PR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.07), which is consistent with current ambient air quality standard of 12 μg/m3, but much lower than the level typically considered healthy for sensitive groups (~40 μg/m3).A positive association was observed between county-level PM2.5 concentration and diagnosed CKD. The reliance on CKD diagnostic codes likely identified associations with the most severe CKD cases. These results can be strengthened by exploring laboratory-based diagnosis of CKD, individual measures of exposure to multiple pollutants, and more control of confounding."
https://openalex.org/W2885597500,"Fusarium verticillioides, an important maize pathogen produces fumonisins and causes stalk and ear rot; thus, we are aimed to clarify its infection cycle by assessing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in stalk and ear rot strains. Maize seeds were inoculated with stable and strongly pathogenic transformants. To investigate the degree of infection, inoculated plants were observed under a stereo fluorescence microscope, and affected tissue strains were detected using PCR. We found that both transformants infected maize. Hyphae infected the plants from radical to the stem and extended to the ear and infected ear kernels caused a second infection. This process formed the infection cycle."

Herein, we induced an HIV-1-like intestinal dysbiosis in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with vancomycin treatment and assessed the contribution of dysbiosis to SIV disease progression. Dysbiotic and control animals had similar disease progression, indicating that intestinal microbial dysbiosis similar to that observed in individuals with HIV is not sufficient to accelerate untreated lentiviral disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2886011607,"Background Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is expressed by granulosa cells of developing follicles and plays an inhibiting role in the cyclic process of follicular recruitment by determining follicle-stimulating hormone threshold levels. Knowledge of AMH expression in the porcine ovary is important to understand the reproductive efficiency in female pigs. Research aim In the present study we investigated the expression of AMH during follicular development in prepubertal and adult female pigs by immunohistochemistry, laser capture micro-dissection and RT-qPCR. Results and conclusion Although in many aspects the immunohistochemical localization of AMH in the porcine ovary does not differ from other species, there are also some striking differences. As in most species, AMH appears for the first time during porcine follicular development in the fusiform granulosa cells of recruited primordial follicles and continues to be present in granulosa cells up to the antral stage. By the time follicles reach the pre-ovulatory stage, AMH staining intensity increases significantly, and both protein and gene expression is not restricted to granulosa cells; theca cells now also express AMH. AMH continues to be expressed after ovulation in the luteal cells of the corpus luteum, a phenomenon unique to the porcine ovary. The physiological function of AMH in the corpus luteum is at present not clear. One can speculate that it may contribute to the regulation of the cyclic recruitment of small antral follicles. By avoiding premature exhaustion of the ovarian follicular reserve, AMH may contribute to optimization of reproductive performance in female pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2886344052,"With the nationwide emphasis on improving outcomes for STEM undergraduates, it is important that we not only focus on modifying classroom instruction, but also provide students with the tools to maximize their independent learning time. There has been considerable work in laboratory settings examining two beneficial practices for enhancing learning: spacing and self-testing. In the current study, we examine biology students’ study practices, particularly in the context of these two behaviors. We specifically investigate whether a light-touch study skills intervention focused on encouraging spacing and self-testing practices impacted their utilization. Based on pre- and post-course surveys, we found that students report utilizing both beneficial and ineffective study practices and confirm that usage of spacing and self-testing correlates with a higher course grade. We also found that students in the section of the course which received the study skills intervention were more likely to report continued use or adoption of spacing and self-testing compared to students in control sections without the intervention. Surprisingly, we found that underrepresented minorities (URMs) under-utilize self-testing, and that our intervention helped to partially ameliorate this gap. Additionally, we found that URMs who reported self-testing earned similar course grades compared to non-URMs who also self-tested, but that there was a much larger drop in performance for URMs who did not self-test relative to non-URMs who also did not self-test. Overall, we would encourage instructors to dedicate class time towards discussing the merits of beneficial study practices, especially for students that have historically underperformed in STEM disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2886499422,"The availability of low-cost wildlife trackers increases the capacity to collect valuable ecological data when research budgets are limited. We converted a commercially available global positioning system (GPS) product into a low-cost tracking device that sends data via the mobile phone network, and assessed its performance under varying conditions. We established a stationary test, deploying devices along a continuum from open urban areas to topographically and structurally complex forested sites. We tested three features of the device: (a) the GPS, by measuring fix success rate, fix precision and horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), (b) remote download capacity via the mobile phone network and (c) battery drain. Measures of GPS performance demonstrated high fix success rates and precision. HDOP values were influenced by habitat type and topographical position, but generally remained very low, giving an acceptable degree of error for most applications in wildlife research. Devices experienced delayed data transmission at sites with less phone reception, and faster battery drain at sites with denser vegetation. We recorded device malfunctions in 8.2% of the 110 sampling locations, but these were not associated with habitat type or topography. Our device was effective under a wide range of conditions, and the development process we used provides guidance to other researchers aiming to develop cost-effective wildlife trackers. Reducing the financial and labour costs of acquiring high-quality movement data will improve the capacity to increase sample size in animal movement studies."
https://openalex.org/W2887808198,"Vaginal candidiasis is a common disorder in women of childbearing age, caused primarily by the dimorphic fungus Candida albicans. Since C. albicans is a normal commensal of the vaginal mucosa, a long-standing question is how the fungus switches from being a harmless commensal to a virulent pathogen. Work with human subjects and in mouse disease models suggests that host inflammatory processes drive the onset of symptomatic infection. Fungal cell wall molecules can induce inflammation through activation of epithelial and immune receptors that trigger pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but pathogenic fungi can evade recognition by masking these molecules. Knowledge about which cell wall epitopes are available for immune recognition during human infection could implicate specific ligands and receptors in the symptoms of vaginal candidiasis. To address this important gap, we directly probed the surface of fungi present in fresh vaginal samples obtained both from women with symptomatic Candida vaginitis and from women that are colonized but asymptomatic. We find that the pro-inflammatory cell wall polysaccharide β-glucan is largely masked from immune recognition, especially on yeast. It is only exposed on a small percentage of hyphal cells, where it tends to co-localize with enhanced levels of chitin. Enhanced β-glucan availability is only found in symptomatic patients with strong neutrophil infiltration, implicating neutrophils as a possible driver of these cell wall changes. This is especially interesting because neutrophils were recently shown to be necessary and sufficient to provoke enhanced β-glucan exposure in C. albicans, accompanied by elevated immune responses. Taken together, our data suggest that the architecture of C. albicans cell wall can be altered by environmental stress during vaginal candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2887859001,"Community genetics aims to understand the effects of intraspecific genetic variation on community composition and diversity, thereby connecting community ecology with evolutionary biology. Multiple studies have shown that different plant genotypes harbor different communities of associated organisms, such as insects. Yet, the mechanistic links that tie insect community composition to plant genetics are still not well understood. To shed light on these relationships, we explored variation in both plant traits (e.g., growth, phenology, defense) and herbivorous insect and ant communities on 328 replicated aspen (Populus tremuloides) genets grown in a common garden. We measured traits and visually surveyed insect communities annually in 2014 and 2015. We found that insect communities overall exhibited low heritability and were shaped primarily by relationships among key insects (i.e., aphids, ants, and free-feeders). Several tree traits affected insect communities and the presence/absence of species and functional groups. Of these traits, tree size and foliar phenology were the most important. Larger trees had denser (i.e., number of insects per unit tree size) and more diverse insect communities, while timing of bud break and bud set differentially influenced particular species and insect groups, especially leaf modifying insects. These findings will inform future research directed toward identification of plant genes and genetic regions that underlie the structure of associated insect communities."
https://openalex.org/W2886230335,"The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America."
https://openalex.org/W2886857694,"Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) have been bred to exude higher amounts or different types of the specialized plant metabolites, acylsugars, from type IV trichomes. Acylsugars are known to deter several herbivorous insect pests, including the western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande); however, all previous studies investigated the effect of acylsugars on leaves, or acylsugar extracts obtained from leaves. In spite of the WFT predilection for flowers, there is a gap in knowledge about flower defenses against thrips damage. This is especially important in light of their capacity to acquire and inoculate viruses in the genus Orthotospovirus, such as Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV), in flowers. Therefore, we turned our attention to assessing thrips oviposition differences on flowers of 14 entries, including 8 interspecific hybrids, 5 tomato lines bred for specific acylsugar-related characteristics (type IV trichome densities, acylsugar amount, sugar moiety and fatty acid profile), and a fresh market tomato hybrid, Mt. Spring, which only produces trace amounts of acylsugars. Our results show that the density of the acylsugar droplet bearing type IV trichomes is greatest on sepals, relative to other flower structures, and accordingly, WFT avoids oviposition on sepals in favor of trichome-sparse petals. In concordance with past studies, acylsugar amount was the most important acylsugar-related characteristic suppressing WFT oviposition. Certain acylsugar fatty acids, specifically i-C5, i-C9 and i-C11, were also significantly associated with changes in WFT oviposition. These results support continued breeding efforts to increase acylsugar amounts and explore modifications of fatty acid profile and their roles in deterring thrips oviposition. The finding that acylsugar production occurs and reduces thrips oviposition in tomato flowers will be important in efforts to use acylsugar-mediated resistance to reduce incidence of orthotospoviruses such as TSWV in tomato by deterring virus transmission and development of thrips vector populations in the crop."
https://openalex.org/W2886633971,"In addition to preventing insect metamorphosis, juvenile hormone (JH) is known to stimulate aspects of insect reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms of JH action in insect reproduction remain largely unknown. By reanalyzing the transcriptomic data from adults and other developmental stages of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, we identified a gene coding for Kazal-type protease inhibitor, previously named Greglin. Greglin is specifically expressed in adult females and most abundant in the fat body and ovaries. Interestingly, Greglin is among the top 3 of highly expressed genes in adult female locusts, after 2 vitellogenin (Vg) genes. Greglin is induced by JH and expressed at remarkably high levels in the vitellogenic stage. Knockdown of Greglin in adult female locusts results in accelerated degradation of serine protease substrate and significantly reduced levels of Greglin protein in hemolymph and ovaries. The consequent phenotypes include blocked oocyte maturation, arrested ovarian growth and shrunken follicular epithelium, as well as declines in egg number and hatchability. The data provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that JH-dependent Greglin is involved in locust vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation likely by protecting vitellogenesis and other forms of yolk precursors from proteolysis. The result offers new insights into the regulation of JH and function of protease inhibitors in insect vitellogenesis, oocyte maturation and fecundity.—Guo, W., Wu, Z., Yang, L., Cai, Z., Zhao, L., Zhou, S.

https://openalex.org/W2886285225,"Tissue repair is a highly dynamic process, and the immediate onset of acute inflammation has been considered necessary for repair. Pore-forming proteins are important, both in pathogen invasion and host immunity. However, their roles in wound healing and tissue repair are unclear. βγ-crystallin fused aerolysin-like protein (α-subunit) and trefoil factor (β-subunit) complex (βγ-CAT) is a complex of a bacterial pore-forming toxin aerolysin-like protein and trefoil factor identified in the frog Bombina maxima. In this study, we established mouse cutaneous wound models to explore the effects of βγ-CAT on skin wound healing. βγ-CAT accelerated the healing of full-thickness wounds by improving re-epithelialization. This complex relieved dermal edema and promoted scarless healing. βγ-CAT treatment resulted in a rapid release of IL-1β, which initiated an acute inflammation response in the early stage of healing. Meanwhile, the expression levels of TGF-β1, VEGF, and bFGF and the recruitment of M2 macrophages around the wound significantly increased after βγ-CAT treatment. βγ-CAT protected skin wounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by improving neutrophil recruitment at the site of the wound. Overall, our results suggest that βγ-CAT can promote tissue repair and protect skin wounds against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection by triggering the acute inflammatory response. This is the first example that aerolysin-like pore-forming proteins widely existing in plants and animals may act in wound healing and tissue repair.—Gao, Z.-H., Deng, C.-J., Xie, Y.-Y., Guo, X.-L., Wang, Q.-Q., Liu, L.-Z., Lee, W.-H., Li, S.-A., Zhang, Y., Pore-forming toxin-like protein complex expressed by frog promotes tissue repair.

https://openalex.org/W2885288652,"Several studies support an important role of angiogenesis in breast cancer growth and metastasis. The main objectives of the study were to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family ligands (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) in breast cancer and their associations with clinicopathological parameters, cancer subtypes/subgroups and patient outcome. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from early-stage breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy within a randomized trial. Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial 2.5 μm thick tissue sections from tissue microarray blocks. High VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 protein expression was observed in 11.8% (N = 87), 80.8% (N = 585), 28.1% (N = 202), 64.6% (N = 359) and 71.8% (N = 517) of the cases, respectively. Significant associations were observed among all proteins (all p-values <0.05), with the exception of the one between VEGF-C and VEGFR1 (chi-square test, p = 0.15). Tumors with high VEGF-A protein expression, as compared to tumors with low expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (33.3% vs. 20.8%, chi-square test, p = 0.009) and HER2-positive (44.8% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001). In addition, tumors with high VEGFR1 expression, were more frequently HER2-positive (32.8% vs. 19.6%, p<0.001), while tumors with high VEGFR3 expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (24.9% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.024) and HER2-positive (26.9% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.001). High VEGF-A and VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased DFS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92, Wald's p = 0.020 and HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.025, respectively), as well as in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as HER2-positive (VEGF-A, HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.008) and triple-negative (VEGF-C, HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p = 0.027) patients. High vs. low VEGFR1 expression was an unfavorable factor for DFS in triple-negative patients (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.26-5.98, p = 0.011), whereas the opposite was observed among the ER/PgR-positive patients (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, p = 0.041). Regarding OS, high VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased OS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89, Wald's p = 0.008), as well as in in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as ER/PgR-negative (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, p = 0.003) and triple-negative (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026) patients. In conclusion, high expression of angiogenesis-related proteins is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in early-stage breast cancer patients and may be surrogate markers of biologically distinct subgroups of ER/PgR-negative or triple-negative tumors with superior outcome. Further validation of our findings in independent cohorts is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2887334125,"Background In the growing population of the elderly, drug-related problems are considered an important health care safety issue. One aspect of this is the prescription of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) which is considered to increase health care costs. Objective Using data from the Health Economics of Potentially Inappropriate Medication (HEPIME) study, we aimed to analyze how the number of prescribed substances moderates the association of PIM use as defined by the German PRISCUS list and health care costs applying a longitudinal perspective. Methods An initial number of 6,849,622 insurants aged 65+ of a large German health insurance company were included in a retrospective matched cohort study. Based on longitudinal claims data from the four separate quarters of a 12-month pre-period, 3,860,842 individuals with no exposure to PIM in 2011 were matched to 508,212 exposed individuals. Exposure effects of PIM use on health care costs and the number of prescribed substances were measured based on longitudinal claims data from the four separate quarters of the 12-month post-period. Results After successful balancing for the development of numerous matching variables during the four quarters of the pre-period, exposed individuals consumed 2.1 additional prescribed substances and had higher total health care costs of 1,237 € when compared to non-exposed individuals in the 1st quarter of the post-period. Controlling for the number of prescribed substances, the difference in total health care costs between both study groups was 401 €. The average effect of one additionally prescribed substance (other than PIM) on total health care costs was increased by an amount of 137 € for those being exposed to a PIM. In quarters 2–4 of the post-period, the differences between both study groups tended to decrease sequentially. Conclusions PIM use has an increasing effect on the development of health care costs. This cost-increasing effect of PIM use is moderated by the number of prescribed substances."

Controlling reproduction of female horses presents a potential alternative. During 2009–2017, we determined the long-term effectiveness of GnRH vaccine (GonaCon-Equine) both as a single immunization and subsequent reimmunization on reproduction and side effects in free-ranging horses. At a scheduled management roundup in 2009, we randomly assigned 57 adult mares to either a GonaCon-Equine treatment group (n = 29) or a saline control group (n = 28). In a second roundup in 2013, we administered a booster vaccination to these same mares. We used annual ground observations to estimate foaling proportions, social behaviors, body condition, and injection site reactions. We found this vaccine to be safe for pregnant females and neonates, with no overt deleterious behavioral side effects during the breeding season. The proportion of treated mares that foaled following a single vaccination was lower than that for control mares for the second (P = 0.03) and third (P = 0.08) post-treatment foaling seasons but was similar (P = 0.67) to untreated mares for the fourth season, demonstrating reversibility of the primary vaccine treatment. After two vaccinations, however, the proportion of females giving birth was lower (P <0.001) than that for control mares for three consecutive years and ranged from 0.0–0.16. The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling at the vaccination site. Regardless of vaccine treatment (primary/secondary), approximately 62% (34/55) of immunized mares revealed a visible reaction at the vaccine injection site. However, none of these mares displayed any evidence of lameness, altered gait or abnormal range of movement throughout the 8 years they were observed in this study. Our research suggests that practical application of this vaccine in feral horses will require an initial inoculation that may provide only modest suppression of fertility followed by reimmunization that together could result in greater reduction in population growth rates over time."

In order to differentiate specific effects of the individual constituents on specific functions in the organism we advocate for controlled studies on specified constituents and their impact on the vertebrate organism. One of the dominating Cannabis constituents, delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has previously been studied in depth whereas information on another main ingredient cannabidiol (CBD) is limited. We have performed a controlled study on CBD and its effect using an experimental zebrafish model. CDB treatment of zebrafish for 30 min affected mobility of the fish by decreasing swimming speed and swimming distance. In addition, out of 23 immune related genes studied it was shown that expression of two genes il1b and il17a/f2 were up-regulated and four genes, tgfba, ighm, cd4-1, and s100a10b were significantly down-regulated following CBD treatment. The study indicated that CBD affects motility and immunity of the vertebrate host."
https://openalex.org/W2885056701,"Bullshit-sensitivity is the ability to distinguish pseudo-profound bullshit sentences (e.g. ""Your movement transforms universal observations"") from genuinely profound sentences (e.g. ""The person who never made a mistake never tried something new""). Although bullshit-sensitivity has been linked to other individual difference measures, it has not yet been shown to predict any actual behavior. We therefore conducted a survey study with over a thousand participants from a general sample of the Swedish population and assessed participants' bullshit-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven bullshit sentences) and profoundness-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven genuinely profound sentences), and used these variables to predict two types of prosocial behavior (self-reported donations and a decision to volunteer for charity). Despite bullshit-receptivity and profoundness-receptivity being positively correlated with each other, logistic regression analyses showed that profoundness-receptivity had a positive association whereas bullshit-receptivity had a negative association with both types of prosocial behavior. These relations held up for the most part when controlling for potentially intermediating factors such as cognitive ability, time spent completing the survey, sex, age, level of education, and religiosity. The results suggest that people who are better at distinguishing the pseudo-profound from the actually profound are more prosocial."
https://openalex.org/W2886507780,"Ocular images play an essential role in ophthalmology. Current research mainly focuses on computer-aided diagnosis using slit-lamp images, however few studies have been done to predict the progression of ophthalmic disease. Therefore exploring an effective approach of prediction can help to plan treatment strategies and to provide early warning for the patients. In this study, we present an end-to-end temporal sequence network (TempSeq-Net) to automatically predict the progression of ophthalmic disease, which includes employing convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract high-level features from consecutive slit-lamp images and applying long short term memory (LSTM) method to mine the temporal relationship of features. First, we comprehensively compare six potential combinations of CNNs and LSTM (or recurrent neural network) in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, to obtain the optimal TempSeq-Net model. Second, we analyze the impacts of sequence lengths on model’s performance which help to evaluate their stability and validity and to determine the appropriate range of sequence lengths. The quantitative results demonstrated that our proposed model offers exceptional performance with mean accuracy (92.22), sensitivity (88.55), specificity (94.31) and AUC (97.18). Moreover, the model achieves real-time prediction with only 27.6ms for single sequence, and simultaneously predicts sequence data with lengths of 3–5. Our study provides a promising strategy for the progression of ophthalmic disease, and has the potential to be applied in other medical fields."
https://openalex.org/W2885507217,"There is a need for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines to protect against chronic bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in a number of species. One of the main challenges for vaccine development is the lack of safe adjuvants that induce protective immune responses. Cationic Adjuvant Formulation 01 (CAF01)—an adjuvant based on trehalose dibehenate (TDB) and targeting the Mincle receptor—has entered human trials based on promising pre-clinical results in a number of species. However, in cattle CAF01 only induces weak systemic immune responses. In this study, we tested the ability of three pattern recognition receptors, either alone or in combination, to activate bovine monocytes and macrophages. We found that addition of the TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) to either one of the Mincle receptor agonists, TDB or monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG), enhanced monocyte activation, and calves vaccinated with CAF09 containing MMG and Poly(I:C) had increased cell-mediated and humoral immune response compared to CAF01 vaccinated animals. In contrast to the highly reactogenic Montanide ISA 61 VG, CAF09-primed T cells maintained a higher frequency of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells (IFN-γ+ TNF-α+ IL-2+). In conclusion, CAF09 supports the development of antibodies along with a high-quality cell-mediated immune response and is a promising alternative to oil-in-water adjuvant in cattle and other ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W2887827579,"The aim of the study was to determine whether the use of Mn nanoparticles would make it possible to reduce the level of this micronutrient added to turkey diets without adversely affecting growth performance, antioxidant and immune status, or apoptosis. The experiment was conducted on 6 groups of turkeys with 10 replications in a two-factor design with 3 dosages of manganese, 100, 50 and 10 mg/kg, and 2 sources, manganese oxide (MnO) and manganese nanoparticles (NP-Mn2O3). The study showed that irrespective of the form of Mn used, reducing the Mn level recommended by British United Turkeys for supplementation of the diet of young turkeys from 100 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg increases the content of this element in the blood with no adverse effect on growth performance or the immune system. The reduction in Mn supplementation in the form of NP-Mn2O3 from 100 to 50 and even to 10 mg/kg of turkey diet has no negative effect on antioxidant defence in young turkeys. A 50% reduction of the recommended Mn level in the form of MnO enhances lipid oxidation processes. Replacing MnO with NP-Mn2O3 in the turkey diet probably can increase apoptosis in young turkeys. On the other hand, irrespective of the form of Mn used, reducing supplementation of the turkey diet with this element from 100 to 50 and even to 10 mg/kg probably can reduce apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2885420489,"The rapidly developing economy and growing urbanization in China have created the largest rural-to-urban migration in human history. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of rural flight and its prevalence and magnitude over the country is increasingly important for sociological and political concerns. Because of the limited availability of internal migration data, which was derived previously from the decennial population census and small-scale household survey, we could not obtain timely and consistent observations for rural depopulation dynamics across the whole country. In this study, we use aggregate location-aware data collected from mobile location requests in the largest Chinese social media platform during the period of the 2016 Chinese New Year to conduct a nationwide estimate of rural depopulation in China (in terms of the grid cell-level prevalence and the magnitude) based on the world’s largest travel period. Our results suggest a widespread rural flight likely occurring in 60.2% (36.5%-81.0%, lower-upper estimate) of rural lands at the grid cell-level and covering ~1.55 (1.48–1.94) million villages and hamlets, most of China’s rural settlement sites. Moreover, we find clear regional variations in the magnitude and spatial extent of the estimated rural depopulation. These variations are likely connected to regional differences in the size of the source population, largely because of the nationwide prevalence of rural flight in today’s China. Our estimate can provide insights into related investigations of China’s rural depopulation and the potential of increasingly available crowd-sourced data for demographic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2887979157,"UC a form of IBD is a chronic inflammatory disorder of large intestine, with unknown etiology. Reports suggest a critical role of COX-2 dependent prostaglandins (PGs) mediated inflammatory pathway in pathophysiology of UC. However, COX inhibition using NSAIDs exacerbate IBD and thus is not a viable solution. Currently, in DSS induced experimental colitis in mice, we have demonstrated that dietary Se supplementation (0.5ppm as sodium selenite) symptomatically resolves the signs of inflammation in a redox sensitive manner as compared to Se deficient (0.01ppm) conditions, as seen by modulation in oxidative stress markers, morphological changes, histopathological examinations, biochemical studies such as MPO activity, activity of intestinal markers enzymes as well as mRNA and expressions of various pro and anti-inflammatory factors such as, mPGES, hPGDS, TXAS, 15-PGDH, GPX-1 and GPX-2. These findings were validated and correlated with changes in the biophysical parameters such as membrane fluidity, electrical parameters (impedance), transport across the colonic tissue and FTIR. Current study not only concluded that Se at supranutritional concentrations by modulating the redox status relieves the signs of colitis by regulating COX dependent PG biosynthetic pathway, but also sheds light on the biophysical characterization of these inflammatory/resolution pathways involved in UC."
https://openalex.org/W2886899199,"Previous psychophysiological research suggests that pain measurement needs to go beyond the assessment of Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness by adding the evaluation of Pain-Related Suffering. Based on this three-dimensional approach, we attempted to elucidate who is more likely to suffer by identifying reasons that may lead individuals to report Pain and Pain-Related Suffering more than others. A sample of 24 healthy participants (age range 18–33) underwent four different sessions involving the evaluation of experimentally induced phasic and tonic pain. We applied two decision tree models to identify variables (selected from psychological questionnaires regarding pain and descriptors from post-session interviews) that provided a qualitative characterization of the degrees of Pain Intensity, Unpleasantness and Suffering and assessed the respective impact of contextual influences. The overall classification accuracy of the decision trees was 75% for Intensity, 77% for Unpleasantness and 78% for Pain-Related Suffering. The reporting of suffering was predominantly associated with fear of pain and active cognitive coping strategies, pain intensity with bodily competence conveying strength and resistance and unpleasantness with the degree of fear of pain and catastrophizing. These results indicate that the appraisal of the three pain dimensions was largely determined by stable psychological constructs. They also suggest that individuals manifesting higher active coping strategies may suffer less despite enhanced pain and those who fear pain may suffer even under low pain. The second decision tree model revealed that suffering did not depend on pain alone, but that the complex rating-related decision making can be shifted by situational factors (context, emotional and cognitive). The impact of coping and fear of pain on individual Pain-Related Suffering may highlight the importance of improving cognitive coping strategies in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2885512449,"Nowadays, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data has become the standard method for quantifying the levels of gene expression. In RNA-seq experiments, the mapping of short reads to a reference genome or transcriptome is considered a crucial step that remains as one of the most time-consuming. With the steady development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, unprecedented amounts of genomic data introduce significant challenges in terms of storage, processing and downstream analysis. As cost and throughput continue to improve, there is a growing need for new software solutions that minimize the impact of increasing data volume on RNA read alignment. In this work we introduce HSRA, a Big Data tool that takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model to extend the multithreading capabilities of a state-of-the-art spliced read aligner for RNA-seq data (HISAT2) to distributed memory systems such as multi-core clusters or cloud platforms. HSRA has been built upon the Hadoop MapReduce framework and supports both single- and paired-end reads from FASTQ/FASTA datasets, providing output alignments in SAM format. The design of HSRA has been carefully optimized to avoid the main limitations and major causes of inefficiency found in previous Big Data mapping tools, which cannot fully exploit the raw performance of the underlying aligner. On a 16-node multi-core cluster, HSRA is on average 2.3 times faster than previous Hadoop-based tools.

https://openalex.org/W2886065763,"In studies on family therapy in Anorexia Nervosa, family relationships, as assessed by Expressed Emotion, have been associated with outcome. Our aim was to explore the contribution of Expressed Emotion as a predictor of 18-month outcome, above and beyond the usual predictive factors. Sixty adolescent girls suffering from Anorexia Nervosa and their parents were assessed at baseline and 18 months later. Levels of Expressed Emotion were evaluated in both parents with the Five-Minute Speech Sample. After controlling for treatment group and initial clinical status, high maternal Emotional Over-Involvement at baseline was significantly associated with better clinical state. More precisely, high maternal Emotional Over-Involvement was associated with higher nutritional status, lower eating disorder severity and fewer re-hospitalizations 18 months later. No associations were found with paternal levels of Expressed Emotion. Therefore, our study confirmed the importance of taking into account both maternal and paternal Expressed Emotion. Our results also underlined that high maternal Emotional Over-Involvement plays a positive role in the outcome of Anorexia Nervosa and needs to be explored further."
https://openalex.org/W2885511714,"Carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an exopeptidase involved in proneuropeptide processing, is also a neurotrophic factor, named neurotrophic factor-α1 (NF-α1) and has important roles in neuroprotection, stem cell differentiation, and neurite outgrowth, independent of enzymatic activity. Additionally, an N-terminal–truncated CPE/NF-α1 variant, (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN, proposed from bioinformatic analysis of GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, USA) DNA sequences and encoding a 40-kDa protein, has been found to be exclusively expressed in embryonic neurons. To investigate the function of (CPEZNF-α1)-ΔN in neurodevelopment, we first cloned (CPEZNF-α1)-ΔN transcripts from an embryonic mouse brain. A rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay, DNA sequencing, and Northern blot revealed 1.9- and 1.73-kb transcripts, which encoded 47- and 40-kDa (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN proteins, respectively. Those proteins were expressed in embryonic mouse brain. Expression of the 2 (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN mRNAs surged at embryonic d 10.5, correlating with the time of neurogenesis in the developing brain and also at postnatal d 1. HT22 cells, a mouse hippocampal cell line, transduced with 40 kDa (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN up-regulated expression of genes involved in embryonic neurodevelopment: insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), death-associated protein 1, and ephrin A1, which regulate proliferation, programmed cell death, and neuronal migration, respectively. HT22 cells and embryonic cortical neurons overexpressing 40 kDa (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN exhibited enhanced proliferation, which was inhibited by IGFBP2 short interfering RNA treatment. Thus, 40 kDa (CPE/NF-α1)-ΔN has an important, enzymatically independent role in the regulation of genes critical for neurodevelopment.—Xiao, L., Yang, X., Sharma, V. K., Loh, Y. P.

https://openalex.org/W2885968213,"To meet the growing demand of fish feed for aquaculture, an increasing proportion of marine ingredients are being replaced by blends of plant products. However, the total replacement of marine ingredients in salmonid diets impairs fish performance. This is particularly true during the early fry stage and this stage is therefore considered of particular importance. In rainbow trout (RBT), the existence of a genetic variability to survive and grow with plant-based diets devoid of marine ingredients has now been proved, but the mechanisms behind are little studied especially at early stage. To investigate these, we analysed the whole transcriptome of three isogenic lines of RBT fry, which have similar growth when fed a marine resources-based diet (M diet) but which highly differ in their responses to a plant-based diet (V diet). Analysis of transcriptomes profiles revealed 1740, 1834 and 246 probes differentially expressed among the three genotypes when fed the V diet. The use of these lines led to the discovery of potential molecular markers linked to plant-based diet utilisation, some of them belonging to new pathways, never described before. An important number of genes was related to immunity, but further investigations are needed to better understand the difference between the genotypes in their immune status response to V diet exposure. Finally, differences in expression of genes related to feed intake and sensory perception among genotypes suggested that the mechanisms underlying the differences in growth on plant-based diet are closely linked to diet acceptance. Research on plants components affecting feed intake should be thus further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2886730775,"Spacecrafts need to maneuver their solar panels towards the sun and antennas towards the ground station for maximum solar power harvesting and communication with the ground station. For tracking purpose, usually magnetorquer rods, reaction wheels and permanent magnets are used, but they are heavier, expensive, and occupy extra space on the spacecraft. Keeping in mind the dimension, budget and mass constraints of small satellites, a system compatible with small satellite is worth consideration. Consequently, this paper focuses on designing and analyzing a solar panel module with embedded Air-Coil. Such an Air-Coil is an innovative idea for the replacement of heavier, bulky and expensive attitude control systems. The proposed Air-Coil is integrated in the internal layers of an eight layers solar panel PCB module. Complete degradation analyses of the solar panel have been done to ensure that it will meet the satellite power requirements at BOL (beginning of life) and EOL (end of life). The proposed embedded Air-Coil has been analyzed for the generated magnetic moment, resultant torque, power consumption and temperature increase of the complete solar panel unit. A steady state thermal model is proposed to measure the thermal resistance between top and bottom layers of the solar panel module, which gives an idea about the heat trapped inside the solar panel module. The designed embedded Air-Coil is fully reconfigurable where coil in each layer can be operated as a separate coil. The four coils in different layers can be attached or detached through switches in different configurations i.e. single coil, four in series, four in parallel, and their hybrid combinations. The analyses of power consumption, heat dissipation, temperature rise, magnetic moment and torque generation by different configurations of the designed Air-Coil have been performed. The generated magnetic moment is very high i.e. around 12Am2, which is enough to rotate a microsatellite by 90° in 200s. The efficacy of the proposed module is significantly higher than the already available systems with respect to mass, price, power dissipation, heat generation, and dimension."

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted with 384 adults (20 to 59 years old) from the city of Alegre, Southeastern Brazil. The simple random sample represented the population using the public health system of the municipality. The prevalence of obesity was based on the Body Mass Index, and central adiposity (dependent variable) was measured by waist circumference in centimeters. The independent variables were the following indicators of psychosocial stress: food and nutrition insecurity (yes/no), serum cortisol (μg/dL), symptoms suggestive of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory-II ≥ 17 (yes/no), and altered blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg (yes/no). Univariate linear regression was performed between central adiposity and each stress indicator, and later the models were adjusted for socioeconomic, health, and lifestyle variables. All analyses were made separately by rural and urban location. Results The prevalence of weight excess, by the classification of the Body Mass Index ≥ 25.0 kg/m2, was 68.3% and, by waist circumference, 71.5% of individuals presented an increased risk for metabolic complications related to central adiposity. Mean waist circumference scores for the rural and urban population were 89.3 ± 12.7 cm and 92.9 ± 14.7 cm, respectively (p = 0.012). Indicators of stress that were associated with central adiposity were: cortisol in the rural population (β = -0.60; 95% CI = -1.09;-0.11) and altered blood pressure in the urban population (β = 6.66; 95% CI = 2.14;11.18). This occurred both in the raw analysis and in the models adjusted for confounding factors. Conclusion Central adiposity was inversely associated with cortisol in the rural population and directly associated with higher arterial blood pressure in the urban population, suggesting a local influence on how individuals react to stress."

Insulin like growth factor-I and its receptor expression was evaluated in liver tissue by immunofluorescence and qPCR.The expression of insulin like growth factor-I and its receptor were significantly related to fibrosis and were higher in children with stage 3 fibrosis compared to stage 1 and 2 (p<0.001 and p = 0.007 respectively). mRNA of insulin like growth factor-I receptor was higher in more advanced stages of fibrosis (p<0.001). Furthermore, the expression of insulin like growth factor-I and its receptor in hepatic stellate cells, the cell type mostly involved in fibrosis progression, was significantly increased in stage 3 fibrosis compared to stage 1 (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008 respectively).We demonstrated for the first time that insulin like growth factor-I and its receptor are upregulated in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These findings give a new hint for the potential therapeutic use of insulin like growth factor-I in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease complicated by liver fibrosis."

We examined infecting HIV genotypes and their association with disease progression in a cohort of men who have sex with men with incident HIV infection in Bangkok, Thailand.We characterized the viral genotype of 189 new HIV infections among MSM identified between 2006-2014 using hybridization and sequencing. Plasma viral load (PVL) was determined by PCR, and CD4+ T-cell counts were measured by flow cytometry. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to examine factors associated with changes in CD4+ T-cell counts. Factors associated with immunologic failure were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models.Among 189 MSM, 84% were infected with CRF01_AE, 11% with recombinant B/CRF01_AE and 5% with subtype B. CD4+ T-cell decline rates were 68, 65, and 46 cells/μL/year for CRF01_AE, recombinants, and subtype B, respectively, and were not significantly different between HIV subtypes. CD4+ T-cell decline rate was significantly associated with baseline PVL and CD4+ T-cell counts (p <0.001). Progression to immunologic failure was associated with baseline CD4+ T-cell ≤ 500 cells/μL (AHR 1.97; 95% CI 1.14-3.40, p = 0.015) and PVL > 50,000 copies/ml (AHR 2.03; 1.14-3.63, p = 0.017). There was no difference in time to immunologic failure between HIV subtypes.Among HIV-infected Thai MSM, low baseline CD4+ T-cell and high PVL are associated with rapid progression. In this cohort, no significant difference in CD4+ T-cell decline rate or time to immunologic failure was seen between CRF01_AE and other infecting HIV subtypes."

The islands of Wan-an and Lanyu support two important green turtle nesting populations in Taiwan and are separated by 250 km. Nesting activity was first documented on Wan-an Island in 1992, with 8 nesting females being documented. A further 11 nesting females were first documented on Lanyu Island in 1997. However, by 2015, the Wan-an Island population declined to only 2 nesting females, whereas the Lanyu Island population showed peaks in abundance (up to 24 nesters) every 3–5 years with no long-term decline. Additionally, the recruitment of new nesters to the Wan-an Island population decreased to 15%, whereas recruitment into the Lanyu Island population remained high (66%). The decrease of the nesting population on Wan-an Island might be due to illegal poaching on the high seas along the migratory corridor of the turtles, whereas the stable nesting population on Lanyu Island showed no evidence of such a threat. The two nesting populations use different migratory corridors to their foraging grounds, resulting in different fates of development in population trend."
https://openalex.org/W2886763760,"The magnitude of connectedness among management units (e.g., flocks and herds) gives a reliable estimate of genetic evaluation across these units. Traditionally, pedigree-based methods have been used to evaluate the genetic connectedness in China. However, these methods have not been able to yield a substantial outcome due to the lack of accuracy and integrity of pedigree data. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain genetic connectedness using genomic information (i.e., genome-based genetic connectedness). Moreover, the effects of various levels of genome-based genetic connectedness on the accuracy of genomic prediction still remain poorly understood. A simulation study was performed to evaluate the genome-based genetic connectedness across herds by applying prediction error variance of difference (PEVD), coefficient of determination (CD) and prediction error correlation (r). Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) were predicted using a GBLUP model from a single and joint reference population. Overall, a continued increase in CD and r with a corresponding decrease in PEVD was observed as the number of common sires varies from 0 to 19 regardless of heritability levels, indicating increasing genetic connectedness between herds. Higher heritability tends to obtain stronger genetic connectedness. Compared to pedigree information, genomic relatedness inferred from genomic information increased the estimates of genetic connectedness across herds. Genomic prediction using the joint versus single reference population increased the accuracy of genomic prediction by 25% and lower heritability benefited more. Moreover, the largest benefits were observed as the number of common sires equals 0, and the gain of accuracy decreased as the number of common sires increased. We confirmed that genome-based genetic connectedness enhanced the estimates of genetic connectedness across management units. Additionally, using the combined reference population substantially increased accuracy of genomic prediction. However, care should be taken when combining reference data for closely related populations, which may give less reliable prediction results."

The following criteria had to be met during lower esophageal sphincter examination using the attached ST Hood short-type for positive corona appearance: A) congestion inside the hood, B) ischemic change around the hood, and C) palisade vessels outside the hood. Results Corona appearance had the highest sensitivity (91%; κ-value, 0.71). Other findings in descending order of sensitivity included 1) functional stenosis of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ; 86%; κ-value, 0.58), 2) mucosal thickening and whitish change (71%; κ-value, 0.27), 3) abnormal contraction of the esophageal body (59%; κ-value, 0.32), 4) dilation of the esophageal lumen (58%; κ-value, 0.53), 5) liquid remnant (57%; κ-value, 0.51), 6) Wrapping around EGJ (49%; κ-value, 0.14), and 7) food remnant (30%; κ-value, 0.88). Even in 22 patients with poor (grade 1) intraluminal expansion, corona appearance had highest sensitivity (88%) compared to other endoscopic findings (κ-value, 0.63). Conclusions Among endoscopic findings using a ST Hood short-type to diagnose esophageal achalasia, corona appearance had the highest sensitivity and its consistency (κ-value) among endoscopists was substantial compared to other endoscopic findings. Similar results were obtained for esophageal achalasia cases with poor expansion. Endoscopic diagnosis of esophageal achalasia with hood attached is useful."

Past studies on the effect of homogeneity of efficacy have exclusively manipulated group composition in their experimental designs, which might have imposed a limit on ecological validity because group membership may not be easily changed in reality. In this study, we maintained the same group composition but varied the subgroup composition. We developed a public good dilemmas paradigm in which participants were assigned to one of the four conditions (high- vs. low-efficacy; homogeneous vs. heterogeneous subgroup) to produce their endowments and then to decide how much to contribute. We found that individuals in homogeneous and heterogeneous subgroups produced a similar amount and proportion of contribution, which was due to the two mediating effects that counteracted each other, namely (a) perceived efficacy relative to subgroup and (b) expectation of contribution of other subgroup members. This paper demonstrates both the pros and cons of arranging people into homogeneous and heterogeneous subgroups of efficacy."

The growth, proliferation and differentiation of Drosophila wings are regulated by several conserved signaling pathways. Here, we show that the Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) and Notch pathways converge on an enhancer in the expanded (ex) gene, which also responds to levels of the bHLH transcription factor Daughterless (Da). Separate cis-regulatory elements respond to Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) and Notch pathways, to bHLH proteins, and to unidentified factors that repress ex transcription in the wing pouch and in the proneural region at the anterior wing margin. Senseless, a zinc-finger transcription factor acting in proneural regions, had a negative impact on ex transcription in the proneural region, but the transcriptional repressor Hairy had no effect. Our study suggests that a complex pattern of ex transcription results from integration of a uniform SWH signal with multiple other inputs, rather than from a pattern of SWH signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2887757137,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most important causes of blindness globally and may lead to decreased quality of life. Utility values for AMD patients according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics have been little-studied, particularly among Asian populations.A total of 1,283 AMD patients were identified from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2012. A 45-degree digital retinal image for each eye was used to identify AMD patients. The utility values, calculated by the three level version of EuroQol-5D, of AMD patients according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were determined. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify factors associated with reduced utility values among AMD patients.The mean utility value for AMD patients was 0.8765. Patients who were older (mean utility value 0.8339), were women (0.8488), had lower education levels (0.8287), were not employed (0.8467), and had lower household income (0.8022) had lower utility values (all p values <0.001). Utility values did not significantly differ according to AMD subtype (p value 0.729), likely due to the lack of enough power as only 48 patients had late AMD. Patients with lower best-eye visual acuity (BEVA) had lower utility values compared to those with high BEVA, even among those with high worst-eye visual acuity (WEVA) (p value <0.001).Sociodemographic factors and visual acuity are important factors in determining the quality of life among AMD patients. Preserving BEVA, regardless of WEVA, may be associated with improved quality of life."
