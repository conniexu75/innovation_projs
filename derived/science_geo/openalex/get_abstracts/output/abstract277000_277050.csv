https://openalex.org/W2066003148,"The pressure in experiments with the diamond-window pressure cell exceeded 1.7 megabars (at 25Â°C). This is the highest sustained pressure ever generated under static conditions where the pressure in the sample itself was measured. At 1.72 megabars, macroscopic flow of one of the diamond pressure faces was observed."

Removal rates of fruits were consistently faster in the forest edge and light gap sites than in sites under closed canopy. Rapid removal of fruits from species that ripen fruit in summer and early fall is selectively advantageous to the plants because it minimizes the probability that fruits will be destroyed by invertebrates before dispersal. Disturbances probably play an important role in interactions between temperate fruits and birds and in community organization."
https://openalex.org/W1977899402,"Noncalling adult male tree frogs were found in close association with about 16 percent of the calling males in a pond in Georgia. In 13 of 30 field experiments a noncalling satellite male intercepted and achieved amplexus with a gravid female moving toward the calling male. This mating strategy, which conserves energy required for calling, resembles the strategy employed by other vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2059490276,Heavy charged particle beams can be widely used for cancer therapy if control in heterogeneous tissue is proved practical. A beam of protons at 200 million electron volts has been visualized in plastic and in a living animal by using an on-line positron camera. The fraction of the activity retained in the radiation site was found to be at least 70 percent of that produced in a dead animal. The sensitivity of the technique was established for a typical geometry.

Digestive tracts examined in toto with the scanning electron microscope were devoid of microorganisms. In contrast, the outer exoskeleton surfaces of these crustaceans support a dense bacterialflora. Observations of the hindgut of termites revealed a diverse gut microflora as expected."
https://openalex.org/W2000111156,"Chytrid-like fungal sporangia are described occurring in saccate pollen grains of Pennsylvanian age. Both endo- and epibiotic sporangia are present, and may exhibit discharge papillae and a coarse rhizomycelium. Sporangial features, choice of substrate, and the presence of a light refractile body in presumed zoospores suggest relationships with the Chytridiales."
https://openalex.org/W2082698123,"Weddellite (calcium oxalate dihydrate) and calcite (anhydrous calcium carbonate phase) are components of concretions in the renal sac of the ascidian tunicate Molgula manhattensis. The presence of weddellite along with urate in the concretions suggests a resemblance to human kidney stones, although, unlike the latter, the concretions in Molgula do not seem to be pathologic deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2036664127,"The U.S. Geological Survey recently completed an intensive river quality assessment study of the Willamette River basin, Oregon. The most noteworthy finding was that across-the-board advanced waste treatment was not the answer to the problem of meeting stringent water quality standards established for the Willamette River. This implies that rigid nationwide standards and regulations are likely to result in unneeded expenditures in some river basins and in unachieved standards in others. It was also found that existing water quality data collected under monitoring- and surveillance-type programs are inadequate for defining the critical cause-effect relationships that control river quality problems. Intensive, synoptic surveys keyed to local problems and conditions are required to provide an adequate information base for making key management decisions."
