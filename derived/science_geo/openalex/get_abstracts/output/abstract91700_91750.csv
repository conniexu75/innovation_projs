https://openalex.org/W2061579546,"Recombinant E. coli that produce light were found in a clone library of hybrid plasmids containing DNA from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. All luminescent clones had a 16 kb insert that encoded enzymatic activities for the light reaction as well as regulatory functions necessary for expression of the luminescence phenotype (Lux). Mutants generated by transposons Tn5 and mini-Mu were used to define Lux functions and to determine the genetic organization of the lux region. Regulatory and enzymatic functions were assigned to regions of two lux operons. With transcriptional fusions between the lacZ gene or transposon mini-Mu and the target gene, expression of lux operons could be measured in the absence of light production. The direction of transcription of lux operons was deduced from the orientation of mini-Mu insertions in the fusion plasmids. Induction of transcription of one lux operon required a function encoded by that operon (autoregulation). From these and other regulatory relationships, we propose a model for genetic control of light production."
https://openalex.org/W2091374932,"Tritiated acetylcholine was used to measure binding sites with characteristics of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in rat brain. Regulation of the binding sites in vivo was examined by administering two drugs that stimulate nicotinic receptors directly or indirectly. After 10 days of exposure to the cholinesterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate, binding of tritiated acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex was decreased. However, after repeated administration of nicotine for 10 days, binding of tritiated acetylcholine in the cortex was increased. Saturation analysis of tritiated acetylcholine binding in the cortices of rats treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate or nicotine indicated that the number of binding sites decreased and increased, respectively, while the affinity of the sites was unaltered."
https://openalex.org/W2086238626,"The morphological basis of the persistent synaptic plasticity that underlies long-term habituation and sensitization of the gill withdrawal reflex in Aplysia californica was explored by examining the fine structure of sensory neuron presynaptic terminals (the critical site of plasticity for the short-term forms of both types of learning) in control animals and in animals whose behavior had been modified by training. The number, size, and vesicle complement of sensory neuron active zones were larger in animals showing long-term sensitization than in control animals and smaller in animals showing long-term habituation. These changes are likely to represent an anatomical substrate for the memory consolidation of these tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2020072455,"To identify and characterize the intracellular site from which the penetration of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to the cytosolic compartment of the host cell occurs, we determined the time course and temperature dependence of nucleocapsid uncoating and infection in BHK-21 cells. At 37 degrees C the genome release to the cytosol was detected within 5-7 min after virus endocytosis, whereas delivery of the virus particles to secondary lysosomes occurred within 15-20 min. At temperatures of 15 degrees -20 degrees C virus particles were internalized by endocytosis, but they were not delivered to the secondary lysosomes. Nevertheless, at 20 degrees C nucleocapsid uncoating and infection occurred, indicating that secondary lysosomes are not required for SFV penetration. We conclude that the penetration reaction occurs in prelysosomal endocytic vacuoles (endosomes). As SFV penetration by membrane fusion requires a pH less than 6 and the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane, the data indicate that endosomes are acidic and contain cholesterol."

In 11 mouse tumors there was a correlation observed between chemotactic activity and macrophage content of neoplastic tissues. Tumor-derived chemoattractants appear to participate in the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages.
https://openalex.org/W2088988435,"Linkage analysis in families with apparent autosomal dominant reading disability produced a lod score of 3.241. Since the traditionally accepted significance level for linkage is a lod score of 3.0, these results strongly suggest that a gene playing a major etiologic role in one form of reading disability is on chromosome 15."
https://openalex.org/W2056493048,"Intragastric administration of a liposomal surfactant suspension markedly reduced acid-induced gastric ulcerogenesis and bleeding in rats. The concentration of surface-active molecules intrinsically present in the gastric mucosa was increased two to six times by administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. Thus, local accumulation of surface-active phospholipids may be an integral component of the cytoprotective mechanism activated by prostaglandin treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2042489699,The amount of early cell loss in five neocortical areas was inversely related to adult numbers of neurons in those areas. Differential cell death predicted particularly the thickness of the upper cortical laminae; it was not related to neuron numbers in the lower laminae. Cell loss thus determines some features of local neocortical differentiation.
https://openalex.org/W2048252930,"Using an in vitro eye-cup preparation, we have evaluated a potential relationship between methoxyindole metabolism and photoreceptor disk shedding. Melatonin, 6-chloromelatonin, and 5-methoxytryptophol all activate rod disk shedding in culture. The effect is compound specific since serotonin and N-acetylserotonin are without effect, and it is similar to shedding in vivo because it is evoked by light and is quantitatively comparable to a normal intact animal response. The results suggest the involvement of 5-methoxyindoles in the control of rhythmic photoreceptor metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2053290347,A mathematical model of electrophoretic separation processes has been developed and adapted for computer simulations. The model is used to predict the characteristic behavior of a variety of electrophoretic techniques from a knowledge of chemical equilibria and physical transport phenomena. The model provides a unifying basis for a rational classification of all electrophoretic processes.
https://openalex.org/W2056978939,"Quantitative electron microscopic analysis reveals 2.85 million retinal axons in fetal rhesus monkeys--a number that is more than twice the 1.2 million present in the adult. More than 1 million supernumerary optic axons are eliminated before birth, simultaneously with the segregation of inputs from the two eyes into separate layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Selective elimination of optic axons may not only play a role in the segregation of binocular visual connections but, secondarily, may establish the ratio of crossed and uncrossed retinogeniculate projections."

https://openalex.org/W2033693803,"The major urinary proteins (MUPs) of the mouse are encoded by a multigene family located at the Mup a locus on chromosome 4. Previous investigations have shown that the MUPs are synthesized in the liver, secreted and then excreted in the urine. We have found significant levels of MUP mRNA in several secretory tissues: the liver and the submaxillary, lachrymal and mammary glands. There are striking differences in hormonal and developmental regulation of MUP gene expression in these tissues. Furthermore, each tissue appears to express a characteristic pattern of MUP mRNAs. In particular, the lachrymal glands appear to express an entirely different set of MUP mRNAs. These results are discussed in relation to the organization of the MUP gene cluster and a possible function of the MUPs."

This result suggests that intermodal speech perception is facilitated by rightward orientation of attention and subserved by the left hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W1981604659,"Cultured bronchial epithelial and fibroblastic cells from humans were used to study DNA damage and toxicity caused by formaldehyde. Formaldehyde caused the formation of cross-links between DNA and proteins, caused single-strand breaks in DNA, and inhibited the resealing of single-strand breaks produced by ionizing radiation. Formaldehyde also inhibited the unscheduled DNA synthesis that occurs after exposure of cells to ultraviolet irradiation or to benzo[a]pyrene diolexpoxide but at doses substantially higher than those required to inhibit the resealing of x-ray-induced single-strand breaks. Therefore, formaldehyde could exert its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects by both damaging DNA and inhibiting DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2087258417,"Studies were conducted to assess whether basal ganglia output neurons originating in the substantia nigra pars reticulata might be affected by dopamine released from dendrites of neighboring substantia nigra pars compacta neurons. Dopamine applied by iontophoresis increased the baseline firing rates of approximately half of the substantia nigra pars reticulata cells tested. The more significant finding, unrelated to the increase in firing, was the ability of dopamine to attenuate the inhibitory responses of these cells to iontophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid. These findings suggest a role for dopamine as a neuromodulator and further suggest that it can act at sites beyond the striatum to modify transmission from the basal ganglia to motor nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2122412561,"We have determined that a protein of the fodrin-spectrin-TW260/240 (FST) family is a component of the thin fibrils (approximately 5 nm wide, 100-200 nm long) that cross-link bundles of actin filaments to adjacent actin bundles and to the plasma membrane in the terminal web of the brush border of the intestinal epithelium. When isolated brush borders were incubated with anti-fodrin antibodies and prepared for electron microscopy by the quick-freeze, deep-etch technique, these approximately 5 nm fibrils were specifically decorated with the antibody. In addition, these cross-linking fibrils disappeared when the anti-fodrin-reactive proteins were extracted from the brush border. We conclude that FST is a component of a cross-linking system composed of approximately 5 nm fibrils that are morphologically distinct from the approximately 8 nm myosin-containing fibrils which were identified by anti-myosin decoration. In addition to linking actin bundles to adjacent actin bundles and to the plasma membrane, these FST fibrils may mediate actin-vesicle, actin-intermediate filament and vesicle-plasma membrane linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2123141909,Information is represented in long-term memory as a network of associations among concepts. Information is retrieved by spreading activation from concepts in working memory through the network structure. The time required to retrieve information is a function of the level of activation that it achieves. Fanning of multiple paths from a node dissipates the activation the node sends down any path and increases retrieval time. Fan effects are reduced as subjects overlearn the material or when they can change their task from a recognition judgment to a consistency judgment.
https://openalex.org/W2075077190,Extracellular single-unit recording techniques were used to test the ability of proglumide to block cholecystokinin-induced excitation of rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons and dopamine-sensitive prefrontal cortex cells. Intravenous and iontophoretic proglumide administration consistently blocked cholecystokinin-induced excitations while having no effect on glutamic acid-induced increases in activity. This selective blockade of central cholecystokinin effects by proglumide suggests that this drug may be valuable for studying the possible role of cholecystokinin as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1993380666,"Dynamic spatial patterns of correlation of electrical potentials recorded from the human brain were shown in diagrams generated by mathematical pattern recognition. The patterns for ""move"" and ""no-move"" variants of a brief visuospatial task were compared. In the interval spanning the P300 peak of the evoked potential, higher correlations of the right parietal electrode with occipital and central electrodes distinguished the no-move task from the move task. In the next interval, spanning the readiness potential in the move task, higher correlations of the left central electrode with occipital and frontal electrodes characterized the move task. These results conform to neuropsychological expectations of localized processing and their temporal sequence. The rapid change in the side and site of localized processes may account for conflicting reports of lateralization in studies which lacked adequate spatial and temporal resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2001783180,"Microinfusions of rat prolactin into the dorsal midbrain of estrogen-treated, ovariectomized rats increased lordosis behavior. Midbrain microinfusions of antiserum to prolactin into rats displaying maximum lordosis had the opposite effect. The distribution of a prolactin-like substance in the brain was studied immunocytochemically. The results suggest that a hypothalamic neuronal system projecting to the midbrain contains a prolactin-like substance that plays a role in facilitating this behavior and therefore may mediate some of the effects of estrogen on the brain. These data, together with others from studies of the prolactin gene and its regulation, indicate that it may be possible to analyze a sequence of molecular events in the brain that facilitate a behavioral response."
https://openalex.org/W1981238000,"The thickness of intact human red cell membrane is measured by a light-microscope technique in which membrane material with a known surface area is extracted into a long, thin cylindrical strand. The radius of the strand is calculated from its known length and surface area. The minimum radius, obtained at high extraction velocities or large membrane tensions, is 55 angstroms. A collapsed membrane cylinder with a mean-mass radius of 55 angstroms would have a membrane thickness of 78 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W2006297513,"The torque generated by the flagellar motor of Streptococcus strain V4051 has been determined from rates of rotation of cells tethered by a single flagellum in media of different isotopic composition and temperature. Starved cells were energized artificially with either a potassium diffusion potential or a pH gradient. The torque increased linearly with protonmotive force. Identical results were obtained in media made with D2O or H2O; there was no solvent isotope effect. At a fixed protonmotive force, the torque was approximately constant over a temperature range of 4 degrees -38 degrees C. In cells chemotactically inert to changes in cytoplasmic pH, the motor turned counterclockwise when protons moved inward and clockwise when they moved outward. We conclude that the motor is a reversible engine driven by simple acid-base dissociation. A detailed model is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2113894174,"We have isolated the four separate segments of chicken DNA which contain sequence homology to beta tubulin. With the exception of a fifth region of DNA which appears to contain only a 5' fragment of a beta gene, these four cloned sequences represent all of the beta tubulin encoding DNA in the chicken. Each gene is very similar in structure, containing three or four small intervening sequences clustered in the 5' portion of the coding region. Using RNAs prepared from a variety of cell lines and tissues, we have found five different mRNAs which carry beta tubulin sequences, two of which are encoded by the same gene. Three of these mRNAs are unexpectedly long (between 3500 and 4000 bases). However, these large mRNAs do give authentic beta tubulin translation products. Overall, we conclude that each of the four beta tubulin genes is a functional gene which is expressed in a specific program during differentiation. These data strongly suggest that four beta tubulins are necessary for proper microtubule function in vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2077606371,"Immunohistochemical techniques were used to confirm biochemical evidence that parenchymal cells isolated from adult rat liver and maintained in nonreplicating monolayer culture for 2 days synthesized type IV basement membrane collagen. On continued incubation in serum-free medium, the hepatocytes also synthesized the interstitial collagens, types I and III. Consistent with these results in culture, type IV collagen was localized to the hepatocytes in slices of pathologic rat liver. Hence collagen formation is a previously unrecognized function of the hepatocyte that may be important in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis."

Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy is sensitive to conformational changes in both the protein and the retinylidene chromophore of rhodopsin. By blocking rhodopsin bleaching at specific intermediates, it is possible to elucidate some of the primary molecular events of vision."
https://openalex.org/W2055298219,Cells synthesize a characteristic set of proteins--heat shock proteins--in response to a rapid temperature jump or certain other stress treatments. The technique of phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to examine in vivo the effects of temperature jump on two species of Tetrahymena that initiate the heat shock response at different temperatures. An immediate 50 percent decrease in cellular adenosine triphosphate was observed when either species was jumped to a temperature that strongly induces synthesis of heat shock proteins. This new adenosine triphosphate concentration was maintained at the heat shock temperature.
https://openalex.org/W1487666625,"The effects of manganese on DNA synthesis fidelity are measured using T4 DNA polymerase. When the nucleotide analogue 2-aminopurine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate competes against dATP at thymine sites on template DNA, the aminopurine misincorporation frequency increases from 6.3% in the presence of Mg2+ to 29.2% in the presence of Mn2+. The major cause of the increased error rate is an approximate 4-fold increase in the frequency of aminopurine misinsertions. Exonucleolytic proofreading of aminopurine is similar in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+. However, the excision frequency of the correct nucleotide, dAMP, is increased 2-fold with Mn2+. In experiments in which insertion and incorporation velocities of aminopurine and adenine are measured independently of each other, a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the Michaelis constant for aminopurine is observed in the presence of Mn2+ compared to a 2-fold decrease in the Km for adenine. In contrast to the marked differential reduction in the ratio of aminopurine to adenine Km values, the maximum insertion velocities of both nucleotides are reduced by similar amounts (40-fold). We suggest that the mutagenic action of Mn2+ can be attributed primarily to a significant differential increase in binding of mispaired relative to correctly paired nucleotides to the polymerase-template complex. The resulting increase in the ratio of residence times for mispaired compared with correctly paired nucleotides on the complex results in their increased frequency of misinsertion. A smaller contributing factor to Mn2+-induced mutagenesis is a loss of proofreading specificity. We propose that the losses in both the specificities of nucleotide insertion and excision (proofreading) share a common molecular origin in which nucleotides are bound in the presence of Mn2+ in distorted configurations at the polymerase insertion and excision active sites resulting in increased nonspecific enzyme-substrate binding forces at the expense of template-substrate base pair specific hydrogen bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1969470120,The rotational mobility of myoglobin in situ was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance line width measurements of a characteristic myoglobin resonance observed in bovine heart muscle spectra. The protein diffuses intracellularly at nearly half the rate observed in dilute solution. This high mobility allows the oxygenated form of myoglobin to contribute significantly to the overall diffusive flux of oxygen in respiring heart muscle.
https://openalex.org/W2067302063,"The tissue culture condition that is required for the type of chromosome breakage seen at most fragile sites, namely, the absence of folic acid and thymidine in the medium, greatly enhanced micronucleus formation in proliferating lymphocyte cultures from normal individuals. This suggests that chromosome breakage at fragile sites and the apparently spontaneous damage that gives rise to micronuclei are controlled by the same mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1969024288,Sister chromatid exchange rates increased significantly in the peripheral lymphocytes of a small group of hospital workers exposed to ethylene oxide for as little as 3.6 minutes per day regularly over a period of months. Results based on breathing zone exposure and task frequency estimates over a 6-month period for 14 workers suggest that sister chromatid exchanges are a sensitive indicator of exposure and that cumulative dose and dose rate are important predictors of sister chromatid exchange response.
https://openalex.org/W1997070380,"Flow cytometry revealed that, in the presence of tritiated thymidine, a greater percentage of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from old human donors were arrested in the G2 or M phase than were cells from young donors. Furthermore, lymphocytes from old donors showed significantly more chromosomal damage than did lymphocytes from young donors. Lymphocyte cultures from old or young donors not exposed to tritiated thymidine had the same percentage of cycling lymphocytes in G2 or M, although the number of lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin to enter the cell cycle was significantly lower in cultures from old donors. Thus, the impaired incorporation of tritiated thymidine by phytohemagglutinin-exposed lymphocytes from old humans reflects both an impaired proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin and an increased sensitivity to the radiobiological effects of tritiated thymidine."
https://openalex.org/W1996611309,"By means of a two-stage promotion protocol in mouse epidermis with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate as first-stage promoter and 12-O-retinoylphorbol-13-acetate as second-stage promoter, the effects of the former that are critical and obligatory for tumor promotion were shown to be irreversible in nature for at least 8 weeks. The reversibility of tumor promotion was related to the second stage of promotion, reflecting the reversibility of epidermal hyperplasia induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate."

Although the highest exposures were found in the extreme southwest part of Utah, as expected, the residents of the populous northern valleys around Provo, Salt Lake City, and Ogden received a higher mean dose and a significantly greater population dose (person-rads) than did the residents of most counties closer to the test site. However, population doses from external exposure throughout Utah were far too low to result in any statistically observable health effects."

https://openalex.org/W1969677406,Tension transients were recorded in a single smooth muscle cell. The transient contains a linear elastic response and a biphasic recovery that appear to originate from the cross-bridges. A comparison of transients in smooth and fast skeletal muscle fibers suggests that the cross-bridge in smooth muscle is more compliant than the cross-bridge in striated muscle and that transitions between several cross-bridge states occur more slowly in smooth muscle than in striated muscle.

https://openalex.org/W1510974900,"The cooperativity with respect to substrates exhibited by allosteric enzymes as well as their inhibition and activation by effectors is mediated through the propagation of conformational changes from the site of ligand binding on one polypeptide chain to other, unliganded chains. This communication between subunits in the enzyme is achieved in part by changes at the intersubunit bonding domains as the oligomeric enzymes are converted from the low affinity state to a conformation of high affinity. Structural alterations at the bonding domains between the catalytic and regulatory subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli were detected in derivatives containing either nickel or cobalt in place of the endogenous zinc ion bound to each of the six regulatory chains. These metal-substituted derivatives exhibited physical-chemical and allosteric properties identical to those of the native enzyme. Spectral analyses indicated that both nickel and cobalt are bound to the enzyme in a distorted tetrahedral environment. With the nickel ions serving as spectral probes for structural alterations at the intersubunit bonding domains, it was observed that the substrate, carbamoyl phosphate, and the bisubstrate ligand, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate caused different changes. The substrate analog, succinate, alone had no effect. However, the combination of both carbamoyl phosphate and succinate produced the same spectral change as that caused by the bisubstrate analog. Circular dichroism measurements on the nickel derivative showed that the perturbation at 360 nm was directly proportional to the extent of occupancy of the six active sites by the bisubstrate ligand. In contrast, the changes at 406 and 460 nm coincided with the gross conformational change measured by the decrease in the sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme. These latter changes in the circular dichroism and the alterations in the absorption spectrum were complete even though about one-third of the active sites were unliganded."

Saline solutions with initial pH values ranging from 5.5 to 10.0 were all acidified to pH 5.0 by tapeworms. If the initial pH was lower than 5.0, it was raised. Because trypsin activity is inhibited at pH 5.0, this intestinal parasite can protect itself from digestion by regulating its environmental pH or releasing trypsin inhibitors, or both."
