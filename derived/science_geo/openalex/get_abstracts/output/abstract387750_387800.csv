https://openalex.org/W2044803049,"IF trace elements in plant material are to be estimated polarographically, a digest free from organic substances must first be prepared. Piper1 has reported that appreciable losses occur during ashing, owing to the volatility of inorganic components and adsorption to the surface of the ashing vessel. Digestion with mineral acids and oxidizing agents on the other hand gives solutions of high total ionic concentration, and the polarograms, as shown by Reed and Cummings2, are often vague. As in many colorimetric estimations, therefore, it is necessary to isolate elements from the digest before they can be estimated accurately. If several elements can be isolated simultaneously, there is the possibility of estimating them in a single polarogram."

https://openalex.org/W1982468099,"THREE naturally occurring aldohexoses—glucose, mannose and galactose—can readily be differentiated by the following method. Add 2 mgm. of the unknown sugar material to a solution of pyrocatechol at a concentration of 0.2 per cent in 85 per cent phosphoric acid syrup. Heat for 15 min. in a boiling water bath, shaking vigorously at the end of the first minute of heating to effect solution of the sugar. In these conditions, glucose produces a lilac colour, mannose produces a brown colour and galactose produces a red colour intermediate in quality between the colours afforded by glucose and mannose. The test is applicable equally to free and polymerized aldohexose. Amino-acids (apart from tryptophane) and gelatine do not produce colour in these conditions, and do not interfere even in large amount with this test."

https://openalex.org/W2032641610,"Anesthesia, by ether, is effective in the treatment of western equine encephalomyelitis in mice. Of mice treated with deep ether anesthesia soon after the intracerebral injection of western equine virus, only 58 per cent developed the disease as compared with 92.4 per cent of control animals. When anesthesia was delayed the approximate length of the incubation period, 60 per cent of the animals developed the disease as compared with 92.4 per cent of the controls. In addition, ether anesthesia delays the development of central nervous system symptoms not only when administered soon after the injection of the virus but also when administered after the disease has progressed far enough to cause objective signs of encephalitis."

https://openalex.org/W2069113727,"J. F. MENKE1 obtained lipid extracts from human breast cancer which, when injected into white mice, induced, in seven of thirty-six animals so treated, the development of sarcomas at the site of injection. In our experiments analogous extracts were prepared from various human cancers. Two extracts were prepared from gastric carcinoma, three extracts from breast carcinoma, and two extracts from fibrosarcoma. Each of the extracts was tested separately."
https://openalex.org/W2070515955,"REACTIONS of organic halides in solution which involve substitution by a nucleophilic reagent at a saturated carbon atom have been extensively studied by Hughes, Ingold and co-workers1. These authors conclude that reactions of this type may occur by two possible mechanisms, a unimolecular mechanism or a bimolecular mechanism . The increase in the unimolecular reaction-rate of the halide R – X as R varies along the series methyl, ethyl, sec.-propyl, tert.butyl, is attributed by these authors to the increase in electron accession to the reaction centre2. The decrease in the bimolecular reaction-rate along this series3 is also attributed to the increase in electron accession to the reaction centre ; this electron accession is assumed to inhibit the approach of the nucleophilic reagent."

https://openalex.org/W2987099789,"IN his article on the “Establishment of Cytochemical Techniques”1, Dr. J. F. Danielli directly or by inference questions the validity of very nearly the whole of cytochemistry. While there is no doubt that many workers have used cytochemical methods without fully considering the evidence for their validity, we feel that Dr. Danielli has gone to the opposite extreme."
https://openalex.org/W1964522952,"IN the estimation of vitamin C in plant materials by titration with 2:6 dichlorophenolindophenol, it has hitherto been generally assumed that the dye titration value is sufficiently independent of the titration pH to make it unnecessary to control the latter at all precisely. The usual procedure of preparing extracts with metaphosphoric or trichloracetic acid solutions to inhibit the action of ascorbic acid oxidase results in a pH which may range from 0.8 to 1.5, or even higher, according to the experimental conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2042816853,"IT has been shown by Fricke and others1,2 that the dielectric constant of gelatin-water systems may rise to abnormally large values as the water content is increased to about 50 per cent, with a consequent increase in the dielectric dispersion. They suggest that these phenomena may be either due to rotation of dipole ion groups present in gelatin which have been loosened by the sorbed water, or alternatively to the outer layers of less firmly bound water, in excess of the monolayer, which by concerted rotation exhibit ‘ferro-electric’ properties."
https://openalex.org/W2048123671,"WE have shown in earlier publications1,2 that ascorbic acid and cysteine prevent the oxidation of bilirubin in alkaline medium. The effect of both substances was ascribed hypothetically to their anti-oxygen properties. The mechanism of action of the anti-oxygen agents had not been elucidated. On the other hand, the protective action of ascorbic acid and cysteine for bilirubin might equally be explained as a reducing one. If such a view is valid, one would expect oxidized bilirubin to be promptly reduced in alkaline solution, when vitamin C or cysteine is added."

https://openalex.org/W1996332511,"DR. GRIFFIN has recently published1 some further observations on the cries of bats, which are of great interest. He demonstrates clearly that the pulse of sound is often extremely short, having a duration which usually does not exceed 2.3 milliseconds. He also finds that the frequency of the supersonic tone alters during the pulse, having a frequency, for example, of 80 kc. at the beginning, dropping to less than 50 kc. at the end. This drop of somewhat less than an octave seems to be typical. The records which Dr. Griffin has obtained are very convincing on both these points."

https://openalex.org/W2089536880,"THE salving or smearing of sheep in autumn was part of the normal routine on sheep-farms in Scotland during the latter half of the eighteenth century. For reasons of cost and the labour involved, this practice fell into disuse about 1860, except in the County of Sutherland, and was regarded as of merely historical interest by 1900. Although it is customary to regard this old practice as being devoid of any rational basis, such an assumption is incorrect, since it was generally recognized that, as well as receiving increased protection from adverse weather, salved sheep yielded heavier fleeces of washed wool than sheep whose fleeces had not been ‘laid’, when the animals were herded under comparable conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4253770975,"THE University and Research Section of the Library Association has now formulated proposals regarding the post-war development of the university and research libraries of Great Britain. These proposals overlap in some respects the recommendations of the Council of the Association made in consequence of Mr. L. R. McColvin's report on “The Public Library System of Great Britain”, but also deal with a group of libraries, some of which come within the scope of the former proposals and almost all of which are of special interest to the man of science. Reviewing the place of the university and research libraries in a national system, and considering in succession the national and the local organisation of book resources for research, the new report* will be carefully studied by all who recognize the importance of scientific and technical books as tools for industrial research, apart altogether from the wider field which they present for research in the arts, the humanities and the social sciences. Its recommendations, which have already been adopted by the Council of the Association, are in substantial agreement with the recommendations of the earlier report where they overlap, and they represent developments which the Council considers are needed to enable the university and research libraries of Great Britain to carry out their work efficiently and to make their full contribution to the national life."
