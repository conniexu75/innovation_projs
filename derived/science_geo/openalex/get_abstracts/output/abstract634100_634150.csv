https://openalex.org/W2953033490,"Cellular adaptations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to high-volume resistance training are not well-characterized. Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320–1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training."

https://openalex.org/W2948037662,"Purpose To use optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to study longitudinal subclinical choroidal neovascularization (CNV) changes and their correlation with progression to exudation in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods This study included a total of 34 patients with unilateral neovascular AMD who were evaluated prospectively using OCTA to detect subclinical CNV in their fellow eye. Eyes with baseline subclinical CNV were followed with serial OCTA for a minimum of one year (15.2±3.27 months) to monitor the development of exudation. Results Of the 34 fellow eyes studied, five were found to have baseline subclinical CNV. One of the five cases of baseline subclinical CNV converted to exudative AMD during the follow up period. The average surface area of baseline subclinical CNV on OCTA was 0.131±0.096 mm2 which progressed to 0.136±0.104 mm2 at the final follow up (P = 0.539). Geographic atrophy grew at a rate of 0.82±1.20mm2/year in four eyes without subclinical CNV and 0.02mm2/year in one eye with subclinical CNV. Conclusion and importance The rate of conversion to exudative AMD in eyes with subclinical CNV of 20% in our study is similar to previous reports and suggests the importance of vigilance in these eyes. The lower growth rate of geographic atrophy may suggest a protective effect of subclinical CNV that deserves further study."
https://openalex.org/W2948743353,"Accurate species delimitation is crucial for studies of phylogeny, phylogeography, ecology, conservation and biogeography. The limits of species and genera in the Characidae family are controversial due to its uncertain phylogenetic relationships, high level of morphological homoplasy and the use of ambiguous morphological characters for descriptions. Here we establish species boundaries for Bryconamericus, Hemibrycon, Knodus and Eretmobrycon (Stevardiinae: Characidae), previously diagnosed with morphology, using three different barcoding approaches (GMYC, PTP, ABGD). Results revealed that species delimitation was successful by the use of a single-gene approach and by following a workflow in the context of integrative taxonomy, making evident problems and mistakes in the cataloging of Characidae species. Hence, it was possible to infer boundaries at genus level for clusters in the trees (GMYC and PTP) and automatic partitions (ABGD) which were consistent with some of recent taxonomic changes proposed in Characidae. We found that discordance cases between methods were linked to limitations of the methods and associated to putative species cluster closely related, some historically problematic in their diagnosis and identification. Furthermore, we suggested taxonomic changes and possibly new species, revealing a high degree of hidden diversity. Finally, we propose a workflow as a fast, accurate and objective way to delimit species from mitochondrial DNA sequences and to help clarify the classification of this group."
https://openalex.org/W2948201471,"The nursing process system (NPS) is used to establish the nursing process involving assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation in solving the health problems of patients.The factors influencing the use of the NPS by nurses were analyzed based on user satisfaction and technology acceptance within the 3Q (service quality, information quality, and system quality) model.In this cross-sectional quantitative study, the valid responses of 222 nurses to a questionnaire were obtained; these nurses worked at eight hospitals affiliated with public organizations in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze information quality, system quality, service quality, user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, behavioral attitude, and intention after the nurses had used the NPS system for more than 1 month.Information quality, service quality, and system quality influenced user satisfaction. User satisfaction affected perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment and had the highest explanatory power (R2 = 0.75). Furthermore, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment influenced behavioral attitude and intention to use the system. The proposed model explained 53% of the variance in the intention to use the NPS.The relationships between the variables of the 3Q model were successfully used to examine the intention of nurses toward using the NPS. Using the findings of this study, designers and programmers can comprehensively understand the perceptions of nurses and further improve the performance of the NPS."
https://openalex.org/W2948290002,"Objective To study the role of miRNA-181a and augmenter of liver regeneration in TGF-β-induced fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells. Methods LX2 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. miRNA-181a, ALR plasmid and empty vectors were transfected using siPORT NeoFx reagent. Cells were harvested after 48 h or 72 h of transfection for protein or RNA analysis. Western blotting was performed for ALR, TGF-β receptor II (TGFβ-RII), collagen 1A1 (COLL1A1), alpha-smooth muscle cell actin (α-SMA), rac1, E-cadherin and β-actin. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed for ALR, GAPDH, miRNA-181a or 5S rRNA. Results TGF-β induced the expression of miRNA-181a, which in turn down-regulated ALR thereby induced the fibrosis markers, such as COLL1A1, α-SMA and rac1 in hepatic stellate cells. Over-expression of miRNA-181a down-regulated expression of ALR and up-regulated expression of fibrosis markers. On the other hand, ALR over-expression resulted in a decrease in miRNA-181a expression and fibrosis markers. Over-expression of ALR also inhibited the expression of TGFβ-RII and increased expression E-cadherin. Conclusion TGF-β induced miRNA-181a, which in turn induced fibrosis, at least in part, by inhibiting ALR. ALR inhibited TGF-β action by decreasing the expression of TGFβ-RII, thereby inhibiting miRNA-181a expression and fibrosis markers. ALR could serve as a potential molecule to inhibit liver fibrosis."

However, the exact function linking the magnitude of discomfort to interpersonal distance has not yet been specified. In this study, we explore whether interpersonal distance and discomfort are isotropic with respect to uncomfortably far or close distances. We also extend previous findings with regard to intrusions into personal space as well as maintenance of distances outside of personal space. We presented subjects with 15 interpersonal distances ranging from 40 to 250 cm and obtained verbal and joystick-based ratings of discomfort. Whereas discomfort rose immediately when personal space was entered, the gradient was less steep for distances that exceeded the comfort region of personal space. Thus, personal space is anisotropic with regard to experienced discomfort."
https://openalex.org/W2948725513,"Extremity and soft tissue injuries contribute significantly to inflammation and adverse in-hospital outcomes for trauma survivors; accordingly, we examined the complex association between clinical outcomes inflammatory responses in this setting using in silico tools. Two stringently propensity-matched, moderately/severely injured (Injury Severity Score > 16) patient sub-cohorts of ~30 patients each were derived retrospectively from a cohort of 472 blunt trauma survivors and segregated based on their degree of extremity injury severity (above or below 3 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale). Serial blood samples were analyzed for 31 plasma inflammatory mediators. In addition to standard statistical analyses, Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to model systemic inflammation following trauma. Patients in the severe extremity injury sub-cohort experienced longer intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), total LOS, and days on a mechanical ventilator, with higher Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) Scores over the first 7 days post-injury as compared to the mild/moderate extremity injury sub-cohort. The higher severity cohort had statistically significant elevated lactate, base deficit, and creatine phosphokinase on first blood draw, along with significant changes in multiple circulating inflammatory mediators. DyNA pointed to a sustained role for type 17 immunity in both sub-cohorts, along with IFN-γ in the severe extremity injury group. DyNA network complexity increased over 7 days post-injury in the severe injury group, while generally decreasing over this same time period in the mild/moderate injury group. PCA suggested a more robust activation of multiple pathways in the severe extremity injury group as compared to the mild/moderate injury group. These studies thus point to the possibility of self-sustaining inflammation following severe extremity injury vs. resolving inflammation following less severe extremity injury."
https://openalex.org/W2948355034,"Wound healing, especially for diabetic wounds, is a lengthy and complicated process involving interactions and responses at the protein, cell, and tissue levels. Loading of growth factors into a hydrogel to construct a sustained-release system is considered a promising approach to improve wound healing. The present study investigates the effect of thermosensitive heparin-poloxamer (HP) hydrogel-encapsulated recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 21 (rhFGF21) on wound healing in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. First, we studied the in vitro release of rhFGF21 from the rhFGF21-HP coacervate. The results showed that HP might control the release of rhFGF21. Next, we examined the effect of rhFGF21-HP on skin wound healing in diabetic mice. Our data showed that rhFGF21-HP significantly improved wound closure; promoted granulation, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization; and enhanced the expression of CD31. Moreover, rhFGF21-HP had obvious advantages in diabetic wound healing. Therefore, the results suggest that the rhFGF21-HP hydrogel polymer plays an important role in skin wound healing. This work provides a suitable sustained-release delivery system that can continuously release rhFGF21 and presents a promising therapeutic strategy for wound healing in patients with diabetes.-Liu, H., Zhao, Y., Zou, Y., Huang, W., Zhu, L., Liu, F., Wang, D., Guo, K., Hu, J., Chen, J., Ye, L., Li, X., Lin, L.

https://openalex.org/W2948586918,"Pueraria thomsonii Benth is an important medicinal plant. Transcriptome sequencing, unigene assembly, the annotation of transcripts and the study of gene expression profiles play vital roles in gene function research. However, the full-length transcriptome of P. thomsonii remains unknown. Here, we obtained 44,339 nonredundant transcripts of P. thomsonii by using the PacBio RS II Isoform and Illumina sequencing platforms, of which 43,195 were annotated genes. Compared with the expression levels in the plant roots, those of transcripts with a |fold change| ≥ 4 and FDR < 0.01 in the leaves or stems were assigned as differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). In total, we found 9,225 DETs, 32 of which came from structural genes that were potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. The expression profiles of 8 structural genes from the RNA-Seq data were validated by qRT-PCR. We identified 437 transcription factors (TFs) that were positively or negatively correlated with at least 1 of the structural genes involved in isoflavone biosynthesis using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) (r > 0.8 or r < -0.8). We also identified a total of 32 microRNAs (miRNAs), which targeted 805 transcripts. These miRNAs caused enriched function in ‘ATP binding’, ‘defense response’, ‘ADP binding’, and ‘signal transduction’. Interestingly, MIR156a potentially promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing SBP, and MIR319 promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing TCP and HB-HD-ZIP. Finally, we identified 2,690 alternative splicing events, including that of the structural genes of trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and pullulanase, which are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavone and starch, respectively, and of three TFs potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. Together, these results provide us with comprehensive insight into the gene expression and regulation of P. thomsonii."
https://openalex.org/W2948625709,"Introduction A large proportion of children with uncomplicated malaria receive appropriate treatment late, contributing to progression of illness to severe disease. We explored contexts of caregiver delays in seeking appropriate care for children with severe malaria. Methods This qualitative study was conducted at the Children’s Ward of Jinja Hospital, where children with severe malaria were hospitalized. A total of 22in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of children hospitalized with severe malaria. Issues explored were formulated based on the Partners for Applied Social Sciences (PASS) model, focusing on facilitators and barriersto caregivers’promptseeking and accessing ofappropriate care. The data were coded deductively using ATLAS.ti (version 7.5). Codes were then grouped into families based on emerging themes. Results Caregivers’ rating of initial symptoms as mild illness lead to delays in response. Use of home initiated interventions with presumably ineffective herbs or medicines was common, leading to further delay. When care was sought outside the home, drug shops were preferred over public health facilities for reasons of convenience. Drug shops often provided sub-optimal care, and thus contributed to delays in access to appropriate care. Public facilities were often a last resort when illness was perceived to be progressing to severe disease. Further delays occurred at health facilities due to inadequate referral systems. Conclusion Communities living in endemic areas need to be sensitized about the significance of fever, even if mild, as an indicator of malaria. Additionally, amidst ongoing efforts at bringing antimalarial treatment services closer to communities, the value of drug shops as providers ofrationalantimalarialtreatment needs to be reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2948816523,"Efforts to reverse the decline of endangered golden lion tamarin monkeys have been relatively successful because the Brazilian organization dedicated to the species’ conservation (Associação Mico-Leão-Dourado, AMLD) relies on science-based computer modeling to determine the number of tamarins necessary to achieve demographic and genetic goals, and a process of strategic planning to achieve those goals. Accurate estimates of the numbers of tamarins in forest fragments are essential to evaluate progress in achieving goals and adapt strategies as necessary. In this report we present the results of a new method to survey the number of tamarins in the wild, a modification of the point transect with lures procedure. Using this method, we estimate that in 2014 there were approximately 3,700 golden lion tamarins in 41,400 hectares of Atlantic Forest. Of these, 59% are from remnant wild populations, 34% are descendants of captive-born reintroduced animals and 7% are descendants of wild translocated groups. The number of tamarins and amount of forest estimated in this survey exceeded values necessary to meet AMLD’s definition of a viable population, determined to be 2,000 tamarins in 25,000 hectares of connected and protected forest. However, the seven forest blocks and their tamarin populations are not yet adequately connected and protected. AMLD’s strategic plan to achieve a viable population of golden lion tamarins includes 12 strategies that mitigate these and other threats or contribute directly to the conservation goal. The point transect with lures survey method provides a way to evaluate progress in achieving that goal and adapt strategies as appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2948986499,"Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and large-cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma (LCNEC) are high-grade lung neuroendocrine tumors (NET). However, comparative protein expression within SCLC and LCNEC remains unclear. Here, protein expression profiles were obtained via mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified co-expressed modules and hub genes. Of 34 identified modules, six were significant and selected for protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and pathway enrichment. Within the six modules, the activation of cellular processes and complexes, such as alternative mRNA splicing, translation initiation, nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) superfamily-type complex, chromatin remodeling pathway, and mRNA metabolic processes, were significant to SCLC. Modules enriched in processes, including signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and cellular macromolecule catabolic process, were characteristically activated in LCNEC. Novel high-degree hub genes were identified for each module. Master and upstream regulators were predicted via causal network analysis. This study provides an understanding of the molecular differences in tumorigenesis and malignancy between SCLC and LCNEC and may help identify potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2948348724,"Mobile services’ rapid evolution and development has meant that their evaluation has become a more and more pressing issue, and from both the practical and theoretical standpoints. The significant previous work in the field of multiple-criteria decision-making based evaluation of mobile services has some practical limitations that should be noted. First, there has been insufficient research that has utilized both objective and subjective weighting. Second, the investigations that have employed Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a well known practical tool for use in multi-criteria decision making, did not consider the fuzzy environment. In order to fill these gaps in the literature, the present study developed fuzzy VIKOR for use with an integrated weighting approach that combines subjective and objective weighting to account for mobile services’ various characteristics and, thereby, evaluate their quality. For subjective weighting, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) was employed for simple determination of the weighting and causal relationships. For objective weighting of evaluation criteria, Shannon entropy was utilized. This study has a unique contribution in that it reflects the special circumstances of the mobile service evaluation that have not been considered in the previous studies. Especially, in this study, not only the subjective weighting method but also the objective weighting method are used for more accurate importance weight of evaluation criteria. In the novelty aspect, this is the first study trying to utilize fuzzy VIKOR in concert with a novel combined subjective/objective weighting method in order to integrate objective decision-matrix-derived information with subjective decision-maker preferences. Additionally, a supplemental, empirical mobile-service-evaluation case study was conducted that enables researchers and practitioners to better understand the overall, practical evaluation process. Validation of the case study results by comparison with other, representative multiple-criteria decision-making methods verified the proposed method’s robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2948237048,"Background Social support, family functioning and family health are essential elements in the treatment of heart failure, yet most heart failure studies focus on the pharmacological interventions. This study aimed to examine whether perceived social support from nurses is associated with better family functioning of patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives and to examine whether family health mediates this relationship. Methods and findings A sample of 312 patients with heart failure and 312 of their nearest relatives were included in the study. The Family Functioning, Health and Social Support questionnaire was used to collect the data. Dyadic data were analysed by the Actor–Partner Interdependence Mediation Model with distinguishable dyads using structural equation modelling. Patients and nearest relatives who perceived more social support had a higher level of family health and functioned better within the family. One partner effect was found, indicating that the higher the level of family health of the nearest relative, the better the family functioning of the patient (p <0.001). Family health partially (in the patient) and completely (in the nearest relative) mediated the association between social support and family functioning. Conclusion This study indicated that patients with heart failure and their nearest relatives who perceived more social support from nurses were more likely to have high level of family health and function better within the family. The interdependent relationships found in our study highlight a dyadic and family-oriented approach to improve family functioning in patients with heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2948478986,"Purpose To assess changes in short-term maximal performance, alertness, dietary intake, sleep pattern and mood states of physically active young men before (BR), during and after Ramadan observance. Methods Twelve physically-active men (age: 21.9±2.4yrs, height:1.77±0.09m, body-mass: 72.6±7.8kg, exercising: ≥3h/week) performed the 5-jump and the digit-cancellation (alertness) tests 15-days BR, on the first (FR) and last 10-days of Ramadan (ER) and 10-days (AR10) and 20-days (AR20) after Ramadan. During each period, sleep pattern (Pittsburgh-Sleep-Quality-Index (PSQI)), mood states (Profile-of-Mood-States (POMS)) and dietary intake were recorded. Results No significant changes in the 5-jump, digit-cancellation test and POMS parameters appeared during and after Ramadan relative to BR. However, the PSQI total score was lower during FR compared to AR10 (p<0.001). Specifically, the subjective sleep quality was lower (i) at BR compared to FR (p<0.05), AR10 (p<0.01) and AR20 (p<0.01) and (ii) at ER and AR20 compared to FR (p<0.05). The sleep duration (i) increased at FR (p<0.05) and (ii) decreased at AR10 (p<0.01) and AR20 (p<0.05) compared to BR. Sleep disturbances were significantly greater (i) at BR compared to FR (p<0.01), ER (p<0.01), AR10 (p<0.05) and AR20 (p<0.05) and (ii) at AR10 and AR20 compared to FR and ER (p<0.05). In terms of diet, the fractional contribution of carbohydrate (%) was lower and the dietary fat content (g) was higher during ER than AR10 and AR20 (p<0.05). Further, the dietary protein (in %) was significantly lower during FR compared to BR (p<0.01), ER (p<0.05), AR10 (p<0.05) and AR20 (p<0.05). Conclusion Ramadan had no-adverse effects on the 5-jump performance, alertness, or mood states in physically active young men. However, the sleep duration was shorter and the sleep quality was improved following compared to during Ramadan. The fractional intake of fat also increased at the expense of carbohydrate during Ramadan, and the protein intake was lower at the beginning of Ramadan than before, at the end of and after Ramadan."
https://openalex.org/W2948331265,"There is an increasing amount of clinical evidence that hypomagnesemia (serum Mg2+ levels < 0.7 mmol/l) contributes to type 2 diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. Amongst other hypotheses, it has been suggested that Mg2+ deficiency affects insulin secretion. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the acute effects of extracellular Mg2+ on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in primary mouse islets of Langerhans and the rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line. Here we show that acute lowering of extracellular Mg2+ concentrations from 1.0 mM to 0.5 mM did not affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets or in insulin-secreting INS-1 cells. The expression of key genes in the insulin secretory pathway (e.g. Gck, Abcc8) was also unchanged in both experimental models. Knockdown of the most abundant Mg2+ channel Trpm7 by siRNAs in INS-1 cells resulted in a 3-fold increase in insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose conditions compared to mock-transfected cells. Our data suggest that insulin secretion is not affected by acute lowering of extracellular Mg2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2948601580,"Background A sea voyage is characterized by a variety of work requirements for the ship's crew, basically reflected in three voyage episodes: port stay, river passage and sea passage. The primary aim of this study was to compare stress and strain amongst a sample of merchant seafarers across these three voyage episodes. Methods In a cross-sectional maritime field study, 323 sailors on 22 container ships were biometrically surveyed and completed a questionnaire. In addition, a survey of energy expenditure and heart rate (variability) was carried out in parallel with 236 participants with the SenseWear armband monitor and the RS 800 polar watch. Results Port stay and sea passage each accounted for the largest proportion of the ships’ journeys, each at around 40%. The study participants rated port stay with 37.8% as the voyage episode with the highest strain, followed by the river passage (24.8%) and then the sea passage (13.0%). The working time during the sea passage was on average shorter than during port stay or the river passage (p<0.001)—as a result, seafarers had more spare time to spend on leisure and sleep. Total energy turnover and, by trend, work energy turnover were notably at the lowest during the sea passage. In particular, the crew had a significantly lower heart rate during the sea passage than during the other two voyage episodes (p = 0.001). Furthermore, there was no difference in the seafarers’ heart rate variability between the voyage episodes. Conclusion In the present study, it becomes clear that an accumulation of psychophysical stress takes place during port stay and leads to a subjectively and objectively higher strain level. In contrast, seafarers are more likely to recover during the sea passage. This knowledge should be used to offer ships' crews targeted health measures, in particular during the sea passage."
https://openalex.org/W2948611854,"Mangrove forests, one of the world's most endangered ecosystems, are also some of the most difficult to access. This is especially true along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where 99% of the country's mangroves occur. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones, have become a convenient tool for natural area assessment, and offer a solution to the problems of remote mangrove monitoring. This study is the first to use UAS to analyze the structure of a mangrove forests within Central America. Our goals were to (1) determine the forest structure of two estuaries in northwestern Costa Rica through traditional ground measurements, (2) assess the accuracy of UAS measurements of canopy height and percent coverage and (3) determine whether the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could discriminate between the most abundant mangrove species. We flew a UAS equipped with a single NDVI sensor during the peak wet (Sept-Nov) and dry (Jan-Feb) seasons. The structure and species composition of the estuaries showed a possible transition between the wet mangroves of southern Costa Rica and the drier northern mangroves. UAS-derived measurements at 100 cm/pixel resolution of percent canopy coverage and maximum and mean canopy height were not statistically different from ground measurements (p > 0.05). However, there were differences in mean canopy height at 10 cm/pixel resolution (p = 0.043), indicating diminished returns in accuracy as resolution becomes extremely fine. Mean NDVI values of Avicennia germinans (most abundant species) changed significantly between seasons (p < 0.001). Mean NDVI of Rhizophora racemosa (second most abundant species) was significantly different from A. germinans and dry forest dominant plots during the dry season (p < 0.001), demonstrating NDVI's capability of discriminating mangrove species. This study provides the first structural assessment of the studied estuaries and a framework for future studies of mangroves using UAS."

Previous trials have reported that gabapentin can relieve chronic neuropathic pain, but its effect on prevention of PHN is unclear.To assess the efficacy of a 5-week course of gabapentin on acute herpetic pain and on the prevention of PHN at 12 weeks in patients with acute HZ.This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 17 primary care health centers in Mallorca, Spain. All patients were older than 50 years, presented with HZ within 72 h of rash onset, and had moderate-severe pain (≥4 on a 10-point visual analogue scale [VAS]). Ninety-eight patients were randomized to receive gabapentin or placebo. All patients received valaciclovir for 7 days and analgesia if needed. The treatment period was 5 weeks, followed by 7 weeks of follow-up. Gabapentin was initiated at 300 mg/day and gradually titrated to a maximum of 1800 mg/day. The main outcome measure was pain at 12 weeks.Seventy-five patients completed the study, 33 in the gabapentin group and 42 in the control group. A total of 18.2% of patients in the gabapentin group and 9.5% in the control group reported pain at 12 weeks (p = 0.144). Four patients in the gabapentin group (12.1%), but no patients in the placebo group, reported pain of 4 or more on a 10-point VAS. Patients taking gabapentin reported worse health-related quality of life and poorer sleep quality. Three patients discontinued the trial due to adverse effects from gabapentin.Addition of gabapentin to the usual treatment of HZ within 72 h of rash onset provided no significant relief from acute herpetic pain or prevention of PHN.ISRCTN Registry identifier: ISRCTN79871784."
https://openalex.org/W2952033359,"Background Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been proposed as a tool for diagnosing drug resistance in tuberculosis. However, reports of its effectiveness in endemic countries with important numbers of drug resistance are scarce. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in isolates from a tuberculosis endemic region in Mexico. Methods WGS analysis was performed in 81 tuberculosis positive clinical isolates with a known phenotypic profile of resistance against first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin). Mutations related to drug resistance were identified for each isolate; drug resistant genotypes were predicted and compared with the phenotypic profile. Genotypes and transmission clusters based on genetic distances were also characterized. Findings Prediction by WGS analysis of resistance against isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin showed sensitivity values of 84%, 96%, 71%, 75% and 29%, while specificity values were 100%, 94%, 90%, 90% and 98%, respectively. Prediction of multidrug resistance showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 97%. Moreover, WGS analysis revealed polymorphisms related to second-line drug resistance, enabling classification of eight and two clinical isolates as pre- and extreme drug-resistant cases, respectively. Lastly, four lineages were identified in the population (L1, L2, L3 and L4). The most frequent of these was L4, which included 90% (77) of the isolates. Six transmission clusters were identified; the most frequent was TC6, which included 13 isolates with a L4.1.1 and a predominantly multidrug-resistant condition. Conclusions The results illustrate the utility of WGS for establishing the potential for prediction of resistance against first and second line drugs in isolates of tuberculosis from the region. They also demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure for use as a tool to support the epidemiological surveillance of drug- and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2948350373,"The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is expressed in various immune cells and involved in regulating inflammatory processes. LRRK2 facilitates calcium extrusion exchanger and sodium-calcium exchanger activity and hence influences intracellular Ca2+ concentration in dendritic cells (DCs). DC maturation and migration are governed by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but the related mechanisms whereby LRRK2 regulates DC function and involved Ca2+ channels are still under investigation. In the previous study, we found that LRRK2−/− DCs exhibited higher store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) activity than LRRK2+/+ DCs. Herein, we ascertained the exact SOCE components by using genetic, pharmacological, and fluorescent approaches. Ca2+ imaging showed that LRRK2 kinase activity negatively modulated SOCE activity. Moreover, LRRK2 deficiency resulted in an enhanced migration capacity of DCs but had little effect on the maturation process. SOCE is widely known to regulate DC functions; we wanted to dissect the reason why LRRK2 specifically influenced DC migration and therefore silenced ORAI1, ORAI2, and ORAI3, respectively. Transwell assays showed that both ORAI1 and ORAI2 silencing markedly decreased the migration of DCs, but only ORAI1 deficiency influenced the expression of maturation markers CD11c, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II. Of note, LRRK2 deficiency increased ORAI2 expression but not that of ORAI1 and ORAI3. Thus, we suggest that LRRK2 modulates DC migration by interfering with ORAI2.—Yan, J., Zhao, W., Gao, C., Liu, X., Zhao, X., Wei, T., Gao, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2948457508,"Adolescence is a developmental phase in which feelings of loneliness often increase. It is also a time period during which computer-mediated communication (CMC) is frequently used by youth to communicate with their peers. Strong family relationships protect youth from experiencing a wide range of adversities and mental health problems, including loneliness, and yet use of CMC to contact peers may leave adolescents feeling disconnected and lonely while also limiting the amount of time they spend with their family. This study examines the association between CMC and feelings of loneliness among Canadian youth, with family communication explored as an effect modifier. The study base was the Canadian 2013-2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study used in a cross-sectional analysis (N = 30117; grades 6-10). Random-effects multilevel Poisson regression methods were used to quantify risks for adolescent loneliness among daily vs. non-daily users of verbal CMC (e.g., Skype, phone calls), text/instant messaging and social media CMC with friends. Effect modification was tested via the inclusion of modelled interaction terms. Family communication quality moderated the relationship between daily CMC use and loneliness among Canadian youth. Among youth experiencing high relative quality of family communication, daily use of verbal and social media CMC to contact friends was positively associated with reports of loneliness, compared to non-daily users. Findings suggest that family communication must remain central in societal discussions of youth loneliness, mental health and use of CMC."
https://openalex.org/W2948097958,"Prior research has shown that immigration law enforcement contributes to poor health outcomes—including reproductive health outcomes—among Latinos. Yet no prior research has examined how immigration enforcement might inhibit reproductive justice and limit individual’s reproductive autonomy. We utilized data from an existing study that consisted of a partnership with a Latino community in Michigan in which an immigration raid resulted in multiple arrests and deportations midway through data collection. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 192) where no one was re-interviewed, we used ordinal logistic regression to compare desired pregnancy timing of individuals surveyed prior to and after the raid to determine the impact of an immigration raid on desired timing of next pregnancy. We then used qualitative data—including 21 in-depth interviews and participant observation—collected in the community after the raid to contextualize our findings. Controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we found that Latinos surveyed in the aftermath of the raid were more likely to report a greater desire to delay childbearing than Latinos surveyed before the raid occurred. Our qualitative data showed that an immigration raid has financial and psychological effects on immigrant families and that a raid may impact reproductive autonomy because people are fearful of these impacts. These finding suggest that current immigration enforcement efforts may influence reproductive decision-making, impede Latinos reproductive autonomy, and that family-friendly immigration policy reform is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2948700799,"Background Gastrointestinal complications following on-pump cardiac surgery are orphan but serious risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. We aimed to assess incidence, perioperative risk factors, treatment modalities and outcomes. Material and methods A university medical center audit comprised 4883 consecutive patients (median age 69 [interquartile range IQR 60–76] years, 33% female, median logistic EuroScore 5 [IQR 3–11]) undergoing all types of cardiac surgery including surgery on the thoracic aorta; patients undergoing repair of congenital heart disease, implantation of assist devices or cardiac transplantation were excluded. Coronary artery disease was the leading indication for on-pump cardiac surgery (60%), patients undergoing cardiac surgery under urgency or emergency setting were included in analysis. We identified a total of 142 patients with gastrointestinal complications. To identify intra- and postoperative predictors for gastrointestinal complications, we applied a 1:1 propensity score matching procedure based on a logistic regression model. Results Overall, 30-day mortality for the entire cohort was 5.4%; the incidence of gastrointestinal complications was 2.9% and median time to complication 8 days (IQR 4–12). Acute pancreatitis (n = 41), paralytic ileus (n = 14) and acute cholecystitis (n = 18) were the leading pathologies. Mesenteric ischemia and gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for 16 vs. 18 cases, respectively. While 72 patients (51%) could be managed conservatively, 27 patients required endoscopic/radiological (19%) or surgical intervention (43/142 patients, 30%); overall 30-day mortality was 12.1% (p<0.001). Propensity score matching identified prolonged skin-to-skin times (p = 0.026; Odds Ratio OR 1.003, 95% Confidence Interval CI 1.000–1.007) and extended on-pump periods (p = 0.010; OR 1.006, 95%CI 1.001–1.011) as significant perioperative risk factors. Comment Prolonged skin-to-skin times and extended on-pump periods are important perioperative risk factors regardless of preoperative risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2948227770,"While there is a general belief that reforesting marginal, often unprofitable, croplands can result in water quality benefits, to date there have been very few studies that have attempted to quantify the magnitude of the reductions in nutrient (N and P) and sediment export. In order to determine the magnitude of a credit for water quality trading, there is a need to develop quantitative approaches to estimate the benefits from forest planting in terms of load reductions. Here we first evaluate the availability of marginal croplands (i.e. those with low infiltration capacity and high slopes) within a large section of the Ohio River Basin (ORB) to assess the magnitude of the land that could be reforested. Next, we employ the Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) to study the reduction in N, P and sediment losses from converting corn or corn/soy rotations to forested lands, first in a case study and then for a large region within the ORB. We find that after reforestation, N losses can decrease by 40 to 80 kg/ha-yr (95-97% reduction), while P losses decrease by 1 to 4 kg/ha-yr (96-99% reduction). There is a significant influence of local conditions (soils, previous crop management practices, meteorology), which can be considered with NTT and must be taken into consideration for specific projects. There is also considerable interannual and monthly variability, which highlights the need to take the longer view into account in nutrient credit considerations for water quality trading, as well as in monitoring programs. Overall, there is the potential for avoiding 60 million kg N and 2 million kg P from reaching the streams and rivers of the northern ORB as a result of conversion of marginal farmland to tree planting, which is on the order of 12% decrease for TN and 5% for TP, for the entire basin. Accounting for attenuation, this represents a significant fraction of the goal of the USEPA Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force to reduce TN and TP reaching the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, the second largest dead zone in the world. More broadly, the potential for targeted forest planting to reduce nutrient loading demonstrated in this study suggests further consideration of this approach for managing water quality in waterways throughout the world. The study was conducted using computational models and there is a need to evaluate the results with empirical observations."
https://openalex.org/W2948701661,"Background Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection with standard triple therapy has been accepted to curb associated risks of chronic gastritis andpeptic ulcer disease. Objective To assess H. pylori eradication rate of standard triple therapy and patient related factors affecting eradication rate. Methods A facility based prospective follow up study was conducted in Bahir Dar City Administration, Ethiopia, on consented outpatients presented with gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and positive for H. pylori stool antigen test from May 2016 to April 2018. Eradication was confirmed with stool antigen test made after 4–6 weeks of standard triple therapy, comprising of proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Pre-developed questionnaire and data collection formats were used to collect variables before and after therapy. Bivariate and backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze data. P-value < 0.05 at 95%CI was considered as significant. Results The overall H. pylori eradication rate was 90.3% (379/421). Almost 80% of the patients were urban residents. Mean (±SD) age and body weight of patients were 30.63 (± 10.74) years and 56.79 (± 10.17) kg, respectively. Self-reported adverse drug effects and area of residence of patients were factors affecting eradication rate significantly. Patients with no self-reported adverse drug effect were 3.85 (AOR: 3.85; 95%CI (1.41–5.26)) times more likely to eradicate H. pylori infection compared to those reported adverse effects. Patients living in rural area were 2.7 (AOR: 2.7; 95%CI (1.19–20.0)) times more likely to achieve eradication compared to urban residents. Conclusion H. pylori eradication rate is within the recommended level for clinical practice, indicating that modifications of the standard triple therapy observed in the different healthcare institutions are not evidence-based. Emphasis should be given to adverse drug effects of medications and tailored counseling based on area of residence could have a contribution in improving eradication rate."
https://openalex.org/W2948878597,"Reptiles show varying degrees of facultative parthenogenesis. Here we use genetic methods to determine that an isolated, captive female Asian water dragon produced at least nine offspring via parthenogenesis. We identified microsatellites for the species from shotgun genomic sequences, selected and optimized primer sets, and tested all of the offspring for a set of seven microsatellites that were heterozygous in the mother. We verified that the seven loci showed high levels of polymorphism in four wild Asian water dragons from Vietnam. In all cases, the offspring (unhatched, but developed eggs, or hatched young) had only a single allele at each locus, and contained only alleles present in the mother’s genotype (i.e., were homozygous or hemizygous). The probability that our findings resulted from the female mating with one or more males is extremely small, indicating that the offspring were derived from a single female gamete (either alone or via duplication and/or fusion) and implicating parthenogenesis. This is the first documented case of parthenogenesis in the Squamate family Agamidae."

To confirm the effects of temperature and sex ratio on adult fecundity, longevity and egg hatchability of B. difformis, we assayed the adults survival longevity and numbers of oviposition, as well as egg hatching rate under female-male ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1 and 3:1 at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C. Female fecundity and egg hatchability were increased with temperature and peaked at 25°C, which, however, were adverse to adult longevity. Furthermore, female-male ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 seemed suitable for female fecundity, of which the sex ratio of 1:1 was the most suitable ratio for its oviposition behavior. These results provide an insight for predicting the population density of B. difformis and offer a literature reference in the effective treatment of harmful insects by controlling and changing the sex ratio artificially."
https://openalex.org/W2948850940,"Background Pancreatic tumor cells may avoid immune surveillance by releasing the transmembrane major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A (MICA) protein in soluble form (s-MICA). We hypothesized that the presence of the A5.1 polymorphism in the MICA gene, which encodes a truncated MICA protein, is associated with higher s-MICA levels and increased pancreatic cancer risk. Methods MICA alleles and s-MICA levels were measured in 121 pancreatic cancer cases and 419 controls. General linear regression with a log transformation assessed geometric means of s-MICA levels across MICA alleles. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pancreatic cancer associated with MICA alleles. Results After multivariate adjustment, participants with at least one copy of the A5.1 allele versus no A5.1 allele had 1.35 (95% CI: 1.05–1.74) times greater s-MICA levels (1.65 times higher for cases and 1.28, for controls) and increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05–3.48). Conclusions Our study suggests higher risk of pancreatic cancer among those with the MICA A5.1 polymorphism, which may be explained by an increase in s-MICA secretion and impaired immune response. Impact These findings provide further evidence at the genetic and molecular level of the important role of MICA in pancreatic cancer development, and may have important implications with regards to pancreatic cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W2948342784,"Chromosomal instability is a type of genome instability involving changes in genetic information at the chromosomal level. The basic tests used to identify this form of instability are sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests and identification of fragile sites (FS). SCE is the process by which sister chromatids become fragmented as a result of DNA strand breakage and reassembly, followed by exchange of these fragments. FS can be observed in the form of breaks, gaps or constrictions on chromosomes, which often result from multiple nucleotide repeats in DNA that are difficult to replicate. The research material was the peripheral blood of ten breeds of cattle raised in Poland, including four native breeds covered by a genetic resources conservation programme, i.e. Polish Red, Polish Red-and-White, White-Backed, and Polish Black-and-White, as well as Polish Holstein-Friesian, Simmental, Montbéliarde, Jersey, Limousine and Danish Red. Two tests were performed on chromosomes obtained from in vitro cultures: SCE and FS. The average frequency of SCE was 5.08 ± 1.31, while the incidence of FS was 3.45 ± 0.94. Differences in the incidence of SCE and FS were observed between breeds. The least damage was observed in the Polish Red and White-Backed breeds, and the most in Polish Holstein-Friesians. The most damage was observed in the interstitial part of the chromosomes. Age was shown to significantly affect the incidence of SCE and FS. Younger cows showed less damage than older ones (SCE: 4.84 ± 1.25; 5.34 ± 1.24; FS: 3.10 ± 0.88, 3.80 ± 0.92)."
https://openalex.org/W2948826688,"Viruses use a spectrum of immune evasion strategies that enable infection and replication. The acute phase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by nonspecific and often mild clinical symptoms, suggesting an immunosuppressive mechanism that, unless symptomatic liver disease presents, allows the virus to remain largely undetected. We previously reported that HCV induced the regulatory protein suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3, which inhibited TNF-α-mediated inflammatory responses. However, the mechanism by which HCV up-regulates SOCS3 remains unknown. Here we show that the HCV protein, p7, enhances both SOCS3 mRNA and protein expression. A p7 inhibitor reduced SOCS3 induction, indicating that p7's ion channel activity was required for optimal up-regulation of SOCS3. Short hairpin RNA and chemical inhibition revealed that both the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and MAPK pathways were required for p7-mediated induction of SOCS3. HCV-p7 expression suppressed TNF-α-mediated IκB-α degradation and subsequent NF-κB promoter activity, revealing a new and functional, anti-inflammatory effect of p7. Together, these findings identify a molecular mechanism by which HCV-p7 induces SOCS3 through STAT3 and ERK activation and demonstrate that p7 suppresses proinflammatory responses to TNF-α, possibly explaining the lack of inflammatory symptoms observed during early HCV infection.-Convery, O., Gargan, S., Kickham, M., Schroder, M., O'Farrelly, C., Stevenson, N.

https://openalex.org/W2948943984,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes great economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide. Chicken type II pneumocytes (CP II cells) secrete surfactants and modulate lung immunity to decrease the infection of the invading pathogen. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of CP II cells to APEC infection remains poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted global gene expression profiling of CP II cells after APEC-O78 infection to explore the host-pathogen interaction. The differentially expressed genes of CP II cells to APEC infection were characterized by RNA-seq with EB-seq algorithm. In consequence, the mRNA of 18996 genes was identified, and CP II cells responded to APEC infection with marked changes in the expression of 1390 genes. Among them, there are 803 down-regulated mRNAs and 587 up-regulated mRNAs. The KEGG prediction and Gene Ontology terms analysis revealed that the major enriched pathways were related to NF-κB signaling pathway, apoptosis pathway, tight junction, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and other pathways. We adopted qRT-PCR to verify the validity of the selected gene expression. The fold induction of qPCR was similar to the RNA-seq results. These results provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of APEC, especially apoptosis pathway involved in APEC infection."
https://openalex.org/W2948888510,"We propose a method for analyzing repeated residential movements based on graphical loglinear models. This method allows an explicit representation of residential presence and absence patterns from several areas without defining mobility measures. We make use of our method to analyze data from one of the most comprehensive demographic surveillance sites in Africa that is characterized by high adult HIV prevalence, high levels of poverty and unemployment and frequent residential changes. Between 2004 and 2016, residential changes were recorded for 8,857 men over 35,500.01 person-years, and for 12,158 women over 57,945.35 person-years. These individuals were HIV negative at baseline. Over the study duration, there were a total of 806 HIV seroconversions in men, and 2,458 HIV seroconversions in women. Our method indicates that establishing a residence outside the rural study area is a strong predictor of HIV seroconversion in men (OR = 2.003, 95% CI = [1.718,2.332]), but not in women. Residing inside the rural study area in a single or in multiple locations is a less significant risk factor for HIV acquisition in both men and women compared to moving outside the rural study area."

The aim of our study was to develop an innovative postnatal risk assessment to be used by the Preventive Child Healthcare (PCHC) to identify at an early stage children at risk for growth (catch-up growth, overweight and obesity) and developmental problems (such as motor, cognitive, psychosocial and language/ speech problems). Methods We used the first four steps of the Intervention Mapping process. Step 1: Review of the literature and focus group discussions. Step 2: Identification of program objectives on how to develop and implement a risk assessment in PCHC daily practice. Step 3: Application of the ASE model to initiate behavioral change in the target group. Step 4: Development of the postnatal R4U and a program plan for the implementation in PCHC organizations. Results Subsequently in 2015, the 41 item postnatal R4U (the postnatal Rotterdam Reproduction Risk Reduction checklist) was developed according to steps one until four of the Intervention Mapping process and was implemented in four PCHC organizations. Conclusions It was feasible to design and implement a postnatal risk assessment identifying both medical and non-medical risks for growth and developmental problems, using the Intervention Mapping process."
https://openalex.org/W2948095070,"Population-level phylogenetic patterns reflect both transmission dynamics and genetic changes, which accumulate because of selection or drift. In this study, we determined whether a longitudinally sampled dataset derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected individuals over a 14-year period (1999-2012) could shed light on the transmission processes involved in the initiation of the HIV-1 epidemic in Korea. In total, 927 sequences were acquired from 1999 to 2012; each sequence was acquired from an individual patient who had not received treatment. Sequences were used for drug resistance and phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic and other analyses were conducted using MEGA version 6.06 based on the GTR G+I parameter model and SAS. Of the 927 samples, 863 (93.1%) were classified as subtype B and 64 were classified as other subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that 104 of 927 patient samples (11.2%) were grouped into 37 clusters. Being part of a transmission cluster was significantly associated with subtype-B viruses, infection via sexual contact, and the infection of young males. Of all clusters, three (~8.1%) that comprised 10 individual samples (22.2% of 45 individuals) included at least one member with total transmitted drug resistance (TDR). In summary, HIV transmission cluster analyses can integrate laboratory data with behavioral data to enable the identification of key transmission patterns to develop tailored interventions aimed at interrupting transmission chains."

We randomly selected 448 patients (70%) from 640 consecutive patients with resected stage I-III primary lung AD, who had been treated at that point with surgery alone. Expression of PD-L2 and IDO1 in these patients was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and evaluated with respect to peripheral blood markers measured before surgery, including white blood cells, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute monocyte count (AMC), absolute eosinophil count (AEC), serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Membrane PD-L2 expression and cytoplasmic IDO1 expression were defined by tumor proportion score (TPS); samples with TPS < 1% were considered negative. Logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with the immune-related factors. Advanced stage (P = 0.0090), higher AMC (P = 0.0195), and higher AEC (P = 0.0015) were independent predictors of IDO1 expression. PD-L2 expression was not associated with any tested peripheral blood markers. Peripheral blood markers, especially AMC and AEC, could potential predict IDO1 expression in lung AD. This study should be replicated in another cohort; further efforts to explore other biomarkers that predict PD-L2 or IDO1 expression are also warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2952884852,"Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) is overexpressed in melanoma and may be a molecular target for imaging and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. 68Gallium (68Ga) labeling of DOTA-conjugated peptides is an established procedure in the clinic for use in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Aim of this study was to compare a standard labeling protocol against the 68Ga-DOTA peptide purified from the excess of unlabeled peptide.The MC1R ligand DOTA-NAPamide was labeled with 68Ga using a standard clinical protocol. Radioactive peptide was separated from the excess of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide by HPLC. Immediately after the incubation of peptide and 68Ga (95°C, 15 min), the reaction was loaded on a C18 column and separated by a water/acetonitrile gradient, allowing fractionation in less than 20 minutes. Radiolabeled products were compared in biodistribution studies and PET imaging using nude mice bearing MC1R-expressing B16/F1 xenograft tumors.In biodistribution studies, non-purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide did not show significant uptake in the tumor at 1 h post injection (0.78% IA/g). By the additional HPLC step, the molar activity was raised around 10,000-fold by completely removing unlabeled peptide. Application of this rapid purification strategy led to a more than 8-fold increase in tumor uptake (7.0% IA/g). The addition of various amounts of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide to the purified product led to a blocking effect and decreased specific tumor uptake, similar to the result seen with non-purified radiopeptide. PET imaging was performed using the same tracer preparations. Purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide, in comparison, showed superior tumor uptake.We demonstrated that chromatographic separation of radiolabeled from excess unlabeled peptide is technically feasible and beneficial, even for short-lived isotopes such as 68Ga. Unlabeled peptide molecules compete with receptor binding sites in the target tissue. Purification of the radiopeptide therefore improved tumor uptake."

This paper deals with finds that may correspond to such ritual preparations retrieved from the hillfort site of Stillfried an der March. The site, spreading across an area of ca. 23 ha, held a very important position among settlements of Late Urnfield period (particularly during the 10th- 9th c. BCE), acting as a central place where large scale storage of grain as well as textile and metal production took place under the control of local elites. Three incomplete ring-shaped charred organic objects, found together with 14 rings and ring fragments made of clay were discovered in a secondary filled silo pit, excavated among a total of about 100 pits of this kind at the site. The overall good state of preservation of the organic ring fragments suggests that they were deposited intact on the bottom of the pit and covered well so that no re-deposition or damage occurred. This could be indicate their intentional placement in this position. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the charred organic rings are cereal products containing hulled barley and a wheat species. Indications that the objects were shaped from a wet cereal mixture and had been subsequently dried without baking are discussed, as well as the possible significance of the find assemblage. The annular objects are put in context with the contemporary cereal spectrum as well as other cereal preparations from Stillfried, outlining their different chaînes opératoires for handling cereal food."

Twenty-three patients with benign essential blepharospasm, 47 with reflex blepharospasm, and 29 dry eye disease controls were included. Pupillary light reflex-related parameters were measured under mesopic (10 lux) and photopic illuminance (200 lux) using an infrared pupillometer. Additionally, we assessed photophobia grade, eyelid function, and dry eye disease-related parameters. There were no differences in age, sex predominance, or dry eye disease-related parameters among the three groups, or in photophobia grade and eyelid function between benign essential blepharospasm and reflex groups. Constriction velocity and maximum constriction velocity in the mesopic condition were significantly greater in the benign essential blepharospasm group (3.26 ± 0.56 and 5.27 ± 0.90 mm/s) than in reflex (2.86 ± 0.62 and 4.59 ± 1.00 mm/s) or dry eye disease groups (2.96 ± 0.46 and 4.72 ± 0.67 mm/s). Constriction velocity and maximum constriction velocity in the mesopic condition positively correlated with photophobia grade (r = 0.525 and 0.617, P = 0.025 and 0.006) in the benign essential blepharospasm group. Pupillary light reflex may be related to the pathophysiology of benign essential blepharospasm with photophobia. Further studies are required to reveal connections among pupillary light reflex, photophobia, and focal dystonia in benign essential blepharospasm patients with photophobia."
https://openalex.org/W2948793894,"Folate is a micronutrient required for the production of new cells, making it a key factor in early fetal development and ensuring normal growth and maintenance of health. The increase in consumption of folate due to increased periconceptional supplementation and fortification of grains in many countries has led to a decrease in occurrence of folate deficiency and a class of birth defects called neural tube defects. However, an opportunity remains to further improve folate status of populations in areas with limited access to fortified foods and supplementation. Screening of women of reproductive age and other vulnerable populations for folate status would increase our understanding of the magnitude of the burden of folate deficiency and inform monitoring of public health programs. Current gold standard methods for folate assessment are time-intensive and require cold chain, sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, and highly-trained personnel. Our lateral flow assay is low-cost, easy to use, and allows a user to assess folate insufficiency at the point of care in less than 40 minutes. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of our assay in 24 human serum samples, including 8 samples with folate concentrations less than 10.0 nmol/L and 14 samples less than 13.4 nmol/L using the Immulite 2000 commercial assay as a reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity were found to be 93% (95% CI: 54.7–100.0) and 91% (95% CI: 80.0–100.0), respectively, when using our test to determine folate insufficiency based on a cutoff of 13.4 nmol/L. Our point-of-care diagnostic test for folate concentrations could inform screening and public health programs in at-risk populations."

The purpose of this study is to explore the safety of ticlopidine/Ginkgo biloba combination, mainly regarding the incidence of neutropenia, through a post-marketing surveillance study. Methods From March 2009 to October 2015, a total of 4839 subjects had been enrolled in this study. The enrollments were conducted by 152 doctors of 89 hospitals according to the regulations for post-marketing surveillance programs in Korea. If a subject was administered the drug once, he/she was included in the safety analysis set for any adverse events and bleedings, and the primary safety evaluation regarding neutropenia was conducted in subjects who completed 3-month blood test follow-up. We predefined that 1% reduction in neutropenia incidence by ticlopidine/Ginkgo biloba ext. combination from the previously reported incidence of ticlopidine of 2.3% was clinically meaningful. Results Among the safety analysis set of 4831 patients (99.8% of the enrolled subjects), 3150 (65.1%) completed evaluation for neutropenia at 3 months which is the primary safety endpoint. The major causes of dropout were no follow-up visit at 3 months (n = 1016) and violation of the follow-up period (n = 503). Nine patients experienced neutropenia (Absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≤ 1200mm3) and the estimated cumulative incidence at 3 months is 0.29% (95% confidence interval, 0.13%– 0.54%). Severe neutropenia (ANC ≤ 450mm3) did not occur in any patients. Conclusions The incidence of neutropenia with addition of Ginkgo biloba ext. to ticlopidine may be lower than the previously reported incidence of neutropenia with ticlopidine, which needs to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials."

Many consumers utilize product review websites before making a purchase. Many well-known websites are searched for relevant product reviews and experiences of product use. We can easily collect large amounts of structured and unstructured product data and further analyze the data to determine the desired product information. For this reason, many researchers are gradually focusing on sentiment analysis or opinion exploration (opinion mining) and use this technique to extract and analyze customer opinions and emotions. This paper proposes a sentimental text mining method based on an additional features method to enhance accuracy and reduce implementation time and uses singular value decomposition and principal component analysis for data dimension reduction. This study has four contributions: (1) the proposed algorithm for preprocessing the data for sentiment classification, (2) the additional features to enhance the accuracy of the sentiment classification, (3) the application of singular value decomposition and principal component analysis for data dimension reduction, and (4) the design of five modules based on different features, with or without stemming, to compare the performance results. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better accuracy than other methods and that the proposed method can decrease the implementation time."

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of WGS based on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endomyocardial biopsies. Methods and results The study included serial donor- and recipient samples from patients who had undergone heart transplantation at Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, between 1988 and 2009. DNA extraction and WGS were conducted. Additional WGS sequencing quality metrics and coverage were obtained with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). 455 endomyocardial samples from 37 heart transplant recipients were acquired from routine rejection monitoring and stored as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. They were analyzed after 3–26 years of storage. DNA was extracted from 114 samples and WGS was run on 85 samples. DNA extraction yielded 313 ng (IQR 96–601) for all samples. A coverage of 11.3x (IQR 9.0–15.9) was recorded for all WGS samples. Three samples stored for > 25 years yielded a coverage of > 25x. Data were generated for 1.7 billion reads per sample (IQR 1.4–2.7). A Transition/Transversion (TiTv) ratio of 2.09 ± 0.05 was calculated for all WGS samples. No associations were found among storage time, DNA yield, or sequencing quality metrics. Conclusions The present study demonstrated the feasibility of whole-genome sequencing based on endomyocardial biopsies. This process could enable large-scale retrospective genomic studies using stored histopathological samples."

https://openalex.org/W2948923263,"In life sciences, accompanied by the rapid growth of sequencing technology and the advancement of research, vast amounts of data are being generated. It is known that as the size of Resource Description Framework (RDF) datasets increases, the more efficient loading to triple stores is crucial. For example, UniProt's RDF version contains 44 billion triples as of December 2018. PubChem also has an RDF dataset with 137 billion triples. As data sizes become extremely large, loading them to a triple store consumes time. To improve the efficiency of this task, parallel loading has been recommended for several stores. However, with parallel loading, dataset consistency must be considered if the dataset contains blank nodes. By definition, blank nodes do not have global identifiers; thus, pairs of identical blank nodes in the original dataset are recognized as different if they reside in separate files after the dataset is split for parallel loading. To address this issue, we propose the Split4Blank tool, which splits a dataset into multiple files under the condition that identical blank nodes are not separated. The proposed tool uses connected component and multiprocessor scheduling algorithms and satisfies the above condition. Furthermore, to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied Split4Blank to two life sciences RDF datasets. In addition, we generated synthetic RDF datasets to evaluate scalability based on the properties of various graphs, such as a scale-free and random graph."
