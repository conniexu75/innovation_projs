https://openalex.org/W2087787002,"Potassium channels catalyse the permeation of K+ ions across cellular membranes and are identified by a common structural motif, a highly conserved signature sequence of eight amino acids in the P domain of each channel's pore-forming alpha-subunit. Here we describe a novel K+ channel (TOK1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains two P domains within one continuous polypeptide. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the channel exhibit a unique, outwardly rectifying, K(+)-selective current. The channel is permeable to outward flow of ions at membrane potentials above the K+ equilibrium potential; its conduction-voltage relationship is thus sensitive to extracellular K+ ion concentration. In excised membrane patches, external divalent cations block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner, and their removal in this configuration allows inward channel current. These attributes are similar to those described for inwardly rectifying K+ channels, but in the opposite direction, a previously unrecognized channel behaviour. Our results identify a new class of K+ channel which is distinctive in both its primary structure and functional properties. Structural homologues of the channel are present in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans."

https://openalex.org/W1983152536,"An unusual polymorphic protein family of nine or more variants has been isolated from the byssal adhesive plaques and foot of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis. In accordance with established terminology, the family is referred to as M. edulis foot protein 3 or simply Mefp-3. Variants of Mefp-3 have molecular masses of about 6 kDa, isoelectric points greater than 10.5, and an amino acid composition dominated by six amino acids: glycine, asparagine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa), tryptophan, arginine, and an unknown basic amino acid. The latter has been isolated and identified as 4-hydroxyarginine using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and appropriate standards. The primary structure of variant Mefp-3F has been determined by peptide mapping using automated Edman sequencing in combination with fast atom bombardment and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry: ADYYGPNYGPPRRYGGGNYNRYNRYGRRYGGYKGWNNGWNRGRRGKYW where Y represents Dopa, and R represents hydroxyarginine. Notably, the 4 occurrences of RY are marked by a resistance to trypsin digestion. Although the conversion of tyrosines to Dopa is essentially complete, hydroxylation of arginines varies between 40 and 80%. In contrast to other mussel adhesive proteins such as Mefp-1 and −2 which have large numbers of highly conserved, tandemly repeated peptide motifs, Mefp-3 has only short sporadic repeats. The specific function of Mefp-3 in byssal adhesion is unknown.

In contrast to other mussel adhesive proteins such as Mefp-1 and −2 which have large numbers of highly conserved, tandemly repeated peptide motifs, Mefp-3 has only short sporadic repeats. The specific function of Mefp-3 in byssal adhesion is unknown. The adhesion of marine mussels to underwater surfaces is of scientific and technological interest because it is strong, durable, opportunistic, and not undermined by the presence of water (Waite, 1992). Since mussel adhesion is mediated by the byssus, an external bundle of quinone-tanned threads tipped with flattened adhesive pads or plaques, much recent research has focussed on characterizing those byssal proteins in closest proximity with the substrate surface. Attempts to extract soluble adhesive molecules directly from the plaques have met with little success due to their highly cross-linked nature. Recently, however, Diamond(1993) reported that the plaques deposited by mussels transferred to sea water at 4-8°C had a greater proportion of extractable protein than those at 15-18°C, thus suggesting that cross-linking might be temperature-dependent. At least four families of plaque proteins (6, 46, 70, and 120 kDa) have been detected following extraction and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in acid-urea (Diamond, 1993). All contain the post-translationally modified amino acid L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). 1The abbreviations used are: L-DopaL-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanineHOArg4-hydroxyarginineMefpM. edulis foot proteinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightFABfast atom bombardmentCIDcollision-induced dissociationPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine 4-hydroxyarginine M. edulis foot protein high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight fast atom bombardment collision-induced dissociation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polyphenolic protein known as Mytilus edulis foot protein 1 (Mefp-1), was the first of the Dopa-containing byssal precursors to be characterized (Waite and Tanzer, 1981; Filpula et al., 1990). It has a mass of 120 kDa and consists of tandemly repeated decapeptides each containing 2 residues of lysine, 1-2 residues of Dopa (Waite, 1983; Laursen, 1992), 1-2 residues of trans-4-hydroxyproline, and 1 residue of trans-2,3, cis- 3,4-dihydroxyproline (Taylor et al., 1994). Because of its highly adsorptive and surface-active behavior in vitro (Notter, 1988; Olivieri et al., 1992; Hansen et al., 1994), Mefp-1 has long been regarded as a key ingredient of mussel adhesion. Unfortunately, confirmation of this role has been dogged by the extreme insolubility of Mefp-1 in byssus (Diamond, 1993; Rzepecki et al., 1992). Although the presence of Mefp-1 in plaques has been demonstrated by immunohistochemical localization (Benedict and Waite, 1986), recent evidence suggests that the protein may in fact be distributed over the entire byssus as a natural coating or lacquer (Rzepecki et al., 1992). Of the other proteins known to be present in adhesive plaques, the recovery of three is much improved in plaques formed at cold temperatures. Mefp-2 (46 kDa) is a major plaque-specific constituent that consists of 11 tandem repeats of an epidermal growth factor motif 37-41 residues in length with the Dopa modifications limited to the non-epidermal growth factor N and C termini of the protein (Rzepecki et al., 1992; Inoue et al., 1995). The remaining two proteins, Mefp-3 and Mefp-4, are also prominent in cold-shocked plaques but until recently no other detailed information was available. In this paper, we report on a unique 6-kDa family of Mefp-3 proteins that is synthesized and stockpiled in the mussel foot and then specifically deposited into the adhesive plaques of the byssus. These polypeptides resemble the other byssal precursor proteins in basicity and Dopa content, but are unprecedented in containing high levels of a new post-translational modification of arginine, namely, 4-hydroxyarginine. The latter contributed to the complexity of primary structure determination which was only solved with the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Karas and Hillenkamp, 1988). Adhesive plaques (1,000-2,000) were produced by M. edulis maintained in 200-liter marine aquaria (4-7°C) and tethered to Plexiglas sheets (18 inches × 24 inches) at densities of 20/sheet. Plaques were harvested from the sheets at 18-24-h intervals with a single-edged razor, washed with excess double-distilled water, and extracted with 1 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid in 8 M urea using mini-tissue grinders (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min in an Eppendorf Microfuge (15,000 × g), and the supernatant was dialyzed (Mr cut-off 1,000) against 1 liter of 5% acetic acid at 4°C and lyophilized for electrophoresis and C-8 HPLC. Those HPLC fractions containing P-2 and −3 were dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of about 10 mg/ml. The samples were then S-alkylated by the following modification from Hollecker(1990). To 40 μl of sample was added 20 μl of 0.1 M EDTA, pH 7.0. This was followed by the addition of 0.4 ml of fresh borate/ascorbate buffer (0.5 M sodium borate, 0.5 M ascorbic acid, pH 8.0), 20 μl of 1 M dithiothreitol, and 1.2 ml of 8 M urea. After an incubation of 30-40 min at room temperature, 300 μl of fresh 0.25 M iodoacetate in borate/ascorbate buffer at pH 8.0 was introduced to the reaction mixture and continued for another 15 min. The reaction was concluded by the addition of 20 μl of glacial acetic acid and placed on ice prior to C-8 HPLC. Mussel feet were amputated from fresh exsanguinated mussels collected from local rafts and jetties and immediately frozen at −80°C. Phenol glands were dissected from the feet as described previously (Waite, 1983). The glands in lots of 150-200 were forcibly extruded through a garlic press and extracted by homogenization using large (30 ml) Kontes tissue grinders and 100-150 ml of cold 5% acetic acid. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min in a refrigerated Sorval 5B centrifuge. After discarding the supernatants, the pellets were rehomogenized on ice in 75 ml of 5% acetic acid in 8 M urea. This was again centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min. Supernatants were pooled, adjusted to 33% (w/v) with ammonium sulfate (Schwarz/Mann) and stirred for 30 min at 7°C before centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 40 min. To harvest protein not precipitated by 33% ammonium sulfate, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against at least 4 liters of doubly distilled water or 0.7% (w/v) perchloric acid using dialysis tubing with a 1,000 molecular weight cut-off (Spectrum Industries, Los Angeles, CA). A white floc in the dialysis tubing was harvested by centrifugation for 60 min at 10,000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor (Sorval HB4) and, following removal of the supernatant, redissolved in a small volume of 5% acetic acid in 8 M urea. Since water- or perchloric acid-insoluble floc is only partially soluble in acetic acid with urea, it typically required centrifugation on an Eppendorf Microfuge (10 min at 15,000 × g) prior to application to C-18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 260 mm × 7 mm column was an RP-300 or OD-300 Aquapore (Applied Biosciences Inc.) eluted with a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile (Waite et al., 1992). Eluant was monitored continuously at 280 nm, and collected 1-ml fractions were assayed by amino acid analysis and electrophoresis following freeze-drying. Trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) digestion of Mefp-3 was performed at the following two reaction conditions. A, for trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C digestion, about 1 mg of Mefp-3F was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 5 mM Tris ascorbate, pH 7.5 (prepared by adding equal volumes of 10 mM Trizma Base (Sigma) and 10 mM ascorbic acid) at a protease:protein weight ratio of about 1:100, under constant stirring at 22-24°C for 18 h under 275 kilopascals of N2. B, for trypsin digestion, Mefp-3F was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.15 M sodium borate, pH 8.5, all other conditions remaining the same as above. The progress of digestion in each case was monitored by removing 5-μl aliquots at 3-h intervals for acid-urea gel electrophoresis (see below). The digestion was terminated by addition of 0.3 ml of glacial acetic acid followed by freezing (−80°C) and lyophilization. The freeze-dried residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 5% acetic acid. Resolution of the peptides was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC using a 260 × 4 mm Phenomenex or Microsorb C-18 column (Rainin Instruments, Woburn, MA). Eluting solvent was a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile (0-30%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Routine electrophoresis was done on polyacrylamide gels (7% acrylamide and 0.2% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 5% acetic acid and 8 M urea (Panyim and Chalkley, 1969). This system is ideal for basic Dopa-containing proteins because it can be processed for protein or Dopa staining with equal facility. Proteins were stained with Serva Blue R (Serva Fine Chemicals, Westbury, NY), whereas Dopa was stained with either the Arnow reagents (Waite, 1983) or nitro blue tetrazolium redox cycling (Paz et al., 1991). Apparent molecular weight was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and discontinuous Tris-glycine (Hoefer). Isoelectric focussing was done on PAGE in 8 M urea in the pH range 7-10. Proteins separated by acid-urea PAGE were horizontally transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P, Millipore) by electrophoresis at 200 mA in 0.7% acetic acid for 40 min using a Genie Transfer Unit with platinized electrode plates (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Transferred proteins were stained with 0.1% Serva Blue G-250 in 40% aqueous methanol with 7% acetic acid and destained with the same solvent minus the stain. Protein bands (usually in quintuplicate) were excised with a clean single-edge razor and prepared as below for hydrolysis and amino acid composition (Tous et al., 1989). Peptides and proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl with 10% phenol and 10% trifluoroacetic acid in vacuo at 150°C for 20 and 40 min to correct for the losses of certain amino acids (Tsugita et al., 1987). Recovery of tryptophan required hydrolysis in 4 N methanesulfonic acid (Simpson et al., 1972) or in 6 N HCl with 30% phenol in vacuo for 20 and 40 min at 165°C (Muramoto and Kamiya, 1990). Routine amino acid analysis was by ion exchange HPLC and ninhydrin-based detection system (Beckman System 6300 Auto Analyzer) using a previously described gradient program (Waite, 1991). R was quantified using the molar color yield of arginine. Due to its coelution with ammonia, tryptophan was separately quantitated on System 6300 using a 40-min program of NaD (5% sodium chloride and 1.9% sodium citrate at pH 6) at a column temperature of 70°C. The amino acid sequence of protein and peptides was derived by automated Edman degradation using a Porton Instruments Microsequencer (Porton, Tarzana, CA). Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids were chromatographically separated according to a gradient program specified by Waite(1991). The elution position of phenylthiohydantoin-4-hydroxyarginine was determined by spotting sample glass fiber discs with authentic 4-hydroxyarginine and running for 2-3 cycles. About 3-4 mg of Mefp-3 was hydrolyzed in 2 ml of 6 M HCl with 5% phenol in vacuo for 24 h at 110°C. After this, the hydrolysate was flash-evaporated to dryness at 60°C. The residue was taken up in distilled water and applied to a 4 × 200 mm HPLC ion exchange column (Beckman P/N 338076) and eluted isocratically at room temperature with NaD (5% NaCl with 1.9% sodium citrate from Beckman) buffer (flow 0.3 ml/min). Eluting fractions were monitored at 220 nm and manually assayed for the guanidino functionality using the Sakaguchi reaction (Litwack, 1960). Sakaguchi-positive fractions were examined by automated amino acid analysis (Beckman System 6300), and those containing the unknown amino acid were pooled, lyophilized at −80°C, resuspended in 0.2 M acetic acid, and chromatographed on a column of Bio-Gel P-2 (80 × 1.5 cm) eluted with 0.2 M acetic acid. One-ml fractions were collected and monitored by conductivity, the Sakaguchi reaction, and amino acid analysis. Fractions containing the arginine derivative were freeze-dried and analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) (Barber et al., 1981). 4-Hydroxyarginine and NG-hydroxyarginine standards were kindly supplied by E. A. Bell (King's College, London) and P. L. Feldman (Glaxo Research Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), respectively. Arginine, the unknown hydroxyarginine, and the other arginine derivatives and peptides were ionized by FAB using glycerol as the matrix. A tandem mass spectrometer (JEOL HX110/HX110) having a E1B1E2B2 configuration was used to generate the mass spectra (Sato et al., 1987). The first mass spectrometer (MS-1) was operated at a resolution of 1:1000 and was used to measure the mass of protonated (M + H)+ ions and to select the CC-only species for collision-induced dissociation (CID), accomplished by introducing helium into the field-free region between MS-1 and the second mass spectrometer (MS-2). The resulting fragments were analyzed by MS-2 using a linked scan. MS-2 was also operated at a resolution of 1:1000 with the acceleration voltage set to 10 kV, and the collision cell voltage kept at 3 kV above ground. The cesium gun was operated at 20-25 kV and CID profile scans acquired with the JEOL Complement data system. MALDI-TOF experiments were performed using a Vestec VT2000 LD-TOF (linear) mass spectrometer (Vestec Corp., Houston, TX). The MALDI matrix was prepared by dissolving α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile. The Mefp-3 protein or peptides derived thereof were dissolved in this matrix solution to give a final concentration between 1 and 10 pmol/μl. About 1 μl of this solution was applied to the target plate and allowed to evaporate. The sample spots were irradiated using a Laser Science N2 laser (LSI, Inc., Cambridge, MA). The laser (337 nm) has a pulse width of 8 ns and was operated at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. MALDI ionization generates protonated singly and doubly charged ions for the Mefp-3 protein (mostly singly charged ions for peptides) which were accelerated using either 30 or 35 kV accelerating voltage. The resolution was about 1:300 which was sufficient to allow mass assignment of the major peaks due to the different hydroxylation states of the Mefp-3 protein. The Mefp-3F protein or peptides derived from enzymatic digestion of Mefp-3F (HPLC-purified) were dissolved in either 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) or 100 mM ammonium citrate (pH 5.5) and digested with carboxypeptidase P (Boehringer Mannheim). Alternatively, aminopeptidase M (Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer was used for N-terminal sequence information. The reactions were performed at room temperature with the enzyme to substrate ratio between 1:10 and 1:100 by weight. Aliquots from the reaction solutions were taken at timed intervals and dissolved in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution before being analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Newly secreted byssal threads and adhesive plaques of the mussel M. edulis contain a number of proteins that are extractable with 5% acetic acid, 8 M urea and separable by acid-urea-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Several of the plaque proteins (P-1 to P-4) have detectable levels of Dopa as indicated by redox cycling with nitro blue tetrazolium. Plaque protein 3 is the most mobile of the plaque-specific proteins and distinct from the others by its sky-blue metachromasy following staining with Coomassie Blue (Serva Blue R-250). P-3 was separated from P-2 (identical with Mefp-2) and resolved into a cluster of 4 peaks by C-8 reversed phase HPLC of a reduced and S-alkylated plaque extract (Fig. 2A). Each fraction under the peaks was subjected to amino acid analysis following hydrolysis (see P-3 in Table 1), and the N terminus of fraction 32 was sequenced (Table 2). The unique composition and N terminus, i.e. A(A/D)YYGPNYGPPR, indicate that P-3 is distinct from either of the previously purified Dopa-containing proteins associated with adhesion in the byssus of M. edulis (Rzepecki et al., 1992; Waite et al., 1985).Figure 2:A, C-8 reversed phase separation of S-alkylated adhesive plaque-derived proteins.

In conformity with current convention, this protein is abbreviated Mefp-3 for Mytilus edulis foot protein 3. Mefp-3 is liberated from phenol glands during homogenization only by including high urea (8 M) concentrations in the 5% acetic acid extraction buffer (Fig. 1B). This may explain previous failures to detect it (Waite and Tanzer, 1981; Rzepecki et al., 1992). By exploiting Mefp-3's high solubility in buffers containing ammonium sulfate and its tendency to precipitate in dilute perchloric acid or water, it can be prepared to >90% purity without reliance on any chromatography (Fig. 1B). Chromatographic polishing of partially purified Mefp-3 was achieved by reversed-phase C-18 HPLC and resulted in an elution profile consisting of 4 major and at least 6 minor peaks and shoulders (Fig. 2B). Acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fractions 30-45 suggests that all of the peaks but one contain an electrophoretically heterogeneous mixture of protein variants denoted A to J (Fig. 2B, inset). Only fractions 37-39 would appear to contain electrophoretically homogeneous protein which is denoted as variant F. However, given the asymmetry of the peak over fractions 37-39, the actual purity of even these fractions remains suspect. Amino acid compositions of the major electrophoretically distinct species were determined following acid-urea-PAGE, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, and hydrolysis (Table 1). All are dominated by Asx, Gly, and Dopa to a total of about 60 mol %. In point of fact, Mefp-3 Dopa levels are nearly double those of P-3, but losses in the latter are to be expected in the oxidative environment of the plaque. A relatively high tryptophan content (4 mol %) is also present as is an unknown pre-arginine component R (Table 1). All species have an apparent pI > 10.5 as determined by isoelectric focussing in the presence of 8 M urea and Triton X-100 and an apparent molecular mass of 11 kDa as determined by discontinuous SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). A more accurate molecular weight determination was obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry which can routinely provide a mass measurement with an accuracy of ±0.1% using an external standard (Beavis and Chait, 1990). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the major component of Mefp-3 variant F (fraction 39 in Fig. 2A, inset) was acquired utilizing bovine ubiquitin (M + H)+ = 8565.9 and (M + 2H)2+ = 4283.4 as an internal standard to further improve the mass accuracy (Fig. 3). The singly charged region of Mefp-3F is enlarged in the inset and shows that Mefp-3F produces a cluster of peaks that differ from the most highly hydroxylated form (M + H)+ = 6135.2 of the protein in multiples of about 16 mass units. Appearance of a prominent peak (R) eluting prior to arginine during amino acid analysis of Mefp-3 hydrolysates led us to attempt a purification and chemical characterization of this amino acid. Its isolation was easily accomplished in two steps by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 4A) followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2 using 3-4 mg of acid-hydrolyzed Mefp-3 (Fig. 4B). Purity was routinely checked by amino acid analysis and paper chromatography (ethyl methyl ketone/propionic acid/water, 2:1:2, by volume on Whatman No. 1 filter paper) using the Sakaguchi reagent spray (Bell and Tirimanna, 1964; Litwack, 1960). R gave an intensely scarlet color with Sakaguchi in contrast to the orange-red of Arg. This indicates the presence of a guanidyl group and agrees with previous studies on hydroxyarginines by Bell and Tirimanna(1964). NG-Hydroxyarginine was tested and found to be Sakaguchi-negative. The new amino acid isolated from Mefp-3 produced an abundant (M + H)+ ion of m/z 191.2 by FAB mass spectrometry indicating a molecular weight of 190.2. This is 16 Da higher than that of arginine and, together with the Sakaguchi reaction, suggested that the unknown amino acid is a hydroxyarginine. The collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra of arginine and the unknown hydroxyarginine are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. Two abundant ions (m/z 70 and 87) in the CID mass spectrum of arginine are not present to any appreciable extent in the CID mass spectrum of the hydroxyarginine, whereas the latter spectrum exhibits two new peaks at m/z 86 and 103 which correspond to a mass shift of 16 Da, respectively. On the other hand, both spectra contain an ion at m/z 73. The structures of the major arginine fragments were deduced and then verified by obtaining CID spectra from several different arginine derivatives of known structure. From the structures of the ions at m/z 73, 86, and 103 (shown in Fig. S1), it was determined that the unknown amino acid was 4-hydroxyarginine. Its identity was later confirmed by obtaining a CID mass spectrum (Fig. 5C) of authentic 4-hydroxyarginine (Bell and Tirimanna, 1964). In addition, R matches authentic 4-hydroxyarginine in Sakaguchi color, and behaves identically with 4-hydroxy-L-arginine which elutes at 79 min between ammonia and Arg on extended amino acid analysis and forms a unique phenylthiohydantoin-derivative eluting at 8-9 min (between His and Dopa) on C-18 HPLC following automated Edman degradation (results not shown). Although it is reasonable to suggest the L-configuration for the α-carbon in light of its susceptibility to trypsin cleavage (unless followed by Dopa), the absolute configuration at C-4 remains unknown.Figure S1:Scheme 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the primary structure of Mefp-3, the relatively homogeneous HPLC fractions 37-39 were initially selected for further characterization. These ostensibly contained a single electrophoretic variant F (Mefp-3F) with a single N-terminal sequence up to residue 11. Beyond this point, each incidence of phenylthiohydantoin-Arg is accompanied by another peak corresponding to phenylthiohydantoin-hydroxyarginine at 8.7 min. Digestion of Mefp-3F with trypsin in 0.1 M Tris-ascorbate resulted in 28 peaks (many more than a mass of 6 kDa could have accommodated) (Fig. 6A). Sequencing was undertaken but complicated by the coelution of related peptides, e.g. every peptide beginning with Dopa had a counterpart beginning with HOArg-Dopa, and every peptide ending with Arg had a counterpart ending with HOArg. These suggested the following: 1) the post-translational conversion of Arg to HOArg may be essentially random with an overall efficiency of <100%; 2) Arg/HOArg frequently occurs in pairs; and 3) while Arg-Dopa is trypsin-labile, HOArg-Dopa is not. In an attempt to reduce tryptic peptide heterogeneity, Mefp-3F was digested with trypsin but this time in 0.15 M borate, pH 8.0. This was observed to retard cleavage of Lys-Dopa and Arg-Dopa bonds due to Dopa's complexation of borate (Waite and Rice-Ficht, 1992). Thus, if HOArg-Dopa is naturally resistant to trypsin, and Lys-Dopa and Arg-Dopa can be rendered so in borate, then only the HOArg-X, Arg-X, and Lys-X (where X represents primary amino acids other than Dopa) bonds should be cleaved in the protein. As expected, trypsin-borate digestion of Mefp-3F resulted in fewer peptides (Fig. 6B) having sequences shown in Table 2. Wherever a basic residue is followed by Dopa, the peptide bond remains relatively resistant. TB-2 and TB-4 are exceptions that appear after 12-18 h and apparently are derived from TB-3 and TB-5, respectively. TB-7 proved to be a mixture of closely related peptides KYW and GKYW. These are the clearest suggestion, in fact, that the proteins included in pooled fractions 37-39 (Fig. 2B, inset) may have subtle variations in sequence even though they appear to be electrophoretically homogeneous. Peptides T-15 and TB-5 also exhibited sequence heterogeneity beyond residue 11 (data not shown). Digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C in 0.1 M Tris-ascorbate results in only three peptides (Fig. 6C). LC-1 yields only N-terminal Dopa during Edman sequencing. Since it also contains stoichiometric amounts of tryptophan as determined by amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis, we conclude its sequence to be YW. This sequence is also apparent in peptides produced by trypsinization of Mefp-3F in borate (TB-7) and Tris-ascorbate (T-20). LC-2 was sequenced to residue 21 and matches the N terminus of Mefp-3F. LC-3 could not be sequenced beyond the eighth residue. A partial sequence can be proposed from these data and reveals uncertainty about the residues between GWNNGWNR and KYW at the C terminus and NYNRYN and RRYGGYK in the middle of Mefp-3F: ADYYGPNYGPPRRYGGGNYNRYN-RRYGGYKGWNNGWNR-KYW. The small size of peptides produced as well as the possibility of microheterogeneity severely limits the effectiveness of a classical Edman approach here. Thus, mass spectrometry was employed to clarify the sequence of peptides near the C terminus as well as confirm the overall suggested structure. Aliquots from the tryptic, tryptic/borate, and endoproteinase Lys-C digests of Mefp-3F (fraction 39 in Fig. 2, inset) were analyzed directly (without purification) by MALDI-TOF mas"
https://openalex.org/W1525779234,"Previous studies indicated that in pancreatic islets the amount of glucose-derived pyruvate that enters mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation is approximately equal to that entering via decarboxylation and that both carboxylation and decarboxylation are correlated with capacitation of glucose metabolism and insulin release. The relatively high rate of carboxylation is consistent with the current study's finding that pyruvate carboxylase is as abundant in pancreatic islets as it is in liver and kidney. Since islets do not contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and, therefore, cannot carry out glyconeogenesis from pyruvate, the carboxylase might be present in the islet to participate in novel anaplerotic reactions. This idea was first explored by incubating mitochondria from various tissues with pyruvate. Mitochondria from tissues, such as pancreatic islets, liver, and kidney, in which pyruvate carboxylase is abundant, exported a large amount of malate and little or no citrate, isocitrate, and aspartate to the medium. The amount of malate within the mitochondria was <1% that in the medium. When pancreatic islet mitochondria were incubated with [1-14C]pyruvate, radioactive carbon appeared in the medium primarily in malate. Very little radioactivity appeared in amino acids, and little or no radioactivity appeared in citrate and isocitrate. Carbon 1 of pyruvate can be incorporated into malate and other citric acid cycle intermediates only via carboxylation, as this carbon would be lost via decarboxylation when pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle as acetyl-CoA via the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. The amount of malate formed equaled the 14CO2 formed and the radioactivity from C-1 of pyruvate recovered in malate slightly exceeded the formation of 14CO2 in agreement with our previous studies that reported a high rate of carboxylation of pyruvate in intact islets. When intact pancreatic islets were incubated with methyl [U-14C]succinate as a mitochondrial source of four-carbon dicarboxylic acids, radioactivity appeared in pyruvate and lactate. Taken together with previous studies, the current results suggest that during glucose-induced insulin secretion there is a shuttle operating across the mitochondrial membrane in which glucose-derived pyruvate is taken up by mitochondria and carboxylated to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. The oxaloacetate is converted to malate which exits the mitochondrion, where, in the cytosol, it is decarboxylated to pyruvate in the reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme. This pyruvate re-enters mitochondrial pools. Such a cycle produces NADPH in the cytosol. Since it is a cycle, this shuttle can produce far more NADPH than the pentose phosphate pathway, which is known to be a very minor route of glucose metabolism in the islet. If it is accepted that this shuttle is active in the insulin cell, this implicates NADPH regeneration in insulin secretion.

Glucose is the most potent physiological insulin secretagogue and metabolism of glucose via mitochondrial pathways is an essential component of glucose's insulinotropic action. Recent work indicated that the amount of glucose-derived pyruvate that enters mitochondrial pathways via carboxylation is approximately equal to that entering the citric acid cycle via decarboxylation in pancreatic islets(1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data suggested that pyruvate carboxylation occurs via the pyruvate carboxylase reaction in the mitochondrion rather than via the reverse of the malic enzyme reaction in the cytosol(1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3MacDonald M.J. Kaysen J.H. Moran S.M. Pomije C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22392-22397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity has long been known to be present in the pancreatic islet(4Ashcroft S.J.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and recent data(5MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), including data herein, indicate that the islet contains an amount of pyruvate carboxylase equivalent to that in gluconeogenic tissues, such as liver and kidney. Pyruvate carboxylase is not present in the islet for the purpose of glyconeogenesis because the islet contains essentially no enzyme activity (6Hedeskov C.J. Capito K. Horm. Metab. Res. 1980; 10: 8-13Google Scholar, 7MacDonald M.J. Chang C.-M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or mRNA (8MacDonald M.J. McKenzie D.I. Walker T.M. Kaysen J.H. Hormone Metab. Res. 1992; 24: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which, along with pyruvate carboxylase, catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This information prompted me to look for a reason for the abundance of pyruvate carboxylase in the islet. In the current study, in order to view the mitochondrial effects of glucose metabolism in isolation, mitochondria from pancreatic islets and other tissues were incubated with pyruvate, the final cytosolic metabolite of glucose which enters mitochondrial metabolism. Mitochondria from islets and other tissues that contain pyruvate carboxylase exported malate to the surrounding medium. When islet mitochondria were incubated with [1-14C]pyruvate, the rate of appearance of radioactivity in malate and total malate formation roughly equaled the formation of radioactive CO2. Since incorporation of radioactivity into malate could only occur via carboxylation, as C-1 of pyruvate is lost when it undergoes decarboxylation, these results support results of previous experiments in which a high rate of pyruvate carboxylation was found in intact islets(1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Intact islets also incorporated radioactive carbon from four-carbon dicarboxylic acids into pyruvate when the islets were incubated with a methyl ester of [14C]succinate as a source of mitochondrial four-carbon dicarboxylic acids. In mitochondria from islets given pyruvate, the production of citrate, isocitrate, and amino acids, or incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]pyruvate into these compounds was minuscule. These observations suggest that a pyruvate malate shuttle is operative in the insulin cell. In this shuttle pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is converted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. The oxaloacetate is converted to malate, which exits the mitochondrion to the cytosol where it is decarboxylated to pyruvate in the reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme to produce NADPH. Pyruvate then re-enters the mitochondrion where it can participate in another turn of the shuttle or undergo decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA and oxidation. This shuttle is rarely mentioned in the literature, and its existence in any tissue has only been inferred from indirect evidence. Pancreatic islets were isolated from fed Sprague-Dawley rats that weighed 250-300 g as described previously(1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3MacDonald M.J.

Res. 1992; 24: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from islets and other tissues by the method of Johnson and Lardy (9Johnson D. Lardy H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) as described previously(10MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, when mitochondria were isolated from islets, about 2,000 islets were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 70 mM mannitol, 230 mM sucrose, and 5 mM potassium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 (MSH solution) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fraction was saved, and the resulting pellet was re-homogenized in 0.4 ml of MSH solution and centrifuged. The islet supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a mitochondrial pellet. When islet mitochondria were to be incubated with pyruvate, the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 6,500 × g for 10 min instead of at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondria from other tissues were isolated from rats starved 24 h and were homogenized in three volumes of MSH solution (9Johnson D. Lardy H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) and washed four times in MSH solution by centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 10 min before they were suspended in incubation medium. The islet mitochondrial pellet was washed once or not washed at all. The amount of pyruvate carboxylase protein was estimated by probing nitrocellulose blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels with 125I-streptavidin as described previously(5MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Lynch C.J. McCall K.M. Billingsley M.L. Bohlen L.M. Hreniuk S.P. Martin L.F. Witters L.A. Vannucci S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E608-E618PubMed Google Scholar). Pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity was estimated in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μl of tissue homogenate, 2 mM Na3ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 8 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.16 mM acetyl-CoA, 20 mM Na[14C]HCO3 (0.1 mCi/mmol), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, maintained at 37°C(12Shank R.P. Bennett G.S. Freytag S.O. Campbell G.L-M. Brain Res. 1985; 329: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding tissue fraction and stopped after 30 min by adding 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Eighty microliters of the resulting mixture was transferred to a scintillation vial and allowed to evaporate to dryness for 15 h to allow unreacted 14CO2 to evolve. Radioactivity incorporated into resulting carboxylic acids was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Mitochondria from organs of rats starved 24 h were suspended in a volume of MSH solution roughly equal to the weight (v/w) of the tissue from which they were obtained. The solution contained 2 mM Na2ADP, 5 mM KHCO3, and 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3. The mixture was incubated at 37°C with shaking, and 1 ml of medium was removed after 5 min (zero time sample) and at intervals after pyruvate (5 mM as sodium salt) was added and immediately centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1.5 min. The supernatant fraction was quickly removed and treated with 0.1 ml of 0.92 M perchloric acid and centrifuged again. The acid extract was then neutralized with about 0.1 ml of 0.92 M KOH and used for metabolite assays. Metabolites were estimated by standard enzymatic spectrophotometric assays(13MacDonald M.J. Huang M.T. Lardy H.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Möllering H. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis; Metabolites 2: Tri- and Dicarboxylic Acids, Purines, Pyrimidines and Derivatives, Coenzymes, Inorganic Compounds. Vol. VII. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany1985: 2-47Google Scholar). Malate, citrate, and isocitrate produced by islet mitochondria were estimated by alkali-enhanced fluorescence. Briefly, mitochondria from about 2,000 islets were incubated at 37°C in 120 μl of a solution of 5 mM KHCO3, 2 mM Na2ADP, and 5 mM potassium phosphate in MSH solution, pH 7.3. After 5 min, 30 μl of the incubation mixture was removed (zero time sample) and pyruvate was added to the remaining incubation mixture to give a concentration of 5 mM. Samples of incubation mixture (30 μl) were subsequently withdrawn at 15 and 30 min. Immediately after samples were withdrawn, they were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1.5 min. The supernatant fraction was quickly withdrawn and treated with 10 μl of 0.92 M perchloric acid. This mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was neutralized to pH ∼ 7 with about 10 μl of 0.92 M KOH. The supernatant fraction from the neutralized extract was used for fluorometric metabolite assays(15Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). To estimate malate, 30 μl of extract was incubated for 20 min with 220 μl of 50 μM NAD, 2 mM glutamate, and 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer, pH 9.9, 0.5 μl of malate dehydrogenase (5 mg/ml, stored in 50% glycerol), and 0.5 μl of aspartate aminotransferase (2 mg/ml, that was centrifuged to remove (NH4)2SO4 and re-constituted in reaction mixture). Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 11.9 (0.25 ml of a 200 mM solution), was added, and the mixture was heated at 60°C for 15 min to destroy NAD. Twenty microliters of 1 M imidazole was added, and then 0.5 ml of 12 M NaOH containing 6 mM H2O2 was added. The mixture was heated at 60°C for 15 min to develop fluorescence. The test tubes were cooled to room temperature, and fluorescence was estimated with a Farrand Ratio-2 fluorometer. Fluorescence from blanks, which were extracts of medium without mitochondria or of mitochondrial samples that were carried through the assay without the addition of the enzymes, was subtracted from the total fluorescence in order to estimate the formation of compounds attributable to metabolism. Samples with various concentrations of NADH and extracts with known amounts of malate produced by kidney mitochondria were carried through the assay as standards. Citrate was estimated similarly except that the reaction mixture contained 50 μM NADH, 40 μM ZnCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 0.5 μl of malate dehydrogenase, and 0.01 units of citrate lyase in a final volume of 250 μl. HCl (0.1 M) was added to destroy NADH, and H2O2 was not present in the 12 M NaOH. Isocitrate was also estimated similarly to malate except that the reaction mixture contained 50 μM NADP, 100 μM MnCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 5 μg of isocitrate dehydrogenase (from glycerol). NADP was destroyed, and fluorescence of NADPH was enhanced as in the assay for malate. Mitochondria from about 2,000 fresh pancreatic islets were incubated in a microcentrifuge test tube in 50 μl to 170 μl of a solution of MSH containing 5 mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM Na2ADP, 5 mM KHCO3, and 2-5 mM [1-14C]pyruvate (10-28 mCi/mmol) at pH 7.3 and 37°C as described in legends to individual figures. After various intervals up to 30 min, mitochondria were separated from the medium by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1.5 min. The supernatant fraction was removed, treated with 5 μl of 0.92 M perchloric acid, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The resulting supernatant fraction was removed and neutralized with about 5 μl of 0.92 M KOH. Part of the extract (20 μl) was mixed with a solution of malate, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, and isocitrate to give a concentration of 0.2 M of each compound and applied to a corner of Whatman No. 1 paper (20 cm × 20 cm) for two-dimensional chromatography in a solvent of 10 parts isobutyric acid and 6 parts 1 M NH4OH in each dimension. The paper was allowed to dry, and compounds were identified by UV light and (after metabolites were identified enzymatically) by spraying with bromcresol green. Malate was identified by painting the relevant area of the chromatogram with a solution of 0.2 mM NAD, 0.2 mM phenazine methosulfate, 0.3 mM nitro blue tetrazolium, 10 mM glutamate, 0.15 mg/ml malate dehydrogenase, 0.04 mg/ml aspartate aminotransferase, and 0.4 M 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer, pH 8.7. Lactate was identified in the same manner with this solution, which contained no glutamate but contained lactate dehydrogenase (0.05 mg/ml) instead of malate dehydrogenase. The spots were cut out of the paper, and radioactivity present in the spots was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Another estimate of C-1 of pyruvate incorporated into malate, citrate, and isocitrate was obtained by converting carbon from malate and citrate into aspartate and carbon from isocitrate into glutamate and measuring the radioactivity in the two amino acids. A portion of a neutralized extract (20-50 μl) was mixed with 2 ml of a solution of 1 mM each of malate, citrate, and isocitrate and applied to a 2-ml column of Dowex 50 × 8 (H+ form) (100-200-mesh). This column was washed with 2 ml of H2O, and the malate in one-fourth (1 ml) of the resulting effluent was converted to aspartate by adding NAD and glutamate to the column effluent to give concentrations of 2 and 40 mM, respectively. The pH was adjusted to about 9.9 by adding 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer to give a 50 mM concentration. Malate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase (0.1 mg/ml each) were added, and one-tenth of the reaction mixture was diluted with water and placed in a cuvette in order to monitor the progress of the reaction at 340 nm. After about 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was complete and the volume of the reaction mixture was doubled by adding water and applied to a second Dowex 50 × 8 (H+) column (1 ml). The column was washed with 10 ml of H2O and aspartate adhering to the column was eluted with 2 ml of 2 M KOH followed by 2 ml of H2O. The eluate was neutralized with perchloric acid. Citrate and isocitrate washed through the first column were treated similarly to malate. To convert citrate into aspartate a portion of the first column sample was adjusted to pH 7.6 with Tris buffer and incubated with 40 μM ZnCl2, and 40 mM glutamate and citrate lyase (0.02 units) and aspartate aminotransferase (0.1 mg/ml) for about 20 min and applied to a 1-ml Dowex 50 × 8 (H+) column and eluted as described above. To convert isocitrate into glutamate, a portion washed from the first column was adjusted to about pH 7.5 with Tris buffer and then MnCl2, NADP, and aspartate were added to give concentrations of 0.1, 4, and 40 mM, respectively. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (0.08 mg/ml) and 0.1 mg/ml aspartate aminotransferase were then added. After about 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was diluted with water and added to a 1-ml Dowex 50 × 8 (H+) column and the column was treated as described above. Radioactivity was also eluted from the first column with KOH, and this represented the incorporation of 14C into amino acids, such as aspartate. Radioactivity in the neutralized eluates was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In addition, [14C]malate was processed in companion columns identically to the unknown samples to estimate recovery of malate. Recovery was always 80% or more. Radioactivity in blanks, which were medium alone, as well as extracts from medium exposed to mitochondria that were carried through the analytical steps but without the addition of enzymes, was subtracted from radioactivity in extracts carried through the full procedure in order to estimate the incorporation of radioactivity attributable to metabolism. Because commercially available aspartate aminotransferase is contaminated with a minute amount of alanine aminotransferase, which caused a high blank value in the presence of high amounts of NAD(P) and/or glutamate or aspartate, method B was developed. In addition, after the first several assays, a beef liver mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase preparation devoid of alanine aminotransferase (a generous gift of L. A. Fahien) was used when the method A assay was used. Fifty microliters out of 120 μl of the neutralized extract was added to 450 μl of a solution of 50 μM NAD, 2 mM glutamate, 1.5 mM cycloserine, and 50 mM 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer, pH 9.9. Cycloserine was present to inhibit a small amount of alanine aminotransferase activity in the aspartate aminotransferase preparation. The mixture was divided into two 0.25-ml portions. To one portion, 2.5 μg of malate dehydrogenase (from a glycerol stock solution) and 1 μg of aspartate aminotransferase (reconstituted in the reaction mixture so as to remove (NH4)2SO4) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed 15-20 min at room temperature, 0.75 ml of H2O was added to each portion, and the portions were applied to a 1.5-ml Dowex 50 × 8 (H+ form) column (100-200-mesh). The columns were washed with 30 ml of H2O and then aspartate was eluted with 1.5 ml of 2 M KOH followed by 1.5 ml of H2O. The eluate was neutralized with perchloric acid and the radioactivity present was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Radioactivity in samples without enzymes, as well as extracts from medium incubated without mitochondria, which were processed identically to mitochondrial samples, was subtracted from the radioactivity in samples from incubations with mitochondria processed with enzyme, to give the radioactivity attributable to [14C]malate exported by the islet mitochondria. The recovery of [14C]malate estimated from the recovery of [14C]malate (0.2 mCi) processed through companion reaction mixtures and columns was always greater than 80%. Radioactivity incorporated into citrate was estimated identically to that for malate in a reaction mixture that contained 2 mM glutamate, 1.5 mM cycloserine, 40 μM ZnCl2, and 50 mM Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.6, and, when added, 0.01 units of citrate lyase, and 1 μg of aspartate aminotransferase. Incorporation of radioactivity into isocitrate was also estimated similarly to that for malate in a reaction mixture that contained 50 μM NADP, 100 μM MnCl2, 2 mM aspartate, 1 mM cycloserine, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.1, 5 μg of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 1 μg of aspartate aminotransferase. About 2,000 islets were incubated in 150 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 10 mM dimethyl [U-14C]succinate (equal parts of dimethyl [1,414C]- and [2,314C]succinate synthesized as described previously (1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) plus added unlabeled dimethylsuccinate) (final specific radioactivity, 2 mCi/mmol) after 90 min at 37°C, one half of the incubation medium was quickly removed from above the islets and brought to 1 ml with H2O. The islets were quickly washed three times in cold Krebs-Ringer solution and were treated with 40 μl of 0.92 M KOH, which was then neutralized with about 30 μl of 0.92 M perchloric acid. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was removed and brought to 1 ml with H2O. Each of the 1-ml samples was applied to a 1.5-ml Dowex 50 × 8 column (H+ form) (100-200-mesh), which was washed with 2 ml of H2O. Three milliliters of effluent was collected, and the pH of the sample was adjusted to 9.5-9.9 with about 2 μl of 30% KOH. NAD, glutamate, and 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer, pH 9.9, were added to give concentrations of 1, 5, and 20 mM, respectively. Both samples were divided into three equal parts of 1 ml. One part received lactate dehydrogenase (25 μg), one part received lactate dehydrogenase plus alanine aminotransferase (10 μg), and one part received no enzymes. After 20 min at room temperature, the pH of the samples was adjusted to ∼7 with HCl and they were added to 1-ml Dowex 50 columns. The columns were washed with 12 ml of water, and alanine was eluted from the columns with 1.5 ml of 2 M KOH followed by 1.5 ml of H2O. The radioactivity in the sample without enzymes was subtracted from those with enzymes to enable calculation of the radioactivity incorporated into lactate (fraction with lactate dehydrogenase) and lactate plus pyruvate (fraction with both enzymes). [14C]Lactate and [14C]pyruvate were processed through companion columns to estimate the recovery of these compounds. Recovery was always greater then 80%. The unwashed mitochondrial pellet from about 2,000 islets was incubated in the presence of [1-14C]pyruvate exactly as described above, except that the microcentrifuge test tube containing the incubation mixture was maintained in a rubber-stoppered scintillation vial. After 30 min at 37°C, 0.5 ml of tissue solubilizer was added to the scintillation vial and 60 μl of 0.92 M perchloric acid was added to the incubation mixture in the microcentrifuge test tube. 14CO2 absorbed into the tissue solubilizer over 3 h was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described for studies with whole islets(1MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem.

The acid extract was removed from the protein pellet and neutralized with 30% KOH.

Therefore we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to determine whether Iip31 possesses novel protein targeting signals. Our results indicate that two di-leucine-like pairs mediate Iip31 targeting and that an acidic amino acid residue four or five residues N-terminal to each Iip31 di-leucine-like pair is required for endocytic targeting. Results from additional testing with hybrid Iip31 molecules indicate that the acidic residues N-terminal to di-leucine pairs are critical for accumulation of these molecules in large endocytic vesicles and in some cases provide a structure favorable for internalization. The acidic residues N-terminal to di-leucine pairs are important in some sequence contexts in providing a structure favorable for internalization, whereas in other contexts an acidic residue is critical for targeting to, and formation of, large endocytic vesicles. Although our results do not support the idea that Iip31 possesses unique protein targeting motifs, they do suggest that di-leucine motifs may be recognized as part of a larger secondary structure. In addition, our data imply that the targeting motif requirements for internalization may differ from the requirements for further transport in the endocytic pathway.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility complexCD-M6PR and CI-M6PRcation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, respectivelyLIMPlysosomal integral membrane proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineTGNtrans-Golgi network. class II molecules are expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and present primarily antigenic peptides derived from exogenous proteins to helper T cells (for review see Neefjes and Ploegh, 1992; Germain and Margulies, 1993; Germain, 1994; and Cresswell, 1994). The Iip31 molecule is a type II transmembrane protein that associates with MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and limits binding of these molecules to antigenic peptides (Roche and Cresswell, 1990; Teyton et al., 1990) while escorting them (Bakke and Dobberstein, 1990; Lotteau et al., 1990) to a specialized endosomal compartment (Peters et al., 1991; Amigorena et al., 1994; Tulp et al., 1994; West et al., 1994; Qui et al., 1994). In this compartment Ii is released, and class II molecules bind peptides before appearing at the cell surface. We wished to determine the precise targeting information in the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail and in particular whether Iip31 contains a novel targeting motif that may explain the transport of MHC class II molecules to a specialized endocytic compartment dedicated to peptide loading. major histocompatibility complex cation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, respectively lysosomal integral membrane protein phosphate-buffered saline trans-Golgi network. Previous studies have demonstrated that information contained in the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail is both necessary and sufficient for Iip31 targeting to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Deletion analyses showed that the first 16 amino acid residues were required for Iip31 endosomal/lysosomal targeting (Bakke and Dobberstein, 1990; Lotteau et al., 1990). Site-directed mutagenesis localized two signals in the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail which could independently target invariant chain to the endosomal system; one signal contains leucine and isoleucine at positions 7 and 8 of the tail (Pieters et al., 1993). The second signal contains methionine and leucine at positions 16 and 17 (Odorizzi et al., 1994; Bremnes et al., 1994). These Ii targeting motifs are part of a larger family of di-leucine-related targeting motifs that mediate lysosomal targeting and internalization from the cell surface (for review see Sandoval and Bakke, 1994). Di-leucine-related signals have been described for T lymphocyte antigen receptor CD3 γ and δ chains (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992), cation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CD-M6PR and CI-M6PR, respectively; Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992a, 1992b; Chen et al., 1993), interferon-γ receptor (Farrar and Schreiber, 1993), lysosomal integral membrane protein (LIMP) II (Ogata and Fukuda, 1994; Sandoval et al., 1994), glucose transporter 4 (Verhey and Birnbaum, 1994), T lymphocyte cell surface CD4 molecule (Aiken et al., 1994), and Iip31 (Odorizzi et al., 1994; Bremnes et al., 1994). Di-leucine-related variants that permit different degrees of LIMP II lysosomal targeting include Leu-Ile, Leu-Val, and Ile-Ile, whereas Val-Ile does not target LIMP II to lysosomes (Ogata and Fukuda, 1994; Sandoval et al., 1994). Substitution of alanine for one or both hydrophobic residues abrogates lysosomal localization and internalization. In this report we use alanine scan mutagenesis to ascertain the sequence requirements for Iip31 targeting of class II molecules to a specialized endosomal compartment. Our analysis confirmed earlier studies demonstrating the importance of two di-leucine-like motifs for internalization of Ii from the cell surface and intracellular targeting to large vesicular endosomal structures. In addition, we uncovered a second critical component: an acidic amino acid residue four or five residues N-terminal to each of these di-leucine-like signals which is required for efficient targeting. By constructing hybrid molecules of Iip31 containing heterologous di-leucine-based signals and using alanine substitution analyses we have shown that acidic residues are required for the formation of the large endocytic vesicles induced by Iip31 expression. Thus, the di-leucine-based pair is part of a larger internalization and endocytic targeting motif that includes an N-terminal acidic residue. In accordance with the tyrosine-based internalization motifs, we suggest that the secondary structure of the di-leucine-containing cytoplasmic tails is an important part of the recognition motif. Targeting of Ii to the compartment for peptide loading is discussed in light of these findings. The cDNAs encoding full-length Iip31 and the Δ2-16Ii N-terminal deletion mutant in the pCMU IV expression vector are as described (Lotteau et al., 1990). All additional cDNAs encoding human Iip31 with mutant cytoplasmic tails were constructed by oligonucleotide cassette cloning using the SalI site introduced at codon 19 of the wild-type Iip31 cDNA (Lotteau et al., 1990). The first 57 nucleotides of this cDNA were removed by cleaving with XbaI and SalI, and the resulting 4.7-kilobase fragment was electrophoresed and purified using the GeneClean II kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides encoding the mutant sequences were then ligated with this fragment. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Gene Assembler (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pre RPC/HR5/5 column (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, oligonucleotides in 1 ml of ammonium hydroxide were applied to an NAP-10 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with 1.4 ml of H2O. All cDNA constructs in pCMU IV were sequenced by fluorescent dye terminator sequencing. HeLa cells were grown in cDMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (8%; Biowhittaker), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)). Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method essentially as described (Schutze et al., 1994). Monoclonal antibody BU45 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), recognizing an epitope in the human Ii lumenal domain, was labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T method as follows. The antibody was transferred to PBS by adding 200 μl (40 μg) of BU45 to 2.3 ml of PBS and applying the antibody to a Centricon 30 filtration device (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to recover 50 μl of BU45. For the iodination reaction, 50 μl of BU45 was incubated with 1 mCi of Na125I (10 μl, Amersham Corp.) and 10 μl of chloramine T (4.2 mg/ml in 250 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) for 1 min, then with 5 μl of sodium bisulfide (4.3 mg/ml in 250 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) for 2 min. Five hundred μl of KI (100 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4) was added, and the mixture was applied to a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Fractions (300 μl each) were collected, and fractions 10-12, containing the 125I-labeled BU45, were pooled. Typically, the reaction yielded 50-70%125I incorporation, with a specific activity of about 2 × 107 cpm/μg of BU45. Two days after transfection, HeLa cells in 100-mm dishes were treated with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended with 9 ml of cDMEM. One-ml aliquots were distributed into six-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY), and cells were cultured for 12-18 h. Cells were washed on ice three times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), then incubated with 5 × 106 cpm of 125I-labeled BU45 in cold PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 ml/well, for 1 h. Cells were washed four times with 3 ml of cold PBS, then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES at 37°C, 5% CO2, or on ice. After incubation at 37°C, plates were placed on ice, and the cells were washed once with cold PBS. Incubation with cold acid (0.5 M acetic acid in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 2.5; 0.5 ml/well) for 7 min removed the remaining cell surface-bound 125Ilabeled BU45. Addition of 2 ml of PBS neutralized the acid. The acid wash was removed, and cells were washed with 1 ml PBS, which was added to the original acid wash. Cells were lysed with 1 N NaOH. For each transfectant at each time point, the percentage of internalized 125I-BU45 was calculated as ((A - B)/(A - B + C)) × 100, where A = cpm in the cell lysate of acid-washed cells incubated at 37°C, B = cpm in the cell lysate of the corresponding acid-washed cells incubated at 4°C, and C = cpm in the acid wash of cells incubated at 37°C. In all cases, the acid wash removed >95% of the initial cell surface-bound 125I-BU45. Background binding of 125I-labeled BU45 to nontransfected HeLa cells in 35-mm dishes at 4°C was always less than 1,000 cpm. HeLa cells were transiently transfected as described above. To detect Ii, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was done essentially as described (Jackson et al., 1990), except that antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0.2% bovine skin gelatin (Sigma) and 0.2% saponin (Sigma), and coverslips were washed three times between staining steps with PBS/gelatin/saponin solution. Cells were stained with rabbit antiserum C351 (generously provided by Dr. Vito Quaranta, the Scripps Research Institute) to the Ii lumenal domain sequence KESLELEDPSSGLGVTKDL, followed by fluorescein-conjugated, affinity-purified goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (Cappell Laboratories, Malvern, PA). The Iip31 cytoplasmic tail contains two independent di-leucine-based pairs, Leu-Ile and Met-Leu, which direct internalization and endocytic targeting of Iip31 or heterologous extracytoplasmic domains 2L. Pond, unpublished results. (Odorizzi et al., 1994; Bremnes et al., 1994). To define further the sequence requirements for di-leucine-based internalization and endocytic targeting, we selectively altered the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail sequence and used two assays to measure the targeting of Iip31 cytoplasmic tail mutants to the endocytic compartment. First, we measured Iip31 internalization from the cell surface of transiently transfected HeLa cells by quantitating the uptake of cell surface-bound 125I-labeled BU45 antibody to Ii as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We used intact BU45 antibody, as it has been shown that internalization of 125I-labeled BU45 and of 125I-labeled BU45 Fab fragments is equivalent (Roche et al., 1993). Second, we analyzed the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant Iip31 molecules by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The precise location in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway in which Iip31 accumulates at steady state remains controversial. The observation that Iip31 colocalizes with endocytic markers (Romagnoli et al., 1993) and with lysosomal-associated membrane protein (Pieters et al., 1993) 3L. Pond, unpublished observation. suggests that it is located in late endosomes or lysosomes. We tested deletion mutants for internalization and vesicular targeting to determine if the di-leucine-like pair forms a complete targeting motif or if additional residues are required. The Δ2-7Ii deletion mutant (Table 1), which retains the Met-Leu pair and contains the di-leucine-like pair Met-Ile at its N terminus, was internalized at a rate similar to wild-type Iip31 (Fig. 1). The Δ2-11Ii deletion mutant (Table 1) retains the Met-Leu pair, and its internalization rate was also similar to wild-type Iip31 (Fig. 1). In contrast, the Δ2-13Ii, Δ2-16Ii, and Δ2-26Ii deletion mutants were not internalized (Fig. 1). As expected, the Δ2-26Ii mutant lacking both di-leucine-based pairs was not internalized. In the Δ2-16Ii mutant, placement of the Met-Leu pair at the cytoplasmic tail N terminus might compromise the internalization signal, as was the case with the Leu-Ile pair at the C terminus of the LIMP II cytoplasmic tail (Ogata and Fukuda, 1994). The Δ2-13Ii mutant, however, contained the Met-Leu pair four residues from the N terminus, and yet it was not internalized. These data suggest that amino acid residues N-terminal to the di-leucine-based pairs are necessary for Iip31 internalization.Table I Open table in a new tab Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the wild-type Iip31 molecules localized to large vesicles (Fig. 2A) and the cell surface (data not shown). The Δ2-7Ii molecules were present predominantly in small vesicles and the cell surface, although some cells contained Δ2-7Ii molecules in large vesicles (data not shown). The Δ2-11Ii molecules were present in small vesicles (data not shown) in accordance with previous reports for Δ2-11Ii molecules (Bakke and Dobberstein, 1990). The Δ2-13Ii, Δ2-16Ii, and Δ2-26Ii molecules were not detected in vesicles but were present at the cell surface (data not shown). The presence of Δ2-11Ii molecules in small but not large vesicles suggests that Iip31 cytoplasmic tail sequences, in addition to lumenal domain sequences2 (Bremnes et al., 1994), are necessary for large vesicle formation. To assess the role of Iip31 cytoplasmic tail amino acid residues in forming an internalization motif, alanine substitutions were made individually at positions 2-15 (Table 1). Because the Iip31 tail contains two independent di-leucine-based pairs, we considered residues 1-8 and 9-17 separately. Therefore, to quantitate the effects of alanine substitutions at residues 1-8 with respect to the Leu-Ile pair, we mutated the Met-Leu pair to Ser-Ser. Similarly, to assess the effects of alanine substitutions at positions 9-17 with respect to the Met-Leu pair, we used as our parent molecule Iip31 with the Leu-Ile pair mutated to Ser-Ser. Mutation of either the Leu-Ile or Met-Leu pair to Ser-Ser had little or no effect on the Iip31 internalization rate (Fig. 1). Substitution of alanine for Iip31 residues Asp3, Leu7, or Ile8 abolished internalization, whereas mutation of Asp2 to alanine dramatically decreased the internalization rate mediated by the Leu-Ile pair (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the internalization rates of Iip31 molecules containing an alanine substitution at residue Gln4, Arg5, Asp6, or Ser9 was comparable to the internalization rate of the parent M16S,L17S Iip31 molecule (Fig. 3A). Similarly, for the Met-Leu pair, replacement of residue Glu12 with alanine eliminated internalization, but replacement of residue Ser9, Asn10, Gln13, or Leu14 with alanine resulted in mutant Iip31 molecules that were internalized (Fig. 3B). Replacing residue Asn11 or Pro15 with alanine decreased the L7S,I8S Ii internalization rate by 40-50% relative to wild-type Iip31 (Fig. 3B). Indirect immunofluorescence showed that all internalized mutant Iip31 molecules in the alanine scan series were present in large vesicles (data not shown), whereas noninternalized mutant Iip31 molecules concentrated at the cell surface and were not detected in vesicles (data not shown). Thus, to function as internalization and endosomal targeting signals for Iip31, residues Asp2 and Asp3 are essential for the Leu-Ile pair, and residue Glu12 is essential for the Met-Leu pair. To assess further the requirements for Iip31 internalization, we tested the effects of conservative substitutions, and substitution of polar but uncharged residues, for the acidic amino acid residues. The internalization rates of mutants D2E and D3E containing only the Leu-Ile pair, and of mutant E12D containing only the Met-Leu pair (Table 1), did not differ from the parent M16S,L17S and L7S,I8S mutants, respectively (Fig. 4). Thus, aspartic acid and glutamic acid are functionally interchangeable at positions 2, 3, and 12 in the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail. The D2N,M16S,L17S and D3N,M16S,L17S mutants were not internalized (Fig. 4), indicating that an isoteric polar, uncharged residue is not permissible at position 2 or 3. Likewise, substitution of glutamine for Glu12 abolished internalization mediated by the Met-Leu pair (Fig. 4). Substitution of polar, uncharged residues for the acidic residues yielded molecules expressed predominantly at the cell surface with no detectable vesicular localization (data not shown). Thus, isoteric polar residues cannot substitute for the critical acidic residues necessary for recognition of the two Iip31 internalization and endosomal targeting signals. Seven of 10 di-leucine-based signals known to mediate internalization contain acidic residues N-terminal to the di-leucine pair (Table 2). To determine whether acidic residues are required for internalization mediated by these di-leucine signals, we selectively replaced the five amino acid residues N-terminal to the Iip31 Leu-Ile pair. Because previous work has shown that the two Iip31 motifs can function when separated (Bakke et al., 1993) and because there are only two amino acid residues C-terminal to the LIMP II Leu-Ile pair, we limited our analyses to N-terminal motif residues. In this way, we could compare different di-leucine-based signals in the context of one reporter molecule, Iip31. We chose sequences from three di-leucine-based signals which contain acidic residues N-terminal to the di-leucine pair: LIMP II, bovine CI-M6PR, and CD3 γ. We also included the CD4 signal, which has no acidic residue in the five residues N-terminal to the di-leucine pair. We made replacements without altering the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail length. In each hybrid the Met-Leu pair was mutated to Ser-Ser to eliminate any contribution of this pair to Iip31 sorting. We then assessed the effects of alanine substitutions within these sequences on Ii internalization and endosomal targeting.Table II Open table in a new tab The cytoplasmic tail of the type I transmembrane protein LIMP II contains two acidic residues and a Leu-Ile pair in a sequence context similar to the Iip31 signals (Table 2). To test whether acidic amino acid residues in the LIMP II cytoplasmic tail are required for di-leucine-based targeting, we made a LIMP II-Ii hybrid tail. To create the hybrid, we substituted part of the LIMP II cytoplasmic tail for residues 2-6 of the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 5A and Table 3). We then assessed Ii internalization and endosomal targeting mediated by the transplanted wild-type LIMP II sequence and alanine scan mutants of this sequence. Substitution of the LIMP II cytoplasmic tail sequence ERAP for the Iip31 tail sequence DQRD, and mutation of Met-Leu to Ser-Ser, gave an internalization rate equal to that of the parent M16S,L17S mutant (Fig. 5A). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that this substitution mutant localized to large endosomal vesicles (Fig. 2B), similar to wild-type Iip31 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, alanine substitution at LIMP II residue Asp2, Glu3, Arg4, or Pro6 had no effect on the Iip31 internalization rate (Fig. 5A) or localization to large endosomal vesicles (data not shown). Changing both N-terminal acidic amino acid residues to alanine in the MAARAPLISNNEQLPSS mutant also did not alter the internalization rate from that of the wild-type LIMP II sequence (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, this mutant was localized to smaller vesicles present throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C) but not to the large perinuclear vesicles seen with Iip31 (Fig. 2A). Our previous results showed that acidic residues C-terminal to di-leucine-like pairs appear not to be required for internalization (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, by mutating residue Glu12 of the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail to alanine, we determined the importance of its presence for internalization of the LIMP II-Ii hybrid molecule. The mutant Ii molecules containing the sequence MAARAPLISNNAQLPSS were internalized as efficiently as Ii molecules containing the wild-type LIMP II sequence (Fig. 5B) but were localized to smaller vesicles similar to those seen with the MAARAPLISNNEQLPSS mutant (data not shown). From these data, we conclude that the LIMP II sequence acts as an internalization signal in the context of the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail. Although the LIMP II N-terminal acidic amino acid residues are not required for internalization, they are important for formation of the large Ii-containing endosomal vesicles.Table III Open table in a new tab We made further mutations in the LIMP II signal to determine which features of this signal are critical for internalization. Having found that the sequence MAARAPLISNNEQLPSS gave the wild-type internalization rate, we made the mutants MAARAALISNNEQLPSS and MAAAAPLISNNEQLPSS and found that Ii hybrid molecules containing these mutant cytoplasmic tails were internalized at approximately half the rate of hybrid molecules containing the wild-type LIMP II signal (Fig. 5B). Mutation of residues 2-6 to alanines, resulting in the mutant MAAAAALISNNEQLPSS, abrogated internalization (Fig. 5B). Thus, MAARAP constitutes a permissive, minimal sequence N-terminal to the Leu-Ile pair required to achieve the wild-type Iip31 internalization rate. We next replaced residues 2-8 of the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail with residues from one of the bovine CI-M6PR di-leucine-based signals, DDRVGLV (see Table 2). Like the LIMP II di-leucine-based signal, this CI-M6PR signal contains acidic residues and a di-leucine signal in a sequence context similar to the Iip31 signals. The wild-type CI-M6PR signal confers Ii internalization (Fig. 6) and large vesicle formation (Fig. 2D). Alanine scan mutagenesis of this CI-M6PR signal showed that mutation of the Asp3 or Leu7 residues, but not the Asp2, Arg4, Val5, or Gly6 residues, abrogated internalization (Fig. 6) and large vesicle formation (Table 3). Thus, the bovine CI-M6PR signal DDRVGLV is similar to the Iip31 di-leucine-based signals in that an acidic residue four residues N-terminal to the di-leucine pair is critical for its recognition, but different in that mutation of the Asp2 residue to alanine had no effect on internalization or large vesicle formation. The CD3 γ chain contains the di-leucine-based signal SDKQTLL, which mediates internalization and enhances lysosomal degradation of the Tac lumenal domain (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992). Replacement of the N-terminal Iip31 di-leucine-based signal with the wild-type CD3 γ signal showed that the CD3 γ signal mediates Ii internalization at approximately the wild-type Iip31 rate (Fig. 7) and allows for large vesicle formation (Fig. 2E). Alanine scan mutagenesis showed that individually mutating residues 2-6 had little or no effect on the internalization rate (Fig. 7). As expected, mutation of Leu7 to alanine abolished internalization (Fig. 7). Mutation to alanine of residue Asp3 or Leu7, but not Ser2, Lys4, Gln5, or Thr6 also prevented large vesicle formation (Fig. 2F and Table 3). These results show that single alanine substitutions N-terminal to the di-leucine pair in the CD3 γ signal do not affect the Ii internalization rate. Acidic residue Asp3, however, is necessary for large vesicle formation but not for internalization mediated by the CD3 γ signal. Lastly, we replaced the Iip31 N-terminal di-leucine-based signal with the CD4 sequence SQIKRLL. The resulting hybrid molecule was internalized slightly faster than the wild-type Iip31 molecule (Fig. 8A). Alanine scan mutagenesis showed that substitution of residues Ser2, Gln3, Ile4, or Lys5 with alanine had little effect on the internalization rate (Fig. 8A). Mutation of residue Arg6 to alanine decreased the internalization rate by about half, compared with the wild-type CD4 sequence, and mutation of residue Lue7 to alanine abrogated internalization (Fig. 8A). Indirect immunofluorescence showed that hybrid Ii molecules containing the wild-type CD4 signal or its alanine substitution mutants were present on the cell surface and in small vesicles (Fig. 2G and Table 3), but in no case were large vesicles detected (Table 3). We therefore sought to reconstitute large vesicle formation by replacing one or both of the CD4 residues Ser2 and Gln3 with aspartic acid residues. Hybrid CD4-Ii molecules containing the modified CD4 signals were internalized at a rate similar to molecules containing the wild-type CD4 signal (Fig. 8B) but were localized to small vesicles and the cell surface, with no large vesicles detected (Fig. 2H and Table 3). Thus, aspartic acid residues in this sequence context do not permit large vesicle formation. In this report, we performed extensive alanine scan mutagenesis of sequences N-terminal to di-leucine-like pairs in the MHC class II-associated Iip31 molecule, and on four other cell surface receptors. Our results suggest that internalization and targeting within the endocytic pathway require different targeting motifs. Mutation to alanine of an acidic residue, but not the other residues immediately N-terminal to the di-leucine pair, abolished large endocytic vesicle formation and, in some cases, internalization. These results show that residues N-terminal to the di-leucine-based pairs are part of a larger motif recognized by the intracellular targeting machinery and that the sequences surrounding the di-leucine pair, in particular N-terminal acidic residues, are involved in targeting within the endocytic compartment. Our data show that residues 2-8 of the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail constitute one internalization motif, and residues 12-17 constitute a second motif. Indeed, Iip31 cytoplasmic tail residues 1-11 and 12-30 can separately confer internalization to hybrid molecules with the neuraminidase transmembrane and lumenal domains (Bakke O. et al., 1993). Furthermore, we note similarities in the two Iip31 signals (Table 2). We have also shown that when the Met-Leu pair is mutated to Ser-Ser, mutation of amino acid residues Asp2 or Asp3 to alanine abrogates internalization with respect to the Leu-Ile pair. Although residue Glu12 is present, it apparently cannot substitute for the Asp2 or Asp3 residues. Similarly, when amino acid residue Glu12 is mutated to alanine and the Leu-Ile pair is mutated to Ser-Ser, residues Asp2 and Asp3 cannot provide the acidic residue needed for internalization mediated by the Met-Leu pair. Thus, the two Iip31 internalization motifs are functionally separate. MHC class II and Iip31 molecules are targeted to a specialized endosomal compartment where class II molecules bind antigenic peptides (see the Introduction). We were interested in determining if the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail has a novel signal for targeting to this compartment. Our results show that the LIMP II and CI-M6PR di-leucine-based signals can mediate targeting to the same or similar vesicular compartments as wild-type Iip31. Therefore, we suggest that the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail does not contain novel sequence information for targeting to the compartment for peptide loading and therefore that other molecules with di-leucine-based signals have access to this compartment. Whether class II molecules influence targeting of class II molecule-Iip31 complexes to this compartment remains to be tested. Using the Ii molecule in HeLa cells, we have shown that two di-leucine-based signals in the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail produced approximately the same internalization rates as single signals alone. Our results are generally in agreement with those of Bremnes et al.(1994), who found that mutation of the Leu-Ile pair to Ala-Ile decreased only slightly the internalization rate of Ii-neuraminidase hybrid molecules in the CV-1 simian fibroblast cell line. In contrast, two YTRF motifs at specific locations in the transferrin receptor cytoplasmic tail clearly confer twice the internalization rate of one motif (Collawn et al., 1993). This result indicates that the sorting machinery can simultaneously recognize two aromatic residue-based motifs if there is a sufficient number of residues separating the motifs and if they are in structurally similar environments. Moreover, in chick embryo fibroblasts, mutation of one of the two Iip31 di-leucine-like pairs to Ala-Ala decreased by 50% the internalization rate of hybrid molecules containing the Iip31 cytoplasmic tail and transferrin receptor transmembrane and lumenal domains (Odorizzi et al., 1994). One hypothesis to explain these contrasting results is that different cell types have differing abilities to recognize two di-leucine motifs in one cytoplasmic tail. This theoretical difference regarding internalization motifs across cell types and species has been demonstrated experimentally. For example, the tyrosine motif analog NPVF mediates low density lipoprotein receptor internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Davis et al., 1987) but not in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Matter et al., 1994). A second hypothesis is that the transferrin receptor and Ii lumenal or transmembrane domains themselves influence the internalization rate. Precedence for this hypothesis is suggested by data showing that the M6PR lumenal domain influences receptor recycling and residence time within endosomes (Dintzis et al., 1994). We examined internalization and large vesicle formation mediated by several di-leucine signals and their five adjacent N-terminal amino acid residues in the context of the Ii cytoplasmic tail. In the Iip31 and CI-M6PR signals, acidic residues four or five residues N-terminal to the di-leucine-like pairs were required for Ii internalization and large vesicle formation. In the LIMP II and CD3 γ chain signals, N-terminal acidic residues were required for large vesicle formation but not for internalization. Since substitution of acidic residues in the CD4 signal did not reconstitute large vesicle formation, we concluded that acidic residues alone are insufficient for formation of large endocytic vesicles. Together, these data show that internalization from the cell surface does not require acidic residues N-terminal to di-leucine-like pairs but that the acidic residues in certain sequence contexts influence sorting within the endocytic pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that acidic residues, in a specific structural context, combine with the di-leucine-like pair to signal vesicle targeting and that this same structure is appropriate for internalization. Our hypothesis suggests that part of one motif may be recognized for internalization and another part for vesicular targeting. This hypothesis is consistent with the possibility that recognition of di-leucine-based signals at the cell surface and within the endosomal pathway is mediated by different molecules. Targeting of internalized molecules to endocytic subcompartments may then depend on the amino acid sequences surrounding the di-leucine pair. Cytoplasmic tail acidic residues in other sequence contexts may be involved in other intracellular targeting processes. For example, basolateral targeting, but not internalization, mediated by cytoplasmic tail sequences of the type I transmembrane protein low density lipoprotein receptor is influenced by acidic residues C-terminal to its tyrosine-based targeting motif (Matter et al., 1994). This observation suggests that although basolateral targeting and internalization sequences may overlap, the motifs for the two processes are distinct. These results are analogous to our observations that N-terminal acidic residues are not always required for di-leucine-based internalization but are required for large vesicle formation. Interestingly, basolateral targeting mediated by the Fc receptor II di-leucine-based signal does not appear to need acidic residues, as determined by analyses of truncation and alanine scan mutants (Hunziker and Fumey, 1994). An alternative hypothesis is that the acidic residues are not required for Iip31 targeting to a specialized endocytic compartment per se but that they are required for large vesicle formation after Ii entry into an endocytic subcompartment. Immunofluorescence studies have shown previously that large vesicles staining for Iip31 are also enriched with late endosomal or lysosomal markers such as CI-M6PR or lysosomal-associated membrane protein molecules (Lotteau et al., 1990; Romagnoli et al., 1993; Pieters et al., 1993). Large vesicle formation induced by Iip31 expression is time-dependent after Iip31 transfection (Pieters et al., 1993), indicating that a critical level of Iip31 accumulation must be reached before large vesicles form. The mechanism by which these large endocytic vesicles form is not known. The Iip31 molecule may alter endosome/lysosome morphology, perhaps by multimerizing and interfering with protein trafficking as suggested previously (Romagnoli et al., 1993). We note that overexpression of rab5 (Bucci et al., 1992) or rab22 (Olkkonen et al., 1993) proteins, which are localized to early and late endosomes and the plasma membrane, also causes large vesicle formation, perhaps by inducing endosomal clustering and fusion. Therefore, another possible mechanism for large vesicle formation in Iip31-expressing cells is that acidic residues in the Iip31 tail mimic a signal recognized for fusion of vesicles in the endosomal compartment. Knowledge of the mechanism by which these large vesicles form may provide insight into the regulation of protein trafficking within the endocytic compartment. The Iip31 molecules might enter the endosomal/lysosomal compartment either directly from the TGN or by internalization from the cell surface. The relative contributions of these two routes for Iip31 is presently not known. Odorizzi et al.(1994) estimate that more than 80% of hybrid molecules containing the Iip31 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and the transferrin receptor lumenal domain are delivered intracellularly from the TGN to the endocytic pathway. For the CI-M6PR and CD-M6PR, which contain tyrosine-based and di-leucine-based targeting motifs, mutation or deletion of the di-leucine pair did not alter their internalization rates, but drastically reduced correct sorting of lysosomal enzymes (Lobel et al., 1989; Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992a). These results suggest that di-leucine motifs mediate direct sorting of CD-M6PR from the TGN to late endosomes. In this report and others (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992; Ogata and Fukuda, 1994; Pieters et al., 1993; Aiken et al., 1994), di-leucine-based motifs were shown to mediate internalization from the cell surface. Moreover, internalization of the CD4 molecule and of the CD3 γ-Tac hybrid is likely to proceed via clathrin-coated pits (Pelchen-Matthews et al., 1991; Letourneur and Klausner, 1992). Thus, it is likely that the di-leucine motif is recognized at the TGN and at the cell surface. This suggestion raises further questions. Are the proteins recognizing the same di-leucine motifs at the TGN as at the cell surface? Are these proteins the same as the adaptin complexes that recognize aromatic residue-based internalization motifs (Glickman et al., 1989). The results described here provide insight into the minimal requirements for Iip31 internalization and endocytic targeting mediated by its two di-leucine-based signals. Our results show that acidic residues are required for targeting of Ii within the endosomal compartment, that internalization is not determined solely by the di-leucine-like pairs, and that nearby residues also contribute to efficient internalization. If all di-leucine-based motifs are recognized by the same targeting molecules, it is probable that a common secondary structure exists. Future studies will determine the validity of this hypothesis. The sequence requirements for the di-leucine-based signals are strikingly different from the aromatic residue-based signals, although parallels may yet exist between the di-leucine-based motif structure and the aromatic residue-based motif β-turn or nascent α-helical structure. The discovery that di-leucine-based signals responsible for internalization and endosomal targeting involve a larger motif helps explain the specificity of the molecular recognition events required for protein sorting.

https://openalex.org/W1990051527,"We have expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> functionally active proteins encoded by two human cDNAs that were isolated previously by using rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase cDNA as the probe. The expressed proteins catalyzed the interconversion between 5α-dihydrotestosterone and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol. Therefore, we name these two enzymes type I and type II 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The type I enzyme has a high affinity for dihydrotestosterone, whereas the type II enzyme has a low affinity for the substrate. The tissue-specific distribution of these two enzymes was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers. The mRNA transcript of the type I enzyme was found only in the liver, whereas that of the type II enzyme appeared in the brain, kidney, liver, lung, placenta, and testis. The structure and sequence of the genes encoding these two 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases were determined by analysis of genomic clones that were isolated from a λ EMBL3 SP6/T7 library. The genes coding for the type I and type II enzymes were found to span approximately 20 and 16 kilobase pairs, respectively, and to consist of 9 exons of the same sizes and boundaries. The exons range in size from 77 to 223 base pairs (bp), whereas the introns range in size from 375 bp to approximately 6 kilobase pairs. The type I gene contains a TATA box that is located 27 bp upstream of multiple transcription start sites. In contrast, the type II gene contains two tandem AP2 sequences juxtaposed to a single transcription start site."

The transmembrane component of the adherens junction is a member of the classic cadherin family; these proteins mediate homotypic cell-cell adhesion(7Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev.

The cDNA sequences of plakoglobin from a number of species have revealed close relationships to vertebrate β-catenins and to Drosophila armadillo, a segment polarity gene(19Butz S. Stappert J.

Developmental studies of armadillo mutants have suggested that the repeats in Armadillo contribute to its function in an additive manner and that the protein is modular(24Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that plakoglobin likewise functions as a modular protein. The fact that plakoglobin shares significant regions of homology with β-catenin (15Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Weischaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 19Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R.

Science. 1991; 254: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) is of particular interest in light of recent studies showing that cells express two types of cadherin-catenin complexes: a complex that contains predominantly β-catenin and one that contains predominantly plakoglobin(25Hinck L. Näthke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 26Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The consensus is that plakoglobin (or β-catenin) binds directly to cadherin and that α-catenin is associated with the cadherin through its association with plakoglobin (or β-catenin). Pulse-chase experiments in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells demonstrated that cadherin-catenin complexes are assembled by first loading plakoglobin (or β-catenin) onto the newly synthesized cadherin and that α-catenin associates with the complex as it arrives at the plasma membrane(25Hinck L. Näthke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Further evidence that β-catenin associates with cadherin in the absence of α-catenin was provided by studies in PC-9 cells, which do not express α-catenin but form complexes of β-catenin and cadherin(27Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Fujita S. Gotoh M. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar). These cells do not strongly adhere to one another, but when transfected with α-catenin, they adhere normally and form complexes that include α-catenin(28Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). α-Catenin is thought to provide a link between cadherin-β-catenin and the cytoskeleton. To examine further the interactions of plakoglobin with cadherin and α-catenin we have identified the regions of plakoglobin that are important in its interaction with the cadherin complex in living cells. We first identified a cell line, the human fibrosarcoma HT-1080(29Rasheed S. Nelson-Rees W.A. Toth E.M. Arnstein P. Gardner M.B. Cancer. 1974; 33: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), that forms a cadherin-catenin complex but produces only minuscule amounts of plakoglobin. We then transfected HT-1080 cells with full-length and truncated forms of plakoglobin and examined the transfectants for the association of plakoglobin with cadherin and/or α-catenin. With this approach we have been able to identify distinct regions of plakoglobin that interact with cadherin and α-catenin, supporting the notion that plakoglobin functions as a modular protein. The HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 121) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfectants were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 10−7M dexamethasone (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The full-length human plakoglobin clone in pBluescript (21Franke W.W. Goldschmidt M.D. Zimbelmann R. Mueller H.M. Schiller D.L. Cowin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Poulain-Godefroy O. Billotte J. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Fasel N. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used for these studies. For expression of full-length plakoglobin, the complete cDNA was inserted into pLKneo. The truncations at the unique SmaI, unique SphI, and most 5′ PstI sites were first done in pBluescript, and appropriate restriction fragments were ligated into pLKneo. Truncating the plakoglobin cDNA at these sites resulted in constructions retaining the NH2-terminal 572, 233, and 114 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). Exonuclease III deletions were made with the Erase-a-Base kit from Promega (Madison, WI) using the full-length pLKneo-plakoglobin construct as the starting plasmid. For all the clones described in the text, the extent of the deletion was determined by nucleotide sequencing. In the deletion clones, translation terminated in the SV-40 sequences downstream of the multiple cloning site in pLKneo. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. were used to prepare constructions terminating precisely at several repeat boundaries. The cDNA 3′ of the SphI site was replaced with a PCR product extending from the SphI site to the end of repeat 5, 7, or 8. The sequence of each the PCR products agreed with that of plakoglobin(21Franke W.W. Goldschmidt M.D. Zimbelmann R. Mueller H.M. Schiller D.L. Cowin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 1993; 207: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies 15F11 against plakoglobin and 13A9 against the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin were generated as described(32Johnson K.R. Lewis J.E. Li D. Wahl J. Soler A.P. Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding human N-cadherin (33Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. John Hemperly (Becton Dickinson and Company Research Center, Research Triangle Park, NC). Monolayers of cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and extracted on ice with 2 ml/75-cm2 flask 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, United Kingdom), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) was done according to the procedure of Laemmli(34Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Materials were from Bio-Rad. Molecular weight markers were from Sigma. SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as described(14Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of immunoblots was done using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer and Image Quant software. A 300-μl aliquot of cell extract was mixed with 300 μl of monoclonal antibody supernatant at 4°C. After 30 min 50 μl of packed anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Durham, NC) was added, and mixing was continued for 30 min. The Sepharose-bound immune complexes were washed 5 times with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20. The pellets were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments IgG purified from ascites fluid was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and used as the immunoprecipitating antibody. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed for 30 min in 1% paraformaldehyde buffered with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, and permeabilized with methanol. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum and 0.1 M glycine in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and exposed to antibodies for 1 h followed by species-specific second antibodies conjugated to fluorescein (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence. All pictures were taken using a ×40 objective and Kodak T-MAX 3200 film. To study the association of plakoglobin with the cadherin-catenin complex, we sought a cell line that expressed minimal amounts of plakoglobin yet was capable of making normal cell-cell contacts using a cadherin. The HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma fulfilled these criteria. Immunoblot analysis of HT-1080 cells (Fig. 2) showed that they express N-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin at high levels but express almost undetectable levels of plakoglobin (γ-catenin). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, N-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin were localized to cell-cell borders, while staining with anti-plakoglobin antibodies produced a faint, diffuse signal with no localization to a specific cellular compartment (not shown). When HT-1080 extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-α-catenin antibody and the products of the immunoprecipitation reaction immunoblotted with antibodies against N-cadherin and β-catenin, both N-cadherin and β-catenin were associated with α-catenin (data not shown). Thus, HT-1080 cells synthesize a complex containing N-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin, and such complexes are found at regions of cell-cell contact. When full-length plakoglobin was transfected into HT-1080 cells, it was localized at cell-cell borders, similar to α-catenin, β-catenin, and N-cadherin (data not shown). It also co-immunoprecipitated with both α-catenin and N-cadherin. Fig. 3 shows extracts of transfected and non-transfected cells that were immunoprecipitated with anti-α-catenin, anti-plakoglobin, or anti-N-cadherin antibodies and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-plakoglobin antibodies. The above results showed that, although HT-1080 cells formed cadherin-catenin complexes containing very little endogenous plakoglobin, transfectants readily incorporated plakoglobin into the cadherin complex. Thus, HT-1080 cells were shown to be an appropriate cell line in which to begin to map the functional domains of plakoglobin. HT-1080 cells do not synthesize desmosomal components (data not shown), so there are no complicating associations of plakoglobin with desmosomal cadherins. Deletions were generated by cutting the cDNA at selected restriction sites (Fig. 1), resulting in COOH-terminal truncations of plakoglobin that retained 572, 233, and 114 amino acids. Each deleted construct was transfected into HT-1080 cells, and clones were propagated. Cells were extracted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with 15F11 anti-plakoglobin antibody (Fig. 4). As described above, non-transfected cells have minimal amounts of plakoglobin, but full-length plakoglobin of about 82 kDa was expressed in transfected HT-1080 cells. Cells transfected with the construct retaining 572 amino acids produced a protein of approximately 60 kDa; cells transfected with the construct retaining 233 amino acids produced a protein of about 30 kDa; and cells transfected with the construct retaining 114 amino acids produced a protein of about 14 kDa. In each case the truncated plakoglobin was stably expressed at high levels. Immunoblots prepared from gels loaded with equal amounts of protein (Fig. 4) were quantitated with densitometry. These data showed that the concentrations of the 572-, 233-, and 114-amino acid constructs were, respectively, 1.9-, 2.7- and 2.6-fold more than that of full-length plakoglobin. All the other truncated plakoglobins used in this study were expressed at levels similar to those presented in Fig. 4. Immunofluorescence localization with anti-plakoglobin antibodies was performed on each cell line. The 572-amino acid construct (Fig. 5B) was found along the cell-cell borders, indistinguishable from the pattern seen with full-length plakoglobin (Fig. 5A). The distributions of the 233-amino acid and 114-amino acid constructs (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively) were distinctly different from those of full-length plakoglobin or the 572-amino acid construct. The two smaller fragments were found diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and not along cell-cell borders. As shown earlier, full-length plakoglobin co-immunoprecipitated with α-catenin and with N-cadherin (Fig. 3). Similar experiments were done in order to determine whether or not the truncated plakoglobins associated with these two proteins. It was found that the 572-amino acid construct co-immunoprecipitated with α-catenin as well as with N-cadherin (Fig. 6). Thus, the 572-amino acid truncation retained the sequences required for associating with each of these partners. When transfectants expressing the 233-amino acid construct were examined, the truncated plakoglobin was found associated with α-catenin but not with N-cadherin. Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8, shows the relevant immunoprecipitates immunoblotted with anti-plakoglobin antibody 15F11. The 233-amino acid construct migrated at about 30 kDa in the same portion of the SDS gel as the antibody light chains. The truncated plakoglobin was apparent in lane 8 when the immunoprecipitating antibody was anti-α-catenin. The 233-amino acid construct was not seen when the immunoprecipitating antibody was anti-N-cadherin (lane 7). Thus, the 233-amino acid construct was not able to stably bind N-cadherin, showing that the ability to bind N-cadherin is provided, at least in part, by amino acids 233-572 of plakoglobin. For these and the following experiments we used 1G5 anti-α-catenin ascites fluid conjugated to Sepharose as the immunoprecipitating reagent, which resulted in an increased background due to binding of the labeled secondary antibody. In order to more closely map the sequences necessary for interaction with N-cadherin, we prepared exonuclease III deletions resulting in proteins that retained 233-572 amino acids of plakoglobin. Immunoprecipitations with antibodies against N-cadherin demonstrated that, as the plakoglobin molecule became shorter, the association with N-cadherin became less evident. Fig. 6 compares the levels of truncated plakoglobins associated with N-cadherin to the levels associated with α-catenin. Comparison of lanes 1, 3, and 5 of Fig. 6 revealed a gradual decrease in the ability of the constructs to associate with N-cadherin. The truncation retaining 375 amino acids was just able to stably interact with N-cadherin. Data obtained from clones expressing a 421-amino acid construct supported this gradual decline in association with N-cadherin (not shown). Immunofluorescence localization showed cell border staining in cells expressing the 472-amino acid construct, with some cytoplasmic signal. Cell border staining was not evident in cells expressing the 375-amino acid construct. To address the question of whether or not the borders of the Armadillo repeats delineated functional domains, we used PCR to generate truncations terminating precisely at the ends of repeats 5, 7, and 8 (amino acids 334, 414, and 458, respectively). Table 1 presents the immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation data generated by all of our constructs. The ability of these shortened molecules to compete with endogenous β-catenin for binding to N-cadherin suggests that the amino acids from 376 to 414 (comprising repeats 7 and 8) are particularly important for interaction with N-cadherin.Table I Open table in a new tab When cells expressing the 114-amino acid construct were extracted and immunoprecipitated, neither the anti-N-cadherin (not shown) nor the anti-α-catenin immunoprecipitate included the 114-amino acid construct (Fig. 7), although the protein was present in the cell extract (lane 6, indicated by an arrow). Thus at least one region of plakoglobin required for interaction with α-catenin resides between amino acids 114 and 233. Fig. 7 also shows that when plakoglobin was truncated at 161 amino acids it readily associated with α-catenin, but, when truncated at 133 amino acids, the association was barely detected. These data suggest that the 47 residues from amino acids 115 to 161 play a major role in association with α-catenin with the 19 amino acids from 115 to 133 allowing weak association. All of the deletions used in these experiments as well as the regions of plakoglobin that likely interact with α-catenin and N-cadherin are presented in Table 1 and shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. To function in cell-cell adhesion, the transmembrane cadherin molecule must be associated with the cytoskeleton via the cytoplasmic catenins. The COOH-terminal 70 amino acids of classical cadherins have been shown to be necessary for association with the catenins(12Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but less is known of the domains of the catenins that allow them to associate with the cadherin molecule or with one another. In this study we show that distinct regions of plakoglobin allow its association with N-cadherin and with α-catenin. The localization of N-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin to cell-cell borders implies that HT-1080 cells interact with one another via their cadherins. However, the cells form an adhesion complex that contains only minute amounts of plakoglobin. Since the endogenous plakoglobin does not localize to cell-cell borders, HT-1080 cells apparently do not need plakoglobin in the cadherin-catenin complex in order to form cell-cell contacts. In AtT20 cells (25Hinck L. Näthke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells(26Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), data have been presented showing that cadherin-catenin complexes contain either β-catenin or plakoglobin but not both. The sequence similarity between β-catenin and plakoglobin suggests they may be able to substitute for one another and perhaps perform similar functions in the cadherin-catenin complex. The two molecules are not interchangeable, however, since plakoglobin, but not β-catenin, associates with desmoglein and desmocollin. Perhaps because HT-1080 cells do not form desmosomes, β-catenin alone is sufficient to provide the necessary functions for cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly, we could not detect obvious morphological or behavioral differences in cells transfected with plakoglobin. Thus, complexes containing plakoglobin appear not to confer a distinct phenotype in HT-1080 cells. As mentioned earlier, plakoglobin is a member of the armadillo family of proteins(40Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The effects of carboxyl-terminal truncations of Armadillo on the development of Drosophila larvae were studied by Peifer and Wieschaus(24Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). When the severity of each mutation was scored using time of embryonic lethality as a parameter, the severity correlated with the extent of the truncation suggesting a modular structure of the Armadillo protein. It was proposed that modules contributed in an additive fashion to the function of Armadillo. Our experiments with plakoglobin parallel those done with Armadillo; in both studies, the effects of carboxyl-terminal truncations were examined. Our data support a modular structure for plakoglobin since, as the extent of the deletion increased, association with N-cadherin was lost first and then association with α-catenin. If our data and those of Peifer and Wieschaus (24Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) are taken together, one interpretation is that, as the truncations of Armadillo became longer, the shortened protein first lost the ability to interact with cadherin and then lost the ability to productively associate with α-catenin. The developmental data would then suggest that preventing the association of an armadillo family member with both α-catenin and cadherin has more serious consequences than preventing the association with only the cadherin. This in turn suggests that cadherin-less complexes containing α-catenin and Armadillo may have functions during development. It is also interesting to note that some of the mutants studied by Peifer and Wieschaus (24Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) resulted in Armadillo being truncated at positions corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region of plakoglobin. Although embryos with these mutations survived a relatively long time and synthesized enough of the truncated Armadillo for it to be readily detected in immunoblots, the mutations were lethal. This underscores the importance of the carboxyl terminus of armadillo family members, although its function is unknown. The diagram shown in Fig. 1 assigns functions to some regions of plakoglobin. A domain of plakoglobin needed for association with α-catenin was mapped to amino acids 115-161, roughly corresponding to the first repeat. Since the truncated plakoglobins are probably competing with α-catenin's other partners (such as β-catenin), these data suggest that sequences near repeat 1 play a major role in the recognition of α-catenin. In contrast to the small region identified in the α-catenin studies, our data suggest a gradual decrease in the ability of plakoglobin and N-cadherin to associate as plakoglobin is shortened from the end of repeat 8 (amino acid 458) to the end of repeat 6 (amino acid 375). Such a large region of association suggests multiple protein-protein interactions are required for plakoglobin to interact with N-cadherin. Immunofluorescence showed that constructs retaining at least 458 amino acids localized to cell borders, which suggests they can successfully compete with β-catenin for binding to N-cadherin. However, we have preliminary data, based on washing immunoprecipitations more stringently, that suggests COOH-terminally truncated plakoglobins are not as stably associated with N-cadherin as are full-length plakoglobin or β-catenin. Studies are in progress to more completely characterize the stability of the interaction of truncated plakoglobins with N-cadherin. As mentioned above, there are regions of plakoglobin whose function was not revealed in our assays. A number of proteins have been localized to the plaques of adherens junctions (for a review see (41Tsukita S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)). Perhaps β-catenin and plakoglobin have roles in recruiting other junctional components. It would not be surprising if plakoglobin and β-catenin have different affinities for these other molecules, a feature that could play a role in signaling events. Conditions must be developed to preserve the interactions of these other adherens junction components in order to study their interactions with the cadherin-catenin complex; such studies are ongoing in our laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W2047009435,"The goal of these studies was to devise a model that explains how human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) interacts with lutropin (LH) receptors to elicit a hormone signal. Here we show that α-subunit residues near the N terminus, the exposed surface of the cysteine knot, and portions of the first and third loops most distant from the β-subunit interface were recognized by antibodies that bound to hCG-receptor complexes. These observations were combined with similar data obtained for the β-subunit (Cosowsky, L., Rao, S. N. V., Macdonald, G. J., Papkoff, H., Campbell, R. K., and Moyle, W. R.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20011-20019), information on residues of hCG that can be changed without disrupting hormone function, the crystal structure of deglycosylated hCG, and the crystal structure of a leucine-repeat protein to devise a model of hCG-receptor interaction. This model suggests that the extracellular domain of the LH receptor is “U-” or “J”-shaped and makes several contacts with the transmembrane domain. High affinity hormone binding results from interactions between residues in the curved portion of the extracellular domain of the receptor and the groove in the hormone formed by the apposition of the second α-subunit loop and the first and third β-subunit loops. Most of the remainder of the hormone is found in the large space between the arms of the extracellular domain and makes few, if any, additional specific contacts with the receptor needed for high affinity binding. Signal transduction is caused by steric or other influences of the hormone on the distance between the arms of the extracellular domain, an effect augmented by the oligosaccharides. Because the extracellular domain is coupled at multiple sites to the transmembrane domain, the change in conformation of the extracellular domain is relayed to the transmembrane domain and subsequently to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. While the model does not require the hormone to contact the transmembrane domain to initiate signal transduction, small portions of both subunits may be near the transmembrane domain and assist in initiating the hormonal signal. This is the first model that is consistent with all known information on the activity of the gonadotropins including the amounts of the hormone that are exposed in the hormone-receptor complex, the apparent lack of specific contacts between much of the hormone and the receptor, and the roles of the oligosaccharides in signal transduction. This model differs from existing models of hormone action in that the extracellular domain has a much larger role in hormone action than serving as a high affinity hormone trap.

These data establish that SecY, SecE, and SecG constitute the integral membrane domain of preprotein translocase. Noncytoplasmic proteins are transported into, or across, a membrane as the first stage in their subcellular localization. This process has been studied extensively for endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, glyoxisomes, and for the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli. The ease of genetic and biochemical approaches in E. coli has made it a model system for such investigations (Schatz and Beckwith, 1990; Bieker et al., 1990; Wickner et al., 1991). Periplasmic and outer membrane proteins of E. coli are synthesized as preproteins with an amino-terminal leader (signal) sequence (Gierasch, 1989). Some preproteins are stabilized in the cytosol by chaperones such as SecB (Randall and Hardy, 1995). Preprotein-chaperone complexes bind to the plasma membrane at SecA (Hartl et al., 1990), the peripheral membrane subunit of preprotein translocase, driven by the affinities of SecA for SecB (Hartl et al., 1990) and for the leader and mature domains of the preprotein (Lill et al., 1990). SecA itself is bound to the membrane by its affinities for acidic phospholipids (Lill et al., 1990; Hendrick and Wickner, 1991) and for the integral membrane protein SecYEG. The binding of SecA to SecYEG has been shown by the ability of antibody to the SecY amino terminus to reduce SecA binding to membranes (Hartl et al., 1990), the ability of SecA to protect SecY from limited proteolysis (Hartl et al., 1990), and the close agreement between the number of high-affinity binding sites for SecA and the number of SecY molecules in plasma membrane vesicles (Hartl et al., 1990). SecY was functionally isolated as a member of a trimeric complex (Brundage et al., 1990) comprised of SecY, SecE, and SecG (Nishiyama et al., 1994; Douville et al., 1994). This complex is essential for SecA-dependent translocation in proteoliposomes (Brundage et al., 1990). Cross-linking studies have established that the mature domain of a model preprotein lies next to SecA and SecY as it crosses the membrane (Joly and Wickner, 1993). Translocase uses two sources of energy, ATP (Chen and Tai, 1985) and the protonmotive force Δ (Geller et al., 1986), to drive the preprotein across the membrane. SecA, when associated with the preprotein leader and mature domain, with acidic lipids, and with SecYEG, is activated to utilize ATP in a complex catalytic cycle (Schiebel et al., 1991). In this cycle, a domain of SecA of approximately 30 kDa inserts into, and at least partially across, the membrane, carrying a segment of about 25 aminoacyl residues of the preprotein (Economou and Wickner, 1994). Additional ATP consumption allows this domain to dissociate from the preprotein and de-insert. When the preprotein is not engaged with SecA, further Δ-driven translocation can occur (Schiebel et al. 1991). Translocation has been reproduced with all-purified components in a reconstituted reaction with proteoliposomes bearing SecYEG, SecA, proOmpA (the precursor of outer membrane protein A), a Δ (established by the incorporation of bacteriorhodopsin in the liposomal membrane) and ATP (Brundage et al., 1990). In this reaction, translocase can support many turnovers of substrate, and the initial rates of translocation per functional translocase complex are similar to those seen with inner membrane vesicles (Bassilana and Wickner, 1993). Despite extensive biochemical, genetic, and physiological characterization of the translocation reaction, it has remained possible that there are additional subunits of the translocase enzyme. The SecYEG complex is labile (Brundage et al., 1992) and has only been isolated in low yield; other forms of the complex, with additional subunits, might have been missed. Furthermore, genetic and physiological studies have implicated SecD and SecF (Matsuyama et al., 1993; Arkowitz and Wickner, 1994; Pogliano and Beckwith, 1994) and FtsH (Akiyama et al., 1994) in translocation, although the biochemical bases of their actions remain unknown. We now report that inner membrane vesicles prepared from cells with the secY, secE, and secG genes under the ara regulon on a multicopy plasmid are highly enriched in each of the SecYEG subunits. Both catalytic and stoichiometric measurements show a significant increase in translocation activity and sites. Inverted inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) were treated with 6 M urea (30 min, 0°C) to inactivate endogenous SecA, as described by Cunningham et al.(1989). The following proteins were purified according to previous methods: SecA (Cunningham et al., 1989), SecB (Weiss et al., 1988; Lecker et al., 1989), proOmpA (Crooke et al., 1988), and [35S]proOmpA (Crooke and Wickner, 1987).

SecG DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the Kohara library clone 521 (Kohara et al., 1987; Nishiyama et al., 1993). A clone 521 lysate was diluted 1:10 in sterile water and heated (10 min, 70°C). A 10-μl aliquot was amplified by PCR using a Coy thermocycler and a GeneAmp kit (Perkin Elmer) following the manufacturer's protocol. Amplification with Amplitaq DNA polymerase was performed for 30 95°C, 55°C, and 72°C cycles. The amino terminus oligonucleotide primer (5′-TAAGGTCATTAAGCTTCTAGAGTATTCACACCCGCTTCAGT) introduced HindIII and XbaI cloning sites, while the carboxyl terminus oligonucleotide primer (5′-GAGATACAGAAAGCTTACAACCATTCCTCAGACCAG) introduced a HindIII cloning site. The PCR product was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in sterile water in one-tenth of the original volume. HindIII restriction digests were performed (2 h, 37°C) on the PCR product and on pHAsecEY DNA (Joly et al., 1994). Each 100-μl digest contained 10 μg of DNA, 50 units, of HindIII (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μl of React 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of the HindIII-digested pHAsecEY DNA were treated (1 h, 37°C) with 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemcal Corp.), which were then heat-inactivated (20 min, 65°C). The phosphatase-treated plasmid DNA and the HindIII-digested PCR product were purified on a 1% SeaPlaque GTG Agarose (FMC) gel in 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0. Ligation was performed by combining 77.3 ng of gel-purified pHAsecEY DNA and 22 ng of gel-purified secG DNA with 1 unit of T4 DNA Ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). The correct orientation of the cloned fragment was confirmed by SmaI-XbaI restriction digestion. pHAsecEYG was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (Grodberg and Dunn, 1988) as described previously (Ausubel et al., 1994). All media and antibiotics were according to Sambrook et al.(1989). Cultures were grown at 37°C with aeration in M9 medium containing 10 μg/ml thiamine, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml of each essential amino acid, and 0.2% (w/v) glucose. Exponential cultures at A600 = 0.5 were induced with 1% (w/v) arabinose and growth continued for 1-3 h. For analysis of total cell proteins, 1 ml of culture was added to 0.5 ml of 30% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (30 min, 0°C) and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 4 min, 4°C). Pellets were twice suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold acetone, vortexed and then centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C). The pellets were air dried (10 min, 37°C) and resuspended in 50 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 (10 min, 37°C, with occasional vortexing). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 23°C), and 40 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and stored at 4°C. IMVs were prepared by a modification of the method of Chang et al.(1978). Cells from a 5-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 20°C), resuspended in an equal weight of 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Cells were thawed by the addition to 250 ml of room temperature AH buffer (5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5) and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C). Pellets were resuspended in 17 ml of AH buffer containing 0.1 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), passed 3 times through a French pressure cell at 8000 p.s.i., and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). Supernatants were layered onto 15 ml of 20% (w/v) sucrose in AH buffer and centrifuged in a SW 28 rotor (2 h, 24,000 rpm, 4°C). Pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of AH buffer with a Dounce homogenizer and then layered onto sucrose step gradients prepared from 6 ml each of 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, and 0.8 M sucrose in AH buffer and centrifuged in a SW 28 rotor (16 h, 24,000 rpm, 4°C). The brown band in the lower third of the gradient was collected and mixed 1:1 with AH buffer and then centrifuged in a 60 Ti rotor (1.5 h, 55,000 rpm, 4°C). Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of AH buffer and stored at −70°C. SecA was iodinated using Iodogen (Markwell and Fox, 1978) and then used in translocation/membrane insertion reactions (Economou and Wickner, 1994). Binding of 125I-SecA to urea-treated IMVs (200 μg/ml) prepared from E. coli strain BL21/pHAsecYEG grown with or without arabinose was performed in 50-μl reactions and analyzed according to Scatchard(1949), as described previously (Hartl et al., 1990; Economou and Wickner, 1994). Binding parameters, initially estimated by visual inspection of Scatchard plots (Scatchard, 1949), were determined using the nonlinear, least squares estimates modelling program LIGAND (Munson and Rodbard, 1980; Haberland et al., 1989). The starting estimates were from Hartl et al.(1990). The Kd (=1/Ka) value of 23-39 nM and the concentration of SecA receptors (∼180 pmol/mg of membrane protein) in the membranes of BL21/pHAsecEYG grown in the absence of arabinose are in good agreement with values from Hartl et al.(1990) using KM-9 membranes (Kd = 30-50 nM and 120-160 pmol of SecA receptor/mg of membrane protein). Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide or high Tris gels), fluorography, and electrophoretic transfer of proteins to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were as described previously (Ito et al., 1980; Douville et al., 1994). Autoradiography of 125I-labeled polypeptides was performed at −80°C with intensifying screens. The genes encoding an epitope-tagged SecE and wild-type SecY were introduced into a pBR322-derived plasmid under control of the ara regulon (Joly et al., 1994). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to allow PCR amplification of a fragment of DNA bearing the secG gene, using the Kohara library phage 521 as a template. This DNA fragment was then ligated into the plasmid downstream from the secE and secY genes to form plasmid pHAsecEYG, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and transformed into E. coli strain BL21. Arabinose-induced expression resulted in a large increase in the synthesis of proteins of the correct apparent molecular weights for SecY, SecE, and SecG polypeptides (Fig. 1A, lane1). These identifications were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of SecY, SecE, and SecG did not induce the synthesis of SecA (Fig. 1B). Pulse-chase analysis showed that each of the three subunits was largely stable after synthesis for 5 min (Fig. 1A, lane 2) or 90 min (data not shown). This confirms earlier studies (Matsuyama et al., 1990) that had shown that SecE overexpression can contribute to the stability of newly synthesized SecY, which is otherwise labile when overexpressed. Upon separation of cell lysates into low speed pellet, high speed supernatant, and inner and outer membrane fractions, it was apparent that the inner membrane fraction was enriched in SecY, SecE, and SecG polypeptides, easily identified in stained gels as major polypeptide constituents (Fig. 1C). Quantitative immunoblot analysis showed a 32-fold overexpression of SecY and a 16-fold overexpression of SecG polypeptides in the overexpressing cells as compared with noninduced controls. In the absence of a membrane potential, translocation of preproteins such as proOmpA is driven exclusively by the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Under such conditions, translocation is an inefficient process, resulting in the hydrolysis of thousands of ATP molecules per molecule of translocated proOmpA (Lill et al., 1989). This high level of translocation ATPase is only seen with fully functional translocation sites (Lill et al., 1989; Bassilana et al., 1992). Membranes from wild-type cells (data not shown) or from uninduced BL21/pHAsecEYG cells showed comparable translocation ATPase activity, which was dependent on preprotein, SecA, and membrane vesicles. However, membranes from cells overexpressing the SecY, SecE, and SecG polypeptides, referred to as induced membranes, showed 20 times the translocation ATPase activity as compared with membranes from uninduced cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the overproduced SecY, SecE, and SecG are capable of productive interaction with SecA and preproteins and that no other membrane component is limiting for that interaction. To directly examine the functionality of the “induced membranes,” translocation reactions were performed with varying chemical concentrations of proOmpA, using purified SecB chaperone, SecA, ATP, and inner membrane vesicles from either induced or uninduced cells. The rate of translocation (expressed as pmol of proOmpA translocated/min/mg of membrane protein) during the initial incubation (when translocation was linear with respect to time) increased at least 30-fold (Fig. 3B), again suggesting that no other membrane component apart from SecYEG is limiting for translocation. One measure of functionality of the integral domain of translocase is the formation of high affinity sites for SecA binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that the induced membranes had 6 times the number of binding sites (1000-1100 versus approximately 180 pmol of SecA/mg of IMV protein), although the binding affinities of SecA for each membrane were comparable (22 and 37 nM for uninduced and induced membranes, respectively) (Fig. 4). We recently reported that SecA, bound at its high affinity sites, could undergo a reaction of reversible membrane insertion, rendering a domain of approximately 30 kDa inaccessible to added protease (Economou and Wickner, 1994). Membranes from induced cells supported the formation of approximately 8 times the membrane-inserted form of SecA as found with membranes from uninduced cells (Fig. 5). At high concentrations of added SecA, there was clearly saturation of the formation of inserted SecA for membranes from either induced or uninduced cells. These data therefore provide a stoichiometric measure of insertion sites and show that a significant fraction of the overproduced SecYEG subunits are in an active state.Figure 5:Membrane insertion of SecA. Protection of the 30-kDa domain of 125 I-SecA from protease was determined as described previously (Economou and Wickner, 1994). Translocation reactions (50 μl) containing 125 I-SecA (80,000 cpm; 0.0456 μg), TL buffer, 200 μg/ml BSA, 30 μg/ml proOmpA, 48 μg/ml SecB, an ATP-regenerating system (5 mM phosphocreatine and 10 μg/ml creatine kinase) and IMVs (100 μg/ml) were prepared on ice. Unlabeled SecA (2-50 μg/ml) in 5 ml of TL buffer containing 10% glycerol was added prior to the addition of membranes. A control sample, marked 0, received 50 μl of SecA buffer alone. The tubes were warmed to 37°C, and reactions of SecA membrane insertion and proOmpA translocation were initiated with 2 mM ATP. After 15 min, the samples were chilled on ice and digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin (0°C, 15 min). The membrane-inserted domain of SecA was detected as a protease-protected 30-kDa species by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography and quantitated by scanning densitometry (Economou and Wickner, 1994).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the overproduced subunits exist as a complex, membranes extracts were prepared with a mixed micellar solution of detergents and phospholipids and chromatographed on an anion-exchange resin. The overproduced SecY, SecE, and SecG subunits co-chromatographed at a position coincident with the translocation ATPase activity of the reconstituted proteoliposomes (Fig. 6), as previously reported for the SecYEG complex from wild-type E. coli (Brundage et al., 1990). This provides direct support for the concept that a considerable portion of the three overexpressed polypeptides are present in the membrane as the active trimeric complex SecYEG. The integral membrane domain of preprotein translocase has been conserved throughout evolution. SecY and SecE homologs are found in several bacterial species (Ito, 1992; Rensing and Maier, 1994; Murphy and Beckwith, 1994), in yeast (Stirling et al., 1992), in chloroplasts (Scaramuzzi et al., 1992), and in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (Görlich and Rapoport, 1993). The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum Sec61 complex has recently been isolated (Görlich and Rapoport, 1993); two of its subunits are homologous to SecY and SecE (Görlich et al., 1992b; Hartmann et al., 1994), while its third subunit is hydrophobic and of similar size to SecG. SecYEG is unusual among permeases in that it transports largely unfolded, membrane-spanning linear aminoacyl polymers with side chains of varying size and charge while maintaining a proton-tight (or, for endoplasmic reticulum, calcium-tight) junction. It is thus important to be certain that all of the relevant subunits of translocase have been defined and to have an abundant supply of this protein for structural characterization. These goals have been addressed in the current study. Our results, taken together with those from previous studies (Brundage et al., 1990; Hartl et al., 1990; Joly and Wickner, 1993; Joly et al., 1994; Hanada et al., 1994), indicate that SecY, SecE, SecG, and SecA are stoichiometric components of preprotein translocase. It is important, however, to emphasize that additional factors, which are not stoichiometric components of translocase, may play essential catalytic roles. These proteins include leader peptidase, which is essential for the release of translocated preproteins (Dalbey and Wickner, 1985) and (in mammals) the signal recognition particle receptor (Tajima et al., 1986). Other examples of proteins involved in the translocation reaction whose catalytic function is not yet known include SecD and SecF (Pogliano and Beckwith, 1994), FtsH (Akiyama et al., 1994), and (in mammals) TRAM (Görlich et al., 1992a). How do SecYEG and its eukaryotic homolog, the Sec61 complex, function? Sec61 complex is believed to function as the direct receptor for ribosomes (Kalies et al., 1994), “gated” in this function by signal recognition particle and its receptor (Rapoport, 1992) and by the nascent polypeptide associated complex (Wiedmann et al., 1994). No mammalian homolog of SecA, the fourth essential subunit of bacterial transalocase (Oliver, 1993), has yet been described, either structurally or functionally. How then is metabolic energy coupled to Sec61 complex-mediated translocation? ATP may still provide energy via Hsp70 to drive translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Lumenal Hsp70 in the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast has a specific binding site on the Sec61 complex and couples ATP hydrolytic energy to preprotein translocation and to Hsp70 release from this site (Brodsky and Schekman, 1993). In some studies, mammalian endoplasmic reticulum translocation also requires ATP (Schlenstedt and Zimmermann, 1987), although lumenal Hsp70 has not been shown to function in the reconstituted system (Görlich and Rapoport, 1993). In contrast to protein translocation through the Sec61 complex of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, most bacterial translocation through SecYEG only begins after a nascent chain critical molecular mass of about 25 kDa (Randall, 1983) is achieved, allowing recognition of the mature domain by SecB (Randall and Hardy, 1994) and SecA (Lill et al., 1990). E. coli translocation may begin after a chain reaches this critical molecular weight but is largely post-translational (Randall, 1983). It is driven by both ATP and Δ in different phases of the translocase catalytic cycle (Schiebel et al., 1991). In the ATP-coupled mode of bacterial translocation, a large 30-kDa domain of SecA penetrates into, and across, the membrane concomitant with translocation of a preprotein segment (Economou and Wickner, 1994). All three SecYEG subunits are required for this SecA-receptor function; overproduction of SecY, SecE, and SecG leads to enhanced SecA binding (Fig. 5), which was not seen with overproduction of SecY and SecE alone (Kim and Oliver, 1994). SecYEG is essential for the SecA membrane cycling reaction (Fig. 5 and Economou and Wickner(1994)). SecYEG may provide surfaces with which SecA can associate as it undergoes ATP-driven membrane penetration and conformational changes. This might explain why preproteins are found near both SecA and SecY throughout their membrane transit (Joly et al., 1994). SecYEG and SecA may provide a pathway for polypeptide chain movement. The availability of large amounts of SecYEG complex should now facilitate the investigation of these and other structural and catalytic properties of preprotein translocase.

https://openalex.org/W1976234627,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) interact with a common G protein-coupled receptor and stimulate production of diverse second messengers (i.e. cAMP, diacylglycerol, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) that varies depending on the target cell. In renal proximal tubule OK cells, PTH inhibits the activity of the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, although it is unclear whether the signal is transmitted through protein kinase A (PKA) and/or protein kinase C (PKC). To delineate the signaling circuitry, a series of synthetic PTH and PTHRP fragments were used that stimulate the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA and/or phospholipase C-diacylglycerol-PKC pathways. Human PTH-(1-34) and PTHRP-(1-34) stimulated adenylate cyclase and PKC activity, whereas the PTH analogues, PTH-(3-34), PTH-(28-42), and PTH-(28-48), selectively enhanced only PKC activity. However, each peptide fragment inhibited Na+/H+ exchanger activity by 40-50%, suggesting that PKC and possibly PKA were capable of transducing the PTH/PTHRP signal to the transporter. This was corroborated when forskolin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), direct agonists of adenylate cyclase and PKC, respectively, both inhibited the Na+/H+ exchanger. The specific PKA antagonist, H-89, abolished the forskolin-mediated suppression of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, but did not prevent the inhibitory effects of PTH-(1-34) or PMA. In comparison, the potent PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride, prevented the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger activity mediated by PTH-(28-48) and PMA but did not avert the negative regulation caused by PTH-(1-34) or forskolin. However, inhibition of both PKA and PKC prevented PTH-(1-34)-mediated suppression of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, indicating that PTH-(1-34) acted through both signaling pathways. In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of only the NHE-3 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger in OK cells. In summary, these results demonstrated that NHE-3 is expressed in OK cells and that activation of the PTH receptor can stimulate both the PKA and PKC pathways, each of which can independently lead to inhibition of NHE-3 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2040448047,"Thrombin stimulation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells leads to Ras-dependent AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation and to DNA replication. In contrast to what has been observed in most cell systems, in 1321N1 cells these responses are pertussis toxin-insensitive. The pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein G12 has been implicated in cell growth and transformation in different cell systems. We have examined the potential role of this protein in AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation and DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells. Transient expression of an activated (GTPase-deficient) mutant of Gα12 increased AP-1-dependent gene expression. This response was inhibited by co-expression of a dominant negative Ala-15 Ras protein. To determine whether the pertussis toxin-insensitive G12 protein is involved in the thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis, an inhibitory antibody against the C-terminal sequence of Gα12 subunit was microinjected into 1321N1 cells. Microinjection of the anti-Gα12 resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis. In contrast, microinjection of nonimmune IgG or an antibody directed against the C terminus of Gαo did not reduce the mitogenic response to thrombin. Furthermore, microinjection of the anti-Gα12 antibody had no effect on fibroblast growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis.

These results demonstrate a specific role for Gα12 in the mitogenic response to thrombin in human astroglial cells. INTRODUCTIONThrombin is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, astrocytes, and other cell lines (Van Obberghen-Schilling et al., 1985; Cavanaugh et al., 1990; Hung et al., 1992; LaMorte et al., 1993a, 1993b). Thrombin cleaves and activates a seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor to trigger G-protein-mediated stimulation of downstream effectors (Vu et al., 1991). The actions of thrombin in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells have been well characterized. In these cells, thrombin stimulates phospholipase C activity leading to mobilization of intracellular calcium, diglyceride generation, and redistribution of protein kinase C (Jones et al., 1989; Nieto et al., 1994). Thrombin receptor activation also leads to a biphasic increase in c-jun mRNA, an associated increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity, and a marked increase in AP-1-mediated gene expression and DNA synthesis (Trejo et al., 1992; LaMorte et al., 1993b). Ras function is required for the mitogenic effect of thrombin as well as thrombin-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity (LaMorte et al., 1993b).There is substantial information about the signaling pathways downstream of thrombin receptor activation; however, it is not known which of the heterotrimeric G-proteins couples thrombin to the mitogenic pathway. In fibroblasts, thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis is sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) 1The abbreviations used are: PTXpertussis toxinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineTREtetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) response element. (Chambard et al., 1987; van Corven et al., 1993). Experiments using microinjected antibodies against Gαo or Gαi suggested that the mitogenic effect of thrombin in CCL39 and in 3T3 fibroblasts is mediated through these G-proteins (LaMorte et al., 1993a; Baffy et al., 1994). However, in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis and thrombininduced gene expression are not inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment, 2G. R. Post, L. R. Collins, E. D. Kennedy, A. M. Aragay, D. Goldstein, and J. H. Brown, submitted for publication. suggesting that G-proteins of the Gi/Go family do not mediate these responses. The PTX-insensitive G-proteins Gq and/or G11 have also been reported to function in mitogenic signaling by thrombin and bradykinin in fibroblasts (LaMorte et al., 1993a; Baffy et al., 1994). However, studies comparing muscarinic and thrombin receptor signaling mechanisms in astrocytes and CCL39 fibroblasts demonstrate that, although both receptors interact with Gq/G11 to stimulate phospholipase C, release calcium, and activate protein kinase C, only thrombin can activate Ras and elicit cell proliferation (Trejo et al., 1992; Seuwen et al., 1990).2 These data suggest that activation of Gq and phospholipase C is insufficient to account for the full mitogenic effects of thrombin and that other signaling pathways are involved.The Gα12 and Gα13 subunits constitute a family of G-proteins distantly related to the other G-protein α subunits (Strathmann and Simon, 1991). Both Gα12 and Gα13 lack the cysteine residue that renders these proteins susceptible to ADP-ribosylation by PTX. The signaling pathways regulated by these G-proteins have not been identified. Activation of these G-proteins has nonetheless been linked to cell growth in several cell systems. Overexpression of Gα12 in NIH3T3 cells leads to neoplastic transformation (Chan et al., 1993), and expression of a GTPase-deficient mutant form of Gα12 and Gα13 can efficiently transform NIH3T3 cells (Jiang et al., 1993; Xu et al., 1993) and Rat-1 fibroblasts (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1994a). In addition, epidermal growth factor-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is enhanced in fibroblasts that express the activated mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1994b). Therefore, these G-proteins appear to be good candidates to be involved in PTX-insensitive signaling pathways leading to cell growth.In the present study we show that the activated mutant form of Gα12 induces AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation when transfected in 1321N1 cells, and this effect requires Ras function. Furthermore, we show that microinjection of an antibody against Gα12 can specifically block the mitogenic effect of thrombin. Taken together, these results suggest that Gα12 functions as a PTX-insensitive mediator of thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Microinjection1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgrow) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gemini) at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 10% CO2. For microinjection, cells were plated at 50-60% confluence on 12-mm coverslips, grown for 1 day, and rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h prior to microinjection. All microinjection experiments were performed using an automatic manipulator (Eppendorf, Fremont, CA). Microinjection needles were pulled on a vertical pipette puller (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Affinity-purified CT95 (anti-Gα12), CT112 (anti-Gαo), and nonimmune IgG antibodies were dissolved in microinjection buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl and injected into the cytoplasm of quiescent cells (at the concentration indicated in the figure). Three hours postinjection the cells were stimulated by either 0.5 unit/ml thrombin (Sigma), 5% fetal calf serum, or 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as indicated in the legends. The thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Amersham Corp.) was added to the incubation medium. Twenty-four hours after stimulation the cells were fixed in 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid and processed for immunofluorescence.Immunofluorescence StainingTo identify injected cells, the coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for half an hour at 37°C with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel) at 20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cells that had incorporated BrdUrd into synthesized DNA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence as described (LaMorte et al., 1993b). Briefly coverslips were incubated with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Amersham Corp.) followed with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cappel) at 1:100 dilution. The cells were analyzed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope.Antibody PurificationAntibodies against Gα subunits G12 and Goa (CT95 and CT112, respectively) were made in rabbits using synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The Gα12 C-terminal peptide sequence used to raise the CT95 antibody is CQENLKDIMLQ, and the Gαo C-terminal peptide sequence (CT112) is CANNLRGCGLY. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using the synthetic peptides coupled to an Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) matrix. Elution was performed with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5. The eluants were dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer, concentrated, aliquoted, and stored at −70°C until used.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlotSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (Laemmli, 1970). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids: pCISG12, pCISG13, pCISGq, or control vector pCISLacZ. Transfected COS-7 and 1321N1 membranes were prepared as described previously (Aragay et al., 1992). One volume of SDS-loading buffer was added to the cell extracts, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged, and loaded onto a 12% SDS-acrylamide gel. Gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunostained with Gα antibodies, and visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Corp.).Transfection of 1321N1 CellsHuman 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were plated 1 day before transfection and were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (Trejo et al., 1992). Each 60-mm plate received a total of 12 μg of DNA. Varying amounts of pCISG12Q229L or pCISGqR183C or pCDNA1GiR179C or the corresponding control vectors pCIS or pCDNAI were transfected with 4 μg of an AP-1-responsive reporter plasmid (2 × TRE) consisting of two consensus TRE sequences (recognized by the AP-1 complex) upstream of the minimal prolactin promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (2 × TRE-LUC). In some cases control vector was added to achieve a final DNA concentration of 12 μg per plate. For the dominant negative Ras studies, cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of 2 × TRE and 4 μg of Ala-15 Ras (Powers et al., 1989) or its control vector, pZIP, and 4 μg of either pCISG12Q229L, pCISGqR183C, or pCISLacZ. 48 h later cells were lysed in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.9, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured in 20 μl of lysate as described previously (Trejo et al., 1992).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe thrombin receptor is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and has been shown to couple to Gi, Go, and Gq proteins in different signaling pathways (Vu et al., 1991; LaMorte et al., 1993a; Baffy et al., 1994). In addition, the thrombin receptor has been shown to couple to G12 in platelets (Offermanns et al., 1994). In 1321N1 cells thrombin stimulates the DNA binding activity of the transcription complex AP-1 and results in an associated increase in AP-1-mediated gene expression (Trejo et al., 1992). This response cannot be explained by activation of either Gi or Gq alone.2 To test the possible involvement of Gα12 in AP-1-mediated gene expression we examine the ability of an activated GTPase-deficient form of Gα12 to transactivate an AP-1-responsive reporter plasmid (2 × TRE-LUC). 1321N1 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids containing the constitutively activated (GTPase-deficient) mutant forms of Gα12 (Q229L), Gαq (R183C), or Gαi (R179C) or with a control plasmid along with the 2 × TRE-LUC reporter. The activated Gα12 caused a 6-7-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to control transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Only a modest (<2-fold) stimulation was seen with the activated Gq and Gi mutants. The marked stimulatory effect of the activated Gα12 mutant suggests that G12 protein may couple thrombin-receptor activation to the induction of the expression of AP-1-responsive target genes.To examine the involvement of Ras in the stimulation of AP-1 gene expression, the Ala-15 dominant inhibitory mutant of Ras (Powers et al., 1989) was coexpressed with the activated forms of either Gα12 or Gαq and the AP-1-sensitive luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 1B). The Gαq-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity was not affected by Ala-15 Ras. However, expression of the Ala-15 Ras mutant led to a 70% reduction in the Gα12-induced luciferase activity. These results demonstrate that Gα12 stimulation of AP-1-dependent gene expression at least partially requires Ras. Together with our previous observation that Ras is required for thrombin stimulation of AP-1 activity and mitogenesis (LaMorte et al., 1993b), these results suggest that Gα12 may couple the thrombin receptor to Ras activation.To more specifically examine the involvement of Gα12 in thrombin-stimulated mitogenesis, we microinjected inhibitory Gα12 antibodies into intact 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. The specificity of the antiserum was first verified by Western blot using extracts of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Gα12, Gα13, Gαq, and LacZ (Fig. 2). The antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to the 11 C-terminal amino acids of Gα12 (referred to as CT95 or anti-Gα12 antibody) recognized a protein of the expected size in COS-7 cells expressing Gα12 but did not detect other G-protein α subunits. The CT95 antiserum also recognized a protein of the expected size in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells.2Figure 2:Identification of Gα12 in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells by Western analysis. Extracts of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pCISGα12, pCISGα13, pCISGαq, and control plasmid (pCISLacZ) and 1321N1 membrane extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with CT95 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Serum-deprived 1321N1 cells were microinjected with either the anti-Gα12 antibody, nonimmune IgG, or anti-Gαo antibody (CT112). Three hours later, the cells were treated with 0.5 unit/ml thrombin. The nucleotide analog BrdUrd was added to the medium, and 24 h later the cells were fixed. Injected cells were simultaneously assessed for the presence of injected antiserum and for the nuclear incorporation of BrdUrd by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). Thrombin stimulated DNA synthesis in 50 ± 3% of the cells while only 10 ± 2% of unstimulated cells synthesized DNA (Table 1). Injection of the CT95 antibody (10 mg/ml) reduced the proportion of cells in which thrombin stimulated DNA synthesis to 23 ± 3% (Table 1). There was a direct correlation between the amount of antibody injected and the degree of inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 4). Microinjection of 15 mg/ml CT95 antibody resulted in a complete abolition of thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis but had no effect on basal BrdUrd incorporation in unstimulated cells. Preincubation of the CT95 antibody with the peptide immunogen resulted in loss of the ability of the anti-Gα12 antibody to block thrombin-induced DNA synthesis (data not shown). There was no inhibition of the response to thrombin in cells injected with equivalent concentrations of nonimmune IgG. Furthermore, microinjection of an anti-Gαo did not reduce the number of cells undergoing DNA synthesis in response to thrombin (Table 1). These results clearly demonstrate that inhibitory antibodies directed against Gα12 can specifically block thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells.Figure 3:Microinjection of CT95 antibody against Gα12 in thrombin-stimulated 1321N1 cells. Cells were plated on glass coverslips and starved 24 h prior to injection. Random areas of quiescent cells were injected with control IgG (10 mg/ml) or CT95 antibody (10 mg/ml).

Errorbars represent the 95% confidence interval calculated by using the standard error of proportion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further demonstrate the specificity of the blocking effect of the CT95 antibody we examined the effect of this antibody on induction of DNA synthesis by bFGF. The actions of bFGF are presumed to be mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation and do not utilize G-protein signaling pathways. Quiescent 1321N1 cells were injected with either the anti-Gα12 antibody or control nonimmune IgG and subsequently stimulated with 20 ng/ml bFGF or with 0.5 unit/ml thrombin. bFGF induced DNA synthesis in 22 ± 4% of the cells (Table 2). Microinjection of the anti-Gα12 antibody (10 mg/ml) did not inhibit the bFGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. These results indicate that bFGF does not utilize Gα12 for mitogenic signaling and that the anti-G12 antibody does not exert a generalized inhibitory effect upon DNA synthesis. These data further strengthen the argument for the specificity of action of the anti-G12 antibody on the response to thrombin.Table II Open table in a new tab We additionally examined the effect of the CT95 antibody on the serum stimulation of DNA synthesis. The addition of 5% fetal calf serum to serum-deprived 1321N1 cells stimulated DNA synthesis in 76-90% of the cells (Table 2). Microinjection of the anti-Gα12 antibody reduced the response to serum by 45%. A similar effect was likewise observed by LaMorte et al.(1992) with an anti-Gαi antibody in serum-stimulated fibroblasts where the thrombin response is PTX-sensitive. The inhibitory effect of the anti-Gα12 antibody suggests that serum-induced DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells is mediated in part through receptor(s) that function via Gα12. This observation argues that G12 is a necessary cellular transducer for certain types of mitogens in addition to thrombin.Our previous work2 demonstrated that the mitogenic response to thrombin in 1321N1 cells was pertussis toxin-insensitive, and we suggested that an additional pathway besides the Gq/phospholipase C pathway was required. The results presented here suggest that G12 is the other transducer mediating the mitogenic effect of thrombin in the 1321N1 cells. The inhibition of thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis by the G12 antibody coupled with the activation by G12 of AP-1-dependent transcription reported here provides the first evidence of a signaling pathway in which G12 links a G-protein receptor to cell growth. It also suggests a new linkage between a G-protein pathway and the oncogene ras.The mechanism by which G12 affects cell growth is still not clear. Recent data demonstrate that βγ released from stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors can mediate the activation of MAP kinases acting on a Ras-dependent pathway (Winitz et al., 1993; Albas et al., 1993; Faure et al., 1994; Crespo et al., 1994; Koch et al., 1994). βγ released from G12 by thrombin activation could mediate the mitogenic response. However, the experiments reported here demonstrate that the α subunit of G12 alone is able to induce AP-1-mediated gene expression. Other studies show that Gα12 or the constitutively activated Gα12 subunits are able to cause cell transformation (Chan et al., 1993; Jiang et al., 1993). It seems likely therefore that there is a pathway activated by the α subunit of G12, which can lead to cell growth in some systems.The direct effector of Gα12 is not known. Responses shown to be indirectly mediated via G12 are the activation of phospholipase A2 (Xu et al., 1993) and of a Na+-H+ exchanger (Dhanasekaran et al., 1994), which is also regulated by G13 (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1994c). Since the activation of the Na+-H+ exchanger involves protein kinase C (Dhanasekaran et al., 1994) it is possible that the activation of a particular isoform of protein kinase C by the G12 pathway may contribute to the mitogenic effect. In addition, Gα12-mediated gene expression is at least partially Ras-dependent, and thus Gα12 may regulate proteins responsible for Ras activation. Further work will be necessary to clarify the G12 effector pathway and the steps leading to mitogenesis. INTRODUCTIONThrombin is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, astrocytes, and other cell lines (Van Obberghen-Schilling et al., 1985; Cavanaugh et al., 1990; Hung et al., 1992; LaMorte et al., 1993a, 1993b). Thrombin cleaves and activates a seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor to trigger G-protein-mediated stimulation of downstream effectors (Vu et al., 1991). The actions of thrombin in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells have been well characterized. In these cells, thrombin stimulates phospholipase C activity leading to mobilization of intracellular calcium, diglyceride generation, and redistribution of protein kinase C (Jones et al., 1989; Nieto et al., 1994). Thrombin receptor activation also leads to a biphasic increase in c-jun mRNA, an associated increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity, and a marked increase in AP-1-mediated gene expression and DNA synthesis (Trejo et al., 1992; LaMorte et al., 1993b). Ras function is required for the mitogenic effect of thrombin as well as thrombin-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity (LaMorte et al., 1993b).There is substantial information about the signaling pathways downstream of thrombin receptor activation; however, it is not known which of the heterotrimeric G-proteins couples thrombin to the mitogenic pathway. In fibroblasts, thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis is sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) 1The abbreviations used are: PTXpertussis toxinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineTREtetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) response element. (Chambard et al., 1987; van Corven et al., 1993). Experiments using microinjected antibodies against Gαo or Gαi suggested that the mitogenic effect of thrombin in CCL39 and in 3T3 fibroblasts is mediated through these G-proteins (LaMorte et al., 1993a; Baffy et al., 1994). However, in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis and thrombininduced gene expression are not inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment, 2G. R. Post, L. R. Collins, E. D. Kennedy, A. M. Aragay, D. Goldstein, and J. H. Brown, submitted for publication. suggesting that G-proteins of the Gi/Go family do not mediate these responses. The PTX-insensitive G-proteins Gq and/or G11 have also been reported to function in mitogenic signaling by thrombin and bradykinin in fibroblasts (LaMorte et al., 1993a; Baffy et al., 1994). However, studies comparing muscarinic and thrombin receptor signaling mechanisms in astrocytes and CCL39 fibroblasts demonstrate that, although both receptors interact with Gq/G11 to stimulate phospholipase C, release calcium, and activate protein kinase C, only thrombin can activate Ras and elicit cell proliferation (Trejo et al., 1992; Seuwen et al., 1990).2 These data suggest that activation of Gq and phospholipase C is insufficient to account for the full mitogenic effects of thrombin and that other signaling pathways are involved.The Gα12 and Gα13 subunits constitute a family of G-proteins distantly related to the other G-protein α subunits (Strathmann and Simon, 1991). Both Gα12 and Gα13 lack the cysteine residue that renders these proteins susceptible to ADP-ribosylation by PTX. The signaling pathways regulated by these G-proteins have not been identified. Activation of these G-proteins has nonetheless been linked to cell growth in several cell systems. Overexpression of Gα12 in NIH3T3 cells leads to neoplastic transformation (Chan et al., 1993), and expression of a GTPase-deficient mutant form of Gα12 and Gα13 can efficiently transform NIH3T3 cells (Jiang et al., 1993; Xu et al., 1993) and Rat-1 fibroblasts (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1994a). In addition, epidermal growth factor-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is enhanced in fibroblasts that express the activated mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1994b). Therefore, these G-proteins appear to be good candidates to be involved in PTX-insensitive signaling pathways leading to cell growth.In the present study we show that the activated mutant form of Gα12 induces AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation when transfected in 1321N1 cells, and this effect requires Ras function. Furthermore, we show that microinjection of an antibody against Gα12 can specifically block the mitogenic effect of thrombin. Taken together, these results suggest that Gα12 functions as a PTX-insensitive mediator of thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells."

Here, we show that the recently identified retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor (RORα) is expressed in the murine lens and activates the γF-crystallin promoter. In contrast to the retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors, activation of the γF-crystallin promoter by RORα requires binding to the single 3′ half-site and spacer sequences of γF-crystallin hormone response element (γF-HRE). We further demonstrate that RORα-dependent activation is repressed by the competitive binding of retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers to the γF-HRE in the absence of all-trans-retinoic acid.

INTRODUCTIONThe murine γ-crystallin gene locus contains six closely related but differentially regulated genes encoding lens structural proteins that are expressed concomitantly with lens cell differentiation(1Murer-Orlando M.

Lens-specific expression of the γF-crystallin gene is directed by proximal promoter sequences located immediately upstream of the TATA box which are conserved in all γ-crystallin genes, while upstream enhancer sequences are necessary for proper spatial expression within the lens(5Liu Q.

Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The γF-HRE consists of an everted arrangement of two nuclear receptor consensus half-sites motifs (PuGGTCA) separated by 8 nucleotides (referred to as everted repeat-8 or ER-8) and confers RA responsiveness when linked to a heterologous promoter(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The γF-HRE is bound in vitro by RA (RAR) and retinoid X (RXR) receptor heterodimers, and both classes of retinoid receptors were shown to cooperate in vivo to trans-activate this element. Recently, we have demonstrated that the γF-HRE also mediates thyroid hormone (T3) responsiveness of the γF-crystallin promoter(8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Although the γF-HRE is bound by the T3 receptor (T3R) in the form of heterodimers with either RXR or RAR, only T3R•RXR heterodimeric complexes appear to be transcriptionally active. These results show that RARα exerts a dominant role in the regulation of transcription of the γF-crystallin gene and underscore the complexity of the retinoid signal at the level of gene expression (for review, see (9Giguère V.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6290) Google Scholar). These proteins are referred to as orphan receptors. We have recently identified a novel family of orphan receptors (RORα, RAR-related orphan receptor) consisting of different isoforms that share common DNA- and putative ligand-binding domains but possess distinct amino-terminal domains which confer different DNA binding specificities (13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). RORα activates transcription constitutively upon binding as a monomer to response elements composed of the PuGGTCA core binding motif preceded by a 6-nucleotide A/T-rich sequence(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 14Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol. Cell.

We have shown that the γF-HRE is bound by RORα1 and acts as a strong HRE for this orphan receptor(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated more closely the interaction of RORα with the γF-HRE and have established that RORα can activate the γF-crystallin promoter in primary chick lens cell cultures. We demonstrate that RAR/RXR heterodimers compete with RORα for occupancy of the γF-HRE and that, in the absence of RA, the retinoid receptor complexes block RORα activation. Since the retinoid receptors and RORα are expressed in the lens, we suggest that both classes of receptors are likely to play important roles in the regulation of the γF-crystallin gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReverse Transcriptase-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from 100 mg of frozen murine eye lens tissue using 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2.0 μg of total RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer, primed with either 100 ng of oligo(dT) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 ng of gig1961 oligonucleotide (5′-TCTGAGGTCATCATCGAGTTCCGC-3′), or 20 ng of gig1962 (5′-CCGGCTGCAGAAATGCCTGGCCGT-3′).

The blot was washed twice for 30 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and then at 65°C with 0.2 × SSC and 0.2% SDS.Plasmids, Cell Culture, and TransfectionThe γF-crystallin and TREpalTKLUC reporter plasmids have been previously described(16Lok S. Stevens W. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3563-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Umesono K. Giguère V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). γF-HRE reporter constructs were prepared by cloning two copies of double-stranded oligonucleotides (see “Results”) containing SalI and BamHI cohesive ends into the SalI site of plasmid TKLUC. Primary lens cultures were prepared as described previously(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The equivalent of five lenses was plated on 60-mm culture dishes coated with collagen. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of γF-crystallin reporter construct and 1 μg of plasmid RSV-βgal, and 0.5-1.0 μg of RSV LTR-based expression vectors directing the synthesis of either the human RORα1 or RARα1. P19 and CV-1 cells were cultured on α-minimum essential medium containing 7% fetal calf serum. These were transfected with 2 μg of thymidine kinase promoter based reporter plasmids, 1 to 2 μg of RSV-βgal, and 100 to 500 ng of appropriate expression vector. Transfected cells were treated for 20 to 48 h with appropriate ligands. β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays were carried as described elsewhere(18Giguère V. Shago M. Zirngibl R. Tate P. Rossant J. Varmuza S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed using equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity using a non-TLC method as described by Amersham.In Vitro Translation and EMSAPlasmid pCMXhRARα (19Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) containing the human RARα1 cDNA(20Giguère V. Ong S.E. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), and plasmid pSKmRXRβ (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) containing the mouse RXRβ were linearized with BamHI and AccI, respectively. Plasmid pSKhR5 containing the human RORα1 cDNA was linearized with BamHI. Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using linearized plasmids and T7 RNA polymerase for RORα1 and RARα, while RXRβ mRNA was synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase. These mRNAs were used to synthesize RORα1, RARα1, and RXRβ protein in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). EMSAs were performed as described previously(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amount of reticulocyte lysate in each binding reaction was kept constant within a given experiment.RESULTSRORα Is Expressed in the Murine Lens and Activates the γF-Crystallin PromoterTo establish whether RORα is expressed in the murine lens we extracted RNA from lens tissue (2-week-old mice) and used reverse transcriptase to synthesize single strand cDNA using either an oligo(dT)- or an RORα-specific primer. The products of cDNA synthesis were amplified using RORα-specific primers designed to generate a 217-bp fragment spanning sequences at the end of the DNA-binding domain and the hinge region. As a control for amplification of genomic DNA, cDNA synthesis was also carried out with the 5′-RORα primer. Upon fractionation of the amplified products on an agarose gel, a band of correct size was detected in both the oligo(dT) and 3′-ROR oligonucleotide-primed cDNA reactions consistent with the presence of RORα transcripts in the lens. An additional smaller band was also detected in cDNA primed with a 3′-RORα oligonucleotide which may indicate the presence of different isoforms of RORα in the lens. Bands were not observed when cDNA synthesis was primed with a 5′ RORα oligonucleotide indicating that genomic DNA was not amplified in this experiment. The identity of the amplified bands was confirmed by mapping with restriction endonucleases (data not shown) and by hybridization with a radioactively labeled 107-bp RORα probe corresponding to sequences contained within the amplified fragment (Fig. 1).The 5′-flanking sequences of the murine γF-crystallin gene between nucleotides −226 to +47 are sufficient for optimal promoter activity in primary cultures of chick lens cells and for proper developmental regulation of a reporter gene in the lenses of transgenic mice(6Goring D.R. Bryce D.M. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Liu Q. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Lok S. Stevens W. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3563-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The γF-HRE (located at −210 to −185) mediates activation by both RAR and T3R and also contributes to basal promoter activity since deletion of the 3′ half-site and spacer sequences (−202 to −185) decreases promoter function(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lok S. Stevens W. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3563-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the first half-site eliminates RA response but has minimal effects on basal promoter activity(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there are endogenous transcription factors in lens cells that specifically recognize the downstream half-site and spacer of γF-HRE to stimulate basal promoter activity. The orphan receptor RORα interacts with a single PuGGTCA motif preceded by A/T-rich sequences and binds to a number of characterized response elements including the γF-HRE(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To determine whether RORα could activate the γF-HRE within the natural promoter context we performed transfections in chick lens cells using reporter gene constructs containing the bacterial CAT gene under the control of the mouse γF-crystallin promoter (−226 to +47). A mutant reporter construct containing a deletion of spacer sequences and the 3′ half-site of γF-HRE (Δ−202/-185) was also tested. Transfection of RORα1 expression vector increased wild-type promoter activity approximately 3.8-fold, while the Δ−202/-185 promoter mutant displayed reduced basal promoter activity and was not significantly activated by transfected RORα1 (Fig. 2).Figure 2:RORα1 activates the γF-crystallin promoter. Chick primary lens cultures were transfected with 10 μg of CAT gene reporter plasmids containing either wild type γF-crystallin 5′-flanking sequence −226 to + 47 (γF(-226/+47)) or an equivalent segment containing a deletion of the γF-HRE 3′ half-site and spacer sequences (Δ -202/-185). 500 ng of an expression vector containing the human RORα1 cDNA under the control of the RSV-LTR were cotransfected together with 1 μg of RSV-βgal as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection. The mean value of duplicate determinations is plotted and dots indicate the values of each determination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RORα1 Selectively Activates the γF-HREWe and others have shown that human RORα1 and rat RZRβ(a distinct ROR isoform)bind to a number of natural and synthetic response elements which are composed of two PuGGTCA half-sites arranged in different configurations (Fig. 3A)(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22Carlberg C. van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J.K. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-André M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have determined the relative binding affinity of RORα1 for these elements by performing competition studies using EMSA (Fig. 3B). Incubation of radioactively labeled γF-HRE oligonucleotide with in vitro synthesized RORα1 generates a single complex. Inclusion in the binding reactions of different molar excesses of response elements indicated that RORα binds with highest affinity to γF-HRE and TREpal. CRBPI-RARE competed poorly while βRARE failed to compete, indicating that RORα1 does not bind with high affinity to these elements.Figure 3:Competition analysis of hormone response elements for binding of RORα1. A, sequences of response elements used in this study. TREpal is an idealized response element derived from the rat growth hormone gene(38Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G.

Stunneberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), CRBPI-RARE was identified in the mouse cellular retinol binding protein I gene(40Smith W.C. Nakshatri H. Leroy P. Rees J. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2223-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). B, radiolabeled γF-HRE was incubated with reticulocyte lysate (2 μl) programmed with human RORα1 mRNA and fractionated on polyacrylamide gel cast in 0.5 × TBE. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the different response elements were included in the binding reactions at the indicated molar excess.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next compared the transcriptional activity of RORα1 on γF-HRE and TREpal which represent the highest affinity binding sites. Luciferase gene reporter plasmids containing a single copy of either element in front of the viral thymidine kinase promoter (−105 to +51) were tested by transfection in P19 cells. Since both γF-HRE and TREpal mediate transcriptional responses to retinoid receptors, duplicate transfected cells were treated with RA as a control. As can be observed from Fig. 4, the TREpal reporter plasmid was efficiently activated by RA treatment, but only the γF-HRE reporter could be activated by transfected RORα1.Figure 4:RORα1 is transcriptionally inactive on TREpal. Reporter plasmids (2 μg/plate) containing either the γF-HRE or TREpal in front of the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene were transfected into P19 cells together with RORα1 expression vector (0.5 μg/plate) and plasmid RSV-βgal. Duplicate plates were treated with RA (100 nM). Cells were grown for 24 h following transfection. The mean values of three independent experiments are plotted with the standard error indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Spacer Region and Downstream Half-site of γF-HRE Are Sufficient for High Affinity Binding of RORα1To determine which half-site of γF-HRE is occupied by RORα1 we tested two oligonucleotides (m1 and m2) containing either the 5′ or 3′ half-site and spacer sequences for binding of RORα1 in competition EMSA (Fig. 5). Oligonucleotide m2 containing the 3′ half-site competed as efficiently as the intact element, while oligonucleotide m1 containing the 5′ half-site competed less efficiently (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the 3′ half-site and spacer sequences are sufficient for high affinity binding of RORα. This conclusion is supported by transfection studies indicating that reporter plasmids containing two copies of either the intact γF-HRE or the 3′ half-site and spacer sequences are transactivated with the same efficiency by RORα1 while a reporter containing the 5′ half-site and spacer is not activated (Fig. 5C).Figure 5:The 3′ half-site and spacer are sufficient for high affinity binding and transcriptional activation by RORα1. Oligonucleotides containing either half-site and spacer sequences (A) were used as competitors in binding reactions (B) at the indicated molar excess. (C) Luciferase reporter plasmids (2 μg/plate) containing two copies of each oligonucleotide in front of the thymidine kinase promoter were transfected in P19 cells together with RORα1 expression vectors (500 ng/plate). The mean values of three independent experiments are plotted with the standard error indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison of the spacer sequences preceding each half-site suggests that the cytosines located at the first and second positions (−1 and −2) upstream of the 3′ half-site may be required for preferential binding of RORα1. As expected from previous analysis of the RORα1 binding properties(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), deletion of dinucleotide CC (m4) decreased binding, whereas replacement with AG (m3) failed to do so (Fig. 6B). The importance of other sequences within the spacer is confirmed by additional mutant oligonucleotides (m5, m6, and m7) (Fig. 6C). In accordance with the consensus RORE determined by binding site selection(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 14Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacement of the dinucleotide AA (positions −3 and −4) with thymidines does not affect binding while replacement with CG causes a sharp reduction in binding affinity. Mutation of TT at positions −5 and −6 causes a slight reduction in binding.Figure 6:Analysis of spacer mutants for binding of RORα1. Mutant oligonucleotides (A) were used as competitors in binding reactions (B and C). Each composite was derived from the same experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RAR/RXR Heterodimers Repress RORα-dependent Activation by Competing for Occupancy of the γF-HREWe have previously shown that primary cultures of chick lens cells are responsive to RA indicating the presence of endogenous retinoid receptors(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice disrupted for RAR α and γ genes display extensive ocular defects including lens fiber abnormalities (23Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dollé P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence for a role of RARs in lens and eye development. In P19 cells, combined transfection of RORα1 and RA treatment results in greater levels of transactivation of the γF-HRE suggesting that retinoid receptors and RORα cooperate in transcriptional regulation (Fig. 4).To investigate the functional relationship between retinoid receptors and RORα on this element, we performed transfection studies in CV-1 cells which contain low levels of endogenous retinoid receptors. A sensitive reporter construct containing three copies of γF-HRE was activated approximately 20-fold by transfected RORα1 (Fig. 7A). Additional RA-dependent stimulation was not observed unless RAR expression vector was cotransfected. In the absence of RA, transfected RAR represses RORα mediated activation in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, RAR can either repress RORα activation or cooperate in activation depending on the availability of its cognate ligand. Repression in the absence of RA may be explained by competition of retinoid receptor complexes with RORα for occupancy of γF-HRE. To demonstrate this we performed EMSA with a limiting concentration of radiolabeled γF-HRE, a constant amount of RAR and RXR and increasing amounts of RORα. An RORα mutant with truncated carboxyl terminus (RORαΔ235) used in these studies forms a fast migrating complex due to its smaller size. As can be seen in Fig. 7B, increasing the amount of RORαΔ235 in the binding reaction causes a dose-dependent decrease in the formation of RAR•RXR complexes. Consistent with these results, co-transfection of RORαΔ235 which is transcriptionally inactive blocks both RA- and RORα-dependent activation on γF-HRE reporter plasmids (data not shown).Figure 7:Retinoid receptors and ROR compete for binding to γF-HRE. A, a constant amount of RORα1 expression vector (1 μg) was transfected with the indicated amounts of RARα expression vector. A luciferase reporter plasmid was used containing three copies of the γF-HRE. B, binding reactions were carried out with a limiting amount of probe (0.01 ng), a fixed amount of RAR/RXR and increasing amounts of a ROR mutant lacking the carboxyl terminus (RORΔ235). The RAR/RXR band was quantified using an Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Arbitrary values representing intensity of the RAR/RXR band was plotted on the y axis and amount of RORΔ235 added was plotted on the x axis. Above is a representative experiment in duplicate where the values of each determination did not vary by more than 30%. The experiment was performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONDuring lens development, differentiation of epithelial cells into fiber cells is regulated by factors secreted from the retina(24Coulombre J. Coulombre A. Science. 1963; 142: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Reyer R.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 24: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto Y. Dev. Growth Diff. 1976; 18: 273-278Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The γF-crystallin gene thus provides an excellent model to study the molecules and transactivating factors that control differentiation processes in the developing lens. Recently, we have shown that both RA and T3 activate γF-crystallin gene expression through a novel HRE (γF-HRE) located in the upstream enhancer element (−210 to −185) of the γF-crystallin promoter (7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar) and proposed that RA may serve as a regulatory signal in lens development. This suggestion is supported by the analysis of mice bearing disrupted RARα and γ genes which display severe ocular defects including abnormal lens fibers and agenesis of the lens(23Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dollé P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the regulation of the γF-crystallin gene by RORα1, an orphan member of the superfamily of steroid-thyroid-retinoid receptors, via interactions with the γF-HRE. We further demonstrate that constitutive activation of the γF-HRE by RORα1 is repressed by the competitive binding of RAR/RXR heterodimeric complexes to the element in the absence of RA.The γF-HRE consists of an everted repeat of two consensus nuclear receptor half-sites (PuGGTCA) separated by 8 nucleotides. This element is bound by all three heterodimeric combinations of RAR, T3R, and RXR and these binding activities require that both half-sites be intact(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 3′ half-site and six adjacent nucleotides (TTAACCAGGTCA) of the γF-HRE are sufficient for proper recognition by RORα1. Since transcriptional activation by transfected RORα1 is constitutive, these findings are consistent with the mutational analyses of the γF-crystallin promoter. Specifically, previous experiments indicated that alterations of the 5′ half-site of the γF-HRE abolished binding of lens nuclear factors but had only a marginal effect on basal promoter activity while deletion of the spacer sequences and 3′ half-site significantly reduced promoter function(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Lok S. Stevens W. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3563-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis also demonstrates that the two A residues at positions −3 and −4 relative to the 3′ half-site are crucial for binding activity. The A/T-rich sequences in RORα binding sites may allow local distortion of DNA upon binding which may optimize protein:DNA interactions. Consistent with this notion, RORα1 has been shown recently to induce a large DNA bend (∼130°) upon binding to a consensus ROR binding site(15McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 796-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The orphan receptor RORα1 activates the γF-crystallin promoter in transfected lens epithelial cells without addition of exogenous ligands suggesting either that it functions in a ligand-independent manner or that a putative ligand is present in the culture medium or metabolized by lens cells. The identification of an ROR ligand would be important not just in the regulation of γ-crystallin genes and lens development but probably in many developmental processes since ROR is widely expressed(27Becker-André M. André E. DeLamarter J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Retnakaran R. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that human RZRα and RZRβ (isoforms of ROR) can be activated by melatonin and a synthetic ligand, CGP 52608(29Wiesenberg I. Missbach M. Kahlen J.P. Schrader M. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 30Becker-André M. Wiesenberg I. Schaeren-Wiemers N. André E. Missbach M. Saurat J.-H. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous attempts to demonstrate activation of RORα1 by melatonin on γF-HRE or consensus RORα1 binding sites reporter plasmids have failed. 2M. Tini, I. Dussault, and V. Giguère, unpublished data. It is clear from our results that additional experiments are needed in order to ascribe a possible role for melatonin in the activation of RORα. Nonetheless, the regulation of the γF-crystallin promoter by ligand activated transcription factors (7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the possibility that their ligands may constitute the signals originating from retina that control lens development.We have shown that in the absence of RA, increasing levels of RARα blocks RORα1 activation of γF-HRE reporter genes in a dose-dependent manner. These results are similar to those obtained in our study of the activation of the γF-crystallin promoter by T3R/RXR heterodimers(8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected RARα potently represses T3 response from γF-HRE reporter plasmids apparently by competition for binding site occupancy. Taken together, these data suggest that RAR/RXR heterodimers exert a dominant role in the regulation of the γF-crystallin gene by nuclear receptors. These results contrast to those observed for the interactions of orphan receptors ARP-1/COUP-TFII, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and RXR/RAR on the Oct-3/4 promoter where the orphan receptors completely abolish promoter activation by RXR/RAR heterodimers(31Ben-Shushan E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings clearly demonstrate that the specificity of the retinoid signal is dependent on the configuration of the response element as well as the repertoire of competing orphan receptors.A number of orphan receptors have been identified which like RORα can regulate transcription by binding as monomers to target sequences consisting of a single half-site and a few adjoining bases(14Giguère V.

Since response elements for RA, T3, and vitamin D3 receptors consist of two or more half-sites, it is likely that monomeric-binding orphan receptors interact with many of these response elements possibly modifying hormonal responses(37Carter M.E.

The combined action of RORα and related nuclear receptors in the regulation of the γF-crystallin gene is likely to be of primary importance in the developmental expression in the lens.

Tini, unpublished observations. suggests a comprehensive role of this orphan receptor in the regulation of γ-crystallin gene family. INTRODUCTIONThe murine γ-crystallin gene locus contains six closely related but differentially regulated genes encoding lens structural proteins that are expressed concomitantly with lens cell differentiation(1Murer-Orlando M.

Lens-specific expression of the γF-crystallin gene is directed by proximal promoter sequences located immediately upstream of the TATA box which are conserved in all γ-crystallin genes, while upstream enhancer sequences are necessary for proper spatial expression within the lens(5Liu Q.

We have previously shown that the γF-crystallin promoter is activated by retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorRXRretinoid X receptorRORαretinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptorγF-HREγF-crystallin hormone response elementT3triiodothyronineT3RT3 receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionRSVRous sarcoma virusβgalβ-galactosidaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasebpbase pair(s)LUCluciferaseTKthymidine kinaseRAREretinoic acid response elementCRBPcellular retinol binding protein I. treatment and have characterized a complex hormone response element (γF-HRE) located within the upstream enhancer region(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The γF-HRE consists of an everted arrangement of two nuclear receptor consensus half-sites motifs (PuGGTCA) separated by 8 nucleotides (referred to as everted repeat-8 or ER-8) and confers RA responsiveness when linked to a heterologous promoter(7Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The γF-HRE is bound in vitro by RA (RAR) and retinoid X (RXR) receptor heterodimers, and both classes of retinoid receptors were shown to cooperate in vivo to trans-activate this element. Recently, we have demonstrated that the γF-HRE also mediates thyroid hormone (T3) responsiveness of the γF-crystallin promoter(8Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Although the γF-HRE is bound by the T3 receptor (T3R) in the form of heterodimers with either RXR or RAR, only T3R•RXR heterodimeric complexes appear to be transcriptionally active. These results show that RARα exerts a dominant role in the regulation of transcription of the γF-crystallin gene and underscore the complexity of the retinoid signal at the level of gene expression (for review, see (9Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 11Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6290) Google Scholar). These proteins are referred to as orphan receptors. We have recently identified a novel family of orphan receptors (RORα, RAR-related orphan receptor) consisting of different isoforms that share common DNA- and putative ligand-binding domains but possess distinct amino-terminal domains which confer different DNA binding specificities (13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). RORα activates transcription constitutively upon binding as a monomer to response elements composed of the PuGGTCA core binding motif preceded by a 6-nucleotide A/T-rich sequence(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 14Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol. Cell.

We have shown that the γF-HRE is bound by RORα1 and acts as a strong HRE for this orphan receptor(13Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated more closely the interaction of RORα with the γF-HRE and have established that RORα can activate the γF-crystallin promoter in primary chick lens cell cultures. We demonstrate that RAR/RXR heterodimers compete with RORα for occupancy of the γF-HRE and that, in the absence of RA, the retinoid receptor complexes block RORα activation. Since the retinoid receptors and RORα are expressed in the lens, we suggest that both classes of receptors are likely to play important roles in the regulation of the γF-crystallin gene."

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the membrane dynamics mediating retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER remain to be clarified. Insight into this problem has been limited by the availability of marker proteins that efficiently traverse this pathway. Cytotoxic proteins including diphtheria toxin, Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin-1 (SLT-1), and Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which kill mammalian cells by catalytically inhibiting protein synthesis, enter the cytosol from intracellular compartments in order to reach their substrates. With the exception of diphtheria toxin, which enters the cytosol from acidified endosomes, the intracellular site of translocation of the other toxins is now believed to involve either Golgi compartments or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (reviewed in (2Sandvig K. van Deurs B.

Given that the biochemical mechanisms involved in retrograde transport from the cell surface to early compartments of the exocytic secretory pathway are unknown, we have used a molecular approach to address the mechanism and site of toxin release. Vesicle transport of cargo from the ER to Golgi compartments is now recognized to involve two protein complexes, referred to as COPI and COPII, which mediate vesicle budding from either the ER (COPII), or pre-Golgi intermediates and Golgi compartments (COPI) (reviewed in (4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar)). The assembly of COPII and COPI coats are regulated by the small GTPases Sar1 and ARF1, respectively (reviewed in (5Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)). Vesicle fusion appears to be controlled by a common mechanism involving SNARE complexes (reviewed in (4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar)) whose assembly is controlled by GTPases belonging to the Rab family (reviewed in (5Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)). By transiently expressing mutant forms of these GTPases in the presence of toxin, we now establish a molecular requirement for COPI, COPII, and SNARE complexes in mediating cytotoxicity. These results lead us to suggest that the retrograde transport of toxins occurs via the active recycling of toxin-specific receptors between the ER and the terminal compartments of the Golgi stack. -Ricin A chain was purchased from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Alderley Edge, United Kingdom). Ricin A chain was (10 μg) was mixed with 10 μg of ricin B chain (Inland Laboratories, Austin, TX) in a total volume of 200 μl in PBS by gently agitating on a klinostat at room temperature for 3 h. A 0.5-ml polyacrylamide column containing immobilized galactose (Pierce) was used to purify reassociated ricin holotoxin from free A chain. The purity of preparations was quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry. Pseudomonas exotoxin A was obtained from Sigma. Diphtheria toxin was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SLT-1 was a kind gift from Nicholas Lea, University of Warwick. Briefly, the SLT operon was amplified by PCR from E. coli 0157 cell paste and cloned into a pUC19 expression vector. E. coli JM105 was transformed with this vector and used to express SLT-1 to a high level following isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. The cells were washed, and the periplasm fraction extracted and then loaded on a globotriose-Sepharose affinity column (kindly provided by D. Muller, University of Warwick). Pure fractions of SLT-1 were eluted under denaturing conditions of 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 6.7. These were dialyzed against PBS, and toxin was quantified. Transient expression in HeLa cells was carried out as described(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (7 × 106 cells) were plated in 100-mm dishes the day prior to transfection. After infection with vaccinia T7 polymerase recombinant virus (vTF7-3), the cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of an expression vector carrying VSV-G under control of the T7 promoter (pAR-G) and 50 μl of the transfection reagent LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM). After 2 h of transfection at 37°C, the transfection medium was removed. The cells were detached from the dish with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM EDTA, washed once with DMEM, and resuspended in the transfection medium. Fetal bovine serum was added to a final concentration of 2.5%. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes (1.0 × 106 cells/dish) and incubation continued for 3 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, and ricin holotoxin was added in DMEM, 2.5% serum to individual dishes at concentrations indicated (in duplicate). Cells were then incubated in the presence of toxin for 3 h at 37°C. Following intoxication, the level of VSV-G synthesis was quantitated by a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were incubated for 15 min in methionine-deficient minimal essential medium, radiolabeled for 10 min with 33 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), and then chased for 5 min in DMEM containing 10% serum. Cells were lysed and VSV-G immunoprecipitated as described(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were subsequently analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The levels of VSV-G synthesis in toxin-treated cells is reported as percentage of total found in control cells that were not treated with toxin. The rate of VSV-G transport from the ER to the cell surface was determined as follows; HeLa cells (6 × 106 cells) were plated in 100-mm dishes the day prior to transfection. After infection of the cells with recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3)(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the temperature-sensitive mutant form of VSV-G (tsO45) for 4 h at the restrictive temperature (39.5°C) to retain VSV-G tsO45 in the ER (7Lafay F. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as described(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then rapidly transferred to a 40°C water bath, washed twice with PBS prewarmed to 40°C, and detached with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA at 40°C. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2 and resuspended in ice-cold minimal essential medium, 2.5% serum to a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. For each time point, 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred into a 5-ml Falcon tube and cells were incubated at the permissive temperature (32°C) for the indicated time to allow the synchronized release of tsO45 VSV-G from the ER and transport to the cell surface. At the indicated time points under “Results and Discussion,” cells were transferred to ice and diluted in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% NaN3. Transport of VSV-G to the cell surface was subsequently determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using an antibody specific for the extracytoplasmic domain of VSV-G (BW8G5) and visualized by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. To define the molecular basis for retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER in vivo, we applied a transient expression system to overproduce trans dominant interfering mutants of GTPases involved in vesicular traffic in both the exocytic and endocytic pathways to assess their effect on the toxicity of ricin and related toxic proteins. Toxin action was measured by co-expressing each GTPase with a plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), an N-glycosylated type 1 membrane protein. The ability of increasing concentrations of ricin and other toxins to inhibit the synthesis of VSV-G was examined after 5-6 h of transient expression where GTPases are expressed ∼5-15-fold above the endogenous level(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The effects of increasing concentrations of ricin on the synthesis of VSV-G in the absence of GTPases is shown in Fig. 1. Half-maximal toxicity was observed at a concentration of ∼2 ng/ml, with greater than 90% inhibition at concentrations above 25 ng/ml. These results are similar to the effect of ricin on general protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro as reported previously(10Argent R.H. Roberts L.M. Wales R. Robertus J.D. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26705-26710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wales R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23986-23990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the effects of a dynamin element 1 mutant that strongly inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis(12Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), a Rab5 mutant that inhibits receptor recycling from endosomes to the cell surface (13Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), and a Rab9 mutant that inhibits clathrin-mediated transport of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor from the late endosome to the TGN (14Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). None of these mutants prevented either ricin or diphtheria toxicity (Table 1). While indirect experiments have previously suggested that diphtheria toxin gains access to endosomes via a clathrin-mediated pathway(15Moya M. Dantry-Varsat A. Gond B. Lourvard D. Boquet P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that both classes of toxins can be efficiently internalized via receptor recycling pathways that are clathrin-independent.Table I Open table in a new tab Since modified forms of ricin, which cannot bind galactose-bearing receptors but which contain high mannose oligosaccharides enabling them to be internalized via the mannose receptor to the TGN, fail to intoxicate macrophages(16Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Walbridge S. Saxena S.K. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 257: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), ricin intoxication of these cells apparently requires binding to an intracellular galactosylated component which itself is capable of undergoing retrograde transport through the Golgi stack. By analogy to endocytic receptors, such a receptor(s) may be actively recirculating between one or more compartments of the early secretory pathway. A test for this possibility is to determine if the toxicity of ricin can be prevented by inhibiting the anterograde transport of the putative receptor(s) to its site of interaction with ricin in the TGN. In principle, such a block would deplete recycling receptor(s) from terminal Golgi compartments, therefore reducing toxin sensitivity. For this purpose, we examined the ability of dominant interfering mutants of Rab1, ARF1, and Sar1, small GTPases that regulate the assembly of protein complexes involved in vesicle formation, targeting, and fusion in the early exocytic pathway to prevent ricin cytotoxicity (reviewed in (5Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)). Mutant forms of these GTPases defective in guanine nucleotide exchange and/or hydrolysis have potent inhibitory effects on the anterograde transport of VSV-G through the secretory pathway(6Dascher C.

For these experiments, VSV-G was used not only as a translational marker as shown above (Fig. 1) but, in addition, as a measure for inhibition of anterograde transport between the ER and the Golgi stack. This was accomplished by following the processing of VSV-G N-linked oligosaccharides to the endoglycosidase H-resistant forms, a hallmark of delivery to the cis/medial Golgi compartments (21Pryer N.K.

Overexpression of Rab1a mutants that inhibit the targeting/fusion of ER- and Golgi-derived vesicular carriers (9Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) markedly protected cells from ricin intoxication (Fig. 2A). The Rab1a(N124I)-activated mutant, which has a high rate of guanine nucleotide exchange(18Pind S. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Farquhar M.G. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), allowed VSV-G synthesis at ∼62% of the control value observed in the presence of 5 ng/ml ricin (Fig. 2A), a concentration that allowed only 22% synthesis in the absence of the GTPase mutant (Fig. 1). This degree of protection correlates well with the ability of the mutant to inhibit VSV-G transport by 64% (Fig. 3c). The Rab1a(S25N) mutant restricted to the GDP-bound form (19Nuoffer C.N. Davidson H.W. Matteson J. Meinkoth J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was less effective, 5 ng/ml ricin allowing VSV-G synthesis at 39% of the control (Fig. 2A) and causing a corresponding 39% inhibition of VSV-G transport (Fig. 3d). In contrast, overexpression of wild type Rab1a, which has no effect on VSV-G transport (Fig. 3b), did not protect against ricin, allowing VSV-G synthesis at only 12% of the level observed in the absence of ricin (Fig. 2A). At the highest ricin concentration tested (100 ng/ml), a level that completely inhibits cellular protein synthesis in the control (Fig. 1), both the S25N and N124I mutants still allowed VSV-G synthesis to ∼33% of the level observed in the absence of toxin (Fig. 2A). These values are summarized in Table 1. This level of protection is striking given that only one molecule of ricin is necessary to inhibit cellular protein synthesis(3Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Robertus J.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), suggesting that a significant fraction of the cells have completely inhibited the transport of ricin to its site of release. Identical results were observed with E. coli SLT-1 and Pseudomonas exotoxin A, while diphtheria toxin was completely insensitive to overexpression of both Rab1 mutants at all concentrations tested (data not shown). These data provide evidence that the assembly of fusion complexes known to be involved in anterograde traffic is required for the retrograde transport of ricin from the TGN to its site of release in an early compartment of the secretory pathway, emphasizing the possible need for recycling receptors.Figure 3:Levels of inhibition of VSV-G transport by trans dominant GTPase mutants. Transfected cells used in the experiment described in Fig. 2 were analyzed for the level of processing of VSV-G to the endoglycosidase H-resistant forms as an index of ER to Golgi transport as described(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the requirement for non-clathrin COPI-coated vesicles in ricin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis. While a large body of evidence has accrued to suggest a role for COPI coats in anterograde transport through the early secretory pathway (reviewed in (25Kreis T.E. Pepperkok R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), recent studies have suggested that COPI components may, in addition, mediate retrograde traffic from the cis-Golgi compartment to the ER (26). The assembly of COPI vesicle coats is controlled by ARF1 (reviewed in (27Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)). For example, overexpression of GDP- and GTP-restricted mutants of ARF1 potently inhibit VSV-G transport in vivo(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific prediction is that ARF1 mutants should effectively block ricin intoxication by blocking either anterograde or retrograde transport. Overexpression of the ARF1 mutants restricted to either the GTP (ARF1(Q71L))- or GDP (ARF1(T31N))-bound forms led to marked protection against ricin (Fig. 2B) and inhibition of VSV-G transport (Fig. 3, f and g). No effect was observed with wild-type ARF1 with VSV-G synthesis allowed at only 10% of the value observed in the absence of ricin (Fig. 2B). In particular, in the presence of the ARF1(T31N-“GDP”) mutant VSV-G synthesis was allowed at a level of ∼50% in the presence of 5 ng/ml toxin (Fig. 2B). The effects of ARF mutants at medium (5 ng/ml) and high (100 ng/ml) doses are summarized in Table 1. Given that brefeldin A (BFA) also inhibits ricin intoxication(28Yoshida T. Chen C. Zhang M. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and that both BFA and the ARF1(T31N-“GDP”) mutant trigger the loss of COPI coats and the fusion of early cis/medial Golgi compartments with the ER(6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), these data provide strong evidence that components of the COPI coat machinery are essential for the normal routing of a ricin receptor(s) through the Golgi to its site of translocation to the cytosol. Must ricin be transported from the cis-Golgi compartment to the ER for toxicity? Since both Rab1 and ARF1 mutants inhibit ER to Golgi as well as intra-Golgi transport (6Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore cannot address this issue, we examined the effects of dominant interfering mutants of Sar1. Sar1 is essential for the formation of COPII vesicle coats involved in export from the ER(30Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Sar1 has been localized to transitional elements of the ER and is exceptionally abundant on ER-derived, but not Golgi-derived vesicular carriers(20Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Mutants in the COPII machinery that effectively inhibit export from the ER (31Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) do not inhibit retrograde traffic between the cis-Golgi compartment and the ER in yeast(26Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of a Sar1 GTP-restricted mutant potently inhibits transport from the ER to the Golgi stack in yeast(32Oka T. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, both the GDP-restricted Sar1(T39N) mutant and the GTP-restricted Sar1(H79G) inhibit ER to Golgi transport, but not the retrograde recycling of marker proteins from the Golgi back to the ER(20Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). 2M. Aridor, T. Rowe, S. Bannykh, and W. E. Balch, submitted for publication. As shown in Fig. 2C, overexpression of the Sar1-GTP and Sar1-GDP mutants resulted in a pronounced ∼54% and 43% protection, respectively, from ricin toxicity at 5 ng/ml, values consistent with their ability to inhibit VSV-G transport by ∼60% and ∼33%, respectively (Fig. 3, i and j; Table 1). Similar results were observed for the effects of the Sar1-GTP mutant on intoxication by both E. coli SLT-1 and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Table 1). The striking sensitivity of SLT-1 to Sar1 mutants suggests that recycling glycosphingolipid receptors, which bind SLT-1(33Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E. Stromberg N. Westling-Ryd M. Schultz J.E. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may also gain access to the ER via retrograde transport through the Golgi stack. Importantly, the Sar1-GTP mutant had no significant effect on intoxication of cells with diphtheria toxin (Table 1). Given the specificity of Sar1 function for anterograde transport from the ER, these results suggest that translocation of these potent toxins to the cytosol involves a receptor actively recycling between the ER and Golgi stack. These data are consistent with the reported visualization of Shiga toxin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates in the ER lumen of butyric-acid treated A431 cells(34Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred O. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Is the relative rate of flux of toxin receptor(s) in the retrograde direction similar to that observed for anterograde transport of cargo? At a concentration of 100 ng/ml, ricin inhibited VSV-G synthesis with a lag of 75 min and a subsequent t½ of 55 min (Fig. 4, circles). This value is comparable to the rate of anterograde transport of VSV-G to the cell surface in HeLa cells, where VSV-G was found to be transported with a t½ of 60 min following a 20-min lag as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 4, squares). Similar kinetics of intoxication have been observed for Pseudomonas exotoxin A in HeLa cells. 3D. Fitzgerald, personal communication. In the case of Shiga toxin, more rapid kinetics have been reported(35Eiklid K. Olsnes S. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 771-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were in good agreement with a t½ of 35 min (∼2-fold that of ricin) (Fig. 4, triangles) in the HeLa cell line used for the present studies. These values are considerably more rapid than the rate of resialylation of the transferrin receptor in the TGN (t½ = 2-3 h) (36Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or the processing of glycoproteins by cis-Golgi enzymes (t½ = 4-8 h) following treatment of cells with inhibitors of ER/Golgi-associated mannosidases(37Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that toxin receptors can move at equivalent rates in the retrograde direction to that of anterograde transported molecules, and suggest a potential for comparable bidirectional membrane flow in the exocytic and endocytic pathways. What is the receptor involved in intoxication by ricin-like molecules? Pseudomonas exotoxin A possesses a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) analog (REDLK) at its carboxyl terminus, which is essential for toxicity(38Chaudhary V.K. Jinno Y. Fitzgerald D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Moreover, adding the ER retrieval sequence KDEL to the carboxyl terminus of ricin significantly increases its cytotoxicity to Vero cells(11Wales R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23986-23990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the retrograde delivery of extracellular toxins to the ER can be mediated by the KDEL receptor, a protein that is generally considered to be concentrated in pre-Golgi intermediates and the cis-Golgi compartment (reviewed in (39Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, ricin must encounter a galactosylated receptor in the TGN for efficient intoxication. Calreticulin (CaBP3) is an example of a soluble, “resident” ER glycoprotein that contains a KDEL retrieval motif, is terminally galactosylated, and has been demonstrated to recirculate between the ER and the trans-Golgi compartments in the liver(40Peter F. Nguyen V.P. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10631-10637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given our results, a reasonable hypothesis is that ricin binds to a molecule such as CaBP3 and is retrieved via the KDEL-mediated pathway. These results suggest that receptors containing a KDEL retrieval signal efficiently recycle from the terminal (trans) Golgi compartments. Although we have emphasized the interpretation that the effects of these mutants is to disrupt the delivery of a recycling receptor between the ER and TGN, several alternative interpretations are possible. One possibility, albeit a more general interpretation of our specific hypothesis, is that inhibition of anterograde transport leads to the depletion of lipids or other proteins that indirectly effect toxin retrieval from the TGN by globally disrupting the retrograde transport machinery. A second possibility is that disruption of anterograde flow leads to an altered ability of the ER to either receive retrograde transported vesicles or that the lipid composition of the ER is changed, interfering with the ability of toxin to exit to the cytosol. While such alternative conclusions cannot be excluded at this time, we find the effects of the Sar1 mutants, which exclusively block anterograde transport from the ER but do not inhibit transport through the Golgi stack (20Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) or retrograde retrieval from the Golgi to the ER,2 offers compelling evidence for the hypothesis that retrograde transport of toxins is mediated by actively recycling receptors. Moreover, when the rate of retrieval of toxin receptors is compared with the markedly reduced rate of retrograde transport of bulk protein based on carbohydrate processing(36Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), these data suggest that a significant degree of sorting occurs during retrograde transport through the Golgi stack. This emphasizes the vesicular nature of this pathway and the likelihood for the specific involvement of COP and SNARE complexes. We gratefully acknowledge M. Zerial (EMBL) for providing expression plasmids encoding the wild-type and Rab5 mutant, S. Pfeffer (Stanford University) for expression plasmids encoding the wild-type and Rab9 mutant, and S. L.

Kirk C.J. Billah M.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These physiological effects are mediated through binding to specific membrane receptors of target cells. AVP receptors are coupled to G proteins and have been divided into at least three types, V1a, V1b, and V2. The V1a (vascular/hepatic) and V1b (anterior pituitary) receptors act through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to mobilize intracellular Ca2+(2Jard S. Gaillard R.C. Guillon G. Marie J. Schoenenberg P. Muller A.F. Manning M. Sawyer W.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar), while the V1a receptor mediates physiological effects such as cell contraction and proliferation, platelet aggregation, coagulation factor release, and glycogenolysis. The V1b receptor is expressed in the anterior pituitary where it stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone release. V2 receptors are found mainly in the kidney and are linked to adenylate cyclase and the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate associated with antidiuresis(3Thibonnier M. Kidney. Int. 1988; 34: S52-S56Google Scholar).Morel et al.(4Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) recently reported the cloning of a cDNA encoding the rat V1a receptor; a 1354-nucleotide cDNA encodes a 394-amino-acid protein with seven membrane-spanning domains similar to bacterial rhodopsin and other G protein-coupled receptors.

Thibonnier et al.(8Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the cDNA for human V1a receptor has 72% amino acid sequence identity to the rat V1a receptor. These findings suggested that the AVP-oxytocin receptors belong to a subgroup of the family of G protein-linked receptors. With respect to genomic cloning of AVP-oxytocin receptor family genes, Seibold et al.(9Seibold A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W. Birnbaumer M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51: 1078-1083PubMed Google Scholar) have described the structure of the gene encoding the human V2 receptor, which showed two very small intervening sequences in the coding region. The sizes and location of these introns are unique among the G protein-coupled receptor genes in that the second exon encodes only six of the seven transmembrane regions, the seventh such region being encoded by exon 3. Very recently, Rosen et al.(10Rosen F. Russo C. Banville D. Zingg H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) reported that the rat oxytocin receptor gene contains two introns, the second of which interrupts the coding region between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains. However, the structures of the V1 type receptor genes and analyses of the promoter regions of these genes remain to be determined. In addition, the cDNA sequence of the rat V1a receptor reported by Morel et al.(4Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) lacked a 3′-noncoding region. In the present report, we describe the structural organization of the rat V1a receptor gene, the complete cDNA sequence, and also the DNA sequence of the promoter region. The V1a receptor gene spans 3.8 kb and consists of two exons and one intron. The 3′-end of the cDNA showed that the major transcript terminates 442 bp downstream of the stop codon, in agreement with the reported mRNA size. The promoter region has features common to promoters of housekeeping genes, and the promoter activity is specifically expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, but not in NIH3T3 or skeletal muscle cells. We characterized the minimal region from nucleotides −296 and −222 which confers promoter activity and tissue specificity on the V1a receptor gene and found that 30- and 28-kDa nuclear proteins bind to this region.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLibrary Screening and DNA SequencingMethods of restriction analysis, screening recombinant genomic libraries, Southern blot transfer, hybridization to DNA on filters, subcloning into plasmid vectors, agarose, and polyacrylamide electrophoresis were performed as described(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1983Google Scholar). A Lambda DASH™ II rat genomic library prepared from Sprague-Dawley male testes (Stratagene) was screened using a rat V1a receptor cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −91 to +1343 of a V1a receptor cDNA clone (4Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) relative to the ATG initiation codon as a probe. The cDNA fragment was obtained by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as follows. Adult rat liver total RNA (1 μg) was transcribed with random hexamers (2.5 μM), dNTPs (1 mM), and RNase inhibitors (1 unit/μl) using murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl) for 45 min at 42°C as previously reported(12Matsubara H.

Invest. 1993; 92: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resultant single strand cDNA was amplified with the forward primer in the 5′-noncoding region (5′-GCGCAGAGCTTAGAACTCGGATCCTCCGGT-3′) and reverse primer in the 3′-noncoding region (5′-CTTTGGACGCAGTCTTGCAGGAGATGGCC-3′) using Taq polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). The resultant PCR product was radiolabeled by random oligonucleotide primer extension using [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe(14Matsubara H. Liman E.R. Hess P. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13324-13328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified and characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting. The specific restriction fragments subcloned into the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination. In addition to T3 and T7 primers, sequence-specific oligonucleotides were synthesized using a DNA synthesizer 381A (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).RNA AnalysisPrimer extension reactions and RNase protection were carried out with 40 μg and 10 μg of total RNA, respectively, as described(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1983Google Scholar). For analysis of V1a receptor mRNA, 30-nucleotide (nt)-long primers (nt −68 to −98 and +21 to +51 relative to the first ATG codon) were synthesized. For analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA, a 30-nt-long primer corresponding to nt +2 to +32 downstream from the HindIII site of the CAT gene was used(15Murasawa S. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RNase protection analysis, a HincII-digested EcoRI and BamHI genomic sequence (−480 to −72 relative to the ATG codon) was used for the probe. A RNA probe was generated using [α-32P]CTP and T7 RNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). After the probe was hybridized with RNA at 52°C overnight, it was digested with RNase T1 (0.21 unit/ml, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and RNase A (2.1 units/ml, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and analyzed on a 6% sequence gel, as described previously(18Mori Y. Matsubara H. Folco E. Siegel A. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26482-26493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Sequence of the Rapid Amplification Product of the 5′-End of Rat V1a Receptor cDNATwo micrograms of total cellular RNA from liver and A10 cells were reverse-transcribed for 45 min at 42°C using murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl, Life Technologies, Inc.). The primer was −264 to −294 relative to the ATG codon (Fig. 2). After removing excess primer with a spin column (Chroma spin-100, Clontech), the first strand reaction products were tailed with dATP using 10 units of terminal deoxytransferase as reported(18Mori Y. Matsubara H. Folco E. Siegel A. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26482-26493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification proceeded using a primer consisting of a T7 primer sequence and (dT)20 (TAATACGACTCACCTATAGGGCGAATTGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) and a nested primer complementary to the nucleotides from position −316 to −336 relative to the ATG codon. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced using the nested primer(16Nio Y. Matsubara H. Murasawa S. Kanasaki M. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 46-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product was analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After fixing and drying, the gel was autoradiographed at −70°C for 4 days.The Sequence of the Rapid Amplification Product of the 3′-End of Rat V1a Receptor cDNATotal cellular RNA (2 μg) from liver and A10 cells was reverse-transcribed for 45 min at 42°C using murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The primer was the same (dT)20 sequence as that used to determine the 5′-end of the cDNA. After removing excess primer, amplification proceeded with the (dT)20 primer and oligonucleotides designed from the 3′-noncoding region of the rat V1a cDNA sequences reported by Morel et al.(4Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) (+1280 to +1300 relative to the ATG initiation codon). The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced using M13 primers. The product was analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was autoradiographed at −70°C for 4 days.Construction of V1a Receptor CAT Expression VectorsThe 2.2-kb EcoRI-ApaI fragment was fused 5′ to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-pBluescript KS(-) construct (V1a 2208, Fig. 5). Sequential deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 5) were prepared by using restriction enzyme sites of XhoI (V1a 1605) and SacI (V1a 221), or Exonuclease III (double-stranded Nested Deletion Kit, Pharmacia). In brief, the V1a 2208-CAT construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRV (linker sites of pBs vector). The linearized DNA was incubated with exonuclease III, and samples were removed at timed intervals, then treated with S1 nuclease to remove single-stranded regions generated by the exonuclease III. Deletion mutants of desired sizes were recircularized with T4 DNA ligase. The 5′-end of deletion mutant was determined by reading the sequence. The ΔV1a 2208-CAT that lacks the sequence between −348 and −222 from V1a 2208-CAT construct was constructed by digestion with PstI and SacI followed by treatment with S1 nuclease and T4 DNA ligase.Figure 5:Expression of CAT fusion genes containing 5′-deleted V1a receptor gene sequences. The 5′-deletion mutants were transiently expressed in A10 and NIH3T3 cells. The cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and assayed. The names of these deletion mutants indicate the 5′-end points of the promoter sequence. ΔV1a 2208 indicates the CAT construct lacking the sequence between −348 and −222 from V1a 2208. The CAT activity levels, normalized with β-galactosidase activities and protein contents, are expressed relative to those in promoterless pBs-CAT, assigned a value of 1.0. The mean activities and S.E. from four separate assays are presented. ∗, p < 0.05;∗∗, p < 0.01 compared with the V1a 1006- and V1a 296-CAT construct, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA Transfection and CAT AssayPlasmids were banded in CsCl before transfection. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate method(15Murasawa S. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 4 h with 30 μg of plasmid DNA, treated with 15% glycerol for 1 min (glycerol shock), and supplemented with the growth medium. After a 48-h incubation, cells were harvested and extracted in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, by freezing-thawing. Using cell extracts, CAT activity was determined by a dual-phase diffusion assay that relies on the direct diffusion of the 14C-labeled acetylchloramphenicol into liquid scintillation counting fluid, as previously reported(15Murasawa S. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mori Y. Matsubara H. Folco E. Siegel A. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26482-26493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this period, each vial was counted at 30-min intervals (at least six times). The relationship between incubation time and radioactivity was linear, and the slope (calculated by linear regression) was proportional to CAT activity. In each transfection, 5 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase was co-transfected. CAT activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity and for cell density by protein concentration. The β-galactosidase assay was performed as previously reported(15Murasawa S. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mori Y. Matsubara H. Folco E. Siegel A. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26482-26493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein assay was performed by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). CAT activity was expressed relative to the activity of a promoterless CAT construct. Most transfection experiments were repeated a minimum of four separate times.Gel Retardation AssaysThe gel retardation assay was performed and nuclear extracts from culture cells were prepared as described(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1983Google Scholar). The DNA fragment between −296 and −221 bp relative to the ATG codon was obtained from V1a 296-CAT construct (Fig. 5) by BssHII (linker site of pBs vector) and SacI digestion and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment (Takara Shuzo) and purified as reported(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1983Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min on ice in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 12 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12% glycerol, and 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of excess competitor DNA. A radiolabeled DNA probe was added (0.1 ∼ 0.5 ng; 15,000 cpm), and the incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the mixture was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (90 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 140 V for 3 h followed by autoradiography.Southwestern (DNA-Protein) BlottingSouthwestern blotting proceeded as follows. Crude nuclear extracts (80 μg of protein each) mixed with 2.5% SDS, 2.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.025% pyronin for 5 min at room temperature were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 5% nonfat dried milk for 30 min at room temperature, and then in the same buffer containing salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), 0.25% nonfat dried milk, and 32P-labeled probe (nt −296 and −221 relative to the ATG codon) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 min at room temperature in the binding buffer, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film.Stable Transfectants of the Promoter-CAT Chimeric Plasmid and Cell CultureFifty micrograms of the V1a 2208-CAT construct were cotransfected with 5 μg of pcDNAneo (Invitrogen) into A10 cells. Two days after transfection, 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium. Three weeks after transfection, G418-resistant colonies were pooled and used for the experiments. The rat vascular smooth muscle (A10) cells (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), NIH3T3 (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan), and rat skeletal muscle (Sol 8) cells (a kind gift of Dr. Koren, Harvard University) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All culture medium contained 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Genomic Southern BlotsTen micrograms of rat genomic DNA prepared from the spleen was digested with the restriction endonucleases, EcoRI, BamHI, and XbaI, resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose gel, and blotted onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled 708-bp BamHI-KpnI cDNA fragment as described (14Matsubara H. Liman E.R. Hess P. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13324-13328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and washed in 0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 60°C.Reagents and Statistical MethodsAll reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated below. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analyses of variance and the Newmann-Keuls test were used for multigroup comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of Rat V1a Receptor Genomic ClonesA total of ∼106 clones from the genomic DNA library were screened with a 32P-labeled rat V1a cDNA probe. Four positive clones were isolated and analyzed further by means of restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blotting. The results indicated that these could be segregated into two overlapping clones, of which two (RGV1 and RGV2) harbored the entire rat V1a receptor cDNA sequence as reported by Morel et al.(4Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a map of these clones with recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI.Figure 1:Schematic representation of the rat V1a receptor gene. A, the gene locus is shown with the recognition sites for EcoRI (R) and BamHI (B) marked. Open and hatched boxes indicate nonexpressed and expressed exons, respectively. B, the structure of the rat V1a cDNA is presented at the bottom. Encoded transmembrane domains (I-VII) and other domains are displayed as hatched and open boxes, respectively.

O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A comparison of the V1a receptor genomic sequence with that of its cDNA indicated that one intron (∼1.8 kb) was located between the sixth and seventh putative transmembrane domains. The sequence of the splice site conformed to the GT-AG rule (Table 1)(17Breathnach R. Benoist C. O'Hare K. Cannon F. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). PCR using the primers designed from the intron sequence showed that the intron is about 1.8 kb in length (data not shown).Table I Open table in a new tab Sequence Analysis of Upstream 5′-Flanking RegionTo identify the DNA elements that control and direct rat V1a receptor gene transcription, we sequenced the 2208-bp region upstream from the ATG initiation codon. As shown in Fig. 2, neither TATA nor CCAAT promoter elements were found within the region containing the proximal major transcriptional initiation sites and the promoter activity, although sequences homologous to these motifs could be identified more than 800 bp upstream of the translational initiation site. It was, however, noted that the G + C content was 62% in the 400 bp immediately 5′ to the ATG initiation codon. This is higher than that of the average mammalian genome (40%); however, a GC box motif was not found in this region, suggesting that the promoter of the V1a receptor gene has features typical of a housekeeping gene(19Dynan W.S. Trends. Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Further analysis of the 5′-flanking region using a computer program (TFD 7.2) revealed potential TATA-like (−616 and −447)(20Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar), Sp1 binding (−557 and −1449)(21Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) sequences (Fig. 2). The TATA-like sequence(−447) is located at the position more than 200 bp upstream of the major transcriptional initiation sites and 48 bp upstream of the minor initiation site. The rat oxytocin receptor gene also has a promoter region and transcriptional initiation sites at positions more than 500 bp downstream of the TATA sequence(10Rosen F. Russo C. Banville D. Zingg H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB (−716 and −677), PEA3 (−1122 and −683), and GATA (−1713) binding sites (23Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) are located in the 5′-flanking region, the regulation of the rat V1a receptor expression by these factors has not been reported.Determination of Transcriptional Initiation Sites by Primer Extension, RNase Protection, and 5′-RACEResults of primer extension experiments using total RNA isolated from rat liver and A10 (rat vascular smooth muscle) cells are shown in Fig. 3A. Two primers were designed from the sequences from nt −68 to −98 and +21 to +51 relative to the ATG initiation codon. Three extended bands were detected by both primer extension analyses, corresponding to positions −405, −243, and −236 relative to the ATG codon (the results obtained using nt −68 to −98 primer are shown in Fig. 3A). No extended signals were observed when yeast tRNA or total RNA prepared from NIH3T3 or Sol 8 skeletal muscle cells, in which no V1a receptor mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR analyses, was used as a control. To confirm the results obtained by primer extension analyses, we performed RNase protection analyses. The riboprobe used in this assay was an antisense RNA runoff from a HincII-digested EcoRI-BamHI genomic DNA fragment subcloned into pBs KS(-). This HincII site is located at position −480 from the first ATG codon. If transcriptions begin at position −405, −243, and −236, as the result of primer extension analyses suggested, this probe would protect fragments 334, 171, and 164 nucleotides in length, respectively. Fig. 3B shows the results of RNase protection assays showing two major bands migrating at positions corresponding to approximately 171 nt and 164 nt, and one faint band of approximately 334 nt following RNase protection of total RNA prepared from liver and A10 cells. Protected bands were not evident when yeast tRNA or total RNA from NIH3T3 or Sol 8 skeletal muscle cells were used as controls. Thus, RNase protection analyses confirmed the presence of the three transcriptional start sites indicated by primer extension analyses.Figure 3:Primer extension (A) and RNase protection (B) analyses of the transcriptional initiation sites of the rat V1a receptor gene.

To examine how the product of one glycosylation step couples with the next transfer step, the endogenous gangliosides of Golgi membranes from 14-day-old chick embryo retina were labeled from CMP-[3H]NeuAc or UDP-[3H]GalNAc or UDP-[3H]Gal in conditions which do not allow vesicular intercompartmental transport. After saturation of the endogenous acceptor capacity, labeling was mostly in the immediate acceptors of the corresponding labeled sugars. However, some labeled intermediates progressed to more glycosylated gangliosides if the membranes were incubated in a second step in the presence of the necessary unlabeled sugar nucleotides. This was particularly evident in the case of membranes incubated with UDP-[3H]Gal, in which most of the [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide synthesized in the first step was converted to GM3 and GD3, or to GM2 or to GD1a in a second incubation step in the presence of unlabeled CMP-NeuAc alone, or together with UDP-GalNAc, or together with UDP-Gal plus UDP-GalNAc, respectively. Conversion was time dependent and dilution-independent. Since prior reports using brefeldin A indicate that transfer steps catalyzed by GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4 localize in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), our results lead to the following major conclusions: (a) transfer steps catalyzed by GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4 colocalize and are functionally coupled in the TGN; (b) proximal Golgi Gal-T1, Sial-T1, and Sial-T2, and their corresponding glycolipid acceptors, extend their presence to the TGN, and (c), GalNAc-T and Sial-T2 compete for a common pool of acceptor GM3 in the synthesis of GM2 and GD3.

The synthesis of the oligosaccharide of gangliosides occurs by successive transfers of sugar moieties from the corresponding sugar nucleotide donor to the proper glycolipid acceptor by specific membrane bound glycosyltransferases (for reviews, see Roseman, 1970; Caputto et al., 1974; Van Echten and Sandhoff, 1993). Current evidence indicates that within the Golgi complex ganglioside synthesis starts in a proximal compartment and ends in a more distal compartment. Thus, cytosolic addition of Glc to ceramide, Gal addition to GlcCer 1The abbreviations used are: GlcCerglucosylceramideHPTLChigh-performance thin-layer chromatographyLacCerlactosylceramidecpmcounts/minBFAbrefeldin A. The nomenclature used for gangliosides is that recommended by Svennerholm (1963). to form luminal LacCer and NeuAc addition to LacCer and GM3 to form GM3 and GD3, respectively, seem to occur in cis-Golgi compartments (Futerman and Pagano, 1991; Trinchera and Ghidoni, 1989; Jeckel et al., 1992). It has been recently shown that NeuAc addition to GD3 to form GT3 also occurs in a proximal Golgi compartment (Rosales Fritz and Maccioni, 1995). Addition of subsequent sugars (GalNAc, Gal, and NeuAc) to give ganglio series gangliosides is carried out by glycosyltransferases (GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4, see Fig. SI) which on subfractionation on isopycnic sucrose gradients colocalize with medial/trans-Golgi markers and peak at slightly different positions; these results were taken as an indication that these enzymes were arranged along the Golgi complex in the order in which they act (Trinchera and Ghidoni, 1989; Trinchera et al., 1990). glucosylceramide high-performance thin-layer chromatography lactosylceramide counts/min brefeldin A. The nomenclature used for gangliosides is that recommended by Svennerholm (1963). In spite of the evidences indicating a compartmental organization of ganglioside biosynthesis along the Golgi complex, the issue of how the product from one transfer step couples as substrate for the next transfer step in the building up of the oligosaccharide is still unclear. Uncovering the natural relationships between the different transfer steps is of importance because in addition to the control of the glycosyltransferase activities (for references see Daniotti et al., 1994) and of the sugar nucleotide availability (Martina et al., 1995), the control of the compartmental organization of the synthetic machinery could also be of relevance in regulating the expression of gangliosides by cells. To approach this issue, we study here the in vitro labeling of the endogenous gangliosides of Golgi complex preparations from chick embryo retina cells at 14 days of incubation. At this stage retina tissue actively synthesizes GD1a (Panzetta et al., 1980, 1987) and is appropriate for examining the coupling between the N-acetylgalactosaminyl-, galactosyl-, and sialyl- transfer steps required for the synthesis of ganglio series gangliosides. Retinas dissected from 14-day-old chicken embryo were suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 M sucrose (buffer A) and washed twice in the same buffer solution. The tissue was homogenized and the homogenate centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant fraction that was used as the starting material to obtain a Golgi fraction essentially as described (Landa et al., 1981; Iber et al., 1992): it was overlaid onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient made of 9 ml each of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 M-sucrose, and centrifuged 2.5 h at 54,000 × g in the SW 25 rotor of the Spinco Ultracentrifuge. The Golgi membrane enriched fraction was collected from the interphase 0.8-1.2 M sucrose and pooled. It showed an enrichment of Sial-T2 and GalNAc-T about 5-fold relative to the total homogenate. These activities were determined following already published procedures (for references, see Daniotti et al., 1994). Two step protocols were usually run. In the first step the incubation system contained, in a final volume of 20 μl, 15 mM MnCl2, 10 μM of UDP-[3H]Gal, or CMP-[3H]NeuAc or UDP-[3H]GalNAc, 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, and 15 μg of protein of Golgi membranes. Unless otherwise indicated, the system was incubated for 90 min at 37°C. In experiments in which incorporation was determined at 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 μM of sugar nucleotide, it was found that 10-20 μM produced about 60% of the maximal incorporation obtained at 50-100 μM (not shown). Ten μM was within the range of the apparent Km values of the sugar nucleotide transporters (Hirschberg and Snider, 1987). For each condition, the labeled nucleotide was added to give a specific radioactivity of 7,500 cpm/pmol. After the first step, membranes were freed from incubation medium ingredients by layering onto 0.6 M sucrose and centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 6 min at 4°C. The washed membrane pellet was resuspended to the original incubation volume with the ingredients of the first step but lacking the radioactive nucleotide. To the washed membranes, unlabeled UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, or CMP-NeuAc, alone or in mixtures of two or three and at concentrations that will be indicated in each case, were added and the second incubation step was carried out during 2 h. After incubation, the system was cooled in ice, diluted to 1 ml with distilled water, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. The pellet was supplemented with appropriate amounts of lactosylceramide (from human erythrocytes), GM3 (from canine spleen), GM2 (from Tay Sachs brain), and bovine brain gangliosides as internal standards and extracted by sonication in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:4.5 by volume). Water-soluble contaminants were removed by passing the extract through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in the same solvent mixture (Maccioni et al., 1974). For determination of total incorporation, an aliquot of the lipid extract was transferred to a vial, evaporated, resuspended in 50 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, mixed with a scintillation fluid containing 10% naphthalene and 2,5-diphenyloxazole, and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. For chromatographic analysis, the lipid extract was evaporated under N2 and run on HPTLC in a developing tank as described by Nores et al.(1994) using chloroform/methanol, 0.25% CaCl2 (60:35:8 by volume) as solvent for samples labeled from UDP-[3H]Gal or CMP-[3H]NeuAc and chloroform/methanol, 0.25% CaCl2 (45:45:10 by volume) for samples labeled from UDP-[3H]GalNAc. In two-dimensional HPTLC separations, the solvent in the second dimension was chloroform/methanol, 7% NH4OH (60:35:8 by volume). Positions of the internal standard gangliosides were determined by exposure of the plate to iodine vapors. Fluorography was carried out by dipping the plate in 2-methyl-naphthalene containing 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and further exposure of the plate to an x-ray film for 4-8 days at −70°C. The relative contribution of individual radioactive gangliosides was determined by densitometric scanning of the x-ray film in a CS 930 Shimadzu UV/vis scanner. Fig. 1A shows that the incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-[3H]Gal or UDP-[3H]GalNAc or CMP-[3H]NeuAc into total endogenous ganglioside acceptors of the Golgi membrane-enriched fraction was linear as a function of the protein concentration in the range of 0.25-1.5 mg protein/ml. Fig. 1B shows that the incorporation as a function of the incubation time was linear up to 30 min and then decreased and tend to plateau after 2 h. Results of Table 1 show that no inactivation of Gal-T2, GalNAc-T, and Sial-T4 occurred by preincubation of the membranes during 2 h before measuring their activities. This indicates that the tendency to plateau in the labeling of the endogenous acceptors observed in Fig. 1B was due to saturation of the endogenous acceptor capacity of the membranes which, if no dilution effect by endogenous sugar nucleotides had occurred, was about 90 pmol/mg of protein for NeuAc and GalNAc and about 270 pmol/mg of protein for Gal.Table I Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows a fluorogram of a HPTLC of radioactive endogenous gangliosides from Golgi membranes incubated with 10 μM of UDP-[3H]GalNAc or CMP-[3H]NeuAc or UDP-[3H]Gal during 1.5 and 4 h. Radioactive GM2 and GD2 were the major [3H]GalNAc-labeled products, radioactive GM3, GD3, GD1a, GT1b the major [3H]NeuAc-labeled products, and radioactive LacCer, GM1, GD1b the major [3H]Gal-labeled products. Although the total incorporation from each sugar nucleotide increased slightly from 1.5 to 4 h (Fig. 1B), the pattern of labeling from any of the radioactive nucleotides did not substantially change. Actually, in experiments not shown it was found that the pattern observed was already established after 30 min of incubation. The results of Fig. 2 indicate that with each sugar donor most of the incorporated radioactivity was in the immediate acceptor of the corresponding labeled sugar (see Fig. SI): [3H]GalNAc was incorporated into endogenous GM3 and GD3, [3H]NeuAc was incorporated into endogenous LacCer, GM3, GM1, and GD1b, and [3H]Gal was incorporated into endogenous GlcCer, GM2, and GD2. Formation of small amounts of [3H]Gal-labeled GM3 and GT1b was also noticeable, suggesting that an endogenous pool of CMP-NeuAc was present in the membrane vesicles. Fig. 3 is a fluorogram of a bidimensional HPTLC of a mixture of the radioactive gangliosides of experiments as the ones described in Fig. 2, showing that each compound separated in the first dimension in a neutral solvent system behaved as a single entity after a second run in an alkaline solvent system. Except for a small amount of radioactive GM3 and GT1b observed in the labeling from UDP-[3H]Gal, the experiments of Fig. 2 evidenced a failure of the system to sustain further glycosylations of the immediate radioactive products formed. To examine the possibility that this was due to a lack of the necessary endogenous sugar nucleotides, membranes were incubated with one radioactive nucleotide as in Fig. 2, washed, and then incubated in a second step for an additional 2-h period in the presence of the non-radioactive sugar nucleotide necessary for the transfer step that would use the radioactive endogenous glycolipid formed in the first step. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that if membranes that were labeled from UDP-[3H]GalNAc in the first incubation step were incubated with increasing concentrations of non-radioactive UDP-Gal from 0 to 50 μM in the second, about 70% of radioactive GM2 and GD2, the major products formed in the first step, were converted into GM1 and GD1b, respectively. Conversion was maximal at 25 μM of UDP-Gal. This indicates that an important fraction of synthesized GM2 and GD2 molecules were positioned as substrates for the Gal-T2 that acts at the next transfer step to synthesize GM1 and GD1b. Fig. 4, C and D, shows that incubation of the labeled membranes in the second step with 50 μM UDP-Gal and increasing CMP-NeuAc concentrations from 0 to 50 μM led to a substantial decrease of GM1 and GD1b and to a concomitant increase of GD1a and GT1b. The simplest interpretation of results of Fig. 4, according to Fig. SI of biosynthesis, is that conversion of [3H]GalNAc-labeled GM1 into GD1a and of [3H]GalNAc-labeled GD1b into GT1b had occurred and was maximal at 25 μM CMP-NeuAc. This indicates that the transfer steps catalyzed by GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4 colocalize and are functionally coupled in the same compartment; Gal-T2 was able to use the product of GalNAc addition to GM3 and GD3 ([3H]GalNAc-labeled GM2 and GD2, respectively) as substrate for synthesis of GM1 and GD1b; Sial-T4 was, in turn, able to convert [3H]GalNAc-labeled GM1 and GD1b into GD1a and GT1b, respectively, by successive transfer reactions. To assess whether transfer steps catalyzed by Sial-T1 and/or Sial-T2 colocalize with those catalyzed by GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4, CMP-[3H]NeuAc was used in the first incubation step, and increasing concentrations of UDP-GalNAc from 0 to 50 μM in the second. Fig. 5, A and B, shows that about 60% of [3H]NeuAc-labeled GM3 and GD3 formed in the first incubation step were converted into GM2 and GD2, respectively, indicating that a considerable fraction of the [3H]NeuAc-labeled GM3 and GD3 was synthesized in a compartment that also bears GalNAc-T. Fig. 5, C and D, shows that incubation of membranes with CMP-[3H]NeuAc in the first step and 50 μM of UDP-GalNAc plus increasing concentrations of UDP-Gal, from 0 to 50 μM in the second step, led to a decrease of [3H]NeuAc-labeled GM2 and GD2 and to an increase of [3H]NeuAc-labeled GM1 and GD1b. This result is consistent with an increasing galactosylation of the products of GalNAc addition to [3H]NeuAc-labeled GM3 and [3H]NeuAc-labeled GD3 (GM2 and GD2, respectively), as UDP-Gal concentration increases and indicates that transfer steps catalyzed by Sial-T1, Sial-T2, GalNAc-T, and Gal-T2 colocalize and are functionally coupled in the same compartment. To examine if the synthesis of lactosylceramide occurs in the compartment supporting the transfer steps catalyzed by Sial-T1, Sial-T2, GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4, membranes were incubated with UDP-[3H]Gal in the first step to obtain [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide. Incubation of these membranes with increasing concentrations of CMP-NeuAc from 0 to 50 μM in a second step (Fig. 6, A and B) led to a gradual decrease of radioactive lactosylceramide and to an increase of GM3 and GD3. About 80% of [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide was sialylated to GM3 and then to GD3. Formation of GM3 was maximal at 10 μM while that of GD3 reached plateau at 25 μM. This indicates that most radioactive lactosylceramide synthesized in the first step was accessible to Sial-T1 and that about half of the formed GM3 was in turn used as substrate for GD3 synthesis by Sial-T2 at about 25 μM CMP-NeuAc concentration. GM1 and GD1b were not converted into labeled GD1a and GT1b at any CMP-NeuAc concentration (except for an increase in GD1a from 2.5 to 5%), indicating that not all intermediates formed in the first step were substrates for a next transfer step. Fig. 6, C and D, shows that incubation of membranes with UDP-[3H]Gal in the first step and with 50 μM of CMP-NeuAc plus increasing concentrations of UDP-GalNAc, from 0 to 50 μM in the second step, led to a decrease in the percent contribution of GM3 and GD3, noticeable at 10-25 μM UDP-GalNAc, and to an increase of labeled GM2. This contrasts with the result of Fig. 6, A and B, in which most radioactive LacCer was converted to GM3 and half of GM3 to GD3 when CMP-NeuAc was the sole nucleotide. According to Fig. SI of biosynthesis, the simplest interpretation of these results is that a competition between SialT-2 and GalNAc-T for the common GM3 acceptor had ocurred when their corresponding sugar donors were both present in the assay; radioactive GM3 was increasingly used for GM2 synthesis, rather than for GD3 synthesis, as UDP-GalNAc concentration increased. This was particularly evident in this system because at 14 days of development retina GalNAc-T activity exceeds Sial-T2 activity in about 20-fold (Panzetta et al., 1980; Daniotti et al., 1991). In addition, the results of Fig. 6 indicate that addition of [3H]Gal to endogenous GlcCer to form the radioactive lactosylceramide moiety of GM3 and GD3 occurred in a compartment bearing not only Gal-T1 but also Sial-T1, Sial-T2, GalNAc-T, and Gal-T2. According to the results of Fig. 4-6, a precursor product relationship between the immediate acceptor of [3H]Gal labeled in the first step (lactosylceramide) and the end product GD1a should be obtained if the three unlabeled nucleotides were present in the second step. Fig. 7 shows the results of an experiment similar to the one described in Fig. 6, C and D, in which UDP-[3H]Gal was in the first step and in addition to 50 μM of CMP-NeuAc and UDP-GalNAc, 50 μM of UDP-Gal was also present in the second step; the experiment was run for different periods of time from 1 min to 2 h. It is clear that with the three nucleotides in excess in the second step, labeled lactosylceramide was progressively converted to GD1a in a time-dependent fashion, being practically exhausted after 30 min; transient formation of labeled GM3, GM2, and GM1 (this last one superimposed to the GM1 fraction not convertible into more complex gangliosides, see Fig. 6) was also noticeable. Dilution of the incubation system (up to 20-fold) in the second step or extensive washing of the membranes with buffer A containing 1 M KCl before incubation to remove possible attached cytosolic proteins was without effect on the pattern of progression of radioactivity to more glycosylated species (not shown). Fig. 8 shows the pattern of labeling of the endogenous acceptors after incubation of the membranes with UDP-[3H]Glc in the first step and unlabeled UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, and CMP-NeuAc in the second. Although the membranes synthesize an important amount of [3H]Glc-labeled glucosylceramide, only 10% of it was converted to [3H]Glc-labeled lactosylceramide. This amount did not increase after a second incubation step in the presence of the three unlabeled sugar nucleotides, suggesting that this is the fraction of GlcCer accessible to the luminal Gal-T1 (Deutscher and Hirschberg, 1986). Of the [3H]Glc-labeled lactosylceramide, no more than 10% was converted to GD1a, which contrasts with the near 80% conversion of [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide formed by addition of [3H]Gal to glucosylceramide shown in Fig. 7. The simplest explanation for the contrast between the experiments of Figure 7:, Figure 8: is that, at difference with [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide, the [3H]Glc-labeled lactosylceramide formed in the compartment in which Glc-T synthesizes glucosylceramide does not largely colocalize with distal Golgi GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4. The possibility was considered that the different transfer steps were located in distinct compartments but that these compartments became mixed due to promiscuous fusion among them under the conditions of the in vitro assay. This possibility was considered since the experiments were carried out in presence of 15 mM Mn 2+, which has been suggested to be fusogenic at concentrations of about 30 mM (Paiement et al., 1982). To check this possibility we took advantage of the fact that the activities of Sial-T2 and GalNAc-T are relatively high and low, respectively, in 7 day chick embryo retina, and that the converse occurs in 14 day embryos (Panzetta et al., 1980; Daniotti et al., 1994); an indication of this is the pattern of labeling from CMP-[3H]NeuAc of the endogenous gangliosides of microsomal membranes from retinas at early (Fig. 9, lane 1) and late (Fig. 9, lane 3) developmental stages, which differ mostly in the lower labeling of GD3 and presence of labeled GD1a in 14 day retinas. Lane 2 is the pattern of labeling of the 7 day preparation that after the incubation with CMP-[3H]NeuAc in a first step was washed, mixed with membranes from 14 day embryonic retina, and incubated in the standard conditions in presence of the three unlabeled nucleotides. It was expected that, if mixing of vesicles from the two embryonic stages had occurred, the GalNAc-T activity of 14 day membranes would convert labeled GD3 molecules from the 7 day membranes to labeled GD2 and/or GD1b. Results from Fig. 9, lane 2, show that no modification of the pattern of labeling of the 7 day preparation had occurred after 2 h of incubation and hence that the two membrane preparations did not behave as if they were promiscuously mixed. It was also considered possible that vesicles were in an inverted topography, so that acceptors from one inside out vesicle could interact with transferases from another inside out vesicle. This possibility was discarded for two reasons: (i) because even at the end of the two-step assay, which implies additional pelleting and homogenization of the membranes, at least 60% of the endogenous gangliosides labeled from CMP-[3H]NeuAc were protected from the action of neuraminidase, as it was already shown for rat brain Golgi membrane gangliosides (Maccioni et al., 1974; Landa et al., 1981); and (ii) because the protein concentration curve shown in Fig. 1A was linear. If enzyme-substrate interactions between inside out particles were occurring, an exponential curve should have been obtained evidencing the compound effect of increasing the concentration of both the enzyme and the substrate in a non-saturated, freely interacting system (Reiner, 1959). The experiments of Fig. 6 and 7 showed that most of the endogenous GM2 and GD2 molecules completed with [3H]Gal ([3H]Gal-GM1 and [3H]Gal-GD1b) were not sialylated to GD1a and GT1b in a second step. This is in contradiction with the results of Fig. 4, in which about 60% of the GM1 formed by addition of Gal to [3H]GalNAc-labeled GM2 was converted to GD1a and with those of Fig. 7, in which the decay of radioactivity of [3H]Gal-lactosylceramide corresponded fairly well with the increase of [3H]Gal radioactivity in GD1a. We were able to isolate [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide and [3H]Gal-labeled GA2 after mild acid hydrolysis (1 N sulfuric acid, 90°C, 2 h) of the radioactive GD1a band isolated from the HPTLC plate of the experiment of Fig. 7, an indication that part of the 3H-Gal incorporated was in the position proximal to ceramide. On the contrary, no radioactive lactosylceramide or GA2 were detected after mild acid hydrolysis of the radioactive GM1 band isolated from the same HPTLC plate, indicating that in this ganglioside most of the incorporated [3H]Gal was terminal in the oligosaccharide. This indicates that some endogenous intermediates do not couple with the corresponding next transfer step; these molecules may be in Golgi vesicles that either because they belong to non-GD1a expressing neuronal cell types or because they represent a particular Golgi membrane domain, or because they depend on regulatory conditions absent from the in vitro assay, are devoid of Sial-T4 activity. The labeling of the endogenous ganglioside acceptors of neural cell Golgi membranes was studied to gain information on the functional relationship among the different glycosyl transfer steps of the synthesis of gangliosides. This approach, used previously for similar studies in brain microsomal membranes (Arce et al., 1971), is based on the ability of Golgi membranes of incorporate sugars into intermediates in the pathway of completion upon incubation of the organelle with the appropriate sugar nucleotide donors. It provides a picture of a dynamic process of synthesis carried out by membrane-bound enzymes, glycolipid acceptors, and sugar transporters, which was interrupted at the moment of membrane isolation, and was resumed in vitro under controlled conditions. Because they synthesize mainly GD1a (Panzetta et al., 1980), retina cells from 14-day-old chick embryo are useful for examination of the functional relationships among the various glycosyl transfer steps involved in ganglio series ganglioside synthesis. Incubation of Golgi membrane-enriched fractions from these cells with UDP-[3H]Gal or UDP-[3H]GalNAc or CMP-[3H]NeuAc up to completion of their endogenous acceptor capacity resulted in the radioactive labeling of most ganglioside intermediates. The incorporated sugar remained mainly in the immediate product of the transfer step marked by the radioactive sugar nucleotide used. These labeled intermediates were substrates for further glycosylations when the membranes were incubated in a second step with the required unlabeled sugar nucleotides, and two, three, or four transfer reactions were evidenced, depending on whether one, two, or the three required unlabeled sugar nucleotides were present. A summarizing experiment illustrating this functional coupling is the one depicted in Fig. 7, in which [3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide formed from UDP-[3H]Gal in the first incubation step was almost completely converted to labeled GD1a upon incubation in a second step with unlabeled UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, and CMP-NeuAc. Since factors known to be necessary for vesicular traffic among compartments (Rothman, 1994) were not present in the conditions of the assay, the results indicate that ganglioside Gal-T1, Sial-T1, Sial-T2, GalNAcT, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4 colocalize in a common compartment of the Golgi apparatus of chick embryo retina cells, and that the products of the corresponding transfer steps are able to couple with the next transfer step of the pathway. The above mentioned compartment could be in the distal or proximal Golgi, with either proximal Golgi enzymes (Gal-T1, Sial-T1, and Sial-T2) and acceptors (glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide) extending their presence to the distal compartment, or vice versa, with elements of distal transfer steps (GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, and Sial-T4) present in the proximal compartment. The first possibility is supported by the results of Figure 7:, Figure 8:, showing that acceptor GlcCer molecules completed with [3H]Gal ([3H]Gal-labeled lactosylceramide) were more efficiently transformed into GD1a than [3H]Glc-labeled lactosylceramide. In addition, the first possibility is supported by the results of experiments with BFA. BFA, which blocks anterograde vesicular transport and redistributes the cis/medial and trans-Golgi (but not TGN) back into the ER (Klausner et al., 1992) inhibits in vivo ganglioside biosynthesis with accumulation of LacCer, GM3, GD3 (van Echten et al., 1990; Young et al., 1990), and GT3 (Rosales Fritz and Maccioni, 1995) and depletion of more complex gangliosides. Although not proved, the effect of BFA strongly suggest that synthesis of LacCer, GM3, GD3, and GT3 occur in cis/medial/trans-Golgi compartments, and that these intermediates are transported in vesicles to a compartment beyond the trans-Golgi, most probably the TGN, for further glycosylation. Evidence for vesicular transport of glycolipids have been provided (Miller-Podraza and Fishman, 1984; Wattenberg, 1990; Young et al., 1992). Thus, the lack of supply of acceptor glycolipid (i.e. GlcCer) to the distally located Gal-T1, Sial-T1, and Sial-T2 and the absence of GalNAc-T in the proximal compartment would be concurrent factors leading to the observed effect of BFA on ganglioside synthesis in cells. Apart from the possibilities of different strategies of subcompartmentation used for different cell types (Roth et al., 1986; Sjoberg and Varki, 1993), our results are in line with the reported immunoelectron microscopy data showing that antibody labeling of the trans-Golgi glycoprotein Gal-T and of the medial Golgi GlcNAc-T1 is highly overlapped in HeLa cells (Nilsson et al., 1993). Also, they agree with the reported overlapped distributions of ganglioside glycosyltransferases in subfractions of rat liver Golgi (Trinchera and Ghidoni, 1989; Trinchera et al., 1990) and with the cis/trans decreasing gradient distribution of ganglioside Sial-T1 and cis/trans increasing gradient distribution of Sial-T4 activities in Golgi preparations obtained by density gradient centrifugation from cultured cerebellar neurons (Iber et al., 1992). Using the endogenous labeling approach, compartmental overlapping was also deduced for some N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic activities in Golgi preparations from rat liver (Hayes and Varki, 1993; Hayes et al., 1993) and for GD3 synthesis and O-acetylation in Golgi membranes from melanoma cells (Sjoberg and Varki, 1993). A key question about when coupling relationships are being measured is whether they are a representative or just a minor phenomenon. Considering the concentration of gangliosides in chicken retina of about 3.5 nmol/mg protein (Panzetta et al., 1980) and the half-life of about 48 h measured in mouse neuroblastoma N18 and rat glioma C6 (Miller-Podraza and Fishman, 1982) and in chicken retina cells, 2V. Rosales Fritz and H. J. F. Maccioni, unpublished results. it follows that a synthesis rate of 36 pmol/mg of protein/h would be necessary to keep the ganglioside pool constant. The rate of completion of endogenous acceptors in the period from 0 to 30 min in Fig. 1B gives minimum values of 58 pmol/mg of protein/h for the sum of [3H]Gal, [3H]GalNAc, and [3H]NeuAc in a 5-fold enriched Golgi preparation. This figure is about 30% of the rate needed for a cell to maintain its ganglioside pool and suggests that we are not dealing with a minor phenomenon. We thank Drs. V. Rosales Fritz, J. A. Martina, and G. A. Nores for useful discussions and B. L. Caputto for critical reading of the manuscript."

Recently, we described a lipid intermediate for the biosynthesis of the cell wall arabinogalactan/arabinomannan of Mycobacterium smegmatis: β-D-arabinofuranosyl-1monophosphodecaprenol (Wolucka, B. A., McNeil, M. R., de Hoffmann, E., Chojnacki, T., and Brennan, P. J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23328-23335). In the present work, by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry, and proton NMR, the major pentose-containing component of the polyprenyl-P-sugar family from M. smegmatis was characterized as β-D-ribosyl-1-monophosphodecaprenol (decaprenyl-P-ribose). Additionally, the structure of a minor arabinose-containing compound, β-D-arabinosyl-1-monophosphooctahydroheptaprenol, could be deduced. In vivo labeling experiments with [14C]glucose demonstrated unequivocally that decaprenyl-P-ribose is actively synthesized in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and Mycobacterium avium serovar 4. It is proposed that decaprenyl-P-ribose could be a precursor for the biosynthesis of either some unknown ribose-containing cell envelope polymers of mycobacteria or the arabinan part of the cell wall arabinogalactan/arabinomannan due to the presence of a 2′-epimerase activity at some late stages of the arabinogalactan/arabinomannan biosynthesis.

INTRODUCTIONThe cell walls of all mycobacteria, including two important human pathogens: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, contain large amounts of an unusual sugar: D-arabinofuranose (D-Araf). 1The abbreviations used are: ArafarabinofuranoseC50-Pdecaprenyl phosphateC50-P-Aradecaprenyl-P-arabinoseC50-P-Ribdecaprenyl-P-riboseC35-Poctahydroheptaprenyl phosphateC35-P-Araoctahydroheptaprenyl-P-arabinoseGC/MSgas chromatography/mass spectrometryFAB-MS/MSfast atom bombardment-tandem mass spectrometry. D-Araf is the major component of two mycobacterial polysaccharides: arabinogalactan and arabinomannan (for review, see (1McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). Arabinogalactan, a key element responsible for the integrity of the lipid-rich cell envelope of mycobacteria(2Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of Mycobacteria. Vol. I. Academic Press, London1982: 95-184Google Scholar), is covalently linked to the innermost peptidoglycan layer and serves as a point of attachment for long chain mycolic acids, which, in turn, interact hydrophobically with numerous free lipids and glycolipids of the mycobacterial envelope (for review, see (3Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial Lipids. Vol. I. Academic Press, London1988: 203-298Google Scholar)). The arabinan segments of the membrane-anchored lipoarabinomannan (4Chatterjee D. Bozic C. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9652-9660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and exocellular arabinomannan (5Lemassu A. Daffé M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) are structurally similar to that of the arabinogalactan(6Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arabinofuranose was also found in a glycolipid isolated from Mycobacterium avium(7Watanabe M. Kudoh S. Yamada Y. Iguchi K. Minnikin D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and structurally related to the nonreducing-end motif of the arabinogalactan-mycolate complex(8McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The biosynthesis of D-Araf residues is largely unknown. Mycobacteria have long been known to contain two unusual polyprenyl phosphates: a C50-decaprenyl-P (9Takayama K. Goldman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6251-6257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a partially saturated C35-octahydroheptaprenyl-P(10Takayama K. Schnoes H. Semmler E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 316: 212-221Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of endogenous glycosyl-P-polyprenols of Mycobacterium smegmatis, comprising decaprenyl and octahydroheptaprenyl phosphate derivatives of arabinose, ribose, and mannose, was described and the complete structure of one component of this family, β-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphodecaprenol, elucidated(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same work, we determined another peculiar feature of the mycobacterial polyprenol, namely the presence of only one internal trans-isoprene residue within the decaprenol molecule. In vivo labeling pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the lipid-linked ribose, arabinose, and mannose of M. smegmatis are active biosynthetic precursors. Additionally, it was shown that ethambutol, a key antituberculosis drug known to inhibit arabinogalactan/arabinomannan biosynthesis(12Takayama K. Kilburn J.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), results in the accumulation of decaprenyl-P-arabinose with a concomitant decrease of the lipid-linked ribose content(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present report, we describe the isolation and structural characterization of the ribose-containing lipid of M. smegmatis (decaprenyl-P-ribose) and demonstrate that this compound is actively synthesized in M. tuberculosis H37Ra and M. avium. The presence of polyprenyl-P-ribose in mycobacteria is puzzling, since ribose-containing cell envelope components, such as polymers or glycolipids, have not been found in these organisms until now. The possible functions of decaprenyl-P-ribose in mycobacteria are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacteriaM. smegmatis, strain 1515 from the Trudeau Mycobacterial Collection, was grown at 37°C on Nutrient Broth (Gibco Ltd., Paisley, Scotland) with shaking for 20 h. M. tuberculosis H37Ra strain 7417 from the National Collection of Type Cultures (United Kingdom) and M. avium serovar 4 were grown with shaking for 1 week on GAS medium (pH 6.6) containing (per liter): 0.3 g of Bacto-Casitone (Difco), 0.05 g of ammonium iron (III) citrate, 4 g of potassium phosphate (monobasic), 2 g of citric acid, 1 g of L-alanine, 1.2 g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.6 g of potassium sulfate, 2 g of ammonium chloride, and 1% glycerol (v/v), supplemented with 1 mM glucose.Isolation of Ribosyl MonophosphodecaprenolThe polyprenyl-P-sugar pool from untreated M. smegmatis cells was prepared as described previously(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and resolved by preparative silica TLC in chloroform-methanol-concentrated aqueous ammonia-water (65:25:2:2). Spots were located with iodine vapors and the second of the fastest migrating, α-naphthol-positive bands (band B, RF 0.43) was scraped off, eluted with choroform-methanol (2:1), and reapplied to DEAE-cellulose, which was developed with 0.05 M ammonium formate in methanol. Salts were removed by partitioning the material in chloroform-methanol-water (8:4:3). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness yielding the purified ribosyl monophosphodecaprenol.Preparation of 14C-Labeled Polyprenyl-P-sugars from M. tuberculosis and M. aviumM. tuberculosis and M. avium cells grown on GAS medium supplemented with glucose were centrifuged, washed, suspended in 100 ml of GAS medium devoid of glucose, and subsequently incubated at 37°C with 50 μCi of D-[14C]glucose (specific activity: 292 mCi/mmol) (Amersham International plc, United Kingdom) for 2 h and 45 min, respectively. Radiolabeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracted with hot 95% ethanol at 70°C for 15 min. After further centrifugation, supernatants (ethanolic extracts) were withdrawn, evaporated to dryness, and partitioned into a mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (8:4:3). The organic layers were washed once with the theoretical upper phase, evaporated to dryness, and submitted directly to mild alkaline hydrolysis to destroy mild alkali-labile lipids. Alkali-stable lipids were applied to a small column of DEAE-cellulose. The column was washed with five volumes of a chloroform-methanol (2:1) solvent, and polyprenyl-P-sugars were eluted with three volumes of 50 mM ammonium formate in methanol. The eluate was desalted and hydrolyzed in 10 mM HCl at 100°C for 5 min. 14C-Labeled sugars were recovered in the water phase and analyzed by TLC, followed by autoradiography.Analytical ProceduresGC/MS of alditol acetates (13Waeghe T.J. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: 281-304Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar) was conducted on a RSL 200 bonded FSOT capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm) (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). The injector temperature was 250°C. The initial temperature was 150°C, and the temperature program involved a 1.5°C/min rise to 175°C, followed by a 12°C/min rise to 192°C, a 0.2°C/min rise to 193°C, and a final 7°C/min rise to 300°C. Alternatively, sugars were analyzed as trimethylsilyl ethers of the corresponding methyl glycosides, as described(14York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The absolute configuration of monosaccharides was determined by the method of Gerwig et al.(15Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar).Radioactive sugars were separated by TLC on cellulose-coated glass plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in tert-butanol-methylethyl ketone-formic acid-water (8:6:3:3). Plates were autoradiographed.Phosphate determination was performed as described earlier(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).1H NMR and FAB-MS/MS analyses were conducted as described previously(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur previous studies demonstrated the presence of the mild acid-labile ribose in the lipid extracts of M. smegmatis(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 75% of the lipid-ribose was recovered in the fraction of mild alkali-stable, weakly anionic lipids, which represented, as determined by means of 1H NMR and FAB-MS/MS, a family of glycosyl monophosphopolyprenols comprising C50-decaprenyl-P and C35-octahydroheptaprenyl-P derivatives. The mycobacterial glycosyl-P-polyprenols could be resolved by preparative TLC into four major bands, A-D. The fastest migrating band A (RF = 0.46) consisted of β-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphodecaprenol (11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sugar analysis of the slower migrating band B (RF = 0.43) revealed the presence of mild acid-labile ribose (340 nmol/100 g of cells) and trace amounts of arabinose (27 nmol/100 g of cells) representing 7% of the total sugar of band B. The mild acid-freed ribose of band B was assigned to the D series by GC/MS analysis of its(-)-2-butylglycoside derivative(15Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar). It was determined also that the band B-derived pentoses and the organic phosphate were present in equimolar amounts.Further structural information on band B components was obtained by FAB-MS/MS experiments. The negative-ion FAB-MS spectrum of the purified band B (Fig. 1A) showed the presence of an intense signal at m/z 909 (relative intensity, 100%), corresponding to the deprotonated molecule of decaprenyl-P-ribose (Mr = 910), and of a less abundant [M - 132 - H]− fragment ion at m/z 777, corresponding to C50-P. Signals at m/z 925 and 941 are attributable to oxidation products of the decaprenyl-P-ribose. Moreover, a series of fragments differing by 68 mass units was observed (at m/z 567, 499, 431, 363, and 295) derived from the loss of 5-9 isoprene units from the ω-end of the isoprenoid chain of decaprenyl-P-ribose. A very weak signal at m/z 713 (relative intensity, 8%) indicated for the presence of trace amounts of a C35-P-pentose (Mr = 714).The product ion spectrum of the m/z 909 ion (decaprenyl-P-ribose) (Fig. 1B) was clearly different from that of β-D-arabinosyl-P-decaprenol(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deprotonated molecule of the latter compound was shown to produce, in tandem mass spectrometry, two abundant fragments at m/z 819 and 777, derived from the loss of a part or the entire D-arabinosyl residue and corresponding to [decaprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH]− ion and [decaprenyl-PO4]− ion, respectively(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the tandem mass spectrum of the deprotonated molecule of decaprenyl-P-ribose (Fig. 1B) showed the presence of only one abundant fragment of decaprenyl-P at m/z 777 (relative intensity, 100%), whereas the [decaprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH]− ion (at m/z 819) was barely observable (relative intensity, 6%). Recently, we demonstrated that the FAB-MS/MS technique can be applied for the determination of the anomeric configuration of glycosyl esters of nucleoside pyrophosphates (16Wolucka B.A. de Hoffmann E. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) 2B. A. Wolucka, J. S. Rush, C. J. Waechter, and E. de Hoffmann, submitted for publication. and polyisoprenyl phosphates.2 In the latter work, it was shown that the fragmentation pattern of polyisoprenyl-P-sugars depends on cis/trans configuration of the phosphodiester and 2′-hydroxyl groups of the glycosyl residue. Compounds with cis configuration, as in β-D-mannopyranosyl-P-undecaprenol and β-D-Araf-P-decaprenol, give two abundant fragments corresponding to [polyisoprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH)]− (B) and [polyisoprenyl-HPO4]− (A), with the relative intensity ratio (B/A) of about 1. In contrast, compounds with trans configuration of the above-mentioned groups, as in α-D-mannopyranosyl-P-undecaprenol, give an abundant [polyisoprenyl-HPO4]− fragment and practically no [polyisoprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH)]− ion in tandem mass spectrometry; consequently, the relative intensity ratio of these two ions (B/A) is very low (close to 0.01) for compounds with trans configuration. Since the mycobacterial decaprenyl-P-ribose produces, in tandem mass spectrometry, only one abundant ion corresponding to [decaprenyl-HPO4]−, and the relative intensity ratio of [decaprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH)]− ion to [decaprenyl-HPO4]− ion is very low (0.06), it can be deduced that this compound has trans configuration of the phosphodiester and 2′-hydroxyl groups of its D-ribosyl residue. Therefore, the D-ribosyl residue of the mycobacterial decaprenyl-P-ribose must be β-linked to decaprenyl-P.The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the decaprenyl-P-ribose preparation from M. smegmatis (Fig. 2) shows all signals characteristic for a glycosylated decaprenyl-P derivative (11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proton resonances of the phospholipid part (decaprenyl phosphate) are, as expected, almost identical with those observed for the purified decaprenyl-P-arabinose(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, signals at δ 0.83 ppm and 1.2 ppm are not derived from the C50-P compound and can be assigned to the protons of methyl and methylene groups of the octahydroheptaprenyl-P contaminant. To estimate the molar ratio of the decaprenyl-P-ribose versus the C35-P compound in band B, we compared the integration values measured for the proton signals of the trans-methyl groups of the ω- and the isoprene unit(s) adjacent to it (at δ 1.55 ppm) with that of the methyl protons of the α-isoprene residue (at δ 1.69 ppm). The mycobacterial C35-octahydroheptaprenol has four saturated isoprene units at the ω-end (10Takayama K. Schnoes H. Semmler E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 316: 212-221Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and, thus, is expected to contain no isoprenyl trans-methyl groups. Indeed, the mycobacterial C35-P-mannose recently purified in our laboratory does not give any signal at δ 1.55 ppm. 3B. A. Wolucka, unpublished results. Therefore, the signal at δ 1.55 ppm of the band B spectrum (Fig. 2) (integral 6.0) corresponds to 6 protons of the two isoprenyl trans-methyl groups of the mycobacterial decaprenyl-P derivative (11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the signal at δ 1.69 ppm (integral, 3.5) contribute three methyl protons of the α-residue of both, C50- and C35-P derivatives. Therefore, the molar ratio of the octahydroheptaprenyl-P compound versus decaprenyl-P-ribose in band B was approximately 1 to 6. The position of the individual protons of the ribosyl residue of decaprenyl-P-ribose (Fig. 2) was determined through sequential selective decoupling experiments. The anomeric proton signal of the decaprenyl-P-ribose (a doublet at δ 5.41 ppm, JH1-P = 4.11 Hz, JH1-H2 < 1.5 Hz) is upperfield-shifted in comparison with that measured for the commercially available α-D-ribofuranosyl 1-phosphate standard (from Sigma) (a doublet of doublets at δ 5.77 ppm, JH1-P = 6.29 Hz, JH1-H2 = 3.31 Hz). It is known from the literature that the upperfield shift of the anomeric proton signal of D-ribofuranosyl derivatives is characteristic for β-linked residues(18Chu C.K. El-Kabbani F.M. Thompson B.B. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1984; 3: 1-31Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded that the D-ribosyl residue of the mycobacterial decaprenyl-P-ribose is β-linked to decaprenyl phosphate. This is in agreement with the above-described results obtained in FAB-MS/MS experiments. Since, in nature, ribose is always found in the furanose ring-form, we propose the following structure for the mycobacterial β-D-ribosyl-1-monophosphodecaprenol (Fig. 3).Figure 2:The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the decaprenyl-P-ribose. The sample was obtained from 44 g of M. smegmatis cells. The purified decaprenyl-P-ribose (∼150 nmol based on sugar estimation) was dissolved in a mixture of deacidified CDCl3 (330 μl) and CD3OD (120 μl).

This value matches quite well with the amount of arabinose detected in band B (7% of total sugar). The FAB-MS analysis further confirmed the presence of only small amounts of a C35-P-pentose (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the product ion spectrum of the deprotonated C35-P-pentose molecule (Mr = 714) showed the presence of two abundant fragments at m/z 581 and 623(19Wolucka B.A. de Hoffmann Acta Biochim. Pol. 1994; 41: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), corresponding to an [octahydroheptaprenyl-HPO4]− ion (relative intensity, A = 96%) and an [octahydroheptaprenyl-PO4-(CH-CHOH)]− fragment derived from the cleavage across the pentose ring (relative intensity, B = 85%), respectively. The relative intensity ratio B/A was 0.88, thus indicating that the compound has cis configuration of the phosphate and 2′-hydroxyl groups of the pentosyl moiety,2 as in the case of β-D-arabinofuranosyl-P-decaprenol. Taken together, the presented data suggest that the minor component of band B is β-D-arabinosyl-1-monophospho-octahydroheptaprenol. Quantification of the arabinose found in band A (as C50-P-Ara; 105 nmol/100 g of cells) and in band B (as C35-P-Ara; 27 nmol/100 g of cells) demonstrated that the C35-P-arabinose represented about 20% of the total polyprenyl-P-arabinose (C50- and C35-P-arabinose) isolated from M. smegmatis. Accordingly, the decaprenyl-P-ribose (340 nmol/100 g of cells) was recovered from M. smegmatis cells in amounts almost 3-fold higher than for the polyprenyl-P-arabinose, thus indicating that the former compound is the major pentose-containing lipid intermediate in this organism(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To examine if the lipid-ribose is characteristic only for M. smegmatis or if it is a common lipid intermediate of mycobacteria, in vivo labeling experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis and M. avium cells. In the previous studies(11Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the family of polyprenyl-P-sugars of M. smegmatis can be rapidly labeled by in vivo incubation of cells with D-[U-14C]glucose. Preliminary experiments with M. tuberculosis H37Ra and M. avium serovar 4 indicated that the efficiency of incorporation of [14C]glucose label into the lipid-linked sugars in these organisms is lower than in M. smegmatis, whereby longer incubation time and higher label are needed to obtain similar yields of labeling. This fact is probably related to the existence of an efficient permeability barrier in M. tuberculosis and M. avium(20Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) or to differences in the biochemical systems responsible for glucose uptake and assimilation in mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis and M. avium cells were labeled in vivo with [14C]glucose for 2 h and 45 min, respectively, and the fraction of 14C-polyprenyl-P-sugars was isolated, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified 14C-polyprenyl-P-sugar fractions were submitted to mild acid hydrolysis and the 14C-sugars released to the water phase were separated by TLC and visualized by autoradiography. Comparison of the TLC patterns revealed that the sugar composition of the glycosyl-P-polyprenol families isolated from M. tuberculosis and M. avium (Fig. 4) is very similar to that of M. smegmatis: ribose, mannose, arabinose, and some still unidentified oligosaccharides are the major 14C-labeled glycosyl residues. Additionally, in the case of M. avium, an unknown 14C-sugar component, which migrated just behind ribose and co-migrated with cold xylose/lyxose standard, could be observed (Fig. 4, lane1). These results demonstrate clearly that decaprenyl-P-ribose was actively synthesized in the all mycobacteria tested, including M. tuberculosis H37Ra, M. avium serovar 4, and different strains of M. smegmatis, and, moreover, that it represents one of the predominant lipid-linked intermediates in these organisms.Figure 4:TLC of 14C-sugars released by mild acid from the purified polyprenyl-P-sugar fraction of M. avium (lane 1) and M. tuberculosis (lane 2) after in vivo labeling with [U-14C]glucose. Cells of M. avium serovar 4 and M. tuberculosis H37Ra were incubated with [14C]glucose for 45 min and 2 h, respectively, and extracted with 95% ethanol at 70°C for 15 min. The dried ethanolic extracts were partitioned into a mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (8:4:3), and the organic layers were washed with theoretical upper phase. The lipid extracts were submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis, and the alkali-stable lipids were chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column. The polyprenyl-P-sugar fraction of M. avium and M. tuberculosis were hydrolyzed in 10 mM HCl at 100°C for 5 min; free sugars were recovered in the water phase after partitioning and, subsequently, resolved by TLC. The radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)D-Ribose is a common component of cell envelope polysaccharides, such as lipopolysaccharides and capsular polysaccharides, in many Gram-negative bacteria, and it always occurs as the β-furanosyl residue(21Lindberg B.

Phytochrome is one of the most important and best characterized photoreceptors in plants. The ability to purify the photoreceptor from etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings and the molecular cloning of phytochrome genes give insight into structural and functional properties of phytochrome. The phytochrome dimer is located in the cytosol of the plant cell (1Brockmann J. Rieble S. Kazarinova-Fukshansky N. Seyfried M. Schäfer E. Plant Cell Env. 1987; 10: 105-111Google Scholar, 2Jones A.M.

The apparent molecular mass of the monomer is approximately 120 kDa. Phytochromobilin, a linear tetrapyrrole that is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of apophytochrome is responsible for light perception. The assembly reaction with the chromophore is an autocatalytic process of the photoreceptor. Phytochrome can absorb light over a wide range (approximately 300-800 nm) of the spectrum (4Grimm R.

The bathochrome shift in the red light absorption maximum from Pr to Pfr is due to the photochemical Z/E isomerization of a chromophore double bond(5Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the photoreceptor can change to the physiologically active Pfr form(6Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994Crossref Google Scholar). These changes are photoreversible, and since the absorption spectra of both phytochrome forms overlap, irradiation leads to a wavelength-dependent photoequilibrium between the inactive Pr and the active Pfr form. red light absorbing form of phytochrome far-red light absorbing form of phytochrome rice phytochrome A-phycocyanobilin adduct tobacco phytochrome B-phycocyanobilin adduct sequestered areas of phytochrome. Since the genes that encode for the phytochrome family have been characterized and phytochrome mutants become available, it has been possible to assign the members of the family to photoreceptors that differ in their abundance and light regulation(7Sommers D.E. Sharrock R.A. Teppermann J.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The predominant photoreceptor in etiolated plants is the light-labile phytochrome A (PHYA). After transition into Pfr, the protein is rapidly degraded (half-life time approximately 2 h), and the expression of the PHYA encoding gene (phyA) is down-regulated by light. Prior to degradation, PHYA is concentrated in distinct regions in the cytosol. The sequestering reaction leading to sequestered areas of phytochrome (SAP) takes place in a few seconds at room temperature, needs ATP, and is dependent on Pfr formation. SAP formation has been discussed as a prerequisite for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation of PHYA(8Vierstra R.D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 103: 679-684Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to PHYA, which accumulates to high levels in etiolated plants, the light-stable phytochromes B and C are photoreceptors with low abundance. With a half-life time of approximately 12 h, PHYB Pfr is relatively stable. Independent of the light treatment, phyB and phyC expression is nearly constitutive(7Sommers D.E. Sharrock R.A. Teppermann J.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The rapid destruction, together with the down-regulation of phyA expression, are probably important processes in switching off a given PHYA Pfr signal. Dark reversion of Pfr to physiological inactive Pr may be an additional possibility to prevent constitutive Pfr signals. With the exception of the Caryophyllales, dicotyledonous PHYA exhibits dark reversion, whereas Pfr from monocotyledonous plants seems to be stable. In etiolated mustard seedlings, the percentage of reverting phytochrome is dependent on the reached photoequilibrium between Pr and Pfr and is virtually complete within 10 min(9Schäfer E. Schmidt W. Planta. 1974; 116: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Marmé D. Marchal B. Schäfer E. Planta. 1971; 100: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Keeping in mind that phytochrome is a dimer, Brockmann et al.(1Brockmann J. Rieble S. Kazarinova-Fukshansky N. Seyfried M. Schäfer E. Plant Cell Env. 1987; 10: 105-111Google Scholar) calculated that the amount of dark-reverting phytochrome matches closely with the percentage of conformation heterodimers between Pr and Pfr. Some examples give indirect evidence that PHYB Pfr dark reversion actually occurs in plants. Investigations with cauliflower florets (11Butler W.L. Lane H.C. Siegelman H.C. Plant Physiol. 1963; 38: 514-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and artichoke receptacles (12Hillman W.S. Am. J. Bot. 1964; 51: 1102-1107Crossref Google Scholar) revealed almost complete reversion from Pfr to Pr with a half-life time of approximately 60 min. Additionally, experiments dealing with the flowering induction of Pharbitis nil and Chrysanthemum indicate the existence of a dark-reverting phytochrome(13Borthwick H.A. Am. Naturalist. 1964; 902: 347-355Crossref Google Scholar). Since these plants were grown in white light, it is likely that the phytochrome therein is PHYB-like. Besides the differences in photoreceptor stability and light-dependent expression, PHYA and -B have different physiological roles. Investigations with phytochrome mutants of Arabidopsis revealed that PHYA perceives far-red light(14Dehesh K. Franci C. Parks B.M. Seeley K.A. Short T.W. Teppermann J.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1081-1088PubMed Google Scholar), seems to cause the very low fluence response, and mediates the high irradiance response(15Smith H. Light and Plant Development. Butterworth, London1976Google Scholar). Contrary to PHYA, PHYB shows low fluence and red light responses(16Reed J.W. Nagpal P. Poole D.S. Furuya M. Chorry J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Studies with phytochrome overexpressing plants and phytochrome mutants revealed that PHYA and PHYB have distinct but also overlapping physiological functions(16Reed J.W. Nagpal P. Poole D.S. Furuya M. Chorry J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 17Whitlelam G.C. Habered N.P.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In synopsis, PHYA may be responsible for the rapid deetiolation even after weak light pulses, whereas PHYB regulates light responses in green and adult plants. The low level of PHYB in plants has so far prevented the analysis of PHYB signal transduction, dark reactions, and photoreceptor destruction. The use of overexpressing systems is one possibility for a direct investigation of this important photoreceptor. Phytochrome overexpressing yeast systems (19Deforce L. Tomizawa K.-I. Ito N.

Chua, and E. Schäfer, manuscript in preparation. Yeast cells contain no endogenous chromophores that assemble with phytochrome. This enables us to work with the apoprotein or to use the substitute chromophore, phycocyanobilin(23Cole W.J. Chapman D.J. Siegelman H.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 3643-3645Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), for holophytochrome reconstitution. In vitro investigations with the tobacco PHYB-phycocyanobilin-adduct (PHYB∗) revealed no differences compared to phytochrome A regarding the spectral properties, dimerization, and chromophore attachment. On the other hand, since phytochrome types differ in their physiological role, it is likely that the proteins also differ in their molecular reactions. Therefore, two protocols for the in vivo reconstitution of phytochrome in yeast were established. Using the in vivo reconstitution system, we investigated the following molecular properties of PHYB∗ and the rice phytochrome A-phycocyanobilin adduct (PHYA∗). 1) The in vivo system enabled the first the direct measurement of PHYB∗ dark reversion. 2) The in vivo system was used to study the sequestering reaction of phytochrome. 3) The functionality of in vivo reconstituted phytochrome in yeast was tested by coexpression with reporter plasmids. For isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced expression of a 66-kDa recombinant phytochrome apoprotein fragment with a six-histidine tag at the N terminus, the BamHI-PstI fragment of the full-length tobacco phyB cDNA (24Kern R. Gasch A. Deak M. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1363-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was inserted in frame into the expression vector pQE9 (Diagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain pREP4. Expression of the fusion protein, denaturing preparation of crude extracts, and purification of the tagged protein on nickel-agarose columns (Diagen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing the 66-kDa fusion protein were pooled, and the fusion protein was purified to homogeneity via quantitative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent electroelution(25Jacobs E. Clad A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 583-589Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of the eluted fraction was monitored by silver staining of SDS-gels (not shown). Immunization of a white New Zealand rabbit and preparation of the antiserum were performed as published by Harlow and Lane(36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). The antiserum was tested for specificity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western analysis. The generation of the galactose inducible rice PHYA (pARiA) and tobacco PHYB (pATB) expression vectors, based on the plasmid pAA7 (26Abe A. Wada T. Handa H. Nogi Y. Fukasawa T. Agric. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain KN380 (28Morishima N. Nakagawa K.-I. Yamamoto E. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15189-15197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in order to investigate the in vivo assembly, dark reversion, and the in vivo and in vitro sequestering of phytochrome in yeast. The resulting phytochrome A- and B-overexpressing strains are referred to as KpARiA and KpATP. To analyze the expression of chalcone synthase promoter constructs in phytochrome-overexpressing yeast, the BamHI-SalI fragments (encoding complete phytochrome protein sequences) of the rice PHYA (29Kay S.A. Keith B. Shinozaki K. Chua N.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2865-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the tobacco PHYB were cloned into the constitutive expression vector pG1(30Schena M. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), resulting in the expression vector pGRiA and pGATB. To generate a noninducible, uracil, selectable yeast episomal plasmid, the Gal1 promoter of the expression plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen) was deleted by SpH1 digestion, and the vector was religated. The resulting vector (pYE) was used to generate the chalcone synthase unit 1 reporter plasmid. A fusion of the U1 (unit 1 promoter region of the chalcone synthase gene from parsley(31Schulze-Lefert P. Dangl J.L. Becker-André M. Hahlbrock K. Schulz W.

A. 1986; 83: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 33Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8390) Google Scholar) was cloned as HindIII-SacI fragment into pYE, resulting in the reporter plasmid pYEU1. In combination with pGRiA or pGTB, pYEU1 was transformed into the yeast strain INVSC1 (Invitrogen). The respective “reporter strains” are I1pGRiAU1 and I1pGTBU1. The materials and experimental procedures employed in the expression of phytochrome in yeast are described by Kunkel et al.(22Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.-H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Hofmann et al.(34Hofmann E. Grimm R. Harter K. Speth V. Schäfer E. Planta. 1991; 183: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the following changes were performed. To culture transgenic yeast cells, synthetic yeast media (35Scherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) lacking uracil (CMU) or uracil and tryptophan (CMUT), at a pH of 5.0, containing either 2% (w/w) glucose or galactose were used. For electron microscopic investigations yeast, spheroplasts were prepared as described by Harlow and Lane(36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). The cells were embedded in Lowicryl K4M and cut into ultrathin sections(37Keizer I. Roggenkamp R. Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 93: 7-12Crossref Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed by using Immunogold-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp.) and phytochrome-specific antibodies as described in Speth et al.(3Speth V. Otto V. Schäfer E. Planta. 1987; 171: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Hofmann et al. (34Hofmann E. Grimm R. Harter K. Speth V. Schäfer E. Planta. 1991; 183: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was carried out with a Phillips CM10 microscope. After assembly with phycocyanobilin (see below), the in vivo phytochrome content was determined with a dual wavelength spectoratiometer (Ratiospect)(38Gross J. Seyfried M. Fukshansky L. Schäfer E. Smith H. Holmes Techniques in Photomorphogenesis. Academic Press, New York1984: 131-157Google Scholar). Quantification of photoreversible phytochrome was performed using standards of purified, native oat PHYA. Phytochrome A or B overexpressing yeast strains (KpARiA, KpATB) were cultured at 30°C in 250-ml Fernbach flasks, with 100 ml of galactose-containing CMU, at constant agitation (150 rpm). To prevent phytochrome phototransformation during the assembly procedure, all steps were carried out under green safety light. Yeast overnight cultures were divided into 20-ml aliquots, and phycocyanobilin and Tween 40 (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 20 μM and 0.9% (v/v), respectively. The cultures were incubated in darkness for 4 to 6 h under constant agitation (150 rpm) at 30°C. After centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, at 25°C) the cells were washed twice with 50 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, 4). The cells were resuspended either in 2 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (in vivo phytochrome determination, dark reversion, and sequestering experiments) or glucose-containing CMU (destruction analysis). For phytochrome expression in combination with U1 reporter plasmids (I1pGRiAU1 and I1pGTBU1), cells were grown on glucose-containing CMUT until the culture reached an optical density (600 nm) of approximately 3.0. After centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, at 25°C), the cells were washed twice with 50 ml of potassium phosphate buffer and resuspended in 2 ml of 30% (v/v) Me2SO. The chromophore was added to a final concentration of 300-400 μM, and the suspension was incubated (without agitation) for 15 min in darkness. To remove the Me2SO, 48 ml of culture medium was added and the yeast cells were precipitated by centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, 25°C), and resuspended in 10 ml of glucose-containing CMUT. Starting from the 10-ml culture (see above), 100 ml of glucose-containing CMUT was inoculated to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5. Culturing was performed at 25°C with constant agitation at 150 rpm, either in red light or in darkness. Two-ml aliquots were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 25°C) at different optical densities between the starting point and an A600 of 2. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. To disrupt the yeast cells, 400 μl of assay buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM mecaptoethanol) was added to the frozen material and whirled with glass beads(36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). Insoluble cell components were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was used for protein quantification and determination of β-glucuronidase activity(32Jefferson R.A. Burgess S.M. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 33Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8390) Google Scholar, 39Frohnmeyer H. Ehmann B. Kretsch T. Rocholl M. Harter K. Nagatani A. Furuya M. Batschauer A. Hahlbrock K. Schäfer E. Plant J. 1992; 2: 899-906Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The addition of phycocyanobilin into Tween 40 substituted culture media (see “Experimental Procedures” under “Method 1”) induced the uptake of chromophore into the yeast cells. Excitation of phycocyanobilin with green light leads to the typical red fluorescence of tetrapyrroles in chromophore-treated yeast cells, whereas the untreated control shows no red fluorescence (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the Tween 40 or the Me2SO treatment (see “Experimental Procedures” under “Method 2”) kills yeast, the cells were colored with the vital dyes methylene blue and fluorescein diacetate. These stainings indicated that 89-94% of the cells survived the treatment. To test whether the chromophore can cause photooxidative damage in red light, the cells were either irradiated for 6 h or kept in darkness (Table 1). Table 1 shows the percentage of living cells 6 h after Me2SO treatment and chromophore uptake. Independent of chromophore and light treatment, the percentage of viable cells is above 90%.Table I Open table in a new tab The covalent assembly of apophytochrome with phytochromobilin and phycocyanobilin is an autocatalytic reaction of the photoreceptor (19Deforce L.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consequently, the uptake of phycocyanobilin into the yeast cells leads to the formation of photoreversible PHYA∗ and B∗ (Table 1). Table 1 gives a summary of several in vivo experiments with rice phytochrome A and tobacco phytochrome B. High amounts of spectral active photoreceptor were obtained after in vivo assembly of phytochrome. This is independent of the phytochrome type. The level of in vivo reconstituted phytochrome is significantly higher than in vitro(22Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.-H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In control experiments with biliverdin and the corresponding wild-type yeast strain, no photoreversibility could be observed (Table 1). The location of in vivo formed holophytochrome inside the cell is demonstrated by the protection against proteolytic digestion (Fig. 1A). After assembly with phycocyanobilin, the PHYA∗ amount was measured in vivo. The signal arising from the photoreversible PHYA∗ was unaltered until 25 μg of purified oat PHYA was added to the suspension. Two min after adding Proteinase K, the externally applied phytochrome was completely digested. However, the signal arising from the yeast cells remained stable for half of an hour. Afterwards, the PHYA∗ signal inside the yeast cells declined slowly. This is probably due to the digestion of the yeast cells by the proteinase. Even with the most sensitive methods, the PHYB amount in plants is usually too low for direct measurements. Thus, it was so far impossible to find out whether or not phytochrome B from dicotyledonous plants performs dark reversion. As opposed to this, the amount of in vivo reconstituted PHYA∗ and B∗ in yeast was relatively high and almost identical (Table 1). The high amount of phytochrome and the possibility to perform in vivo quantification with the Ratiospect (38Gross J. Seyfried M. Fukshansky L. Schäfer E. Smith H. Holmes Techniques in Photomorphogenesis. Academic Press, New York1984: 131-157Google Scholar) enable the direct investigation of PHYB∗ dark reversion. Denaturing during phytochrome extraction can lead to artificial Pfr instability and dark reversion. This in vitro reaction is dependent on the presence of divalent cations and reductants(40Pike C.S. Briggs W.R. Plant Physiol. 1972; 49: 514-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PHYA from monocotyledonous plants can dark revert in vitro but not in vivo. To avoid these problems, we exclusively studied the in vivo reaction. Since both dark reversion and protein destruction lead to the loss of Pfr, protein stability is a prerequisite for the exact quantification of the Pfr reversion. Therefore we investigated the stability of phytochrome. After in vivo reconstitution, the spectral active amount of PHYA∗ and B∗ remained stable for at least 1 day (not shown). To see whether Pr and Pfr differ in their stability, yeast cultures were grown in darkness or red light. After PHYA∗ reconstitution, the cultures were supplemented with fresh growth media, irradiated with far red light (10 min), and transferred to darkness or directly irradiated with red light. After a 12-h incubation, the phytochrome content was spectroscopically measured (Table 1). This light treatment had no influence on the PHYA∗ level in yeast. In contrast to plants, the Pfr formation caused no rapid destruction of the photoreceptor. Based on the absolute spectra of PHYB∗(22Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.-H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we calculated the photoequilibrium between Pfr and Pr. The irradiation with 660-nm red light leads to an equilibrium value of approximately 80% Pfr. In Fig. 2 80% Pfr is referred to as maximum (100%), and the Pfr amounts are expressed as percentage of the maximum. Depending on the time in darkness, PHYB∗ showed a rapid dark reversion. Approximately 30% of the total Pfr was involved, and the reaction was almost completed within 60 min. During the measurements the level of spectral active phytochrome remained unchanged. After dark reversion from Pfr to Pr, the molecule was fully photoreversible (Fig. 2). To exclude the possibility that phycocyanobilin causes dark reversion in phytochrome adducts, we performed control experiments with PHYA∗. As in plants, the monocotyledonous PHYA∗ exhibited no dark reversion (Fig. 2). Like the dark reversion, the formation of sequestered areas of phytochrome is an in vivo reaction that occurs after the transition of phytochrome into Pfr. This reaction was described for phytochrome from etiolated monocotyledonous plants(3Speth V. Otto V. Schäfer E. Planta. 1987; 171: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Hofmann E.

Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 773-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42McCurdy D.W. Pratt L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After transition into Pfr, phytochrome A is enriched in electron dense particles in the cytosol. This SAP formation is probably ATP-dependent and extremely rapid at room temperature. The temperature and ATP dependence of the SAP formation lead to the hypothesis that the redistribution of phytochrome into defined areas of the cytosol involves an enzymatic process or direct modification of the photoreceptor. However, it was impossible to identify a component that is involved in the SAP formation. To see whether SAP formation can occur in yeast, we performed electron microscopic investigations after in vivo reconstitution of PHYA∗. The ability to perform SAP formation in a fully heterologous system should help to understand this reaction in plants. The experiments with PHYB∗ were performed to test whether this phytochrome type has the ability to sequester. Prior to fixation and embedding, the phytochrome content of the spheroplasts was measured, and the cells were either irradiated with red light or kept in darkness. For parallel experiments with yeast cells that contained phytochrome apoprotein, the complete procedure was carried out without chromophore. For the phytochrome A and B localization, we used type-specific antisera (see “Experimental Procedures”). The in situ localization of PHYA∗ (Fig. 3A) shows particles inside the yeast cells. The intensive PHYA∗ label was clearly limited to the electron dense particles. For comparison, Fig. 3D shows a SAP from etiolated oat(34Hofmann E. Grimm R. Harter K. Speth V. Schäfer E.

Previously we cloned the full-length cDNA of human LTK, but no ligands have so far been identified, and hence, very little is known about the physiological role of LTK. To analyze the function of the LTK kinase, we constructed chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor and the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of LTK and established cell lines that stably express these chimeric molecules. When cultured in medium containing EGF, growth of these cell lines was stimulated, and these fusion proteins became autophosphorylated and associated with Shc in vivo in a ligand-dependent manner. By treatment with EGF, Shc was associated with the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex. Our analyses demonstrate that LTK associates with Grb2/Ash through an internal adaptor, Shc, depending on a ligand stimulation. The LTK binding site for Shc was tyrosine 862 at the carboxyl-terminal domain and to a lesser extent tyrosine 485 at the juxtamembrane domain. Both of them are located in NP/AXY motif which is consistent with binding sites for Shc. These findings demonstrate that LTK can activate the Ras pathway in a ligand-dependent manner and that at least one of the functions of this kinase is involved in the cell growth.

Both of them are located in NP/AXY motif which is consistent with binding sites for Shc. These findings demonstrate that LTK can activate the Ras pathway in a ligand-dependent manner and that at least one of the functions of this kinase is involved in the cell growth. Leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) 1The abbreviations used are: LTKleukocyte tyrosine kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorIRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1GSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serum. is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the insulin receptor family. The LTK gene was initially cloned from a mouse pre B cell cDNA library. Northern blot analysis revealed that the LTK gene is expressed in pre B lymphocyte, brain, placenta, and several hematopoietic cell lines (Ben-Neriah and Bauskin, 1988; Maru et al., 1990). Initially obtained clones encoded transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase with only eight amino acids as an extracellular domain, but recent studies have suggested that LTK cDNA encodes a larger extracellular domain, including the signal sequence (Haase et al., 1991; Snijders et al., 1993). Finally, we cloned a cDNA of human LTK with 423 amino acids as an extracellular domain and 415 amino acids as a cytoplasmic domain, and this clone was supposed to be full-length (Toyoshima et al., 1993). This cDNA clone encodes a 100-kDa protein when transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. leukocyte tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor insulin receptor substrate-1 glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum. Very little is known about the physiological role of LTK tyrosine kinase. The ligands for LTK have not been identified, and the expression level of LTK has been revealed to be relatively low. Therefore functional analyses of LTK has not been progressed. We showed previously that, in Northern blot analysis, the LTK gene is preferentially expressed in leukemias with no cell lineage specificity, but not in other neoplasms (Maru et al., 1990). Furthermore, by an in vitro kinase assay using anti-LTK antibody, a 100-kDa phosphoprotein was detected in human hematopoietic cell lines. These data indicate that native LTK gene product might have a critical role in malignant transformation in these cell lines (Kozutsumi et al., 1993). Recently ALK tyrosine kinase, which has 64% of amino acids sequence similarity with LTK, was cloned by the positional cloning strategy. In the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation observed in one-third of large cell lymphomas, a nuclear protein, nucleophosmin, is fused with the catalytic domain of ALK by the gene rearrangement (Morris et al., 1994). This fusion protein could contribute to malignant transformation in these lymphomas. From these observations, we supposed that the physiological role of LTK is concerned with the cell growth and malignant transformation. Chimeric receptor molecules have been successfully used as a tool to study the signaling properties of ligand-orphan receptors in which the extracellular domain of an orphan receptor is replaced by the extracellular domain of another well characterized receptor tyrosine kinase whose ligand is available. This kind of approach enables us to analyze the molecular events involved in the signal transduction pathway of the tyrosine kinase of interest, even when its ligands are not yet identified. We constructed EGF receptor (EGFR)-LTK chimeric receptor cDNAs composed of the extracellular domain of EGFR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of LTK and introduced them into human embryonic kidney 293 cells which express a relatively low level of endogenous EGFR. Using these cells, we analyzed biological and biochemical properties of LTK tyrosine kinase. In this study, we report that EGFR-LTK chimeric receptors are correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface. The growth of chimeric receptor-expressing transfectants are promoted in the presence of EGF. These chimeric receptors associate with Shc in vivo in a ligand-dependent manner, and Shc connects the cytoplasmic domain of LTK with Grb2/Ash-Sos complex. These findings indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of LTK generates growth signals upon ligand stimulation and that they may be transmitted through the Ras signaling pathway. Anti-LTK monoclonal antibody, KM912 that recognizes the extracellular domain and 1D3-1 that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal domain of LTK were produced as described previously (Kozutsumi et al., 1993; Toyoshima et al., 1993). Ab-1, the monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of EGFR, anti-Grb2/Ash monoclonal antibodies 3F2 and C23, the rabbit anti-GST antibody, the rabbit anti-Shc antibody, and the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 were purchased from Oncogene Science Inc., MBL Inc., Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., AMRAD Inc., and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. The rabbit anti-Grb2/Ash polyclonal antibody was a gift from T. Takenawa (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). The rabbit anti-Sos antibody, which is specific for mSos1, was provided by Y. Kaburagi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). To generate an expression vector pSSRαbsr, the EcoRI-PvuII fragment of pSV2bsr containing the blasticidin-resistant gene was blunted, linked with ClaI linker, and subcloned into the ClaI site of an expression vector, pSSRα (Toyoshima et al., 1993). The expression vector pUC-CAGGS was kindly provided by J. Miyazaki (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). Three chimeric receptor cDNAs were constructed by ligating the extracellular domain of human EGFR with the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of LTK. These chimeric receptors differed in the joining regions (Fig. 1). To construct EL1, the NheI site of LTK was blunted, and the NotI-NheI fragment encoding the extracellular domain of human LTK was exchanged with the NotI-NaeI fragment encoding the extracellular domain of human EGFR. To construct EL2, a unique EcoRV site was introduced at position 2090 of the EGFR cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985) with a mutagenic primer 5′-TTGGACAGATATCAAGACC-3′. The NheI site of LTK was blunted and the NotI-NheI fragment of LTK was exchanged with the NotI-EcoRV fragment of EGFR. To generate EL3, a unique EcoRV site was introduced at position 1362 of the LTK cDNA, using a mutagenic primer 5′-CAGGTGACGATATCCACAGC-3′. The NotI-EcoRV fragment of LTK was exchanged with the NotI-EcoRV fragment of EGFR. These chimeric receptor cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pSSRαbsr. Tyrosine-phenylalanine LTK mutants, Y485F, Y721F, Y753F, and Y779F, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with mutagenic primers, the 30-mer 5′-GCCCCACCTGGCAAAAATAGGGATTGGGGG-3′, the 32-mer 5′-GATAGGGCATGAAGCCTAGGGAGAAGATCTCC-3′, the 29-mer 5′-CACTGGGTCATAATGCGGAACACAGGCCC-3′, and the 20-mer 5′-CTGAGTGCAGAACTGCAGAC-3′. Tyrosine 862-phenylalanine substitution was done by introducing a point mutation with polymerase chain reaction using 5′-GATGGCACGAGATATCTACC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGAGCGAAAAGTGGGATTCC-3′ primers and verified by direct sequencing. The BglII-NotI fragment containing the introduced point mutation was substituted for the comparable fragment of wild-type LTK. All these mutant LTK cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pUC-CAGGS. Human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells (Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank; JCRB, CRL1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transfections were carried out according to the protocol of Chen and Okayama (Chen and Okayama, 1987). Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were washed once with DMEM and cultured in fresh medium containing 5% FCS. After 24 h, 5 μg/ml of blasticidin was added to the medium. Following 2 weeks of selection, resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Full-length cDNA of Grb2/Ash subcloned into pGEX expression vector was gifted by T. Takenawa (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). Bacterial cultures expressing Grb2/Ash were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37°C. The induced bacteria were lysed in Escherichia coli lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. Prior to stimulation, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.1% FCS for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with 200 ng/ml of EGF for 5 min at 37°C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% (w/v) deoxycolate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM EDTA) or Triton lysis buffer (0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM EDTA). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. For analysis of total cellular proteins, SDS sample buffer was added directly to lysate, and the mixture was denatured for 5 min at 95°C and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4°C for 3 h with specific rabbit or mouse antibodies coupled to the protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in the wash buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4), resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and denatured for 5 min at 95°C prior to loading on the gel. Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The filters were preincubated for an hour with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline-Triton X-100 (TBST) buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the specific antibody, washed three times with TBST buffer, and incubated for another hour with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody. The color reaction was performed with the ProtoBlot system (Promega). For the assays of protein-protein interaction on filters, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer for an hour, incubated with bacterial lysates containing GST-Grb2/Ash or GST alone for an hour at room temperature, and washed four times in TBST buffer. The filters were subsequently incubated with the rabbit anti-GST antibody and then incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and visualized by the ProtoBlot system as described above. One mg of 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycouril (IODO-GEN, Sigma) was dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform in an Eppendorf tube and dried under nitrogen. Approximately 1 × 107 cells expressing chimeric receptors were detached from the dish and transferred to the tube. Then 0.3 mCi of Na125I (ICN) was added to the tube and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Then cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LTK antibody, 1D3-1. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE as described above, and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to quantitate the factor-induced proliferation of cell lines expressing chimeric receptors and EGFR as described previously (Mosmann, 1983). Briefly 1 × 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured in 90 μl of DMEM containing 0.1% FCS and various concentration of EGF for 72 h. Then 10 μl of MTT solution (MTT, 5 mg/ml) was added to the medium and incubated for 6 h at 37°C. Next, 150 μl of acid isopropanol (0.04 N HCl in isopropyl alcohol) was added to all wells and mixed, and optical density was measured on a microelisa plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) at 540 nm. To examine a time-dependent cell growth rate, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in a six-well dish in DMEM containing 0.1% FCS with or without EGF (20 ng/ml) and were counted every 2 days. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and average values were presented. Three chimeric receptor cDNAs, whose products differ in their joining regions upstream of the juxtamembrane domain, were constructed. All these chimeric receptor cDNAs encoded proteins in which the extracellular domain of human EGFR was joined to the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of the human LTK. The joining region of EL3 is the nearest from the extracellular border of the LTK transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). All chimeric receptor cDNAs were subcloned into an expression vector, pSSRαbsr. These constructs were then introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 cells which express a relatively low level of endogenous EGFR. Approximately 140-kDa polypeptides corresponding to chimeric receptors were detected by immunoblotting with anti-LTK antibodies (data not shown). To establish cell lines that stably express the chimeric receptors, 5 μg/ml of blasticidin was added to the medium, and after selection for 2 weeks, resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Three to five clones were found to express chimeric receptors by immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates (data not shown). Among them, clones EL1-3, EL2-3, and EL3-3 expressed approximately the same level of fusion proteins and were used for further analyses. In addition, we established human EGFR and wild-type human LTK stable transfectants, clones E-5 and P-3, respectively. To confirm the expression of these fusion proteins, lysates from these stable transfectants were immunoprecipitated with Ab-1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of human EGFR, and immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with 1D3-1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal region of human LTK. As shown in Fig. 2A, approximately 140-kDa proteins were detected in the 293 cells transfected with the chimeric cDNAs, but not in those transfected with the expression vector alone (Fig. 2A). To verify that these chimeric receptors are expressed on the cell surface, cell surface proteins were labeled with Na125I. Then the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with 1D3-1 and subjected to the SDS-PAGE analysis. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In this experiment, approximately 140-kDa proteins corresponding to chimeric receptors were detected (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that chimeric receptors are expressed on the cell surface. To investigate whether the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptors in fibroblast could affect their morphology or growth properties, the cells expressing the chimeric receptors were maintained in DMEM at 0.1% FCS, supplemented with various concentrations of EGF, and subjected to MTT assay. In this experiment, the growth of EL1-3, EL2-3, EL3-3, and E-5 cells was promoted in proportion to EGF concentration, compared with parental 293 cells and cells transfected with the expression vector alone (Fig. 3A). When these stable transfectants were cultured in DMEM with 0.1% FCS in the presence of EGF for 7 days, the cells that express the chimeric receptor (EL3-3) and EGFR (E-5) increased in number, whereas the cells transfected with the expression vector alone decreased (Fig. 3B). The growth of EL1-3 cells and EL2-3 cells showed a similar tendency to that of EL3-3 cells (data not shown). However, when cultured in the presence of EGF for 2 weeks, no morphological changes were observed in EL1-3, EL2-3, EL3-3, and E-5 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the signal transduction pathway concerning their cell growth exists downstream of the cytoplasmic domain of LTK, depending on the ligand stimulation. Because 293 cells express endogenous EGFRs and, to some extent, the growth of parental 293 cells were stimulated in the presence of EGF, we expressed the chimeric molecules in Ba/F3 cells, which do not express endogenous EGFR and examined the growth rate in the presence of EGF. In this experiment, we have obtained similar results (data not shown). Ligand binding to the extracellular domains of receptor tyrosine kinase results in activation of the cytoplasmic kinase function. To investigate the ability of EGF to induce the autophosphorylation of chimeric receptors in 293 cells, EL1-3, EL2-3, EL3-3, E-5 cells, and mock cells were starved for 24 h in medium containing 0.1% FCS and stimulated with 200 ng/ml of EGF for 5 min at 37°C. Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. As shown in Fig. 4, each chimeric receptor became increasingly phosphorylated on tyrosine in a ligand-dependent manner. At the same time, approximately 70-kDa protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine. No differences of the pattern of phosphoproteins among chimeric receptors (EL1, EL2, and EL3) were observed, but this 70-kDa phosphoprotein was not detected in EGF-treated E-5 cell lysates. Instead, an 85-kDa phosphoprotein was detected in E-5 cell lysates depending on EGF stimulation. These differences might suggest the existence of the signal transduction pathways specific for LTK tyrosine kinase. When mock cells were stimulated with EGF, a 170-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was faintly detected. This phosphoprotein was thought to be endogenous EGFR, because the 293 cells express a relatively low level of EGFR. But compared with introduced chimeric proteins, the expression level of endogenous EGFR was relatively low. Because no differences were observed so far among the biological and biochemical properties of the chimeric receptors, we used EL3-3 cells for further analyses. Since EGF promoted proliferation of cells expressing chimeric receptors, the signaling pathway concerning cell growth should exist downstream of LTK. Recent studies have suggested that many receptor tyrosine kinases activate Ras through binding with the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex. Therefore, we examined the physiological role of Grb2/Ash in the signaling pathway of LTK. Lysates from EL3-3 cells and E-5 cells stimulated with EGF were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Grb2/Ash polyclonal antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. Major 140-, 56-, and 42-kDa phosphoproteins were detected in EL3-3 cell lysates, whereas major 170-, 115-, 100-, 56-, and 46-kDa phosphoproteins were detected in E-5 cell lysates (Fig. 5A). As it has been reported that EGF induces association between Grb2/Ash and EGFR or Shc (Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1993, 1994), the 170-kDa protein immunoprecipitated from E-5 cell lysates was considered to be EGFR, and 52- and 46-kDa proteins were considered to be Shc. We could not characterize the 115- and 100-kDa phosphoproteins co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2/Ash. The 140-kDa phosphoprotein immunoprecipitated from EL3-3 cell lysates was not detected from E-5 cell lysates and therefore considered to be the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor. To verify this, lysates from EL3-3 cells stimulated with EGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Grb2/Ash antibody, and 27-kDa Grb2/Ash protein was detected (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, anti-Grb2/Ash immunoprecipitates from EL3-3 cells stimulated with EGF were immunoblotted with 1D3-1 anti-LTK monoclonal antibody. In this experiment, the 140-kDa chimeric receptor was identified (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that chimeric receptor is physically associated with Grb2/Ash in vivo in a ligand-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 5A, anti-Grb2/Ash immunoprecipitates from EGF-treated EL3-3 cells contained 52- and 46-kDa phosphoproteins, and we considered these proteins to be Shc. To verify this, anti-Grb2/Ash immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Shc antibody, and as expected, p46, p52, and p66 Shc proteins were detected (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, anti-Shc immunoprecipitates from EGF-treated EL3-3 cells were revealed to contain the p27 Grb2/Ash protein (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that LTK kinase can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2/Ash in vivo. These findings raised the possibility that LTK can directly associate with Shc. To examine this possibility, lysates from EL3-3 cells stimulated with EGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-LTK monoclonal antibody, and then the 140-kDa chimeric receptor protein was detected. EGF-treated EL3-3 cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-LTK monoclonal antibody, and immunoblotting with anti-Shc antibody was performed. In this experiment, p46, p52, and p66 Shc proteins were co-precipitated with LTK. (Fig. 7C). These data demonstrate that the chimeric receptor associates with Shc in vivo in a liganddependent fashion.Figure 7:EGF-induced complex formation involving the chimeric receptor, Sos, and Grb2/Ash. A, lysates from EL3-3 cells treated with or without EGF were immunoprecipitated with Ab-1 or C23 anti-Grb2/Ash polyclonal antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Sos antibody. An arrow indicates Sos. B, E-5 cells, EL3-3 cells, and mock-transfected cells were stimulated with indicated concentration of EGF at 37°C for 5 min, solubilized, and immunoblotted with anti-Sos antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies have suggested that the SH3 domains of Grb2/Ash bind constitutively to proline-rich motifs within the carboxyl-terminal tail of Sos (Buday and Downward, 1993; Chardin et al., 1993; Egan et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993). Since the chimeric receptor associated with Grb2/Ash in vivo, Sos should also associate with this complex. To investigate this, EL3-3 cells stimulated with EGF were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody and then subjected to the Western blot analysis by anti-Sos antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were revealed to contain Sos protein (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, when anti-Sos immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, a 140-kDa phosphoprotein corresponding to the chimeric receptor was detected (data not shown). These data suggested that the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor and Sos form a complex in vivo. To examine whether this association occurs through Grb2/Ash, lysates from EGF-stimulated EL3-3 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2/Ash antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Sos antibody. In this experiment, Sos was shown to form a stable complex with Grb2/Ash, but EGF stimulation resulted in a mobility shift of Sos in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A). This shift in electrophoretic mobility is thought to be a result of phosphorylation of Sos on serine and threonine residues (Skolnik et al., 1993a). To test whether this phosphorylation results from the LTK kinase activity and not from activation of endogenous EGFR, lysates from E-5 cells, EL3-3 cells, and mock cells stimulated with EGF were subjected to Western blot analysis by anti-Sos antibody. In this experiment, mobility shift of Sos was observed in E-5 cells and EL3-3 cells, but little shift of Sos band in mock cells was observed (Fig. 7B). These data suggested that LTK can activate Sos through association with Grb2/Ash. In summary, there were two possible models for association between the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor and Grb2/Ash. One is that, like EGFR, LTK can directly bind both of Grb2/Ash and Shc. Another is that, like Trk tyrosine kinase, LTK can directly associate only with Shc, but not with Grb2/Ash, because Grb2/Ash indirectly binds LTK through Shc. Recent studies have revealed that the consensus motif of binding sites for the SH2 domain of Grb2/Ash is YXNX motif (Skolnik et al., 1993b; Songyang et al., 1993, 1994). For example, the Shc binding site for Grb2/Ash is Tyr317, and the peptide sequence containing this tyrosine is DPSYVNVNQ. Similarly, the Grb2/Ash binding motif on IRS-1 is PGEYVNIE, and the binding motif on EGFR is VPEYINQSV. This motif is strictly conserved among binding sites for Grb2/Ash, Drk, and Sem-5 (Songyang et al., 1993, 1994). But the YXNX motif does not exist in the cytoplasmic region of LTK. Therefore, association between the chimeric receptor and the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex was considered to be indirect. To examine this, the far-Western blot analysis using GST-Grb2/Ash fusion protein was performed (Mayer et al., 1991). EL3-3 cells and E-5 cells stimulated with EGF were lysed in Triton lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with Ab-1, a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of EGFR. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. Replica filters were incubated either with a bacterial lysate containing the GST-Grb2/Ash fusion protein or with GST alone. Binding of the GST proteins to the transferred proteins on the filter was detected by incubation of the filters with the anti-GST antibody followed by the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody. In this assay, GST-Grb2/Ash bound to EGFR but did not bind to the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor. However, GST-Grb2/Ash could bind to the 52- and 46-kDa proteins of immunoprecipitates from EL3-3 cells (Fig. 8). These proteins were also detected in E-5 cell lysates and therefore considered to be Shc proteins associated with the chimeric receptor. GST alone could not bind to any proteins of immunoprecipitates from EL3-3 cells and E-5 cells. These data indicate that Grb2/Ash indirectly binds the EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor via Shc as an internal molecule. Recent studies have revealed that the consensus binding motif for Shc is NP/AXY (Prigent and Gullick, 1994). The cytoplasmic domain of LTK has two NP/AXY motifs, Tyr485 located on the juxtamembrane region and Tyr862 located on the carboxyl-terminal region. As shown in Fig. 10, the NP/AXY motif located on the juxtamembrane region is conserved among the insulin receptor family members. Therefore we hypothesized that the binding site for Shc is Tyr485 located on the juxtamembrane region of LTK. We analyzed the binding sites of Shc on the LTK by using the wild-type LTK and various LTK mutants. The mutant LTKs used in this study include receptors containing point mutations at Tyr485, Tyr721, Tyr753, Tyr779, Tyr862, or Tyr485/Tyr862 (Tyr to Phe) or lysine 544 to methionine (Lys544M) (Fig. 9A). These wild-type and mutant LTK cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pUC-CAGGS and transiently introduced into 293 cells. In this experiment, the wild-type and all of the mutant LTKs except for K544M mutant were autophosphorylated (data not shown). While an approximately equal amount of Shc was associated with Y485F, Y721F, and Y779F LTK mutants, the amount of Shc associated with the Y862F mutant was markedly reduced, and no Shc protein could bind to Y485F/Y862F LTK mutant (Fig. 9B). As shown in Fig. 10, the NP/AXY motif located on the juxtamembrane region is conserved among the insulin receptor family members. Therefore we hypothesized that the binding site for Shc is Tyr485 located on the juxtamembrane region of LTK. But, as shown in Fig. 9, the major LTK binding site for Shc is tyrosine 862, and the minor binding site for Shc is tyrosine 485. The Lys544 mutant is a kinase-inactive LTK mutant (Kozutsumi et al., 1994), and we confirmed that it is not autophosphorylated in this experiment by the immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown), but the binding of Shc protein was not completely canceled. From these data, we summarized the signal transduction pathway of LTK as shown in Fig. 11 and compared it with that of EGFR (Batzer et al., 1994) and Trk (Obermeier et al., 1993b). While EGFR directly binds both Shc and Grb2/Ash, Trk and LTK cannot bind Grb2/Ash directly. In this respect, LTK has a similarity to Trk tyrosine kinase. Many receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to play a critical role in the cell growth and differentiation and to be implicated in generation of various human neoplasms. The evidence that, in Northern blot analysis, the LTK gene is preferentially expressed in human leukemias with no cell lineage specificity (Maru et al., 1990) suggests that LTK gene product might play an important role in human leukemogenesis. However, since LTK tyrosine kinase was cloned in 1988, the functional analyses of this kinase has not been advanced, mainly because its specific ligands have not been identified. Although it was reported that, when expressed in COS-7 cells, LTK resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, where its kinase activity might be controlled by changes in the redox potential, the cDNA clone used in this study was not full length and therefore devoid of the signal sequence (Bauskin et al., 1991). Furthermore, there is no evidence that native LTK protein was expressed in endoplasmic reticulum. Chimeric receptor molecules have been successfully used to investigate the biological and biochemical properties of ligand-orphan receptors. This kind of approach is particularly useful to analyze the signaling molecules implicated in the signal transduction pathway of the kinase. EGFR is the well characterized receptor tyrosine kinase and therefore frequently used to construct such chimeric receptor molecules to analyze the function of ligand-orphan receptors. These include kit (Herbst et al., 1991; Lev et al., 1991), neu (Pandiella et al., 1989), Trk (Obermeier et al., 1993a, 1993b), insulin receptor (Ballotti et al., 1989), ret (Santoro et al., 1994), and elk (Lhotak and Pawson, 1993). In general, the biological properties of such molecules depend on their cytoplasmic catalytic domains. We therefore constructed EGFR-LTK chimeric receptor cDNAs composed of the extracellular domain of EGFR and the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of LTK. When expressed in 293 cells, these chimeric receptors were correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface (Fig. 2). EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of chimeric receptors, as well as several cellular proteins, but the pattern of phosphoproteins was different from those of cells expressing EGFR (Fig. 3), suggesting the existence of the signal transduction pathway specific for LTK tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasm. We analyzed the biological activities of cells expressing the chimeric receptors and found that growth of these cells are promoted in the presence of EGF (Fig. 4). These data indicated that LTK kinase can transmit signals concerning the cell growth. To examine the intracellular events, signaling molecules involved in the LTK signal transduction pathway were examined. Recent studies have suggested that many tyrosine kinases activate Ras through binding to the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex. Therefore we examined the roles of Grb2/Ash in the LTK signaling pathway. We found that EGF induced association between the chimeric receptor and Grb2/Ash in vivo. Furthermore, Shc was phosphorylated on tyrosine and associated with the chimeric receptor upon stimulation with EGF. Although the cytoplasmic domain of LTK has two NP/AXY motifs (Tyr485 and Tyr862) which match the binding motif for Shc (Prigent and Gullick, 1994), Grb2/Ash binding motif, YXNX (Skolnik et al., 1993b; Songyang et al., 1993), does not exist on the cytoplasmic region of LTK. Therefore we hypothesized that association between the chimeric receptor and Grb2/Ash is indirect. The data of the far-Western analysis using GST-Grb2/Ash were consistent with our hypothesis (Fig. 8). The Shc binding motif, NP/AXY, which is located on the juxtamembrane domains, is conserved among the members of insulin receptor family (Fig. 9). This NP/AXY motif located in the Trk juxtamembrane domain has been shown to represent the binding site for Shc (Obermeier et al., 1993b). Interestingly, this motif is also conserved at the juxtamembrane domain of ALK tyrosine kinase (Morris et al., 1994), which might play a critical role in malignant transformation. Therefore we considered that LTK binding site for Shc is Tyr485 located at the juxtamembrane region, but in contrast to our anticipation, the major binding site for Shc was Tyr862, which is located at the carboxyl-terminal region and Tyr485 was the minor binding site. The significance of this difference is unclear. For example, EGFR has three NP/AXY motifs on the carboxyl-terminal domain (Tyr1086, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173), but the major binding site for Shc is Tyr1173, whereas Tyr1086 and Tyr1128 exhibit weak or no interaction with Shc (Batzer et al., 1994). These findings may imply that additional residues are also required to generate a high-affinity binding site for Shc. The activation of the Ras pathway is implicated in generation of various tumors. For example, Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase, which is thought to play important roles in the development of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, binds directly to Grb2/Ash and mediates Ras stimulation (Puil et al., 1994). We have shown that, in some human hematopoietic cell lines, a 100-kDa phosphoprotein is detected by an in vitro kinase assay using anti-LTK antibody (Kozutsumi et al., 1993). Therefore it is possible that LTK is implicated in the tumorigenesis in these cell lines through activating the Ras pathway. Several kinds of adaptor molecules are known to connect phosphotyrosine of a tyrosine kinase with the SH2 domain of Grb2/Ash when the tyrosine kinases do not have the binding motif for Grb2/Ash. platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and Trk tyrosine kinase do not have the YXNX motif on their cytoplasmic domains and therefore they cannot bind Grb2/Ash directly, but Syp (Li et al., 1994), IRS-1 (Giorgetti et al., 1994;Skolnik et al., 1993), and Shc (Obermeier et al., 1993b) have been shown to connect these receptors with Grb2/Ash. It is an intriguing idea that the adaptor molecule specify the biological activities of the kinase. For example, insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with the Grb2/Ash-Sos complex (Baltensperger et al., 1993), but at the same time IRS-1 associates with p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Syp, phospholipase Cλ, and Nck (Kuhne et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1993), and thus the signal transduction pathways through these molecules should also be activated. In the case of LTK, Shc is the adaptor molecule which couples the cytoplasmic domain of LTK and the SH2 domain of Grb2/Ash. In this respect, LTK may be referred to as a Trk-type receptor tyrosine kinase. Many growth factors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2/Ash (Cutler et al., 1993; Damen et al., 1993; Ravichandran and Burakoff, 1994; Ravichandran et al., 1993). Therefore it is obvious that Shc has a critical role in connecting various growth factor receptors with the Ras pathway. Furthermore, Shc itself has been shown to possess a transforming activity. Overexpression of Shc proteins induces transformation of mouse fibroblasts (Pelicci et al., 1992). Middle T-antigen, through binding to Shc, associates with Grb2/Ash and stimulates the Ras activity, and this leads to cell transformation (Dilworth et al., 1994). These data indicate that Shc proteins play an important role in generating the cell growth signals through binding to the Ras pathway. On the other hand, when overexpressed in PC12 cells, Shc induces Ras-dependent neurite outgrowth in these cells (Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1992). PC12 cells express both EGFR and Trk and both of them can activate the Ras pathway, whereas only nerve growth factor, but not EGF, can induce neuronal differentiation in these cells (Chao, 1992). Obermeier et al.(1994) showed that, in PC12 cells, neuronal differentiation signals are mainly controlled by the Trk binding site for Shc. Recently, when stimulated with nerve growth factor, Shc is shown to associate with CRK in vitro (Matsuda et al., 1994) and microinjection of the CRK protein has been shown to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (Tanaka et al., 1993). These data suggest that Shc's neuronal differentiation signals are generated through the CRK protein. Northern blot analysis showed that the LTK gene is expressed in neuronal tissues (Maru et al., 1990) and therefore these findings raised the possibility that LTK might also generate neuronal differentiation signals through activating Shc-CRK pathway. In this study, we analyzed the biological and biochemical activities of LTK tyrosine kinase, but our experiments were carried out with recombinant chimeric molecules expressed in fibroblasts in which native LTK protein is not expressed. Therefore the question remains whether these findings are true events when native LTK product is stimulated by its unknown ligands. To address these questions, its specific ligands should be identified. We thank T. Takenawa for anti-Grb2/Ash antibody and Grb2/Ash pGEX. We also thank Y. Kaburagi for anti-Sos antibody."

In vitro, under certain conditions, terminase can render DNAs from various sources, of varying lengths and termini, resistant to degradation by high concentrations of DNase I. This reaction is completely dependent on the presence of terminase, proheads, a hydrolyzable triphosphate, and a divalent metal ion, and we propose that it is the result of translocation of DNA into proheads by terminase. This reaction is stoichiometric with respect to terminase, DNA, and proheads and can be supported by all deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside triphosphates, but not by the corresponding diphosphates or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. Mg2+ and Ca2+ promote the reaction, but Mn2+ and Zn2+ do not. In the absence of spermidine, translocase activity is low, but addition of the Escherichia coli protein integration host factor (IHF) promotes specific translocation of only those DNA fragments containing the terminase-binding site, cosB.

Under these conditions IHF no longer promotes specificity, but translocation of only cosB-containing DNA fragments can be restored by addition of small amounts of a dialyzed and RNase-treated E. coli extract, suggesting that additional host factor(s) may be involved in determination of packaging specificity.

Formation of viable phage cannot be accomplished by gpA in the absence of gpNu1. During the assembly of phage λ heads in vivo, linear DNA concatamers are matured by the terminase holoenzyme and then specifically translocated into the preformed protein shells, or proheads, starting from the left end of the genome (reviewed in Feiss (1986); Becker and Murialdo(1990); Murialdo(1991)). This translocation reaction is believed to be accomplished by a similar process in all double-stranded DNA bacteriophages (Casjens, 1985; Black, 1988) and is thought to be driven by ATP hydrolysis, since an ATP requirement exists for all in vitro packaging systems (Earnshaw and Casjens, 1980; Black, 1988). Another essential requirement for DNA packaging is the presence of the functional terminase proteins, which are thought to be directly involved in the translocation process (Becker et al., 1977; Guo et al., 1986; Hamada et al., 1986; Rao and Black, 1988). Specificity of λ DNA maturation and translocation in vivo derives from the interactions of the terminase holoenzyme with the DNA elements of the cohesive end junction (cos site), located between −40 and +160 bp on the λ genome map (Miwa and Matsubara, 1982, 1983; Hohn, 1983; Feiss et al., 1983). Cos contains three distinct regions: cosN (−11 to +11 bp), 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)gpgene productsssingle-strandedIHFintegration host factorNTPnucleotide triphosphatePFUplaque-forming unitkbkilobase(s)ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). a sequence with partial 2-fold rotational symmetry where terminase makes the staggered nicks and separates the 12-base overhangs using an ATP hydrolysis-requiring helicase-like activity (Higgins et al., 1988; Rubinchik et al., 1994b); cosB (+12 to +160 bp), which contains three binding sites, R1, R2, and R3, to which both the small subunit of terminase, gpNu1, and the terminase holoenzyme, specifically bind (Shinder and Gold, 1988; Parris et al., 1994), as well as a high affinity binding site for IHF (Kosturko et al., 1989); and cosQ (−12 to −40 bp), a region involved in completion of DNA translocation into the prohead and the cleavage of the 2nd cos site (Cue and Feiss, 1993). base pair(s) gene product single-stranded integration host factor nucleotide triphosphate plaque-forming unit kilobase(s) adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). It is clear that the two subunits of λ terminase, gpA (74 kDa) and gpNu1 (21 kDa), must contain domains which define the numerous activities performed by terminase as part of the overall packaging pathway. We have recently established that both the ATPase and the helicase activities of the terminase holoenzyme can be accounted for by its large subunit, gpA (Parris et al., 1994), and have quantitatively analyzed the reaction parameters of these activities (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). We have attempted to investigate the relationship between the two known ATP hydrolysis-requiring activities of terminase, packaging and helicase, and the observed in vitro ATPase. Our interpretation of the results suggested that the in vitro ATPase of gpA and terminase is predominately associated with the helicase activity of these proteins and not necessarily with their translocation activity. However, this interpretation was questionable since the roles and requirements of the various host proteins, as well as of phage morphogenic components required to complete the phage assembly pathway and generate viable PFUs, were not defined in the in vitro packaging assay. DNA packaging assays measure the formation of viable, infectious phage particles, and this formation consists of a series of steps. After the terminase•DNA•prohead complex is formed, DNA is translocated into the capsid. Thereafter, the phage proteins gpD, gpW, and gpFII must be added before tails can be attached (Perucchetti et al., 1988), and there is evidence that host factor(s) may also be involved. In this study, we have used a defined in vitro assay to look specifically at the translocation of DNA into a preformed λ prohead, in the absence of additional host or phage components, and to quantitatively describe the translocase activity promoted by λ terminase and its subunits. The origins and relevant genotypes of bacterial strains used in this work are indicated in Table 1. Bacterial and phage extracts for use in in vitro translocase and packaging assays were prepared as described previously (Parris et al., 1994).Table I Open table in a new tab [14C]DNA labeled with radioactive thymidine from 159T−(λcI857Sam7)) was purified as follows. Cells were grown at 37°C to a concentration of 2 × 108/ml in 500 ml of Frasers medium (a minimal medium with casamino acids and glycerol) supplemented with 0.15 ml of 1 M CaCl2, 25 μl of 20% MgSO4, and 1.25 ml of thymidine (2 mg/ml). Induction was by heating for 15 min at 45°C followed by rapid cooling to 37°C. The culture was grown for 4 h at 37°C in the presence of 250 μCi of methyl-[14C]thymidine to label the induced phage DNA. The specific activity of [14C]λ DNA was 30,000 counts/min/μg. λ phage, labeled and unlabeled mature λ DNA, and M13 ssDNA were purified by standard methods. T7 DNA was the generous gift of Dr. P. Sadowski, and yeast genomic DNA was generously donated by the members of the Dr. B. Andrews Laboratory. Calf thymus DNA (Type II) was from Sigma. The pWP14 (Parris et al., 1988; Rubinchik et al., 1994a) and pTZ19 (Pharmacia LKB) plasmids were purified using Qiagen P500 columns as described by the manufacturers. Plasmid concatamers (>30 kb) were prepared by ligating EcoRI digests of these plasmids at high DNA concentrations. Escherichia coli tRNA was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and wheat germ rRNA was generously donated by Dr. B. G. Lane. Strains, vectors, and methods used to purify gpA, gpNu1, terminase, and IHF for use in this study are described in detail by Parris et al.(1994). λ proheads were prepared from thermally induced 594(λAam32Kam24cI857Sam7) cells disrupted by sonication. This was followed by a high speed centrifugation to pellet the proheads. Subsequently a 40-80% ammonium sulfate cut of this fraction was applied to a Sepharose 6B column. The proheads from this column were applied to an anion-exchange TMAE column and were eluted with approximately 0.5 M NaCl. GpA, gpNu1, terminase, IHF, and proheads used in this work were more than 95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-Coomassie Brilliant Blue R stain analysis. GpD was partially purified from induced 594 (λWam403Bam10cI857Sam7) with modifications to previously published methods (Perucchetti et al., 1988). Partially purified gpW was the kind gift of Abraham Haddad. Details of its purification will be published elsewhere. For the in vitro assays, all proteins were first dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined after dialysis, using the Bio-Rad protein assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Terminase was assumed to have the Mr of 120,000. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I, 1861 units/mg dry weight) was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corporation. Pyruvate kinase (2 mg/ml) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. HinDIII, EcoRI, PstI, and ScaI restriction endonucleases and T4 ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Acetylated bovine serum albumin was obtained from New England Biolabs as a 10 mg/ml stock solution. 100 mM dNTP solutions, β,γ-methylene-ATP, and ATPγS were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. 100 mM NTP solutions were purchased from Pharmacia LKB. ADP was purchased from Sigma and contained less than 0.1% of ATP as determined by chromatographic analysis. [2-14C]ATP and [2-14C]dTTP were obtained from DuPont-NEN. Phosphoenol pyruvate was purchased from Sigma. Reactions were typically carried out in volumes of 10-20 μl and contained 0.3-2 μg of DNA, 1-2 μg of purified proheads, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 6% glycerol. Reaction mixtures also contained either 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, or 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 3 mM spermidine. These sets of conditions were respectively analogous to the relaxed stringency (RS) and the high stringency (HS) conditions of the endonuclease activity of λ terminase (Rubinchik et al., 1994a) and will be henceforth referred to as such. Reaction conditions were varied depending on the experiment, as indicated in figure legends. If required, purified IHF was added to 30 nM. For gpNu1:gpA interaction experiments, the two subunits were mixed on ice in the desired molar ratio (typically, 2 or 3 gpNu1 to 1 gpA) and incubated on ice for 5-10 min. All protein dilutions were made in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This buffer was used in control reactions which lacked terminase or its subunits. The reactions were initiated by the addition of DNA and were typically incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Unless stated otherwise, 1 μl of a DNase I solution (10 mg/ml) was then added to each reaction, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 3-6 μl of gel loading buffer, which contained 60% glycerol, 150 mM EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. The reactions were then either electrophoresed directly, or packaged DNA was released from proheads by adding 2-4 μl of 10% SDS to the reactions and incubating them for 5 min at 65°C. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.7% agarose gels in 0.04 M Tris acetate and 0.002 M EDTA buffer, pH 7.7, at 12 V/cm for 1-2 h. Subsequently, gels were either stained in 0.01% ethidium bromide solution and photographed, or, if labeled DNA was used, dried and exposed to storage phosphor plates overnight, and scanned by the PhosphorImager instrument from Pharmacia LKB. Dried agarose gels could also be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R for protein analysis. Quantitative data analysis was performed by the GraFit data analysis application (version 2.04, Erithacus Software Ltd.), as described previously (Rubinchik et al., 1994a, 1994b). Specifically, all above-background counts remaining in a lane (including the well) after the DNase I treatment were considered to be the result of translocation-dependent protection. ATPase activity was assayed with [2-14C]ATP added to the translocase reactions to a final concentration of 100 μM. Typically, 2-μl aliquots were taken from the translocase assays at various time points and analyzed by thin layer chromatography, as described previously (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). In vitro packaging assays were performed essentially as described (Parris et al., 1994), with the following modifications. Approximately 0.3 μg of mature λcI857Sam7 DNA was added to a reaction containing either 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM spermidine HCl, 1 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 15 mM putrescine, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (HS), or 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 30 nM IHF, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (RS + IHF). To this was added 1.5 μg of purified proheads and purified terminase to a final concentration of 40 nM. The reaction volume at this point was 20 μl. This phase I reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, a crude extract or combinations of crude extracts and partially purified proteins were added, to provide gpD, gpW, gpFII, and tails, and the phase II reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 60 min to complete the mature phage particle. Alternatively, all components of the packaging reaction, with the exception of terminase, could be supplied as crude extracts in a single 60-min reaction. Mature phage particles were titered on QD5003, and the results expressed as PFUs/ml reaction. DNase I sensitivity assays were performed with the following modifications to the above system. After the assembly of phase I reactions (with or without gpD and gpW, as desired), they were incubated for 15 min to allow packaging of the DNA to occur. At this point 2 μg of DNase I were added and reactions left to proceed for another 10 min at room temperature. Appropriate phase II components were added and the reaction incubated for another hour at room temperature. Viable phage were titered as described above. DNA packaging assays with other DNA substrates to test for packaging specificity and infectivity of translocated DNA were performed as the 2-phase assays described above, except that λ DNA was replaced by T7 or supercoiled, linear, or concatameric plasmid DNA of the same concentration. T7 DNA packaging was tested by plating phase II products on QD5003 and DH5 and screening for the appearance of characteristic T7 plaques. Plasmid infectivity was monitored by incubation of a plasmid DNA packaging reaction aliquot (10 μl) with 0.1 ml of an exponential culture of QD5003 in 2 ml of culture broth for 1 h at 37°C, followed by plating on solid agar plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and by observing growth of ampicillin-resistant colonies. 14C-Labeled mature λ DNA was observed to become DNase I resistant when it was used as a substrate in in vitro packaging reactions (Fig. 1, lane 4). This activity required the presence of phage components necessary for correct prohead assembly, such as gpE, gpB, and gpNu3 (Fig. 1, lanes 5, 6, and 8), but not of any other gene products involved in λ phage morphogenesis (Fig. 1, lanes 9-11). Some activity was detected in lysogen extracts which lacked gpC (Fig. 1, lane 7), but these did not generate viable PFUs (Table 2). Purified λ proheads could successfully substitute for prohead-donating lysogen sonicates (Fig. 1, lane 12) in this assay. The amount of DNA observed to be protected from DNase I was 2 orders of magnitude higher than could be accounted for by the number of PFUs generated (Table 2). The assay was equally or more efficient (with respect to the final yield of protected DNA) when purified proheads and terminase were mixed with mature λ DNA in the absence of other phage or host proteins (Table 2). Protected DNA migrated through the gel in a novel pattern, with a large fraction present in a band, the position of which corresponded to the band of purified proheads as assayed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining (data not shown). DNase I resistance was completely dependent on the presence of ′both proheads and terminase (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8), as well as MgCl2 and ATP, which leads us to believe that the resistance is the result of terminase-promoted translocation of DNA into preassembled λ proheads.Table II Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Purified proheads and terminase are both necessary and sufficient to promote DNase I resistance. The translocase assays were carried out in 10-μl reaction volumes and under HS conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” except that DNase I was not added to lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 after a 60-min incubation. All reactions contained 0.8 μg mature λ DNA, of which 0.1 μg was 14C-labeled. Lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8 contained 150 nM terminase; lanes 5-8 contained 9 nM purified proheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heating the DNase I-treated reactions at 65°C in the presence of 1.5% SDS released the DNA from proheads, which then appeared as a distinct band with a mobility similar to that of mature λ DNA. Due to the limited resolution of DNA fragments larger than 20 kb on agarose gels, we estimate the size of DNA species recovered from the proheads to be between 25 and 48.5 kb. The last estimate, which corresponds to the complete length of the λ genome, is unlikely to be accurate, since the products of the translocation assay did not generate viable PFUs after DNase I treatment, unless complemented with partially purified gpD and gpW (Table 2). DNAs of various origins were tested as substrates for the translocase activity of terminase. The results are summarized in Table 3. In the absence of polyamines and NaCl (RS conditions), translocase activity was very low, as assayed by using a HinDIII λ DNA digest as a substrate (Fig. 3, lane 1). When IHF was added to the RS conditions, translocation of the 23-kb DNA fragment, which contains the left end of the λ chromosome and the cosB site, was preferentially enhanced, while that of all the other λ DNA fragments remained low (Fig. 3, lane 2). Titration experiments indicated that maximum IHF effect was reached when this protein was present in 2-3-fold molar excess over the DNA molecules containing the cos site. When a linearized cosmid pWP14 was used as a substrate under RS plus IHF conditions, it was cleaved at the cos site, and the fragment containing the left end-cosB sequences was preferentially translocated.Table III Open table in a new tab Spermidine, or a combination of spermidine and putrescine, significantly enhanced the nonspecific translocase activity, so that under HS conditions all linear DNA molecules of varying lengths and termini, such as all the fragments of a λ HinDIII digest, monomeric T7 genomes, or plasmid DNA, could be translocated into λ proheads, regardless of the presence of the cos site (Fig. 3, lanes 5, 7, and 9; Table 3). Likewise, eukaryotic DNA, from yeast and calf thymus, was translocated under these conditions. However, only those DNA molecules that contained both the left and the right ends of λ chromosome, such as mature λ chromosomes themselves, or concatameric cosmid DNA, 2To generate infectious λ particles, cosmid concatamers were presumably cleaved at two of the multiple cos sites, such that a linear DNA molecule approximately the length of a mature λ chromosome, and containing mature λ ends, was generated. gave rise to infectious particles, as monitored by the appearance of plaques and ampicillin-resistant colonies, respectively (Table 3). Specificity of translocation in the presence of spermidine or both spermidine and putrescine could not be restored by IHF (Fig. 3, lanes 6-8), but was accomplished by addition of small amounts of dialyzed E. coli extract treated with RNase A (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5). Purified gpNu1 subunit was not able to promote translocase activity in the absence of gpA. At high protein concentrations and RS conditions (described under “Experimental Procedures”), the large subunit of terminase gpA was capable of protecting a small amount of DNA from DNase I degradation (Fig. 5). It could not, however, promote formation of viable phage. The translocase activity of gpA was not affected by the presence of IHF and did not occur under HS conditions (described under “Experimental Procedures”). It also did not generate viable phage when used as a first stage in a two-stage packaging assay. When the DNA translocated under RS conditions by gpA was extracted from the proheads by heating in the presence of SDS, it appeared as a smear with no distinct bands visible. Translocation of DNA into proheads appeared to be non-catalytic with respect to the amount of terminase, as assayed by quantifying the reaction yields after 60 min at ambient temperature (Fig. 5). The activity was directly proportional to the concentration of terminase below 150 nM but appeared to decrease at higher terminase levels. To examine the activity profile in more detail, we used two levels of terminase from the linear response range to do translocation time courses, as well as to determine ATPase activity under translocation conditions. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the translocation data points were adequately fitted by the first order rate kinetics in both cases. Table 4 summarizes the relevant parameters of this experiment. Calculated reaction yield values confirm that the reactions were essentially completed after a 60-min incubation. The initial reaction rates and the final yields were directly proportional to the terminase concentrations. Similar time course data were obtained when terminase was incubated at room temperature for 1 h prior to the initiation of the reaction, which suggests that time-dependent inactivation of terminase is not the predominant cause of the first order reaction. The translocase activity may be dependent on the number of translocase-competent terminase•DNA•prohead complexes formed. The number of such complexes was estimated for the two terminase concentrations (Table 4), based on the calculated yields and the previously published results which established that up to 82% of λ genome could be packaged into proheads in the absence of gpD (Sternberg and Weisberg, 1977). The average rate of translocation per complex and per terminase protomer was then determined (Table 4).Table IV Open table in a new tab The translocase activity was also found to be stoichiometric with respect to the reaction concentrations of DNA (Fig. 7A) and proheads (Fig. 7B). That is, the yield was directly proportional to the amount of the component tested up to the point where it saturated one of the other reaction components (Fig. 7B). We propose that the number of translocation-competent complexes formed is determined by the reaction concentrations of terminase, DNA, and proheads, as well as relevant physiological conditions, such as spermidine and IHF. The translocase activity of terminase was optimal at MgCl2 concentrations of between 1 and 5 mM. It could also be supported by similar concentrations of CaCl2, but not by MnCl2 or ZnCl2. Translocase was inactive if ATP was absent from the reaction, or if it was replaced by ADP, or by nonhydrolyzable analogs such as ATPγS and β,γ-methylene-ATP. The activity could also be supported, to a varying extent, by all NTPs and dNTPs, with ATP and dATP being the most efficient, followed closely by CTP. We have investigated the effect of varying the ATP concentration on the translocation reaction (Fig. 8). 50% of maximal activity was reached at ATP concentrations of approximately 60 μM, but when concentrations higher than 1 mM were present the activity decreased sharply. This decrease was determined to be the result of Mg2+ depletion by the nucleotide and could be reversed by increasing the concentration of MgCl2. Under RS plus IHF reaction conditions, combining gpA and gpNu1 produced translocase activity comparable to that of the terminase holoenzyme, albeit somewhat less active on a molar basis (Fig. 5). Activity profiles with respect to substrate specificity, as well as various metals, nucleotides, and inhibitors, were also essentially the same. The optimal subunit ratio was between 2 and 4 gpNu1 molecules to 1 gpA molecule (Fig. 9). The subunit mixture was inactive under HS conditions. Bacteriophage λ in vitro packaging assays are very inefficient, with less than 0.05% of the substrate DNA generating PFUs in our experiments (Table 2). By using 14C-labeled λ DNA as a substrate in these assays, we were able to observe some of it becoming resistant to DNase I degradation. This resistance did not require phage proteins responsible for the maturation of λ heads (gpD, gpW, or gpFII), or the presence of phage tails (Fig. 1). DNase I-resistant DNA migrated in a novel pattern on an agarose gel, presumably as the result of its association with phage morphogenic components. Since this resistance required the presence of preassembled λ proheads, active λ terminase, hydrolyzable NTPs, and, in a purified system, could lead to the formation of viable phage after the DNase I treatment, we believe that it arises as the result of translocation of DNA into the λ proheads. The amount of DNA protected was at least 100-fold higher than expected from the number of PFUs observed (Table 2), suggesting that either the viability of the large number of filled proheads was lost at some subsequent morphogenic step (perhaps addition of the tails), or that the majority of DNA translocated into proheads was in some way inviable to begin with (for example, damaged ssDNA overhangs). Translocation activity was not detected with extracts that lacked gpB or gpNu3, which is consistent with previously reported observations that these mutants cannot synthesize λ preconnectors (Georgopoulos et al., 1983). It was also absent in gpE− extracts, which lack the prohead shell, but do make the BC-preconnectors (Georgopoulos et al., 1983). Interestingly, a significant amount of translocation activity was detected with gpC− extracts (Fig. 1, Table 2), which have been reported to make inviable prohead-like structures containing gpE, gpB, and gpB∗, and partially filled with gpNu3 (Georgopoulos et al., 1983). Therefore, the element of the connector composed of gpB (and/or its derivative, gpB∗) appears to be sufficient for interaction with the terminase during DNA translocation. Next, we demonstrated that purified λ proheads could be used successfully in the place of sonicates of induced lysogens. Under HS conditions, terminase and proheads were both necessary and sufficient for the translocase activity to occur (Fig. 2). Translocase was fully active in the presence of RNase, making it unlikely that RNA molecules play an important role in this process in λ, as they do in λ29 (Guo et al., 1987). Translocation also occurred under RS conditions, although much less efficiently. In the presence of IHF, however, the reaction yields under RS conditions equaled or even surpassed those obtained under HS. Both sets of conditions could be used to assemble mature heads in a two-stage in vitro packaging assay (Table 2), indicating that spermidine was not essential to the translocation process itself, but probably acted to facilitate the formation of the DNA•terminase complexes. Presumably, IHF acts in a similar fashion, its binding to the high affinity site in cosB enhancing gpNu1-mediated terminase interactions with that region, as has been demonstrated in vitro for gpNu1 (Shinder and Gold, 1989). The stimulatory effect was not cumulative, i.e. no additional stimulation occurred if IHF was added to the translocase reactions under HS conditions. A similar observation was made on the effects of spermidine and IHF on the in vitro endonuclease activity of terminase (Rubinchik et al., 1994a). When the products of the translocase assay were denatured in the presence of SDS, the released DNA migrated through the 0.7% agarose gel as a single band with mobility similar to that of mature λ. This implies that most of the length of input DNA was packaged into purified proheads. However, when assayed as a substrate for subsequent production of viable phage in a two-stage in vitro packaging assay, the translocase products were found to be sensitive to DNase I treatment (Table 2), suggesting that the entire λ genome could not be packaged into the prohead in the absence of gpD, in agreement with published results obtained in vivo (Sternberg and Weisberg, 1977). Adding gpD and gpW to the translocation assay prior to the addition of DNase I did indeed render the reaction products almost completely insensitive to degradation, as witness the number of PFUs generated (Table 2). These observations are consistent with the previously described roles for gpD and gpW as proteins required to ensure the packaging of the entire λ genome and the stabilization of the mature λ head (Perucchetti et al., 1988). We have investigated the specificity of the in vitro translocase activity of terminase by utilizing a number of nucleic acids as substrates. Neither supercoiled DNA, ssDNA, nor RNA molecules could be translocated under any conditions tested (Table 3). Under RS conditions and in the presence of IHF, the DNA molecules that contained the λ chromosome left end cosB site were specifically and preferentially translocated (Fig. 3, Table 3). Under HS conditions, however, all linear dsDNA molecules could be translocated, irrespective of origin, composition, or the nature of their termini. Such promiscuous translocase activity in vitro has been previously described in a number of other bacteriophages which utilize DNA elements to ensure specificity of packaging in vivo, such as T3 (Hashimoto and Fujisawa, 1988), T7 (Son and Serwer, 1992), and P22 (Behnisch and Schmieger, 1985). In the case of λ translocation in vitro, the failure of non-linear DNA to serve as a substrate implies that the main requirement is a double-stranded terminus, which apparently can have either 5′ or 3′ ssDNA overhangs or be blunt (Table 3). The presence of the proper mature λ termini must therefore become essential at some step following the initiation of DNA translocation. Experiments with T7 and plasmid DNA have demonstrated that unlike T3, λ cannot infect cells successfully in the absence of the cos site, in agreement with the previous reports that specific interactions of λ tails and the right end of the λ chromosome are necessary for both tail attachment and DNA ejection (Xu and Feiss, 1991) and that both mature termini of the λ chromosome are required for its circularization following its injection into a bacterium. For the λ in vitro translocation system, the loss of DNA specificity was correlated with the presence of spermidine in the reactions (Fig. 3). However, packaging of DNA by λ in vivo is very specific, both in the presence and absence of IHF, with no detectable amounts of non-λ DNA found in purified mature phages. Since bacterial cells can contain high concentrations of spermidine and other polyamines, additional factors must play a role in ensuring the specificity of translocation. We have found that the spermidine-promoted loss of specificity could be overcome by addition of small amounts of dialyzed and RNase-treated E. coli C extract, suggesting that other, as yet unidentified, host factor(s) may be involved in the process and that it or they are likely to be protein in nature (Fig. 4). E. coli C was chosen because it was reported to lack cryptic lambdoid prophage sequences (Murialdo, 1988), which would make it unlikely that the effect on specificity of translocation was due to a background expression of some phage protein. The translocase activity also required a hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate and a divalent metal ion. All four NTPs and dNTPs could be utilized with comparable efficiency, although ATP and CTP generated higher initial rates of translocation. These results are consistent with the previously characterized NTPase activity of terminase and gpA, but differ from that of in vitro packaging, where CTP was 100-fold less efficient than ATP, and GTP was completely inactive (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). The translocase activity of terminase reached 50% of maximum at approximately 60 μm of ATP (Fig. 8), a concentration comparable with the Km values of the helicase and ATPase activities of gpA and terminase, but significantly different from the ATP requirement for in vitro packaging (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ supported translocation equally well, while Zn2+ and Mn2+ were inactive. In vitro packaging has a similar profile with divalent metals, but there Ca2+ is 100-fold less efficient than Mg2+ (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). Similar results were obtained with studies of potential inhibitors, where sodium vanadate inhibited packaging significantly more than it did translocase at comparable concentrations. The comparison of activity profiles of in vitro packaging and translocase with nucleotides, metals, and inhibitors supports a previously proposed hypothesis that there is some other step(s) in phage morphogenesis that occurs during in vitro packaging that has a more stringent requirement for ATP and Mg2+, and is more sensitive to inhibition, than the translocase activity (Rubinchik et al., 1994b). This step could involve the activities of gpW, gpFII, or tails. Previously, we have reported that purified λ terminase subunits gpNu1 and gpA could be combined to generate in vitro endonuclease, ATPase, and packaging activities resembling those of the terminase holoenzyme (Parris et al., 1994; Rubinchik et al., 1994a, 1994b). A similar result was obtained for the translocase activity. The mixture of the two subunits was less active than the holoenzyme on a molar basis (Fig. 5) but had essentially the same activity parameters with respect to nucleotides, metals, and inhibitors. Unlike terminase, a gpA-gpNu1 mixture was inactive under HS conditions, as was previously reported for its endonuclease activity (Rubinchik et al., 1994a). In both cases, inactivation was correlated primarily with the presence of NaCl in the reaction. The optimal gpNu1 to gpA molar ratio for the translocase activity was between 3 and 4 (Fig. 9), which is higher than the previously reported ratio for the endonuclease activity (between 1 and 2, Rubinchik et al., 1994a). It is possible that translocation of DNA requires a higher degree of occupancy of R sites or another gpNu1 function not related to its DNA binding activity. An intriguing possibility is that the number of gpNu1 molecules associated with each gpA within the terminase protomer actually varies depending on the function being performed, with more gpNu1 being “recruited” as needed. Such an arrangement would be consistent with the non-integer gpNu1/gpA ratios that were previously reported for purified terminase (Gold and Becker, 1983; Tomka and Catalano, 1993a; Parris et al., 1994). Not only the initial reaction rates, but also the final yields of the translocase activity were directly proportional to the reaction concentrations of terminase (Fig. 6, Table 4). The yields were also proportional to the reaction concentrations of DNA (Fig. 7A) and proheads (Fig. 7B). These observations are consistent with the model where ternary complexes are first assembled, the number of such complexes depending on the final concentrations of individual components, as well as the reaction conditions. Titrations of one of these components with the other two being in excess indicate that only a fraction of each of them appears to be capable of forming translocation-competent complexes. In the case of terminase, the amount of inactive protein may be less than it appears, since the number of terminase protomers required per active translocating complex is unknown and could be quite high. It is also possible that components damaged during purification inhibit the reaction by interacting with their active counterparts to form inactive complexes. Translocation of DNA into proheads appears to proceed at a high initial rate, which gradually slows down (Fig. 6). This reaction rate is an average of the complex population and does not tell us what is happening on the level of the individual translocating complex. Since the in vitro translocation reaction does not appear to be processive with respect to terminase (Fig. 5), it is possible that the terminase complex is unable to dissociate from the filled prohead on its own and requires activity of subsequent morphogenic components, such as gpW, gpFII, or λ tails. We are currently investigating these interactions. Terminase has an in vitro NTPase activity which is independent of the translocation reaction (Gold and Becker, 1983; Tomka and Catalano, 1993b; Rubinchik et al., 1994b), while purified λ proheads have no detectable NTPase of their own. When ATPase of the translocation reaction was measured, it was found to be essentially the same as that of terminase and DNA alone (Table 4). The average rate of ATP hydrolysis was sufficient to account for the calculated average rates of translocation, based on the assumption that 2 bp of DNA could be translocated per ATP molecule hydrolyzed (Guo et al., 1987; Morita et al., 1993)."

F.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14412-14416). There are eight cysteines in the exoplasmic domain of the protein, forming four disulfide bonds in the folded protein. We have constructed double cysteine to alanine mutants for each of the four disulfide bonds and examined the folding and metabolic fate of each of the mutants in transfected 3T3 fibroblasts. We find that mutation of the two cysteines nearest to the transmembrane region (C1) does not prevent proper folding of the protein, whereas mutations of the other three disulfides prevent proper folding of the protein and all of the mutant proteins are degraded in the ER. A normal (∼20%) fraction of the C1 mutant protein exits the endoplasmic reticulum and is processed in the Golgi complex, and it does so at a faster rate compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, the folded form of this mutant protein is more resistant to unfolding by dithiothreitol than the wild-type. The C1 mutant protein is expressed on the cell surface and can form a functional receptor with the H1 subunit with similar binding affinities for natural ligands as that of the wild-type receptor. The same fraction of newly made mutant and wild-type proteins (∼80%) remain in the ER, but the mutant protein is degraded more quickly. Thus, the presence of the C1 disulfide bond in the wild-type receptor both reduces the rate of protein folding and exit to the Golgi and slows the rate of ER degradation of the portion (∼80%) of the receptor that never folds properly. Unfolded forms of the H2b subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor, a galactose-specific C-type lectin, are degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas folded forms of the protein can mature to the cell surface (Wikström, L., and Lodish, H.

This Ca2+-dependent lectin binds to terminal galactose residues on sugar side chains; these ligands are removed from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis via coated pits and degraded in lysosomes(2Ashwell G.

The functional human ASGP receptor is a hetero-oligomer consisting of two types of subunits, H1 and H2, with a minimum stoichiometry of (H1)3(H2)1(5Henis Y.I. Katzir Z. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). H1 and H2 are 60% homologous in amino acid sequence(6Spiess M. Schwartz A.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

The polypeptide chain of each subunit consists of four main domains: a short cytosolic amino-terminal segment, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment that also functions as an uncleaved signal anchor sequence, followed by an exoplasmic “stalk” domain and, at the very carboxyl terminus, the Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain. There are two subtypes of H2: H2a and H2b, which differ only by the presence of five extra amino acids in H2a near the transmembrane region on the exoplasmic side that results from alternative splicing. In HepG2 human hepatoma cells, most of the H2 expressed on the cell surface is H2b(10Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the human receptor, highly homologous ASGP receptors with identical functions have also been cloned and analyzed in rat (11Halberg D.F. Wager R.E. Farrell D.C. Hildreth IV, J.

The ASGP receptor belongs to a family of animal proteins known as the C-type lectins with the characteristic of requiring calcium ions for ligand binding(13Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Within this domain of about 130 amino acids, 18 invariant and 32 conserved residues are found in all members(13Drickamer K. J. Biol.

The important role of disulfide bonds in determining and maintaining tertiary and quaternary structures of secreted proteins and exoplasmic domains of membrane proteins has long been recognized. These proteins form disulfide bonds between cysteine residues due to the more oxidative redox state of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compared to the cytosol(14Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins occurs within the ER and is catalyzed by the ER-resident enzyme protein disulfide isomerase(15Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Intracellular disulfide-bonded folding intermediates of the human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit have been identified(16Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and disulfide-bonded in vivo folding intermediates have also been reported for influenza hemagglutinin(17Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), retinol-binding protein(18Kaji E.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22188-22194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ASGP receptor H1 subunit(19Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikström L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the influenza hemagglutinin have shown that all the disulfide bonds are required for proper folding and protein maturation(20Segal M.S. Bye J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When cells are treated with a reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), which disrupts disulfide bonds, newly made proteins that contain disulfide bonds, e.g. albumin and the ASGP receptor, are retained within the ER, whereas proteins that do not have disulfides are secreted normally in the presence of DTT(21Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of Ca2+ in the ER by treating cells with Ca2+ pump inhibitors or Ca2+ ionophores also blocks exit of the ASGP receptor from the ER and unfolded proteins accumulate(1Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14412-14416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikström L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, proteins that are misfolded or cannot attain a properly folded state in the ER cannot exit this organelle to the Golgi complex and are ultimately degraded in the ER (22Pelham H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 23Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed without H1 in transfected fibroblasts, about 80% of ASGP receptor H2b subunits are degraded in the ER(10Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The unfolded portion of the newly made H2b protein is selectively degraded within the ER, whereas the 20% that is folded matures to the cell surface(1Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14412-14416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we felt it important to analyze further the relationship between folding and degradation of H2b within the ER. In this study, we determine the importance of each of the four disulfide bonds in the folding and degradation of the H2b protein by specifically mutating each pair of cysteine residues and observing the metabolic fate of the mutant proteins in transfected fibroblasts. We find that disruption of three of the disulfide bonds results in the inability of the protein to fold properly, and these cannot exit the ER and are degraded. However, mutation of the two cysteines nearest the transmembrane region (C1 mutation) actually causes the protein to fold faster than the wild-type and the mutant protein exits the ER to the Golgi complex more rapidly than does the wild-type. Furthermore, the C1 H2b mutant will form a functional receptor with H1 and bind a natural ligand with similar affinity to the wild-type receptor.

NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type H2b (2C cells) that had been treated with 0.1 M iodoacetamide and cell surface-iodinated were lysed in detergent and immunoprecipitated by antiserum against the carboxyl terminus of the H2 protein.

Products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing (50 mM DTT) conditions. Four mutations of the H2b protein were made corresponding to the four putative disulfide linkages (C1-C4, see Fig. 1), and each mutant has both cysteines of the disulfide bond mutated to alanine residues. The substitution mutations of H2b were introduced by overlap extension PCR (28Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase for primer extension. The concentrations of reagents and enzymes used in the PCR reactions were according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The double mutations were made sequentially, and all mutations were verified by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase 2.0 kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type H2b (2C cells) were kind gifts of Dr. G. Lederkremer (Tel Aviv University)(10Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells expressing H2 mutants were generated by using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol(29Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using the pMEX-neo mammalian expression vector containing mutant H2 cDNAs subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the multicloning site of the vector. Colonies resistant to G418 were subcloned and tested for expression of H2 protein by metabolic labeling. Wild-type H1 cDNA subcloned into the pCB7 expression vector was similarly transfected into 3T3 cells expressing wild-type or C1 mutant H2b and selected by hygromycin resistance. All 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Confluent or near confluent (80%) cells in 100-mm or 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes were labeled with [35S]cysteine using techniques described previously(24Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Antisera against the carboxyl terminus of the ASGP receptor H2 subunit (8Bischoff J. Libresco S. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Drs. L. Wikström and G. Lederkremer. Immunoprecipitation and Endo H and N-glycanase digestions of cell lysates were done as described previously(24Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 0.75-mm 10% or 12% Laemmli gels and analyzed by autoradiography or fluorography using 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole as described previously (30Bischoff J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11825-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms and fluorograms were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics laser microdensitometer as described previously(31Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14835-14838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence localization of H2b wild-type and cysteine mutant proteins on the cell surface of transfected 3T3 fibroblasts were done as described previously(10Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, live 3T3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant proteins were reacted at 4°C first with a primary rabbit antibody against the carboxyl terminus of the H2 protein followed by a secondary Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol/acetone, and visualized with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. Orosomucoid was desialylated with immobilized neuraminidase (Sigma) and radioiodinated with Iodobeads (Pierce) as described previously(9Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 158-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz A.L. Fridovich S.E. Knowles B.B. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Saturation binding, uptake, and degradation assays were performed as described previously(9Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 158-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz A.L. Fridovich S.E. Knowles B.B. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Binding assays were done with radioligand (specific activity = 107 cpm/μg) concentrations in the range of 20 ng/ml to 5 μg/ml. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled ligand and typically represented less than 10% of the total binding. Degradation products were measured as radioactivity remaining in the culture medium after it was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, oxidized with potassium iodide/hydrogen peroxide, and extracted with chloroform(32Schwartz A.L. Fridovich S.E. Knowles B.B. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8878-8881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the exoplasmic domain of the ASGP receptor H2b subunit contains eight cysteine residues (at positions 157, 171, 172, 185, 200, 275, 287, and 295) that are conserved in man, rat, and mouse. The six cysteines nearest to the carboxyl terminus are conserved in C-type lectins and are predicted to form three disulfide bonds, based on biochemical and crystallographic data obtained on homologous proteins (34Fuhlendorff J. Clemmensen I. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6757-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Giga Y. Ikai A. Takahashi K. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 37Ng N.F. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16069-16075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are Cys172/Cys185, Cys275/Cys287, and Cys200/Cys295 and are labeled here as C2, C3, and C4 disulfides, respectively. The two cysteines nearest to the transmembrane region, Cys157 and Cys171, are not conserved in other C-type lectins. To determine if a disulfide is formed between these two cysteines (referred to as the C1 disulfide), we take advantage of the methionine residue at position 159, between these two cysteines, that is only one of two methionines in the whole molecule, excluding the translation initiation residue site. Met159 is also the only methionine in the exoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). The mature complex glycosylated H2b protein is ∼50 kDa, with a core protein mass of ∼35 kDa and three N-linked sugar side chains adding ∼5 kDa each to the total mass. In the experiment leading to Fig. 2, proteins in H2b-transfected fibroblasts were reacted with iodoacetamide to block free sulfhydryl groups and then radioiodinated with the membrane-impermeable Bolton-Hunter reagent (sulfo-SHPP). The cells were then dissolved in detergent and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum against the carboxyl terminus of the H2 protein. We chose to analyze only the mature, cell surface form of the H2b protein to avoid ambiguities that can arise in the intracellular forms, which may not be fully folded or are misfolded with non-native disulfides. If there is a C1 disulfide bond, on digestion of the immunoprecipitated mature cell surface H2b protein by cyanogen bromide, which specifically cleaves after methionine residues, a ∼27-kDa fragment (with two N-linked sugar side chains) and a ∼17-kDa fragment (with one N-linked sugar side chain), should be detected only in reducing conditions but not under non-reducing conditions. Fig. 2 shows the 50-kDa full-length complex glycosylated H2b expressed on the cell surface of stably transfected 3T3 fibroblasts analyzed under non-reducing (lane1) and reducing (lane3) conditions. After digestion with cyanogen bromide, a portion of the 50-kDa protein is decreased in size to about 44 kDa due to cleavage at Met56 but no smaller fragments were observed under non-reducing conditions (lane2). However, under reducing conditions, a ∼27-kDa fragment (which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal fragment with two N-linked sugar side chains) and a ∼17-kDa fragment (which corresponds to the amino-terminal fragment with one N-linked sugar side chain) were observed (lane4). These were not observed under non-reducing conditions (lane2). These observations strongly suggest that there is a reducible intrachain disulfide linking Cys157 and Cys171. It is possible that the C1 disulfide bond is actually between Cys157 and Cys172, whereas the C2 disulfide is between Cys171 and Cys185, but the main conclusion is that Cys157 is disulfide-bonded. In summary, the intrachain disulfides of the H2b protein are presumed to be: Cys157/Cys171 (C1), Cys172/Cys185 (C2), Cys275/Cys287 (C3), and Cys200/Cys295 (C4). To examine the importance of each of the four intrachain disulfides in the H2b protein, we constructed double cysteine to alanine mutants, which individually disrupted each of the disulfide bonds (C1-C4 mutants) and studied the metabolic fate and folding of each of the mutants in stably transfected 3T3 fibroblasts. Fig. 3(lanes1, 7, 13, 19, and 25) show that on pulse labeling with [35S]cysteine, the wild-type and C1-C4 mutants of H2b are all synthesized as a 43-kDa precursor (openarrow), which can be deglycosylated to a 35-kDa core protein with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). Lanes2-6 show that in the subsequent chase period, a fraction of the wild-type precursor is converted to a 50-kDa mature form (solidarrow), which is resistant to Endo H (data not shown). Densitometric scans of this pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 4a) shows that about 20% of the wild-type precursor becomes complex glycosylated (i.e. Endo H-resistant). This Golgi processing proceeds with a half-time of about 90 min with most of the mature forms appearing by 3 h. After an initial lag of 60 min, ∼80% of the Endo H-sensitive forms of H2b are degraded with a half-life about 60 min, consistent with previous reports(1Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14412-14416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3(lanes 8-12) shows that a fraction of the C1 mutant precursor is also converted to the 50-kDa mature form that is Endo H-resistant (data not shown). Furthermore, densitometric scans (Fig. 4b) shows that although the fraction of the C1 mutant precursor that attains complex glycosylation is similar to the wild-type (∼20%), the Golgi-processed forms appear much faster than the wild-type. Substantial amounts of the complex glycosylated form of the C1 mutant protein has already appeared by 30 min, and the maximum level is reached by 60 min. The Endo H-sensitive form of the C1 mutant also disappears much faster than that of the wild-type, with a half-life of less than 30 min.Figure 4:Kinetics of ER degradation and Golgi processing of H2b wild-type and cysteine mutant proteins in transfected 3T3 fibroblasts. The 43-kDa high mannose precursors and 50-kDa complex glycosylated forms of the H2b wild-type or mutant proteins in the fluorograms from Fig. 2 were quantitated by scanning densitometry, normalized to amount of precursor after each pulse, and plotted against time of chase. Panel a, rate of loss of high mannose forms and appearance of complex glycosylated forms of wild-type protein. Panel b, rate of loss of high mannose forms and appearance of complex glycosylated forms of C1 mutant protein. Panel c, rate of loss of high mannose forms of C4 mutant protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3(lanes 14-18, 20-24, and 26-30) shows that the C2, C3 and C4 mutants do not form any detectable complex glycosylated mature forms. All the pulse-labeled proteins remain as 43-kDa forms (Endo H-sensitive, data not shown). A ∼55-kDa polypeptide that appears in all lanes is unlikely to be a processed form of the mutant H2b receptor, since it is present in the pulse-labeled samples and its mobility is not affected by N-glycanase digestion (data not shown). We do not know the identity of this co-immunoprecipitated protein. The immunoprecipitated 35-kDa polypeptide that appears in the chase periods comprises the carboxyl terminus of the H2b protein; it is produced by a proteolytic cleavage in the exoplasmic domain near the membrane-spanning region (24Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We consistently observe that more of this fragment is produced in cells expressing the C2, C3, and C4 mutants, consistent with the finding that no detectable fraction of these proteins matures out of the ER. Fig. 4c shows that the kinetics of degradation of the Endo H-sensitive form of the C4 mutant is similar to that of the wild-type. Similar densitometric scans show that the C2 and C3 mutants also have similar kinetics of degradation compared to the wild-type H2b (data not shown). On non-reducing SDS-PAGE, less compact forms of a protein should experience more hydrodynamic resistance, and thereby migrate more slowly than more compact forms of the same protein. Formation of disulfide bonds in a protein should allow it to attain more compact forms and migrate faster under non-reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE than non-compact forms without disulfide bonds. Previous studies on folding of the ASGP receptor subunits showed folding intermediates that were separable by non-reducing SDS-PAGE(1Wikström L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14412-14416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikström L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5(lanes1 and 2) shows that, as judged by their differences in mobility on non-reducing SDS-PAGE, pulse-labeled H2b wild-type and C1 mutant proteins have a less compact and presumably unfolded structure (shadedarrow) but that they attain a more compact structure (lanes6 and 7, stripedarrow) after a 30-min chase period. However, if the cells are treated with 5 mM DTT for another 5 min at the end of the 30-min chase, a fraction of the wild-type H2b protein is “unfolded” to a less compact form (lane11), while almost all of the C1 mutant protein remains as the more compact species (lane12). Lanes 3-5 show that the C2, C3, and C4 mutants are also synthesized as less compact unfolded forms, similar to the wild-type (lane1, shadedarrow). After 30 min, the C2 and C4 mutants (lanes8 and 10) also attain a more compact or more folded form (stripedarrow) similar to the wild-type (lane6). However, most of the C3 mutant remains as the less compact unfolded form after 30 min (lane9). On treatment with 5 mM DTT, only a fraction of the wild-type is unfolded to the less compact form (lane11) but all of the C2, C3 and C4 proteins are unfolded to the less compact form (lanes 13-15). On reducing SDS-PAGE, all the bands migrate to the same positions (data not shown) and therefore results under non-reducing conditions reflect differential oxidative isoforms of the proteins. Experiments in which longer chase times were done (up to 3 h) showed identical results concerning the relative mobilities and DTT sensitivities of the wild-type and mutant proteins (data not shown). We conclude that the C2, C3, and C4 disulfides are required for proper folding of the protein. If any of these disu"
