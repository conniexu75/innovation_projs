https://openalex.org/W2091368852,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced calcium release from intracellular stores is a regulator of cytosolic-free calcium levels. The subsecond kinetics and regulation of IP3-induced calcium-45 release from synaptosome-derived microsomal vesicles were resolved by rapid superfusion. Extravesicular calcium acted as a coagonist, potentiating the transient IP3-induced release of calcium-45. Thus, rapid elevation of cytosolic calcium levels may trigger IP3-induced calcium release in vivo. Extravesicular calcium also produced a more slowly developing, reversible inhibition of IP3-induced calcium-45 release. Sequential positive and negative feedback regulation by calcium of IP3-induced calcium release may contribute to transients and oscillations of cytosolic-free calcium in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1980401440,"The respiratory epithelium is a potential site for somatic gene therapy for the common hereditary disorders alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency and cystic fibrosis. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector (Ad-alpha 1AT) containing an adenovirus major late promoter and a recombinant human alpha 1AT gene was used to infect epithelial cells of the cotton rat respiratory tract in vitro and in vivo. Freshly isolated tracheobronchial epithelial cells infected with Ad-alpha 1AT contained human alpha 1AT messenger RNA transcripts and synthesized and secreted human alpha 1AT. After in vivo intratracheal administration of Ad-alpha 1AT to these rats, human alpha 1AT messenger RNA was observed in the respiratory epithelium, human alpha 1AT was synthesized and secreted by lung tissue, and human alpha 1AT was detected in the epithelial lining fluid for at least 1 week."
https://openalex.org/W2012691080,"Integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (platelet GPIIb-IIIa) binds fibrinogen via recognition sequences such as Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Fibrinogen binding requires agonist activation of platelets, whereas the binding of short synthetic RGD peptides does not. We now find that RGD peptide binding leads to changes in alpha IIb beta 3 that are associated with acquisition of high affinity fibrinogen-binding function (activation) and subsequent platelet aggregation. The structural specificities for peptide activation and for inhibition of ligand binding are similar, indicating that both are consequences of occupancy of the same site(s) on alpha IIb beta 3. Thus, the RGD sequence is a trigger of high affinity ligand binding to alpha IIb beta 3, and certain RGD-mimetics are partial agonists as well as competitive antagonists of integrin function."
https://openalex.org/W1493020617,"Human blood coagulation factor XI was activated by either autoactivation or thrombin. These reactions occurred only in the presence of negatively charged materials, such as dextran sulfate (∼ Mr 500,000), sulfatide, and heparin. During the activation, factor XI was cleaved at a single Arg-Ile bond by thrombin or factor XIa to produce an amino-terminal 50-kDa heavy chain and a carboxyl-terminal 35-kDa light chain. This activation pattern is identical to that produced by factor XIIa. The addition of a small amount of thrombin and sulfatide to factor XII-deficient plasma produced shorter clotting times than when these agents were added to factor XI/factor XII combined-deficient plasma. These results suggest that the activation of factor XI by thrombin and possibly the autoactivation of factor XI proceed in plasma to lead fibrin clot formation. These reactions may have a role on an appropriate negatively charged surface in normal hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1525292585,"The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin serves as either a specific cell surface receptor for collagen or as both a collagen and laminin receptor depending upon the cell type. Recently we established that the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin binds to a site within the alpha 1 (I)-CB3 fragment of type I collagen (Staatz, W. D., Walsh, J. J., Pexton, T., and Santoro, S. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4778-4781). To define the alpha 2 beta 1 recognition sequence further we have prepared an overlapping set of synthetic peptides which completely spans the 148-amino acid alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment and tested the peptides for ability to inhibit cell adhesion to collagen and laminin substrates. The minimal active recognition sequence defined by these experiments is a tetrapeptide of the sequence Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA) corresponding to residues 435-438 of the type I collagen sequence. The DGEA-containing peptides effectively inhibited alpha 2 beta 1-mediated Mg2(+)-dependent adhesion of platelets, which use the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin as a collagen-specific receptor, to collagen but had no effect on alpha 5 beta 1-mediated platelet adhesion to fibronectin or alpha 6 beta 1-mediated platelet adhesion to laminin. In contrast, with T47D breast adenocarcinoma cells, which use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen/lamin receptor, adhesion to both collagen and laminin was inhibited by DGEA-containing peptides. Deletion of the alanine residue or substitution of alanine for either the glutamic or aspartic acid residues in DGEA-containing peptides resulted in marked loss of inhibitory activity. These results indicate that the amino acid sequence DGEA serves as a recognition site for the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin complex on platelets and other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111986594,"Hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is assumed to be a regulatory event leading to the inactivation of its growth-repressing functions. We demonstrate a functional alteration linked to the phosphorylation status of the protein. The un- or under-phosphorylated species are tightly associated with the nuclear structure. The association is resistant to digestion with nucleases, and release requires elevated salt concentrations. In contrast, the hyperphosphorylated species are eluted under hypotonic buffer conditions. The conversion from low salt-resistant to low salt-extractable pRB occurs with transition through the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle and thus parallels the reported onset of pRB phosphorylation. The ability to form a tight nuclear association is impaired in several naturally occurring pRB mutants, all of which show alterations within the binding region for viral oncoproteins. We suggest that the tight nuclear interaction is essential for the growth-regulating functions of pRB and may be preempted by viral oncoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035766144,"A link is found between T wave alternans and vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation, and a new approach is provided for quantification of susceptibility to malignant arrhythmias. Complex demodulation reveals that alternation of the electrocardiogram is concentrated during the first half of the T wave, coinciding with the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, there are marked increases in the degree of T wave alternans that parallel the established time course of changes in vulnerability. The influence of the sympathetic nervous system in arrhythmogenesis is also accurately detected. Ultimately, complex demodulation of the electrocardiogram could provide a technique for identification and management of individuals at risk for sudden cardiac death."
https://openalex.org/W1483156553,"Reaction of protein amino groups with glucose (the Maillard reaction) leads from early stage products such as Schiff base and Amadori products to advanced glycation end products (AGE), structures implicated in diabetic complications and the aging process. We have prepared the polyclonal anti-AGE antibody and the monoclonal anti-AGE antibody against AGE-bovine serum albumin and made an immunochemical approach to characterize AGE structures. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies reacted with AGE-proteins such as AGE-bovine serum albumin, AGE-human serum albumin, and AGE-hemoglobin but not with unmodified counterparts. Treatments of these AGE-proteins with borohydride had no effect on the immunoreactivity. Moreover, fructosyl-epsilon-caproic acid, a synthetic Amadori compound, did not serve as an antigen, indicating that these antibodies were specific for AGE products but not for early stage products of the Maillard reaction. In addition, these antibodies were also able to recognize AGE products prepared either from α-tosyl-1-lysine, α-tosyl-1-lysine methyl ester, monoaminocarboxylic acid such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid, γ-amino-n-butyric acid, and β-alanine. Thus, these results strongly suggest the presence of a common structure in AGE preparations, regardless of whether AGE products are generated from proteins, amino acids, or monoaminocarboxylic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2166613737,"The mechanism that causes large regions of eukaryotic chromosomes to remain unreplicated until late in S phase is not understood. We have found that 67 kb of telomere-adjacent DNA at the right end of chromosome V in S. cerevisiae is replicated late in S phase. An ARS element in this region, ARS501, was shown by two-dimensional gel analysis to be an active origin of replication. Kinetic analyses indicate that the rate of replication fork movement within this late region is similar to that in early replicating regions. Therefore, the delayed replication of the region is a consequence of late origin activation. The results also support the idea that the pattern of interspersed early and late replication along the chromosomes of higher eukaryotes is a consequence of the temporal regulation of origin activation."
https://openalex.org/W1523954091,"Yeast DNA coding for nucleosome assembly protein I (NAP-I), which facilitates nucleosome assembly in vitro at physiological ionic conditions, was cloned and its gene product was characterized. A monoclonal antibody against NAP-I (58 kDa) from human HeLa cells was used to screen a genomic library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae constructed into lambda gt11. A 60-kDa protein was detected by immunoblotting in the extracts of Escherichia coli lysogenized with a positive clone. The 60-kDa protein purified from the extracts had an activity equivalent to that of NAP-I from mouse and human cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the gene coding for the yeast NAP-I defines a polypeptide of molecular mass 47,848 Da with three negatively charged regions. While the two regions contain 8 and 10 acidic amino acids out of 13 amino acid residues, the longest stretch has 15 glutamic and 13 aspartic acids out of 38 residues. These regions are probably involved in the interaction with histones. Proteins recognized by the anti-NAP-I antibody were also present in Xenopus oocytes and Drosophila cultured cells. Possible roles of NAP-I are discussed in relation to other nucleosome assembly proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1490420782,"To quantify intrahepatic Krebs cycle metabolism, phenyl acetate, excreted in urine as a glutamine conjugate, was given to healthy subjects infused with [3-14C]lactate. They were studied after 60 h of fasting and when given glucose after an overnight fast. Distributions of 14C in glutamate from urinary phenylacetylglutamine and blood glucose were determined. Corrections to the distributions because of the fixation of 14CO2 formed from the [3-14C]lactate were determined by administering [14C]bicarbonate. Comparisons of distributions in glucose and glutamate support the assumption that the glutamate distributions reflect those in hepatic alpha-ketoglutarate. From the distributions in glutamate, the extent of exchange of labeled with unlabeled carbons and relative flow rates in the cycle in liver were estimated. Dilution of 14C by 12C in the cycle was found in the fasted but not the fed state. In the fasted state, pyruvate carboxylation was estimated to be at least twice the rate of Krebs cycle flux and the rate of pyruvate's decarboxylation less than 1/25 the rate of its carboxylation. In the fed state, the rate of decarboxylation was estimated to be between one-sixth and one-half the rate of carboxylation. The rate of conversion of oxalacetate to fumarate in both states appeared to be greater than 6 times the rate of Krebs cycle flux."
https://openalex.org/W1528896526,"We have used three methods to study the formation and repair of intrastrand adducts and interstrand cross-links in the DNA of Chinese hamster ovary cells induced by the anticancer drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin). Using atomic absorption spectroscopy, we found that 21% of the total genomic cisplatin adducts were removed at 8 h and 42% at 24 h. We used ABC excinuclease digestion, coupled with out previously reported methodology to quantify DNA in specific genomic regions. These adducts were removed faster in the transcribed dihydrofolate reductase and c-myc genes compared to a noncoding fragment, a region containing the little or nontranscribed c-fos oncogene, and to the overall genome. Interstrand cross-links in specific sequences were quantified by Southern hybridization of denatured-renatured DNA separated on a neutral gel. We found that cross-links were removed more efficiently from the gene regions than intrastrand adducts and, at high levels of cross-linking, removal was similar from transcribed and from nontranscribed regions."
https://openalex.org/W1522002051,"We have expressed in Escherichia coli a cDNA encoding rabbit liver cytochrome P-450IIE1, the ethanol-inducible P-450. The expressed P-450 is located primarily in the bacterial inner cell membrane and comprises 3% of the E. coli total membrane protein. The partially purified cytochrome exhibits a reduced CO difference spectrum with a maximum at 452 nm, characteristic of P-450IIE1, and solubilized membranes or partially purified P-450 preparations reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and phosphatidylcholine catalyze the deethylation of N-nitrosodiethylamine with a turnover number equal to that of purified liver P-450IIE1 (approximately 4.5 nmol/min/nmol of P-450). A modified IIE1 cDNA that encodes a protein lacking amino acids 3-29, a proposed membrane anchor for cytochrome P-450, was also expressed in E. coli and, unexpectedly, the shortened protein was also found to be predominantly located in the bacterial inner membrane rather than the cytosol. Like the full-length protein, this truncated cytochrome has a reduced CO difference spectrum characteristic of P-450IIE1 and is fully active in the deethylation of N-nitrosodiethylamine. These results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal hydrophobic segment is not solely responsible for attachment to the membrane and evidently is not required for proper protein folding or catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1590978853,"A431 cells express high numbers of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and produce a ligand for these receptors, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). We have obtained evidence that the EGF receptors on these cells may be activated through an autocrine pathway by ligand and have investigated whether activation of phosphorylation of the receptor by the endogenously produced TGF-alpha occurs intracellularly or at the cell surface. When A431 cells were cultured under serum-free conditions, in the absence of exogenous ligand, EGF receptors were found to have a basal level of phosphorylation. When cells were labeled by culturing with 32Pi in the continuous presence of monoclonal antibodies that block binding of TGF-alpha to the EGF receptor, phosphorylation decreased to 30 +/- 10% of the basal level. This reduction could not be accounted for by the decrease in receptor content attributable to down-regulation and catabolism of EGF receptors that resulted from the binding of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies. The reduction in receptor phosphorylation mediated by antibody was accompanied by the accumulation of increased levels of secreted TGF-alpha species in the culture medium. We also pulse-labeled A431 cells for 15 min with [35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated the cell lysate with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after various chase periods. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor became detectable after 40 min of chase and reached a maximum after 4-6 h; these times are in agreement with the intervals required for EGF receptors to reach the cell surface after synthesis and then to achieve maximal expression. In addition, only the 170-kDa, mature EGF receptor species, and not the 160-kDa intracellular precursor, was immunoprecipitated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results of these pulse-chase experiments and the finding that anti-receptor monoclonal antibody can block receptor phosphorylation suggest that activation of EGF receptors can result from the binding of an endogenous ligand (presumably TGF-alpha), which occurs at the cell surface and not during receptor biosynthesis and intracellular processing."
https://openalex.org/W1511180136,"We have studied transferrin receptor expression in MRC5 human fibroblasts in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF, cachectin) or interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1). Treatment of exponentially growing MRC5 cells with these cytokines led to a 3-4-fold increase in transferrin receptor mRNA and a coordinate increase in transferrin receptor protein by 24 h. Under these conditions, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation was minimal, suggesting that the induction of transferrin receptor by TNF and IL-1 is mediated by a growth-independent regulatory mechanism. A study of the time course of this response showed that cytokine-mediated increases in transferrin receptor mRNA and protein proceeded after a lag of 12-24 h. A simultaneous analysis of the effects of TNF and IL-1 on ferritin in MRC5 cells was also performed. Ferritin L mRNA levels were unchanged. However, induction of ferritin H mRNA was seen within 4 h, preceding the induction of the transferrin receptor. The synthesis of ferritin H (but not ferritin L) protein peaked at 8 h after TNF or IL-1 treatment, followed by a rapid decrease in both ferritin H and L protein synthesis. As ferritin H synthesis declined, levels of transferrin receptor protein increased, reaching a maximum by 24 h. These results suggest that the cytokine-dependent induction of ferritin H and subsequent increase in the transferrin receptor are related and possibly interdependent events. This study demonstrates that the complex role of TNF and IL-1 in iron homeostasis includes modulation of the transferrin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1965219069,"For self-splicing of Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA precursor, guanosine binding is required for 5′ splice-site cleavage and exon ligation. Whether these two reactions use the same or different guanosine-binding sites has been debated. A double mutation in a previously identified guanosine-binding site within the intron resulted in preference for adenosine (or adenosine triphosphate) as the substrate for cleavage at the 5′ splice site. However, splicing was blocked in the exon ligation step. Blockage was reversed by a change from guanine to adenine at the 3′ splice site. These results indicate that a single determinant specifies nucleoside binding for both steps of splicing. Furthermore, it suggests that RNA could form an active site specific for adenosine triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1559380160,"Abstract The disassembly of vimentin-containing intermediate filament (IF) networks during mitosis in BHK-21 cells is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of vimentin (Chou, Y.-H., Rosevear, E., and Goldman, R. D. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 1885-1889). We have recently identified p34cdc2 as the catalytic subunit of one of the two endogenous vimentin kinases in mitotic baby hamster kidney cells (Chou, Y.-H., Bischoff, J. R., Beach, D., and Goldman, R. D. (1990) Cell 62, 1063-1071). To begin to characterize the biochemical basis of the p34cdc2-mediated IF disassembly process, we have purified and sequenced the 32P-labeled tryptic peptides derived from in vitro-phosphorylated vimentin. The results demonstrate that Ser-55, in the N-terminal non-alpha-helical domain of vimentin, is the most favored phosphorylation site. This finding supports the idea that the N-terminal domain of type III IF protein plays a crucial role in regulating IF structure and supramolecular organization."

https://openalex.org/W1572846506,"To examine the fate of the carbons of acetate and to evaluate the usefulness of labeled acetate in assessing intrahepatic metabolic processes during gluconeogenesis, [2-14C]acetate, [2-14C]ethanol, and [1-14C]ethanol were infused into normal subjects fasted 60 h and given phenyl acetate. Distributions of 14C in the carbons of blood glucose and glutamate from urinary phenylacetylglutamine were determined. With [2-14C]acetate and [2-14C]ethanol, carbon 1 of glucose had about twice as much 14C as carbon 3. Carbon 2 of glutamate had about twice as much 14C as carbon 1 and one-half to one-third as much as carbon 4. There was only a small amount in carbon 5. These distributions are incompatible with the metabolism of [2-14C]acetate being primarily in liver. Therefore, [2-14C]acetate cannot be used to study Krebs cycle metabolism in liver and in relationship to gluconeogenesis, as has been done. The distributions can be explained by: (a) fixation of 14CO2 from [2-14C]acetate in the formation of the 14C-labeled glucose and glutamate in liver and (b) the formation of 14C-labeled glutamate in a second site, proposed to be muscle. [1,3-14C]Acetone formation from the [2-14C]acetate does not contribute to the distributions, as evidenced by the absence of 14C in carbons 2-4 of glutamate after [1-14C]ethanol administration."
https://openalex.org/W1548056598,"The biosynthesis and proteolytic processing of type XI procollagen was examined using pulse-chase labelling of 17-day embryonic chick sterna in organ culture with [3H]proline. Products of biosynthesis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with and without prior reduction of disulfide bonds. Pro-alpha chains, intermediates, and matrix forms were identified by cyanogen bromide or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion. The results show that type XI pro-alpha chains assemble into trimeric molecules with interchain disulfide bonds. Proteolytic processing begins at least 40 min after the start of labeling which is later than that of type II procollagen (25 min). This first processing step involves the loss of the domain containing the interchain disulfide bonds which most likely is the carboxyl propeptide. In the case of the pro-alpha 3 chain, this generates the matrix form, m alpha 3, which retains its amino propeptide. For the pro-alpha 1 and pro-alpha 2 chains, this step generates intermediate forms, p alpha 1 and p alpha 2, which undergo a second proteolytic conversion to m alpha 1 and m alpha 2, and yet retain a pepsin-labile domain. The conversion of p alpha 2 to m alpha 2 is largely complete 2 h after labeling. p alpha 1 is converted to m alpha 1 very slowly and is 50% complete after 18 h of chase in organ culture. The apparent proteolytic processing within the amino propeptide, and the differential rate of processing between two chains in the same molecule are unusual and distinguish type XI from collagen types I, II, and III. It is possible that the extremely slow processing of p alpha 1 affects the formation of the heterotypic cartilage collagen fibrils and may be related to the function of type XI collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1502146046,"The two interleukin 1 (IL-1) genes (IL-1 alpha and beta) encode 31-kDa precursor molecules, which are cleaved upon secretion to generate the mature, active, carboxyl-terminal 17-kDa proteins. The IL-1 beta precursor is inactive, whereas the IL-1 alpha precursor is as active as the mature IL-1 alpha. In this report, we demonstrate that when either of the recombinant precursors is processed to the mature form, the mature region undergoes a conformational change from a proteinase K-sensitive structure to one that is proteinase K-insensitive. In addition, cysteine residues that are exposed to solvent in the IL-1 beta precursor become buried in the mature protein. Limited structure-activity mapping of the IL-1 beta precursor indicates that the amino-terminal 76 residues are responsible for the conformational change, whereas the most dramatic change in biological activity occurs after further removal of residues 77-94. These findings suggest that the altered structure of the mature region in precursor IL-1s has been conserved for some function. Denaturation/renaturation experiments implicate the precursor domain in protein folding, and by analogy with signal-directed secretory proteins, the unique conformation of the precursors may play a role in IL-1 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1595565889,"Expression of the rat insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene results in a number of mature mRNA species that differ in size primarily at the 3' end due to differential polyadenylation site usage. Additionally, alternate splicing in both 5' and 3' regions produces RNAs which have the capacity to encode different IGF-I precursor peptides. We have analyzed total and polysomal RNAs using Northern blot analyses and solution hybridization/RNase protection assays to assess the in vivo translatability of these various IGF-I mRNA species. The results suggest that all of the known splicing variants are found on polysomes and may, therefore, be translated into a number of IGF-I precursors in vivo. One particular 5'-untranslated (UTR) variant is relatively enriched in polysomal RNA, a finding which suggests that removal of some of the 5'-UTR sequences encoded by exon 1 may enhance translatability. Of the IGF-I mRNAs with different lengths of 3'-UTR, only the shorter species were found on polysomes, suggesting that some aspect of the long 3'-UTR may prevent translation. Thus, differential processing of the primary transcript of the IGF-I gene may serve to generate IGF-I mRNA species which specify different precursors as well as to control their relative translatability."
https://openalex.org/W1533865850,"Sialuria is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by excessive synthesis of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc). Fibroblasts cultured from the three known cases of sialuria contained 70-200-fold increases in soluble sialic acid, but normal concentrations of bound sialic acid. The sialic acid appeared in the cytosolic fraction of the cells on differential centrifugation, and was susceptible to borohydride reduction, suggesting that accumulated sialic acid was in the form of NeuAc and not CMP-NeuAc. In biochemical studies, CMP-NeuAc (50 microM) inhibited the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2-epimerase of normal fibroblasts by 84-100%, but inhibited the epimerase from sialuria cells by only 19-31%. Feeding sialuria cells up to 5 mM D-glucosamine for 72 h increased free sialic acid content 20-60%, but normal cells were unaffected by this treatment. Cytidine feeding (5 mM, 72 h) reduced the NeuAc content of sialuria cells, initially 112, 104, and 266 nmol/mg protein, by 63-71 nmol/mg protein; CMP-NeuAc concentrations, initially 4, 2, and 5 nmol/mg protein, increased by 14-33 nmol/mg protein. Consequently, the total cellular content of soluble sialic acid (NeuAc + CMP-NeuAc) was lowered 14-46% by cytidine feeding. The inheritance pattern of sialuria has not been determined. However, cells from both parents of one sialuria patient contained normal concentrations of free sialic acid, and the parental epimerase activity also responded normally to CMP-NeuAc. We conclude that the basic biochemical defect in all known cases of sialuria is a failure of CMP-NeuAc to feedback-inhibit UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and cytidine feeding can lower the intracellular soluble sialic acid concentration of sialuria cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507553352,"Abstract Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to monitor aggregation kinetics of the thiol-activated cytolysin (perfringolysin O (PFO) or theta-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens on erythrocyte membranes. PFO was labeled with the isothiocyanate derivatives of either fluorescein or tetramethylrhodamine. No detectable change in the hemolytic activity of PFO was detected after modification with either fluorophore at a ratio of 1:2 fluorophore molecules/cytolysin molecule. Fluorescence energy transfer (FET) between the donor (fluorescein.PFO or PFOD) and the acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine.PFO or PFOA) was detected by both quenching of donor fluorescence (520 nm) and by enhancement of acceptor fluorescence (575 nm) upon aggregation of labeled cytolysin molecules. FET was only observed when PFOD and PFOA were incubated in the presence of membranes. FET was not observed when PFOD and PFOA were incubated in a membrane-free solution or when unlabeled toxin was substituted for PFOA. FET was also found to be temperature-dependent. The temperature-dependent rates of change in FET upon mixing labeled toxin with erythrocyte membranes proceeded without a lag phase and displayed an activation energy of 18.7 kcal/mol. At all temperatures aggregation of PFO was virtually complete before the onset of hemolysis, the latter exhibiting a distinct lag phase. The lag period before onset of hemolysis was temperature-dependent and exhibited an activation energy of 23.2 kcal/mol. These results suggest that the aggregation of membrane-associated PFO is necessary to initiate the hemolytic process, and the lag phase which occurs before onset of hemolysis reflects the kinetics of PFO monomer to polymer conversion."
https://openalex.org/W1498362729,"Treatment of cultured rat hepatocytes with certain amino acids stimulates the activity of the System N transporter. The present report investigates the mechanism by which the stimulatory amino acids elicit their effect. Activation of System N-mediated transport by amino acids is rapid, cycloheximide-insensitive, and involves neither trans-stimulation nor recruitment of additional carriers to the plasma membrane. In addition, the activation is Na(+)-dependent, supporting the related observation that the most effective stimulatory amino acids are substrates of Na(+)-dependent transport Systems A, ASC, and N whereas substrates of Na(+)-independent System L and non-amino acid metabolites are ineffective. The data suggest that active accumulation of amino acids via Na(+)-dependent carriers is necessary for the activation to occur. The amino acid-dependent stimulation is blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing extracellular K+. Treatment of hepatocytes with an amino acid such as asparagine causes cell swelling and stimulation of System N activity; both of these effects are reduced by hypertonic media. Furthermore, swelling of rat hepatocytes with hypotonic media mimics the System N-stimulatory effects of asparagine. Among the Na(+)-dependent amino acid transport systems present in rat hepatocytes, System N is stimulated preferentially by amino acid-containing or hypotonic media. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cell swelling is a prerequisite for the amino acid-dependent activation of the hepatic System N transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1589667651,"Platelets respond to a large number of stimuli by undergoing complex biochemical and morphological changes. These changes are involved in physiological processes including adhesion, aggregation, and coagulation. Platelet activation produces membrane alterations that can be recognized by monoclonal antibodies. In this report we describe a novel activation-dependent protein recognized by a monoclonal antibody, JS-1. The platelet glycoprotein was designated p-155 according to its apparent reduced molecular weight, p-155 exists in the native state as varying sized, large multimers held together by disulfide bonds. p-155 is released upon platelet activation and binds to the activated platelet surface. Although p-155 and platelet glycoprotein Ia migrate similarly on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunodepletion and isoelectric focusing distinguished p-155 from glycoprotein Ia. p-155 differed from von Willebrand factor and from thrombospondin in its reduced molecular weight. Additionally, immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated p-155 with antisera to von Willebrand factor and to thrombospondin confirmed the unique identity of p-155. Evidence for a soluble, nonintegral membrane-associated protein was obtained by Triton X-114 phase separation studies, membrane elution studies, and by the demonstration of the protein in the aqueous phase of platelet releasate. Both radioimmunoprecipitation and direct binding techniques demonstrated the activation-dependent nature of p-155. The protein could not be detected in other blood cells, endothelial cells, HEL cells, liver, or in plasma. The functional role of p-155 in platelets is not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W1496834675,"Three distinct classes of membrane-bound acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) have been identified. A12 AChE is composed of 12 catalytic subunits that are linked to noncatalytic collagen-like subunits through intersubunit disulfide bonds. G2 AChE is localized in membranes by a glycoinositol phospholipid covalently linked to the C-terminal amino acid. Brain G4 AChE involves two catalytic subunits linked by a direct intersubunit disulfide bond while the other two are disulfide-linked to a membrane-binding 20-kDa noncatalytic subunit. Molecular cloning studies have so far failed to find evidence of more than one AChE gene in any organism although alternative splicing of torpedo AChE mRNA results in different C-terminal sequences for the A12 and G2 AChE forms. Support for a single bovine AChE gene is provided in this report by amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal domains from the G2 erythrocyte, G4 fetal serum, and G4 brain AChE. Comparison of the 38-amino acid sequences reveals virtually complete identity among the three AChE forms. Additional extensive identity between the fetal serum and brain AChEs was demonstrated by sequencing several brain AChE peptides isolated by high performance liquid chromatography after trypsin digestion of nitrocellulose blots of brain AChE catalytic subunits. Cysteines involved in intersubunit disulfide linkages in brain AChE were reduced selectively with dithiothreitol in the absence of denaturants and radioalkylated with iodoacetamide. The observed sequence of the major radiolabeled tryptic peptide was C*SDL, where C* was the radioalkylated cysteine residue. This sequence is precisely the same as that observed at the C terminus of fetal bovine serum AChE and shows close homology to the C-terminal sequence of torpedo A12 AChE. We conclude that the mammalian brain G4 AChEs utilize the same exon splicing pattern as the A12 AChEs and that factors other than the primary sequence of the AChE catalytic subunits dictate assembly with either the collagen-like or the 20-kDa noncatalytic subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1533715656,"Abstract To identify the DNA sequences that cis-regulate the expression of the rat liver pyruvate kinase (L-PK) genes, a series of constructs in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes is driven by various deleted fragments of the 3200 base pairs (bp) upstream of the L-PK gene cap site have been assayed for transient expression after introduction into hepatoma HepG2 cells, rat hepatocytes in primary culture, fibroblast LTK- cells, myogenic C2C12 cells, and CHO cells. Four distinct regulatory domains have been characterized. A proximal promoter region containing a binding site for the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) which is sufficient to confer liver specificity, even in the presence of a ubiquitous enhancer. A distal promoter region (-96 to -283 bp) containing binding sites for the liver-specific factor A1 (LFA1), the ubiquitous nuclear factor 1 (NF1), the major late transcriptional factor (MLTF), and so far unidentified proteins binding to the L5-PK region which is essential to maximally activate expression of the construct in HepG2 cells. An extinguisher region, located between positions -2082 and -1170 bp, which decreases efficiency of the L-PK promoter in HepG2 cells, but not in hepatocytes in primary culture. Finally, a far upstream region (-2900 to -2500 bp) which seems to correspond to a liver-specific DNase I hypersensitive site and which behaves in HepG2 cells as an activating sequence efficient in the absence of the extinguisher."
https://openalex.org/W1496169422,"The biosynthesis of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC) together with that of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC (platelet-activating factor) has been demonstrated in a variety of inflammatory cells and tissues. It has been hypothesized that the relative proportion of these phospholipids produced upon cell activation may be influenced by their rates of catabolism. We studied the catabolism of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC in resting and activated human neutrophils and compared it to that of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC. Neutrophils rapidly catabolize both 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC and 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC; however, the rate of catabolism of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC is approximately 2-fold higher than that of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC. In addition, most of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC is catabolized through a pathway different from that of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC. The main step in the catabolism of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC is the removal of the long chain at the sn-1 position; the long chain residue is subsequently incorporated either into triglycerides or into phosphatidylcholine. The 1-lyso-2-acetyl-GPC formed in this reaction is then further degraded to glycerophosphocholine, choline, or phosphocholine. 1-Acyl-2-acetyl-GPC is also catabolized, to a lesser extent, through deacetylation at the sn-2 position and reacylation with a long chain fatty acid. Stimulation of neutrophils by A23187 results in a higher rate of catabolism of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC by increasing both the removal of the long chain at the sn-1 position and the deacetylation-reacylation at the sn-2 position. In a broken cell preparation, the cytosolic fraction of the neutrophil was shown to contain an enzyme activity which cleaved the sn-1 position of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC and 1-acyl-2-lyso-GPC but not of 1,2-diacyl-GPC. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the human neutrophil is able to catabolize 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC in a manner both quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of platelet-activating factor. The differential catabolism may regulate the relative proportion of these two bioactive phospholipids in the neutrophil."
https://openalex.org/W1568633060,"We have identified, in nuclear extracts of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, a factor which binds a sequence between -339 and -361 in the mouse alpha 1(I) collagen promoter. A 3-base pair substitution mutation introduced in this promoter element, which abolishes the binding of the factor, increases the activity of the promoter 4-fold in DNA transfection experiments. This suggests that this element is a negative regulator of transcription. The factor which binds to the -339 to -361 sequence is present in type I collagen-producing cell lines but not in a variety of other cell types, suggesting that it is involved in the tissue-specific regulation of the alpha 1(I) gene."
https://openalex.org/W1566047600,"Human NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (EC 1.6.2.2) contains 4 cyteine residues (Cys-203, -273, -283, and -297). Cys-283 was previously proposed to be involved in NADH binding by chemical modification (Hackett, C. S., Novoa, W. B., Ozols, J., and Strittmatter, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9854-9857). In the present study the role of cysteines in the enzyme was probed by replacing these residues by Ser, Ala, or Gly employing site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. Four mutants, in which 1 of the 4 Cys residues was replaced by Ser, retained comparable kcat and Km values to those of the wild type. All of these mutants were as sensitive as the wild type to treatment with SH modifiers, while a double mutant, C273S/C283S was resistant. Since inhibition by SH modifiers was protected by NADH, Cys-273 and Cys-283 were implicated to be close to the NADH-binding site. C273A and C273A/C283A mutants showed approximately one-fifth of the enzyme-FAD reduction rate of the wild type as revealed by steady-state kinetics and by stopped-flow analysis. Anaerobic titration has shown that reduction and re-oxidation processes including formation of the red semiquinone of these mutants were not significantly altered from those of the wild type. From these results it was concluded that none of the Cys residues of the enzyme are essential in the catalytic reaction, but Cys-273 conserved among the enzymes homologous to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase homologous to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase plays role(s) in facilitating the reaction. A difference spectrum with a peak at 317 nm, which was formerly considered to be derived from the interaction between NAD+ and Cys-283 of the reduced enzyme, appeared upon binding of NAD+ not only to the reduced wild type enzyme but also to the C273A/C283A mutant in which both of the Cys residues close to the NADH-binding site were replaced."
https://openalex.org/W1480895211,"Using synthetic DNA, we assembled a gene encoding a protein identical in sequence to one of the antifreeze proteins produced by the fish Pseudopleuronectes americanus (winter flounder). To address the relationship between structure and function, we also assembled genes encoding proteins varying in sequence and length. The synthetic genes were cloned into a bacterial expression vector to generate translational fusions to the 3' end of a truncated staphylococcal protein A gene; the chimeric proteins encoded by these fusions, varying only in their antifreeze domains, were isolated from Escherichia coli. The antifreeze domains conferred the ability to inhibit ice recrystallization, which is characteristic of naturally occurring antifreeze proteins, on the chimeric proteins. The chimeric proteins varied in their effectiveness of inhibiting ice recrystallization according to the number of 11-amino acid repeats present in the antifreeze moiety. A protein with only two repeats lacked activity, while the inhibitory activity increased progressively for proteins containing three, four, and five repeats. Some activity was lost upon removal of either the salt bridge or the carboxyl-terminal arginine, but surprisingly, not when both features were absent together."
https://openalex.org/W1538486657,"CD6 (T12) is a 130-kDa glycoprotein present on the surface of human T cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the anti-T12 and anti-2H1 monoclonal antibodies recognized different epitopes on CD6, and both were capable of transducing activation signals to T cells. Anti-T12 augmented suboptimal signaling via the TCR/CD3 complex and directly activated separated CD4+ but not CD8+ cells. Structural characterization of CD6 revealed that it contained intrachain disulfide bonds, was N-glycosylated, and in activated cells was phosphorylated on serine. Given the functional significance of CD6 and its involvement in signaling via CD3 and CD2 pathways, we examined in detail the biosynthesis, structural characteristics, and phosphorylation properties of this receptor-like molecule. These studies demonstrate that the nascent CD6 polypeptide on both T cells and thymocytes in 88 kDa, and the immature N-glycosylated form is 110 kDa. After maturation of N-linked glycan and addition of sulfated O-linked oligosaccharide, CD6 appears on the cell surface as a molecule of 130 kDa. CD6 is phosphorylated in resting cells and can be hyperphosphorylated when stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that it may participate in the major common signaling pathway mediated through protein kinase C. Concanavalin A-activated cells are phosphorylated at an additional site(s) on the molecule and cannot be hyperphosphorylated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These physical features reveal additional clues about the physiological role of CD6 and its mechanism of signal transduction and strongly suggest that CD6 represents a physiologically important membrane receptor involved in T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1520817266,"Calmodulin (CaM) has been shown to be an essential component for progression of nuclear division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ohya, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1989) Curr. Genet. 15, 113-120). To define the functional domain of the molecule required for cell proliferation, we constructed plasmids expressing a series of N- and C-terminal halves of the CaM under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. These plasmids were introduced into a cmd1-disrupted yeast haploid strain, and the growth properties of the cells depending on the half-CaMs were examined. Plasmids expressing the N-terminal half (Ser1-Leu76) and the C-terminal half (Leu85-Cys147), which each maintain two complete EF-hand structures, complemented the growth defect of the cmd1 null mutation, whereas those expressing shorter regions of C- and N-terminal CaM did not. The half-CaMs that complemented the cmd1 null mutation were found to be approximately 6-fold overexpressed relative to expression of native CaM by the wild-type CMD1 gene. The levels of expression of the half CaMs with the true CMD1 promoter were not sufficient for complementation. These results demonstrate that half-CaMs (either the N- or the C-terminal) are capable of supporting growth of yeast cells when they are suitably overproduced. Cells depending solely on half-CaMs all showed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, suggesting that half-CaMs cannot carry out all the cellular functions of the complete CaM molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1519996127,"HP-1 is a 30-residue cysteine- and arginine-rich peptide of the human neutrophil primary granule and is the most abundant human representative of the family of peptides variously called defensins and corticostatins. Peptides belonging to this family have many biological activities including the non-oxidative destruction of ingested microorganisms, the inhibition of adrenocorticotropin-stimulated synthesis of glucocorticoids, monocyte chemotaxis, the non-cytolytic inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in HL-60 promyelocyte-like cells and the stimulation of nifedipine-sensitive calcium channels. Using a combination of reversed-phase and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and an HP-1 radio-immunoassay, three immunoreactive peptides were detected and isolated from the promyelocyte-like cell line, HL-60, and from leukocytes of patients with chronic myelogenous and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. One of these peptides was HP-1 itself. A second was identified by gas-phase Edman microsequencing as an amino-terminally extended fragment of the HP-1 precursor which we call HP1-56. The third is likely to arise from enzymatic cleavage of the precursor at a dibasic site. Of the leukemic cells the greatest amount of HP1-56 relative to HP-1 was found in cells from a patient in myeloblastic crisis but overall the richest source of HP1-56 relative to HP-1 was found to be in fetal lung tissue. HP1-56 is difficult to detect in normal peripheral neutrophils and its presence in cells that are actively biosynthesizing primary granule components such as HL-60 may make it useful for studying the biosynthesis of granule polypeptides, their ontogeny, and possibly as a marker protein for leukemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2146721491,"We isolated 7.4 mg of pure renin from 2 kg of rat kidneys using affinity chromatography on pepstatin-aminohexyl-Sepharose and an octapeptide renin inhibitor, H-77-Sepharose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that renin consists of two polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, one of Mr = 36,000 (heavy chain) and the other of Mr = 3,000 (light chain). The amino-terminal 10-amino acid sequences of the heavy and the light chains were identical to the sequences beginning at Ser72 and Asp355, respectively, of the amino acid sequence of preprorenin deduced from the renin cDNA sequence. Amino acid sequencing of the carboxyl-terminal peptide of the heavy chain, generated by digestion with lysyl endopeptidase, showed that the carboxyl-terminal residue of the heavy chain is Phe. Thus, the propeptide of prorenin is cleaved after Thr71, followed by removal of two amino acids, Arg353 and Asn354, the result being formation of the heavy and light chains. Thus, the site of cleavage of rat prorenin is after a nonbasic amino acid, in contrast to the cleavage of the propeptide after a pair of basic amino acids in mouse submaxillary renin, human renal renin, and many secretory proteins. Treatment of renin with neuraminidase or glycopeptidase F had no apparent effect on the charge heterogeneity of renin. Glycosylation probably does not contribute to charge heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1488429763,"Fast twitch skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase was isolated and incubated with a radioactive, bifunctional, photoactivable, and cleavable cross-linker conjugated to calmodulin. Incubation of the holoenzyme only resulted in the labeling of the alpha-subunit in the presence of Ca2+. After cleavage with CNBr (and subdigestion with Asp-N protease), a sequence was identified (residues 1069-1087) in the alpha-subunit which had the predominant basic character and the propensity to form an amphiphilic helix like other calmodulin binding domains. If cross-linked calmodulin was incubated with the isolated subunits of phosphorylase kinase, radioactivity was recovered in seven CNBr peptides: three came from the alpha-subunits, one of them corresponding to the sequence labeled in the holoenzyme. Three came from the beta-subunit, and one came from the gamma-subunit. The latter contained the two adjacent calmodulin binding domains recently identified in the gamma-subunit (Dasgupta, M., Honeycutt, T., and Blumenthal, D. K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17156-17163)."
https://openalex.org/W1584208630,"Abstract Two 57-residue peptides containing one pair of fingers from a human enhancer binding protein were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. One peptide (MBP-DF) contained the native sequence, while the second peptide ([Abu11]MBP-DF) has an alpha-aminobutyric acid residue substituted for a nonconserved cysteine residue at position 11. The peptides were characterized by several chemical and physical methods, and their DNA binding properties were evaluated using gel retardation experiments. Spectroscopic studies demonstrated that addition of metal ions such as zinc and cobalt resulted in specific conformational changes in both peptides, indicating that cysteine-11 does not appear to be involved in metal chelation. One-dimensional 1H NMR studies indicate that a stable folded structure is formed upon addition of zinc, and the chemical shift pattern is consistent with that previously observed for one constituent single finger (Omichinski, J., Clore, G. M., Appella, E., Sakaguchi, K., and Gronenborn, A. M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 9324-9334). Gel retardation experiments demonstrate that the peptides are capable of interacting with a 15-mer oligonucleotide comprising a portion of the major histocompatibility complex enhancer sequence and that the interaction is zinc-dependent. The dissociation constant for the [Abu11]MBP-DF peptide is 1.4 x 10(-7) M with maximal binding occurring at a zinc-to-peptide ratio of 2 to 1. The binding specificity observed with respect to related enhancer sequences exhibits the same relative order as noted previously for the whole protein. Studies with point mutants of the major histocompatibility complex enhancer binding sequence indicate that the last GC base pair in a four-guanine stretch plays a pivotal role in the interaction between the peptide and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1546445306,"Abstract Lanthanide ion luminescence studies and 45Ca2(+)-binding measurements were used to study the metal ion-binding properties of avian thymic hormone. The procedure used to isolate the protein--involving heat-treatment at 80 degrees C, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, DEAE-agarose chromatography, and gel filtration--affords material that is deemed homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as the absence of a detectable tryptophan signal in the fluorescence emission spectrum. Avian thymic hormone exhibits a pI = 4.35 when subjected to isoelectric focusing through polyacrylamide gels. The two ion-binding sites are indistinguishable in their interactions with Ca2+ and Mg2+, displaying KCa = 8 nM and KMg = 68 microM. The Eu3+ 7Fo----5Do excitation spectrum at pH 6 displays a peak at 5795.4 A, with a shoulder at 5792.8 A and is replaced at higher pH values by a broader spectrum with a maximum at 5784.8 A and a shoulder at 5777.1 A. The pKa governing this spectral interconversion is 8.21. All of these properties are very similar to those observed with other parvalbumins. However, polyclonal antibodies to avian thymic hormone do not cross-react with the parvalbumin from chicken leg muscle, as judged by Western blot analysis-further evidence that avian thymic hormone and the muscle-associated chicken parvalbumin are indeed distinct proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1601654483,"The role of Tyr264 in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis catalyzed by the RecA protein of Escherichia coli was investigated by constructing Gly, Ser, and Phe substitution mutations using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The corresponding mutant recA genes neither restored resistance to killing by ultraviolet irradiation nor increased homologous recombination in a recA strain. The purified RecA(Gly264) protein was unable to bind nucleotide, hydrolyze ATP, or form stable ternary complexes with adenosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate and DNA although the mutant protein bound DNA normally in the absence of nucleotide. The RecA (Phe264) and RecA(Ser264) proteins hydrolyzed ATP poorly and the rates were reduced approximately 8- and 18-fold, respectively. Although capable of low levels of ATP hydrolysis, neither the RecA(Phe264) nor the RecA(Ser264) protein promoted DNA pairing or strand exchange reactions in vitro. Furthermore, these mutant RecA proteins were impaired in their ability to form salt-resistant ternary complexes with adenosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate) and DNA as judged by filter binding. Nevertheless, nucleoprotein complexes formed with either RecA(Phe264) or RecA(Ser264) protein directed efficient cleavage of LexA repressor in vitro. These results demonstrate that Tyr264 is required for efficient ATP hydrolysis and for homologous pairing of DNA but does not participate in activating RecA protein for LexA repressor autodigestion."
https://openalex.org/W1516146836,"Abstract The delta globin gene in simian primates is either weakly expressed (in hominoids and New World monkeys) or silent (in Old World monkeys). In prosimian primates, however, an unequal homologous crossover between the psi eta and delta loci of lemurs produced a hybrid psi eta delta pseudogene locus, whereas in tarsier the delta locus encodes a beta-type chain found in 18% of adult tarsier hemoglobin molecules. In the present study, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the galago delta and beta globin genes and their encoded peptides were determined, and evidence is provided showing that the galago delta locus encodes a beta-type chain (beta 2) found in 40% of the galago fetal and postnatal hemoglobin molecules, whereas the beta locus encodes the remaining 60% of the beta-type chain (beta 1). Galago beta 1 and beta 2 chains differ from each other by only one amino acid residue. The homology between the galago delta and beta loci extends from 800 base pairs 5' of the proximal CCAAT element to near the end of exon 3 as a result of a recombination event in which beta sequence replaced delta sequence. After this initial recombination event, concerted evolution between the loci continued over their conserved coding, intron 1, and promoter regions but failed to occur between the two loci in their intron 2 and distal 5'-flanking sequences where the two loci have now diverged by 20%. Calculations based on this divergence value and on a rate of noncoding sequence evolution of 4.2 x 10(-9) to 5.5 x 10(-9) substitutions/site/year for the lorisiform lineage to galago yielded a date of 18-24 million years ago for the initial recombination event. The fact that the promoter sequences of the galago delta locus are the same as that of the galago beta locus may account for the high level of expression of the galago delta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1582864227,"We studied the mRNA-binding properties of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2. This Met-tRNA-binding factor interacts with the cap structure of reoviral mRNA in an ATP-independent manner. Both the beta- and gamma-subunit of eIF-2 are involved in the UV-induced cross-linking of eIF-2 to the cap. The interaction of eIF-2 with a messenger is sensitive to the cap analogue 7-methyl-guanosine 5'-triphosphate as measured by cross-linking and by mRNA retention on nitrocellulose filters. The cap-binding property of eIF-2 does not conflict with the current mRNA-binding model of initiation factors eIF-4A, -4B, and -4F: cross-linking of eIF-4E and of eIF-4B is stimulated by eIF-2. The eIF-2-mediated increase of eIF-4E interaction results in a decrease of the cross-linking of the beta- and gamma-subunits of eIF-2. The presence of GTP in the cross-linking assay interferes with the interaction of eIF-2 with the cap structure but does not inhibit the eIF-2 stimulated eIF-4E and -4B cross-linking. These observations indicate a role for eIF-2 in the mRNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1508529444,"Habituation in response to repetitive depolarization of PC12 cells can be used as a model for memory processes at the molecular level. In response to depolarization by high external potassium, a triphasic elevation in internal calcium levels occurred. Calcium elevation was maximal immediately after addition of the stimulus (phase 1), followed by a 2-min period in which the calcium level decreased (phase 2), leading to a new steady-state level which was higher than in the unstimulated cell (phase 3). In response to repetitive depolarizations, the calcium level in phase 1 was reduced by as much as 43%, and phase 3 was reduced by as much as 40%. By measuring the relationship between calcium elevation and secretion, it was shown that measured reductions in calcium levels were correlated with neurosecretory habituation. One of the components responsible for the reductions in calcium levels was a tetraethylammonium-sensitive potassium channel, and the habituation of this channel was reversed by addition of 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1523155597,"Biological esterification with fatty acids is a feature that is now known to be common to most steroids. The esterification of estradiol in the D-ring at the 17 beta-hydroxyl leads to a family of extremely active estrogens. Similarly, esterification of the weaker estrogen, estriol (E3), has an even greater impact on its hormonal potency. We have recently shown that synthetic long chain esters of E3 at either 16 alpha- or 17 beta- are highly potent estrogens. The estrogenic activity of the synthetic E3 esters led us to determine whether E3 is biologically esterified, and if so, to characterize the resulting esters. Incubation of E3 with rat lung, a tissue which is highly active in esterifying estradiol, produces a nonpolar metabolite which upon saponification is converted back into E3. There was no evidence for the formation of a diester. Purification by high performance liquid chromatography separates the non-polar metabolite into two peaks, one the C-16 alpha- (approximately 60%) and the other the C-17 beta-ester (approximately 40%). The two fractions were further purified and characterized; each is a mixture of fatty acid esters of E3. The composition of the C-16 alpha- and the C-17 beta-fatty acid esters of E3 is identical. The predominant fatty acids are arachidonate, 34%, palmitate, 26%, followed by oleate 14%, linoleate 13%, stearate 8%, and palmitoleate 5%. The similarity of the esters at C-16 and C-17 may indicate that the fatty acid precursor for the acyltransferase is the same for both hydroxyl groups. It may also suggest that the same enzyme esterifies both positions in the D-ring. Since synthetic estriol fatty acid esters are extremely potent and long-lived estrogens, the enzymatic esterification of estriol produces powerful estrogens with considerable physiological potential."
