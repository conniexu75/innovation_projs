https://openalex.org/W2003115478,"Mammalian heat shock genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), a sequence-specific transcription factor. We have examined the role of serine phosphorylation of HSF-1 in the regulation of heat shock gene transcription. Our experiments show that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) of the ERK-1 family phosphorylate HSF-1 on serine residues and repress the transcriptional activation of the heat shock protein 70B (HSP70B) promoter by HSF-1 in vivo. These effects of MAPK are transmitted through a specific serine residue (Ser-303) located in a proline-rich sequence within the transcriptional regulatory domain of human HSF-1. However, despite the importance of Ser-303 in transmitting the signal from the MAPK cascade to HSP70 transcription, there was no evidence that Ser-303 could be phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro, although an adjacent residue (Ser-307) was avidly phosphorylated by MAPK. Further studies revealed that Ser-303 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) through a mechanism dependent on primary phosphorylation of Ser-307 by MAPK. Secondary phosphorylation of Ser-303 by GSK3 may thus repress the activity of HSF-1, and its requirement for priming by MAPK phosphorylation of Ser-307 provides a potential link between the MAPK cascade and HSF-1. Our experiments thus indicate that MAPK is a potent inhibitor of HSF-1 function and may be involved in repressing the heat shock response during normal growth and development and deactivating the heat shock response during recovery from stress.

In mammalian cells, heat shock genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), a sequence-specific transcription factor that binds to heat shock elements (HSE) in their promoters (3Wu C.

Although the mechanisms involved in HSF-1 activation are not fully understood, they operate at the posttranslational level and involve the conversion of HSF-1 from a latent cytoplasmic form to a nuclear protein that controls the transcription of heat shock genes (3Wu C.

Science. 1993; 269: 1409-1410Crossref Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). HSF family members are unique in binding to DNA in a homotrimeric complex (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Trimerization is governed by arrays of amphipathic α-helical residues (“leucine zippers”) in the amino-terminal domain and is negatively regulated by a fourth “leucine zipper” domain in the carboxyl terminus (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 7Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, although heat-inducible nuclear localization and DNA binding are necessary steps in HSF-1 activation, these events are not sufficient for full transcriptional competence; HSF-1 can be activated to an intermediate state in which it binds to HSE sequences but does not stimulate transcription (8Hensold J.O.

Much preliminary evidence suggests a role for phosphorylation in the conversion of HSF-1 from this intermediate state into a transcriptionally active form (8Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K.

In addition, HSF from yeast and HSF-1 from mammalian cells both undergo hyperphosphorylation during heat shock (12Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B.

The regulation of transcriptional activity in trimeric HSF-1 involves a number of functional domains which could mediate stepwise activation of HSF-1 and may be targets for phosphorylation (14Green M.T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation domains in the carboxyl terminus of the protein are suppressed under non-stress conditions by interaction with leucine zipper 2 in the amino-terminal core domain containing the DNA binding and oligomerization regions (16Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, a centrally located regulatory region mediates the heat inducibility of the COOH-terminal activation domains independently of the core domain (14Green M.T. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell.

The regulatory domain contains a number of serine residues within a proline-rich region essential for heat shock activation of HSF-1, which are potentially phosphorylated during heat shock (amino acids 220-310). As a number of these sequences conform to consensus phosphorylation domains for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), we have examined the role of MAPK phosphorylation in regulating the transcriptional activating functions of HSF-1. heat shock protein heat shock factor heat shock element glycogen synthase kinase 3 mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase MAP kinase kinase extracellular regulated kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay chloramphenicol acetyltransferase myelin basic protein wild-type 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. MAPK activity in mammalian cells was first ascribed to two closely related proteins, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK 1 and 2), that are rapidly activated in response to stimuli such as signals for proliferation and differentiation and stresses such as oxidative stress and ionizing radiation (19Boulton T.E. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 20Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 21Herskowitz I.

The central importance of ERK 1 and 2 in cell proliferation is indicated by the findings that they are essential components in the signal transduction pathways leading from growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases to the initiation of mitogenesis (23Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The ERK family was recently joined by two related gene families, the Jun/SAP kinases and the p38/Hog-1 family (24Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Meyer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). These three MAPK families share a number of properties, including a downstream position in a three kinase cascade composed of: MAP kinase kinase kinase, its substrate MAP kinase kinase (MKK), and finally the MAPK itself with the unique property of being activated by phosphorylation on adjacent threonine and tyrosine residues by MKK (20Marshall C.J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The ERK, JunK, and p38 families have distinct targets as well as overlapping substrates, and each family is activated by heat shock (24Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Meyer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J.

As the MAP kinases regulate other transcription factors, including TCF-62, c-Jun, and ATF-2, we have therefore examined the potential role of MAPK in HSF-1 regulation (23Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the role of phosphorylation in HSF-1 function. Our studies show that HSF-1 is phosphorylated on serine residues by ERK-1. Increasing cellular ERK activity by overexpressing a specific MKK (MEK-1) inhibited the transcriptional activating potential of HSF-1. Point mutation studies identified a specific residue, Ser-303, as essential for transmitting the inhibitory influence of MAPK to HSF-1. Paradoxically, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of the wild type and mutant forms of HSF-1 after incubation with MAPK in vitro indicated that Ser-303 is not phosphorylated by MAPK. Instead Ser-303 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Repression of HSF-1 by MAPK appears to involve the phosphorylation of HSF-1 on an adjacent residue, Ser-307, which primes HSF-1 for subsequent phosphorylation on Ser-303 by GSK3. Thus serial phosphorylation of HSF-1 by MAPK and GSK3, although not interfering with the ability of HSF-1 to bind to HSE represses its function at a later step in transcriptional initiation or elongation. THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB 202) from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in endotoxin-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere and routinely subcultured by dilution at a 1/3 ratio. NIH 3T3 cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Confluent cultures were serum-starved in medium containing 0.1% bovine calf serum 24 h prior to treatment. THP-1 cells (70 × 106 to 100 × 106 cells) were incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% complete medium and 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (8500-9120 Ci (314-337 TBq)/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 4 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified incubator. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 450 μl of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mM NaF, 0.5 mM sodium vanadate, 1 μM okadaic acid, left on ice for 20 min, and frozen at −80°C. The cell extracts were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 2 mM EGTA containing inhibitors as above was added. Protein-A-Sepharose beads (100 μl) were added and the samples incubated for 2 h at 4°C on a rocking apparatus. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, the 100 μl of A68-3 anti-HSF-1 antibody was added, and the samples incubated for 2 h at 4°C as above. Protein-A beads were added as before, the mixture incubated for 30 min at 4°C, and the beads collected and washed three times in 500 μl of incubation buffer and repeated centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled 3 min, and processed for two-dimensional mapping and/or phosphoamino acid analysis. The human HSF-1 cDNA was excised from its parent vector (pBHSF-1) by digestion with XhoI, the recessed strands filled with Klenow fragment, and the resulting fragment cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET22b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) in order to produce the native protein, containing no additional amino acid. The plasmid provided ampicillin resistance to transform BL21(DE3) cells, which express large amounts of recombinant protein under isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. HSF-1 was isolated and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and Mono-Q ion-exchange chromatography. The resulting material is pure by SDS-PAGE and C8 reverse phase chromatography binds the specific heat-shock element. 2F. Soncin, R. Prevelige, and S. K. Calderwood, manuscript in preparation. Purified MAPK from P. ochraceus (p44mpk) and GSK3β from rabbit muscle were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. For in vitro MAP kinase assays, HSF-1 (5 μg) was incubated with 25 ng of MAPK and γ-32P-labeled ATP (1 μCi/μl) in final volume of 30 μl of MKIV buffer. MKIV buffer contained 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM ATP, 100 nM okadaic acid, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, and 100 μg/ml lipid free bovine serum albumin. As a positive control for MAPK activity, we used MBP at 5 μg/reaction. Synthetic model peptides derived from sequences in human HSF-1 containing consensus MAPK domains were prepared (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA) with the addition of two R residues to each amino terminus in order to ensure binding to p81 membranes in the kinase assay (29Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 121-135Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Peptides H275 (amino acids 271-281; RRLAPASPMASPG), H300 (amino acids 298-310; RKEEPPSPPQSPRV), H321 and H359 (amino acids 359-371; RRGRPPSPPPTSTPE) were purified by high performance liquid chromatography for use in the MAP kinase assay as above (30Rabindran S.K. Gioorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Two further peptides were also employed in the assays which were variants of the H300 peptide containing a Gly for Ser substitution at position 303 (H300S303G) or a similar substitution at position 307 (H300S307G). For MAPK assay, the samples were incubated for 20 min at 30°C in MKIV buffer and the reaction stopped either by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen (for EMSA), by adding electrophoresis reducing sample buffer and boiling 3 min (for SDS-PAGE), or by adding ice-cold 80 mM phosphoric acid and adsorption on P81 cellulose paper (peptides) prior to liquid scintillation assay. For in vitro GSK3β assay, rHSF-1 or synthetic peptides were exposed to 50 mU of enzyme in a buffer consisting of 8 mM MOPS, pH 7.3, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgC4H6O4, 100 μM ATP, 20 mM MgCl2, and 32P-labeled ATP (1 μCi/μl) in a final volume of 30 μl at room temperature for 30 min. For sequential in vitro MAPK/GSK3β labeling, polypeptides were exposed to MAPK for 10 min at 30°C (in GSK3β buffer) followed by 30 min at room temperature with GSK3β. MAPK was equally active in MKIV buffer or in the GSK3β buffer described above. Samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE with 4% stacking gels, the gels dried and subjected to autoradiography on x-ray film, and the bands corresponding to HSF-1 excised. The slices were rehydrated in 20% MetOH for 24 h, dried in a vacuum oven, resuspended in 50 mM NH4HCO3 containing 25 μg of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Trypsin (25 μg) was added again and slices incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C. Supernatants of tryptic digests were pooled, lyophilized several times in water, resuspended in 90% formic acid, and proceeded for two-dimensional mapping on 20 × 20-cm Kodak chromatogram cellulose sheets as described (31Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at 1200 V for 1 h using the pH 1.9 buffer, and the chromatography was developed for 5 h in the phosphochromatography buffer (31Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Sheets were dried and autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitated HSF-1 was hydrolyzed for 2 h at 110°C in 6 N HCl. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 vol of water and dried under vacuum. The samples were resuspended in a solution containing 5 mg/ml each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, spotted on cellulose sheets, and separated by electrophoresis at 600 V for 7 h. The position of the standards was visualized by the ninhydrin reaction and the sheets autoradiographed. Binding of rHSF-1 to HSE was assayed after serial dilution of samples in 5 μl of 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, addition of 5 μl of [32P]HSE oligonucleotide derived from the mouse HSP70.1 sequence (approximately 0.8 ng) in 20% glycerol, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 4 mM MgCl2 (final volume 10 μl), incubation for 30 min at room temperature, and separation on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 34 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA as described (9Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nuclear HSF-1 was extracted as described previously and assayed as above (9Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using pALTER-1 vector as described in the Altered Sites II In Vitro Mutagenesis system manual (Promega, Madison, WI). The full-length EcoRI cDNA insert of HSF-1 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pALTER-1 vector. This construct in the desired orientation was used for the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. For this purpose, three oligonucleotides (GTCCCTGCCGGCCCCATGGCCT, AGCCCCCCGGCCCGCCTC, and CGCCTCAGGGCCCCCGGGT) were employed in mutating serine residues at positions 275 (S275G), 303 (S303G), and 307 (S307G) to glycine. In addition, oligonucleotides AGCCCCCCGACCCGCCTC and CGCCTCAGGACCCCCGGGT were used to mutate Ser-303 and Ser-307 to aspartate. The point mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Wild type and mutated HSF-1 were force-cloned into XhoI/EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector, which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The HSF-1 cDNA contains an XhoI site at a position 5 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon. The transfection was carried out using calcium phosphate precipitation as described in the Profection Mammalian Transfection System technical manual (Promega). NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 250,000/100-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transfection. The HSF-1 constructs were co-transfected with the HSP70B promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct p2500CAT that contains 2.5 kilobase pairs of 5′ non-coding sequence from the heat-inducible human HSP70B gene (32Schiller P. Amin J. Ananthan J. Brown M.E. Scott W.A. Voellmy R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) including at least two heat shock elements, the TATA box region, and most of the leader sequence (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada). The amounts of plasmids used in each transfection are indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested 48 h after incubation with plasmids for expression of CAT protein. CAT expression was then determined using an enzyme linked immunoassay for CAT protein according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Boehringer Mannheim). In some experiments, HSF-1 was co-transfected with a pCMV-MEK-1 plasmid obtained from Dr. N. G. Ahn, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO (33Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Van de Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether human HSF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo, THP-1 human monocytes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and whole cell extracts were prepared either without or with heat shock prior to HSF-1 isolation by immunoprecipitation. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated HSF-1 by trypsin digestion and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping indicated multiple phosphorylated species both in control and heat-shocked cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The phosphoamino acid analysis of the isolated proteins showed that the immunoprecipitated HSF-1 incorporated phosphate almost exclusively on serine residues whether analyzed before or after heat shock (Fig. 1C). In order to investigate the nature of protein kinases involved in the phosphorylation of HSF-1, we next analyzed the efficiency of a wide range of kinases, including protein kinase A, calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II and IV, casein kinase II, and the MAP kinases, to phosphorylate HSF-1 in vitro. We focused on MAP kinase because MAPK family member p44mpk (Fig. 1D) phosphorylated HSF much more efficiently than the other enzymes. Incubation of purified recombinant human HSF-1 (rHSF-1) with purified MAP kinase from P. ochraceus (p44mpk, which is related to human ERK-1) in vitro led to efficient phosphorylation of HSF-1 (Fig. 1D). Under these conditions 32P incorporation into HSF-1 in the presence of MAPK was at least abundant as that of myelin basic protein (MBP), a well characterized MAPK substrate. As two related members of the MAPK family, Jun kinase and p38 kinase, are also activated by heat shock, we examined their ability to phosphorylate HSF-1. However, neither kinase (isolated from mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies) showed any significant HSF-1 phosphorylating activity in the in vitro assay, while mammalian ERK-1 prepared in the same way avidly phosphorylated HSF-1, indicating that ERK-1 family members specifically interact with HSF-1. 3J. Landry, F. Soncin, and S. K. Calderwood, unpublished results. Phosphoamino acid analysis of HSF-1 treated with MAPK (p44mpk) as described in Fig. 1D indicated phosphorylation primarily on serine residues, with trace labeling of threonine and no evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). We next examined rHSF-1 phosphorylation by MAPK using trypsin digestion and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Figs. 1F). Four phosphopeptides (A, B, C, and D) were resolved from the tryptic digest, including two major (A and B) and two minor (C and D) species (Fig. 1F). These analyses of rHSF-1 phosphorylation by MAPK in vitro were next compared with the phosphorylation state of HSF-1 extracted from cells in vivo (Fig. 1, A and B). The two major species A and B resolved by two-dimensional mapping of rHSF-1 treated with MAPK in vitro (A and B) corresponded, in terms of rF value, with two species (marked A and B on Figs. 1, A and B) phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1, A and F). These experiments therefore suggest that HSF-1 is phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro and is potentially involved in HSF-1 phosphorylation in vivo. We next examined the potential role of MAP kinase in the control of HSF-1 activity. Cellular MAPK activity was stimulated by overexpressing MEK-1, the proximal activator of MAPK (33Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Van de Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). We then determined the effect of elevated MEK-1 on the ability of HSF-1 expressed from the pCMV-HSF-1 vector to activate the HSP70B promoter in NIH 3T3 cells under non-heat shock conditions (Fig. 2A). MEK-1 was chosen for its specificity in activating the ERK kinases and because our control experiments indicated that NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing the pCMV-MEK-1 vector exhibited MAPK activity 4-8-fold greater than controls (not shown). NIH 3T3 cells were used here instead of the THP-1 cells used earlier as, in contrast to NIH 3T3 cells, HSF-1 expression does not appreciably activate the HSP70B promoter in THP-1 cells in the absence of heat (34Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription from the HSP70B promoter was strongly activated by HSF-1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells, while in controls transfected with the HSF-1 cDNA in inverse orientation, there was no evidence of transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of pCMV-MEK-1 repressed the ability of HSF-1 to activate the HSP70B promoter by 70-80% (Fig. 2A). We next attempted to determine whether the effects of MAPK were exerted at the first step in HSF-1 activation (trimerization, nuclear localization/HSE binding) or at a later stage. To investigate potential effects of MAPK phosphorylation on the HSE binding ability of HSF-1, we incubated purified rHSF-1 with MAPK in vitro as described in Fig. 1D (except that unlabeled ATP was used) and measured HSE binding by EMSA (Fig. 2B). rHSF-1 differed from HSF-1 extracted from human cells in being competent to bind HSE in the absence of heat shock. rHSF-1 (with or without MAPK treatment) was diluted wit"

However, very little is known about their substrate requirements and the significance or consequences of this postsynthetic modification. We have explored this reaction in vitro with two known substrates filaggrin and trichohyalin. First, the degree and rate of modification of arginines to citrullines directly correlates with the structural order of the substrate. In filaggrin, which has little structural order, the reaction proceeded rapidly to >95% completion. However, in the highly α-helical protein trichohyalin, the reaction proceeded slowly to about 25% and could be forced to a maximum of about 65%. Second, the rate and degree of modification depends on the sequence location of the target arginines. Third, we show by gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy that the reaction interferes with organized protein structure: the net formation of ≥10% citrulline results in protein denaturation. Cyanate modification of the lysines in model α-helix-rich proteins to homocitrullines also results in loss of organized structure. These data suggest that the ureido group on the citrulline formed by the peptidylarginine deiminase enzyme modification functions to unfold proteins due to decrease in net charge, loss of potential ionic bonds, and interference with H bonds.

However, the physiological significance of each of these has not been established. On the other hand, there are two well documented protein substrates of PAD. One is the filaggrin, which is present only in orthokeratinizing epidermis. Filaggrin can bundle keratin IF into tight arrays in vitro and in vivo (20Steinert P.M. Cantieri J.S. Teller D.C.

The second known substrate protein is trichohyalin (THH), which is a major differentiation product of the inner root sheath cells of the hair follicle, and of the medulla in the hair fiber and related structures such as porcupine quills (23Auber L.

However, the details of the reaction of PAD with filaggrin and THH or other substrates remain unclear. Moreover, the function of the PAD modification events in these tissues remains unknown. In this study, we have explored the substrate specificity of the type 2 PAD using as substrates mouse filaggrin, human THH, and other model peptides of related structures. Our data reveal certain sequence and substrate structural requirements for the enzyme and, for the first time, the consequences of its action, which provide insights into its function in the skin. The following were purchased: type 2 rabbit skeletal muscle PAD (PanVera Corp., Madison WI); sequencing grade Asp-N protease (Boehringer Mannheim); precast Tris-glycine, Tricine, and isoelectric focusing (pH 3-7 and 3-10) gels (Novex, San Diego, CA); horse heart myoglobin, protamine sulfate, and a synthetic copolymer polypeptide of average composition alanine6-lysine5-glutamate2-tyrosine1 (20,000-50,000 molecular weight; Sigma). Mouse filaggrin was isolated and purified as described (20Steinert P.M. Cantieri J.S. Teller D.C. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Dale B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amount of citrulline was corrected for hydrolytic losses to ornithine. Citrulline and ornithine eluted at 15.7 and 50.1 min, near glutamic acid and lysine, respectively. Protein concentrations of samples were determined according to Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar), and by amino acid analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was done according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). The construct of THH-8 (residues 1250-1849 predicted by secondary structure analysis) for expression was made by polymerase chain reaction with primers from the sequences of domain 8 (31Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12164-12176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and confirmed by sequencing. The ATG start and TGA stop codons were inserted at the positive and negative polymerase chain reaction primers, respectively. This construct was cloned into the pET-11a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) (39Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector was transformed into the BL 21 E. coli strain, and bacteria (1-5-liter cultures) were grown in Terrific Broth (Sigma; modified, supplemented with 10 g/liter glucose and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin) until A600 nm = 1.2. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-2-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h (final A600 nm = 2.5). Bacterial pellets (10,000 × g, 30 min) were lysed and DNase-digested as described (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning:. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.36-17.44Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 5 min) and washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 several times. The pellet was solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), loaded, and chromatographed at a flow rate of 15 ml/h on a Sepharose Q Fast Flow column equilibrated in this buffer. The column was then washed in the same buffer without urea, and the THH-8 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 M NaCl. THH-8 was identified by Western blotting with poly- and monoclonal anti-pig THH antibodies (27O'Keefe E.J. Hamilton E.H. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 65S-71SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The purity and concentrations of the combined fractions was determined by amino acid analysis. THH-8 (50 μg/ml) was incubated with PAD at 37°C at different enzyme:substrate molar ratios (between 1:1000 and 10:1) in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM CaCl2, and the reaction was terminated as required by the addition of EDTA (10 mM final concentration). To determine the extent of reaction (i.e. appearance of citrulline), samples obtained at low enzyme:substrate ratios were acid-hydrolyzed directly for amino acid analysis. Control experiments showed that the PAD enzyme alone does not generate citrulline during reaction. When high enzyme:substrate ratios were used, the reaction products were first resolved on 10% Tricine gels (Novex), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and after a brief staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the appropriate THH bands were cut out and hydrolyzed. Aliquots of the samples were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, and either pH 3-7 or 3-10 isoelectric focusing gels. Mouse filaggrin (10 μM) was incubated as described for THH-8 at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:1000 in the Tris buffer at pH 8.0. The degree of modification was likewise determined by amino acid analysis. Synthetic peptides were deiminated at an enzyme:arginine molar ratio of 1: 40,000 at pH 8.0 at 37°C for 3 h. The products were separated by HPLC on a reverse phase column prior to amino acid analysis. Unmodified and modified THH-8 and filaggrin samples in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 were digested with Asp-N protease at a ratio of 1:2,000 (by weight) at 23°C for up to 18 h. The fragments were separated by HPLC on a narrow bore reverse phase column (218TP52) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using a 10-60% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.08% trifluoracetic acid in 50 min at 0.23 ml/min flow rate. The eluted peaks were dried, and their amino acid compositions were determined and sequenced. Peptides were covalently attached to a Sequelon-AA polyvinylidene difluoride solid support (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and sequenced by Edman degradation in a LF3000 gas phase sequencer (Porton) using the manufacturer's recommended procedure number 39. PTH-derivatives were separated by on-line reverse-phase HPLC (using 3.5% tetrahydrofuran in buffer A; 41Farnsworth V. Steinberg K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with System Gold software. PTH-citrulline eluted at 6.1 min, immediately after PTH-threonine. Samples of THH-8 (0.14 mg/ml), horse heart myoglobin (0.7 mg/ml), and a commercial random synthetic polypeptide (molecular weight 20,000-50,000) of average composition alanine6-lysine5-glutamate2-tyrosine1 (0.5 mg/ml) were reacted with potassium cyanate for up to 24 h to convert lysine residues to homocitrullines (42Stark G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 590-594Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After reaction, the protein samples were equilibrated by dialysis into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The extent of reaction was followed by acid hydrolysis, although 35% of the homocitrulline was converted back to lysine under the conditions used (42Stark G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 590-594Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Homocitrulline eluted from the Analyser column at 26.0 min. THH-8 (0.05-0.1 mg/ml), mouse filaggrin (0.2 mg/ml), myoglobin (0.5 mg/ml), or copolymer polypeptide (0.35 mg/ml) solutions were equilibrated into the same buffer as used for the PAD reaction. Steady state fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax Instruments, Paris, France). The bandwidths of excitation and emission monochromators were in the range of 2-4 nm. In all fluorescence experiments, spectra were corrected for Raman contributions by buffer base-line subtraction. Absorption and circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out using a Jasco Uvidec 650 spectrophotomer and Jasco 600 and 700 spectropolarimeters, respectively. In both cases, 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes were used. The sample holders were thermostated before and during measurements, using external circulation. Protein concentrations were measured by amino acid analyses to calculate molar ellipticity values for estimation of helix contents. In addition, α-helical contents were routinely estimated by use of curve-fitting algorithms from the shape of the spectra, especially in the case of the copolymer polypeptide of heterogeneous molecular weight. The two methods yielded identical estimates. To date, studies with the PAD enzyme have utilized mostly model peptide substrates. The purpose of the present study was to explore the specificity and structural requirements of the PAD enzyme using the known in vivo substrate proteins mouse filaggrin and a more soluble cloned portion of human THH (THH-8). For the enzyme, we have used the commercially available type 2 enzyme from rabbit skeletal muscle. While there are minor differences in the antigenicity and apparent molecular weights of the type 2 (“ubiquitous”) and 3 (“hair follicle”) enzymes, they have been reported to have essentially identical substrate specificities (8Watanabe K. Akiyama K. Hikichi K. Ohtsuka R. Okuyama A. Senshu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Takahara H. Tsuchida M. Kusubata M. Akutsu K. Tagami S.

Mouse filaggrin (30 kDa) contains 16% arginine (40 residues/mol) (43Rothnagel J.A. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1862-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By amino acid analysis, an average of 95% were deiminated to citrullines within 3 h using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:1000 (Fig. 1A), so that the total citrulline content was >15%. To determine whether the 95% conversion meant that all arginines were equally modified or whether ∼2 were not modified at all, the filaggrin sample was digested with Asp-N protease, and the 15 fragments encompassing the entire sequence were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The peptides were subjected to acid hydrolysis, and their amino acid compositions were determined. In all fragments ∼95% of the arginine was modified. In confirmation, one fragment containing 4 arginines (Table I) was directly sequenced by Edman degradation. At each expected arginine residue position, >95% citrulline was recovered. The partially and fully modified filaggrin migrated considerably more slowly by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). While this phenomenon has not been described previously with model protein substrates, two studies have reported progressive decreases in the mobility of human (19Senshu T. Akiyama K. Kanm S. Asaga H. Ishigami A. Manabe M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and rat (22Harding C.R. Scott I.R. J. Mol.

Rogers G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or pig tongue epithelium (30Hamilton E.H. Sealock R. Wallace N.R. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 881-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) because of its extraordinary insolubility, this precludes its use in in vitro enzymatic reactions. Instead, we have expressed in bacteria domain 8, the largest domain representing about 30% of human THH. This domain consists of numerous irregular peptide repeats of about 26 residues that are typical of the entire human THH sequence (31Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12164-12176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 80-kDa protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2, inset, lane 1). Its amino acid composition is as expected from its known sequence (including 137 arginines, 22.8%), and is ∼86%α-helical as determined by CD (see Fig. 5B, line 1). Since this result is exactly as predicted for this THH sequence and is consistent with the available data for native pig tongue THH (31Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12164-12176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data indicate that the bacterially expressed protein had properly adopted the native structural configuration. The THH-8 cross-reacts with existing monoclonal (Fig. 2, inset, lane 2) and polyclonal (data not shown) antibodies (27O'Keefe E.J. Hamilton E.H. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Invest.

In the pH 8.8 buffer, its solubility was limited to ∼100 μg/ml.Fig. 5Circular dichroism shows that PAD promotes loss of secondary structure in filaggrin and THH-8.

Using the low enzyme:substrate ratios used with filaggrin (1:1000), very little modification occurred (Fig. 3A, line 1). At ratios of 1:100-1:50, about 20-25% of the arginine content was modified (line 2), but a maximum of up to about 65% could be achieved at higher ratios (up to 10:1) (line 3). As was found for filaggrin, the migration of the modified THH-8 on SDS gels was reduced in a gradual fashion so that its Mapp was about 160 kDa (Fig. 3B). By isoelectric focusing, bands of progressively more acidic charge were seen (Fig. 3C), from pI ∼6.5 for unmodified THH-8, which only enters the gel poorly, to pI 4.8, commensurate with the expected loss of arginine. We also noted that partially to maximally modified THH-8 samples became more soluble (>0.5 mg/ml). We next wanted to determine why the modification of THH-8 proceeded to only about 65%. Aliquots of unmodified and maximally modified THH-8 were digested with Asp-N, and the fragments were separated on reverse phase HPLC. In the latter, the elution times of the peaks were largely unchanged, probably because most peptides were relatively long (>20 residues), but the peaks became more broad (data not shown). This may be because each peak constituted a mixture of forms of a single peptide whose several arginines were modified to varying extents. By amino acid analyses, most peptides showed 30-70% modification. Many peptides were then partially or completely sequenced, encompassing about 40% of the THH-8 protein (see Table I for partial list). Due to the highly repetitive nature of THH-8, these are representative of >80% the protein. Indeed, we found that the citrulline contents varied across the broad peptide peaks. However, in general, most of the arginines were converted to citrulline by >75%, except those arginines followed by a glutamic acid residue, which were only slightly modified at ≤5%. Since about one-third of the arginines are followed by glutamic acid residues, this provides a simple explanation for the observed maximal extent of modification. In the special cases of two (Table I, peptides 2, 5, and 7) or three (peptide 1) consecutive arginines in THH-8, the first was completely but the second and/or third were modified less efficiently. In addition, intact modified THH-8 was sequenced from its amino terminus (Table I, peptide 1) to show that arginines followed by aspartic acid residues were modified to near completion. Changes in mobilities of proteins in SDS fields are often due to changes in conformation and/or charge (44Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D.C.1981Google Scholar). To further explore this issue, we included 8 M urea in the SDS gel and the sample buffer prior to boiling. In both cases, the unmodified as well as partially modified filaggrin (Fig. 4A) and THH-8 (Fig. 4B) samples all migrated at the decreased rates of ∼60 or ∼160 kDa, respectively, close to the modified forms. Both of these proteins have unusual structures. Filaggrin is thought to possess a β-turn secondary structure (21Mack J.W. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1980935526,"The Akt protooncogene encodes a serine-threonine protein kinase which is activated by growth factor-generated signals that are transduced via the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K). Earlier studies suggested that the activation of Akt by PI3-K may be mediated by the binding of D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides to the Akt pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. On the basis of these studies, it was hypothesized that Akt is a direct PI3-K target. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted the pathway of Akt activation in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The results showed that Akt, which is normally catalytically inactive in these cells, was activated when coexpressed with the activated PI3-K. Moreover, they showed that activated forms of c-Ha-ras (v-Ha-ras) and c-src (v-src or srcY527F), two molecules that transduce growth factor-generated signals, also activate Akt in a PI3-K-dependent manner in Sf9 as well as NIH 3T3 cells. The activation of Akt by both growth factors and v-ras and v-src (or srcY527F) depends on the integrity of the Akt PH domain and carboxyl-terminal tail. These results show that Akt activation via the PI3-K can be faithfully reproduced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells.

In vitro incubation of inactive Akt immunoprecipitated from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, with enzymatically synthesized D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PPIs), activated Akt in a dose-dependent manner (6Franke T.F.

This suggested that the modulation of the Akt catalytic activity is mediated by binding of PI3-K-generated PPIs to the Akt PH domain. The preceding results were interpreted to indicate that Akt is a direct target of the PI3-K. However, this conclusion was challenged by a report showing that the activation of Akt by insulin, contrary to its activation by PDGF, was unaffected by PH domain mutations (7Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Akt is a direct target of the activated PI3-K, we reconstituted the pathway of Akt activation by infecting Sf9 cells with combinations of Akt-, p85-, p110-, and PDGFRβ-expressing baculoviruses.

The activation of the PI3-K by growth factor-generated signals is mediated by intracellular signaling molecules. One such molecule, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase c-src binds p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3-K (8Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), while another, c-Ha-ras, binds and activates p110, the PI3-K catalytic subunit (9Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies had indeed shown that the activation of Akt by PDGF was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant RasN17 suggesting that Ras contributes to the transduction of PDGF-induced signals that activate Akt (6Franke T.F.

To determine whether activated forms of c-src and c-Ha-ras activate Akt and whether their potential contributions to the activation of Akt were dependent on the PI3-K, we examined their role in Akt activation in Sf9 and NIH 3T3 cells. The data presented in this report show that v-src (or srcY527F) and v-Ha-ras or the combination of the two activate Akt in a PI3-K-dependent manner in both Sf9 and mammalian cells. The activation of Akt by both growth factors and v-src (or srcY527F) and/or v-Ha-ras depends on the Akt PH domain and carboxyl-terminal tail. Sf9 cells derived from Spodoptera frugiperda were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in Grace's insect medium supplemented with yeastolate, lactalbumin, glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (30 units/ml), streptomycin (30 μg/ml), and kanamycin (60 μg/ml). Expression constructs of wild type and mutant Akt, v-src, v-Ha-ras, and N17Ras in the pVL1392 vector (Pharmingen) were recombined into the Autographa californica strain of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) using the Baculogold transfection kit and following procedures suggested by the supplier (Pharmingen). Baculovirus recombinants carrying the PI3-K regulatory and catalytic subunit genes p85 and p110 and the PDGFRβ were kindly provided by G. Panayotou (Ludwig Institute, London, UK). Viral stocks were amplified to achieve titers higher than 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Baculovirus infections were carried out in 60-mm Petri dishes using 2 × 106 cells and a multiplicity of infection of 10. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were serum-starved overnight. The next day the cells were washed in D-PBS and harvested. Cells treated with wortmannin (Sigma) were exposed to 200 nM concentration of the drug for 30 min prior to harvesting. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). The CMV6 expression constructs of wild type and mutant Akt tagged at their amino terminus with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (HA-Akt, HA-AktR25C, HA-AktΔ11-35, and HA-Akt K179 M) were described previously (6Franke T.F.

The mutant HA-AktΔ11-60 is a HA epitope-tagged Akt mutant with a deletion of the PH domain amino acids 11 to 60. The expression construct MT-Akt was generated by substituting the HA epitope tag with a 12-amino acid c-myc epitope tag (10Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D. Morrison D.K.

The c-myc epitope-tagged carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (Δ431-480) has been described previously (10Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A.

To generate a mammalian expression construct of the activated c-src (srcY527F), mutant DNA was transferred from the pUC18-based construct pcsrc527 (provided by R. Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) into CMV6. The v-Ha-ras, c-Ha-ras, and N17Ras expression constructs were described elsewhere (11Patriotis C. Makris A. Chernoff J. Tsichlis P.N.

Transient transfections of NIH 3T3 cells seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 0.5 × 106 cells/dish were carried out using 4 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed once with D-PBS, and then cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. The next day, the cells were stimulated with PDGF-AB (Life Technologies, Inc.) (50 ng/ml) as indicated. Cells treated with wortmannin were exposed to 200 nM concentration of the drug for 30 min prior to their treatment with PDGF-AB. Protein expression was determined by probing Western blots of total cell lysates with the appropriate antibodies. Alternatively, Western blots of immunoprecipitates used for in vitro kinase assays were probed with the same antibodies. In both cases, cells were lysed using a Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA). The expression of Akt or its mutants was determined using the anti-Akt-CT antibody (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Expression of srcY527F in NIH 3T3 or v-src in Sf9 cells was monitored using the anti-v-src monoclonal antibody 327 from Oncogene Science. Expression of v-Ha-ras was monitored using an anti-Ha-ras monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories. Detection of antigen-bound antibody was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) as described previously (10Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D.

Transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells or infected Sf9 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 48 h following transfection or infection, respectively. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and precleared with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-protein G (1:1) agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4°C for 20 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating the precleared lysates with the appropriate antibodies (anti-Akt-CT (dilution 1/500), anti-c-myc monoclonal 9E10 (dilution 1/1000) or anti-HA monoclonal 12CA5 (dilution 1/500)) and 40 μl of protein A-protein G agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer, once with water, and once with Akt kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2). Kinase assays were carried out as described previously (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

The anti-c-myc monoclonal 9E10 was harvested from ascites induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the corresponding hybridoma obtained from ATCC. To determine whether Akt is a direct target of the PI3-K, we expressed Akt in Sf9 cells and we examined its activity in the presence or absence of activated PI3-K. Immunoprecipitated Akt from Akt-expressing Sf9 cells was catalytically inactive. Coexpression of Akt with p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3-K, had little if any effect. However, coexpression of Akt with p110, the catalytic subunit of the PI3-K, or coexpression of Akt with p110 and p85 induced moderate Akt activation. Coexpression of PDGFRβ with Akt, p85, and p110 boosted further the Akt catalytic activity (Fig. 1A). Treatment of Sf9 cells coexpressing Akt, p85, p110, and PDGFRβ with nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin (200 nM) inhibited the activation of Akt (Fig. 1B). The effect of the PDGFRβ on the activity of Akt, in the absence of PDGF, was hypothesized to be due to the overexpression and spontaneous dimerization and activation of the receptor (12Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by probing Western blots of total lysates of PDGFRβ expressing Sf9 cells with the antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (UBI). The results showed that the overexpressed receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the absence of growth factor stimulation (Fig. 2). Overall, the results of these experiments revealed that the PI3-K-dependent activation of Akt by PDGF can be reproduced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and provided additional independent evidence that Akt is a direct target of the PI3-K.Fig. 2Overexpressed PDGFRβ is constitutively active in Sf9 cells.

This, combined with the activation of Akt by in vitro incubation with enzymatically synthesized PPIs, suggested that Akt is activated as a result of the interaction of these PPIs with the PH domain (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). However, studies by others on the activation of Akt by insulin suggested that the PH domain may not be required for Akt activation (7Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Because of these conflicting data, we re-examined the role of the PH domain on the activation of Akt. To this end, Sf9 cells were infected with p85, p110, and wild type or mutant Akt baculovirus constructs. The Akt mutants included the PH domain mutants Akt Δ11-35, Akt R25C, and Akt Δ11-60 and the kinase-deficient mutant Akt K179M. All the Akt baculovirus constructs were HA-tagged at their amino terminus. The baculovirus-infected cells were then stimulated by coexpression of the PDGFRβ. Some of the cultures expressing wild type Akt were treated with wortmannin (200 nM) for 30 min prior to lysis. In vitro kinase assays of Akt immunoprecipitated from cells starved of serum overnight confirmed that Akt is activated by PDGFRβ-generated signals and that its activation is inhibited by wortmannin. However, the Akt mutants Δ11-35 and R25C, as well as the kinase-deficient mutant K179M, failed to respond to the PDGFRβ (Fig. 3). These findings confirmed that the activation of Akt by PI3-K-mediated signals is PH domain-dependent. One of the PH domain mutants examined in this experiment, Δ11-60, was active in the absence of PI3-K-transduced Akt activation signals. This mutant failed to respond to the PDGFRβ, but was still sensitive to wortmannin (Fig. 3). Since deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tails of several kinases, including Src (13Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and Tpl-2, 4J. D. Ceci, C. Patriotis, A. M. Makris, C. Tsatsanis, R. Kovatch, D. A. Swins, N. A. Jenkins, P. N. Tsichlis, and N. G. Copeland, manuscript in preparation. induces constitutive kinase activation, we examined the activity of a c-myc epitope-tagged mutant of Akt carrying a partial carboxyl-terminal tail deletion (Δ431-480). The mutant was expressed in Sf9 cells either alone or in combination with p85, p110, and PDGFRβ and was shown to be inactive both in the absence and in the presence of the activated PI3-K (Fig. 3). The same mutant also failed to be activated by PDGF when transfected transiently into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). Since Akt activation has been linked to phosphorylation (4Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal tail of Akt contains several potential phosphorylation sites (1Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), we suggest that the tail may be the site of phosphorylation events critical for Akt activation. The preceding data confirmed our earlier observations that Akt is an immediate target of the growth factor-activated PI3-K (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The activation of the PI3-K by growth factors is mediated by several intracellular signaling molecules. Src, one of the molecules that may contribute to the transduction of PI3-K-activation signals, interacts, via its SH3 domain, with the proline-rich domain of p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3-K (14Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Ras, another such molecule, interacts directly with the PI3-K catalytic subunit p110 (9Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). To determine the biological outcome of these interactions, we first examined whether activated Src and Ha-ras activate the PI3-K and Akt in Sf9 cells. To this end, Sf9 cells were infected with HA-Akt, p85, and p110 baculovirus constructs and they were superinfected with activated src (v-src), activated Ha-ras (v-Ha-ras), or v-src plus v-Ha-ras baculovirus constructs. Subsequently, Akt was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Akt-CT antibody, and its activity was measured in vitro. The results (Fig. 5) confirmed that v-src, v-Ha-ras, and the combination of the two activate Akt in a PI3-K-dependent manner. The activation of Akt by v-src plus v-Ha-ras was partially inhibited by the dominant negative mutant N17Ras. Moreover, similarly to the activation of Akt by PDGFRβ, its activation by v-src and v-Ha-ras was also inhibited by mutations in the PH domain and by wortmannin (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Akt specific activity in Sf9 cells. Specific activity of wild type Akt and Akt PH domain mutants in Sf9 cells expressing p85 and p110 in the presence or absence of v-src plus v-Ha-ras. Cells expressing wild type Akt and these Akt-activating molecules were also treated with wortmannin. Specific kinase activity was determined by dividing the PhosphorImager-obtained values of 32P incorporation into the Akt substrate by the relative expression of Akt as measured by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The preceding data showed that Akt can be activated in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, both by growth factors and by v-src and/or v-Ha-ras in a PI3-K-dependent manner. The activation of Akt by v-src and/or v-Ha-ras in Sf9 cells predicted that Akt may also be activated by these molecules in mammalian cells. To test this hypothesis, NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with an MT-Akt expression construct and expression constructs of activated src (srcY527F) (8Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and v-Ha-ras separately or in combination. Following overnight serum starvation, Akt was immunoprecipitated with the anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and in vitro kinase assays were carried out on the immunoprecipitates. The results showed that Akt is activated by srcY527F, v-Ha-ras, and by the combination of the two not only in Sf9 but also in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 7). The activation of Akt by Src and Ha-ras also depends on the integrity of the Akt PH domain (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Akt specific activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Specific activity of wild type and mutant Akt proteins transiently cotransfected with activated Src (Y527F) and v-Ha-ras into NIH 3T3 cells. The harvested cells were either serum-starved or serum-starved and PDGF-stimulated. The specific activities of wild type and mutant Akt were measured as described in the legend of Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented in this manuscript show that the activation of Akt via the PI3-K can be reproduced faithfully in Sf9 cells and provide support to the hypothesis that Akt is a direct target of the PI3-K. Moreover, they show that the activation of the PI3-K by both growth factors and intracellular signaling molecules is sufficient to activate Akt in both Sf9 and mammalian cells. Earlier studies had shown that Akt activation by PDGF requires that the Akt protein has an intact PH domain (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). This observation combined with the in vitro activation of Akt by enzymatically synthesized PPIs was interpreted to suggest that Akt activation depends on the direct interaction between the Akt PH domain and PI3-K-generated PPIs (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The validity of this hypothesis, however, was questioned because of independent studies showing that the PH domain is dispensable for Akt activation by insulin (7Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Due to these conflicting data, we proceeded to re-evaluate the role of the PH domain in the PDGF-induced activation of Akt. The results reported here confirmed that only Akt with an intact PH domain can be fully activated and provided support to the hypothesis that Akt activation is induced by binding of PI3-K-generated PPIs to the PH domain. Alternatively, these mutations could lock Akt into a nonactivatable conformation. Such a conformational change could interfere with the ability of Akt to form dimers (10Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or to interact with other proteins or it could block its stimulation-dependent translocation to the cell membrane. The differences between PDGF and insulin regarding the role of the PH domain in Akt activation could perhaps be due to differences in signaling between these factors. Among the Akt PH domain mutants, particularly interesting was the mutant AktΔ11-60 which showed high constitutive kinase activity but failed to respond to PDGFRβ-generated signals. The high basal kinase activity of the AktΔ11-60 mutant suggests that mutations in the PH domain may either increase the affinity of the PH domain to activating PPIs or abrogate the binding of inhibitory PPIs. The former possibility appears to be supported by the fact that the kinase activity of this mutant is partially inhibited by wortmannin. Alternatively, such mutations may lock the Akt protein in an active conformation perhaps because they may affect its ability to form dimers or to interact with other proteins. The carboxyl-terminal tails of several kinases appear to play important regulatory roles. Thus, truncation of the carboxyl-terminal tail of c-src (13Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and Tpl-24 (15Patriotis C. Makris A. Bear S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or mutation of Tyr-527 of c-src into phenylalanine (16Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S. Kaplan P.L. Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) activate these kinases constitutively. The data presented in this report show that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of Akt gives rise to a protein that is catalytically inactive and fails to respond to the activated PI3-K. Therefore, the Akt carboxyl-terminal tail may also play a regulatory role which is, however, qualitatively different from that of the c-src and Tpl-2 tails. The tail contribution to the regulation of the Akt kinase activity could be mediated through its interaction with residues in the kinase domain. Such interactions could maintain the protein in an activable conformation. A proline-rich region in the tail (amino acids 423-427) may provide the flexibility required for this function. Since the tail contains several potential phosphorylation sites, the proposed interaction between the tail and the kinase domain of Akt could be regulated by phosphorylation. Such carboxyl-terminal tail phosphorylation events have been proposed to also contribute to the regulation of other kinases such as Raf-1 (17Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), p70S6K (18Han J-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The finding that Akt is activated directly by the PI3-K suggested that all growth factors and intracellular signaling molecules that activate the PI3-K may also activate Akt. Here we examined the potential role of two such signaling molecules, Ha-ras and Src, in Akt activation. c-Ha-ras is known to interact with, and to activate p110, the catalytic subunit of the PI3-K (9Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Moreover, our earlier studies had shown that the PDGF-mediated activation of Akt is inhibited by the dominant negative mutant RasN17 transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Src and other src-related kinases, on the other hand, are known to interact through their SH3 domains with a proline-rich region (amino acids 84-99) in the regulatory subunit of the PI3-K (14Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, p85 appears to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and contributes to the activation of the PI3-K (14Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The results of the experiments reported here confirmed that both v-src (or srcY527F) and v-Ha-ras, as well as the combination of the two, activate Akt in Sf9 and mammalian cells in a PI3-K-dependent manner. In summary, the data presented in this report showed that the activation of Akt by the PI3-K can be reproduced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and provided additional support to the hypothesis that Akt is a direct target of the PI3-K. The same data showed that Akt is activated by both growth factors and intracellular signaling molecules that transduce growth factor-generated signals that activate the PI3-K. Finally, both the PH domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail of Akt play critical roles in regulating its activity.

https://openalex.org/W2001237845,"c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, is activated in response to many stressful stimuli including heat shock, UV irradiation, protein synthesis inhibitors, and inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether JNK plays a role in the cellular response to different drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. Treatment of human KB-3 carcinoma cells with Adriamycin resulted in a time- and dose-dependent activation of JNK of up to 40-fold. Treatment with vinblastine or etoposide (VP-16) also activated JNK, with maximum increases of 6.5- and 4.3-fold, respectively. Consistent with these findings, increased c-Jun phosphorylation was observed after drug treatment of cells. In contrast, none of the drugs significantly activated the extracellular response kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Since these drugs are transport substrates for the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein, JNK was assayed in two multidrug-resistant (MDR) KB cell lines, KB-A1 and KB-V1, selected for resistance to Adriamycin and vinblastine, respectively. Relative to KB-3 cells, basal JNK activity was increased 7-fold in KB-A1 cells and 4-fold in KB-V1 cells, with no change in JNK protein expression, indicating that JNK is present in a more highly activated form in the MDR cell lines. Under conditions optimal for JNK activation, Adriamycin, vinblastine, and VP-16 all induced MDR1 mRNA expression in KB-3 cells. Our findings suggest that JNK activation is an important component of the cellular response to several structurally and functionally distinct anticancer drugs and may also play a role in the MDR phenotype."

Clonal derivatives were characterized for expression of the human apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 isoforms. An apoE4-expressing clonal cell line and a non-expressing clonal control cell line were loaded overnight with either [3H]cholesterol or [3H]choline. The cells were washed and incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium with or without the addition of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP). Only the apoE-secreting cells and only in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP released large amounts of labeled cholesterol or phosphatidylcholine into the medium. Mass analyses of cellular free and esterified cholesterol confirmed the results of the labeling studies; a decrease in cellular cholesterol content was observed in the 8-Br-cAMP-treated apoE-secreting cells, concurrent with an increase in cholesterol found in the medium. FPLC analysis of the medium demonstrated that 8-Br-cAMP treatment of the apoE-secreting cells led to an increased size fraction and amount of a peak of secreted cholesterol which comigrated with apoE. The 8-Br-cAMP-mediated increase in cholesterol efflux was also observed in non-apoE-secreting cells incubated with exogenous apoE or apoAI, and the effect of apoE was saturable. The apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 isoforms were equally efficient in promoting 8-Br-cAMP-dependent cholesterol efflux. Reductive methylation of apoE abolished its ability to promote 8-Br-cAMP-dependent cholesterol efflux. Brefeldin A and monensin, inhibitors of protein processing through the Golgi, both blocked the 8-Br-cAMP stimulation of cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE. 8-Br-cAMP induced specific apoE and apoAI binding, but not apoE degradation, by the RAW cells. We present a model wherein cAMP induces a membrane apolipoprotein receptor that does not lead to endocytosis and degradation, but instead promotes the transfer of lipids to apolipoproteins, which can then be released from the cell.

The scavenger receptor mediates the binding and uptake of modified lipoproteins leading to an accumulation of cellular cholesterol, which is stored primarily as cholesterol esters (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Krieger M. Ho Y.K. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). When macrophages in the arterial intima become cholesterol laden, they are referred to as foam cells, due to their characteristic appearance in histologic specimens. The presence of clustered foam cells in a fatty streak is the earliest, and reversible, stage of atherosclerosis, which occurs even during adolescence (4Wissler R.W. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 108: S3-S20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ApoE is a ligand necessary for uptake by the LDL receptor and the LDL receptor related protein and can mediate the macrophage binding and uptake of LDL, VLDL, and β-VLDL (5Granot E. Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2133-2139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and could therefore mediate macrophage cholesterol accumulation. On the other hand, apoE secretion by macrophages could play a role in cholesterol removal from macrophages. This latter hypothesis is attractive due to the observed up-regulation of macrophage apoE mRNA, synthesis, and secretion by cholesterol loading (7Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11657-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that apoE may function directly in promoting the efflux of macrophage cholesterol, or it may function indirectly by binding to high density lipoprotein (HDL), which acts as an acceptor of macrophage cholesterol, and targets it for uptake by the liver (9Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The role of macrophage apoE secretion is not well understood; however, recent experiments using transgenic mice that express apoE only in macrophages prove that macrophage apoE is antiatherogenic, although the mechanism of the protective effect of apoE was not elucidated (10Bellosta S.

Basu et al. (9Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported in 1983 that apoE and cholesterol are secreted by independent pathways in mouse peritoneal macrophages. This conclusion was based on two observations; 1) cholesterol efflux occurs only when an exogenous acceptor is present while apoE secretion is constitutive, and 2) cholesterol efflux occurs at a dose of the protein secretion inhibitor monensin that significantly reduces immunoprecipitable apoE secretion (9Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, lipid free apoE and apoAI have been shown to act as acceptors of cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded macrophages (11Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study a novel model system was created to reevaluate the role and mechanism of apoE in macrophage cholesterol efflux.

Plump, unpublished results. was stably transfected with apoE expression vectors. These apoE-secreting cells, when cholesterol-loaded, secreted increased cholesterol or phospholipid into medium devoid of any exogenous cholesterol acceptors, but only in the presence of a cAMP analogue. ApoE can exert its effect on cholesterol efflux when supplied exogenously to RAW cells in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. Our data support a model that cAMP induces a cellular apoE receptor, which we propose to mediate the assembly of lipids with apoE and the subsequent release of the lipoprotein particle. The human apoE4 expression vector was derived from a previously described genomic apoE λ clone (15Das H.K. McPherson J. Bruns G.A.P. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol.

Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate method, as described previously (17Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8300-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation with the DNA solution, the cells were shocked with 30% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and fed with growth medium. On the following day, the cells were treated with 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) to select for cells stably integrating the neor gene. Two days later, the cells were trypsinized and plated into 100-mm culture dishes and fed with the selection medium. Individual colonies were picked 7-10 days later and expanded for analysis of apoE gene incorporation and expression. Initial analysis of genomic DNA prepared from neor clones was by PCR specific for the human apoE gene using primers E7 and E9 as described previously (18Emi M. Wu L.L. Robertson M.A. Myers R.L. Hegele R.A. Williams R.R. White R. Lalouel J.M. Genomics. 1988; 3: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Expression of human apoE mRNA was analyzed by an RNase protection assay (19Smith J.D. Plump A.S. Hayek T. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14709-14712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirmation of ubiquitous apoE expression by the clonal cell lines was obtained by immunohistochemistry as described below. Human apoE ELISA assays were performed with a kit (PerImmune, Rockville, MD) using human apoE serum standards provided by Dr. Peter Alaupovic (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). Immunohistochemistry for human apoE was performed on adherent cells fixed in methanol for 2 min; all incubations were performed at room temperature. Cells were treated with casein blocking buffer (Pierce) for 10 min, followed by a 60-min incubation with the goat anti-human apoE antiserum (INCstar, 1:100). After washing, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG (1:250). Staining was done with the 1-Step chloronaphthol reagent (Pierce). The dot blot immunoassay was performed by spotting 5μl of each sample and known dilutions of the human apoE standard onto nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked and then probed with goat anti-human apoE antiserum (1:1000). After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG (1:5000). The washed blots were developed in enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham) and exposed to x-ray film. The films were scanned by laser densitometry and the concentrations of apoE were determined by comparison with the known standards. Cells were labeled with Tran35S-label (mixture of methionine and cysteine, ICN) in methionine-free DMEM. To 1 ml of the collected medium, 50 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mg/ml aprotinin, 6 mg/ml benzamidine, 100 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin) and 5 μl of 200 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added. After centrifugation to remove cellular debris, radioactivity incorporated into protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Equal incorporated counts/min were added to 0.5 ml of buffer 3 (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 3 μl of goat anti-human apoE antiserum. After rocking overnight at 4°C, 50 μl of a 10% protein A-Sepharose suspension was added for an additional hour. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with buffer 3. The immunoprecipitated protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer and run on a discontinuous 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained, destained, and then processed for fluorography by soaking for 30 min each in water and 1 M sodium salicylate (pH 6.0) (20Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Cells in 24-well dishes were cholesterol-loaded and -labeled overnight in 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 50 μl/ml 1 M glucose, 10 μl/ml 200 mM glutamine, and 0.2% BSA (Sigma A6003) (referred to as DGGB) and with [3H]cholesterol (Amersham), which had been preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL), to yield a final concentration of 0.33 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol and 50 μg/ml AcLDL. AcLDL was prepared from human LDL as described previously (21Fraenkel-Conrat H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 247-269Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). On the following day, the cells were washed three times in PBS, 0.2% BSA and chased with 0.5-1 ml of DGGB; 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) was included as indicated. After the 24-h chase, a 100-μl aliquot of medium was taken for determination of radioactivity and the cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide, and the radioactivity in an aliquot was determined. The percentage of [3H]cholesterol secreted was calculated by dividing the medium-derived counts/min/dish by the sum of the medium-derived plus cell-derived counts/min. In some experiments, cells were chased with serum-free medium conditioned by incubating for 24 h with non-cholesterol-loaded apoE-secreting cells. In other experiments, cells were chased in DGGB plus apoE partially purified from apoE-secreting stably transfected RAW cells; apoE was purified from the conditioned medium by heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia) chromatography, as described previously (22Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purified human apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) was obtained from PerImmune. Reductive methylation of apoE-conditioned medium was performed with sodium borohydride and formaldehyde, as described previously (7Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7545-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and followed by extensive dialysis against serum-free medium. Chemical analysis of the 3H-labeled material in the medium was achieved by a Folch extraction (medium:methanol:chloroform, 3:4:8) (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the organic phase was dried down under nitrogen, resuspended in a small volume of chloroform, and spotted onto a silica gel-coated glass plate for thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis developed in heptane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:15:1.5) (25Madden E.A. Bishop E.J. Fiskin A.M. Melnykovych G. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 617-622PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesterol and cholesterol oleate standards migrated with RF values of 0.22 and 0.90, respectively. The plate was divided into five zones and scraped for determination of radioactivity. Cells in 24-well dishes were cholesterol-loaded and choline labeled overnight in 0.5 ml of DGGB supplemented with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]choline (Amersham) and 50 μg/ml AcLDL. On the following day, the cells were washed twice in PBS, 0.2% BSA and chased with 1 ml of DGGB with or without the addition of 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP. After 24 h, the chase medium was extracted by the addition of four volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1). The organic layer was dried under nitrogen, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined after the cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide. The percentage of secreted [3H]phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin was calculated by dividing the medium-derived lipid extracted (counts/min/dish) by the sum of the medium-derived plus cell-derived counts/min. Cholesterol and cholesterol ester mass analyses were performed on 55-mm cultures washed with PBS, 0.2% BSA and twice with PBS. Lipids were extracted in hexane:isopropanol (3:2), and 40 μl of 1 mg/ml coprostanol in dimethyl sulfoxide was added as an internal standard for sample recovery. Coprostanol standard was added to tissue culture medium before extraction in medium:methanol:chloroform (3:4:8). The solvent from either plate or medium extraction was removed and dried under nitrogen. The organic residue was dissolved in a small volume of carbon disulfide, and free cholesterol was determined by injection into a Perkin Elmer 8500 gas chromatograph with a 6-meter column packed with OV-17 and 3% WHP 160/120. Total cholesterol was determined in a similar manner after saponification of the lipid extract in tetramethylammonium hydroxide for 1 h at 80°C. Cholesterol esters were calculated as the difference between the total and free cholesterol. The protein content of the extracted plates was determined by a modified alkaline Lowry procedure (26Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). ApoE-secreting and control cells were cultured in p150 dishes and cholesterol-loaded and -labeled overnight by incubation with 50 μg/ml AcLDL and 0.33 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in DGGB. Cells were chased for 24 h in 20 ml of DGGB with or without the addition of 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP. The chase media from two dishes were pooled and concentrated to 1.5 ml with a Centriprep 10 (Millipore). 0.5-ml aliquots were separated by FPLC using two Superose 6 (Pharmacia) columns in series and eluted at 0.3 ml/min with 1 mM EDTA in 0.15 M sodium chloride. 1-ml fractions were collected, and [3H]cholesterol radioactivity was determined in 0.1-ml aliquots. The apoE concentration in each fraction was determined by the quantitative immunodot blot assay, described above. 50 μg of apoE2 (PerImmune) in 0.1 M sodium borate was iodinated with 250 μCi of 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (DuPont NEN), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The radiolabed apoE was purified by Sephadex G-50 chromatography, in a column preabsorbed with 0.1% gelatin. The specific activity of the 125I-apoE2 was 3171 cpm/ng apoE, determined by γ counting and the apoE ELISA assay. Binding was performed in 24-well dishes, which were preincubated overnight with 50 μg/ml AcLDL in DGGB with or without the addition of 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP. On the following day the cells were put on ice, washed twice with PBS, 0.2% BSA, and incubated on ice for 1 h with 50-500 ng/ml 125I-apoE2 in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 50 μg/ml unlabeled apoE2 (purified from apoE2-secreting cells). The cells were washed once in cold PBS, 0.2% BSA and twice in cold PBS, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide. 125I radioactivity was determined from a 0.1-ml aliquot, and cell protein was determined on a 20-μl sample using the alkaline modification of the Lowry assay (26Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding, and was normalized per mg of cell protein. Cellular association and degradation of 125I-apoE2 was determined in cells preincubated with AcLDL and ± 8-Br-cAMP as above. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 200 ng/ml 125I-apoE2 in the absence or presence of both 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP and 20 mg/ml unlabeled apoE2. Cellular association of 125I-apoE was determined after solubilizing the cells in 0.5 ml of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide, and was normalized per milligram of cell protein. 125I-ApoE degradation was determined from the 125I-tyrosine recovered in the media, by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation protocol in which free 125I was excluded (27Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific uptake and degradation were calculated by subtracting the nonspecific uptake and degradation measured in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled apoE2. ApoAI was purified from human HDL and labeled with 125I by the iodine monochloride method, as described previously (28Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The specific activity was determined by γ counting and by an apoAI turbidometric assay (INCstar). ApoAI binding was performed as above with 500 ng/ml 125I-apoAI in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml amounts of various apolipoprotein competitors. Trypsin treatment (250 μg/ml) was performed immediately prior to binding for 15 min at 37°C, followed by extensive PBS washing. Tests of significance and linear regression analysis were performed using the InStat statistical software program from GraphPAd Software (San Diego, CA). RAW 264 cells were co-transfected, as described above, with human apoE expression vectors driven by the SV40 promoter and a neomycin resistance plasmid. Stably transfected cells expressing the neomycin resistance gene were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin. In order to obtain a population of cells that uniformly made apoE, individual colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for the presence of the human apoE gene by PCR analysis of genomic DNA. Expression of human apoE mRNA was analyzed by an RNase protection assay, and secretion of apoE into the medium was analyzed by ELISA. Four clonal lines were selected and characterized: 1) a line serving as a negative control, which was transfected with the neomycin resistance gene alone and did not express apoE; 2) a line expressing apoE4; 3) a line expressing apoE3; and 4) a line expressing apoE2. ApoE immunohistochemistry revealed the absence of staining of the control clone and the uniformly positive apoE staining of the apoE-expressing cell lines (data not shown). Cells were labeled for 4 h with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine plus cysteine, and the total secreted proteins along with immunoprecipitated human apoE were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. Only the apoE-secreting cells yielded labeled immunoprecipitated protein that migrated as a doublet of approximately 35.5 and 34 kDa, presumably due to glycosylation heterogeneity (data not shown). For cholesterol pulse-chase studies, the control and apoE4-secreting cells were labeled by incubating overnight in serum-free medium with 50 μg/ml human AcLDL that had been preincubated with [3H]cholesterol. Upon a subsequent 24-h chase period in serum-free, BSA-containing medium without the addition of 8-Br-cAMP, there was no difference in cholesterol efflux between cell types (Fig. 1A). However, if the cells were treated with 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP, there was a dramatic increase in cholesterol efflux from the apoE4-secreting cells. The apoE- and 8-Br-cAMP-dependent effect on cholesterol efflux in pulse-chase studies was observed consistently in multiple independent experiments performed over a 3-year period. This effect was also observed in independently isolated clones of apoE3- and apoE2-expressing stable transfectants. The absolute percent of cholesterol efflux from the apoE4-secreting cells in the basal and 8-Br-cAMP-treated states was variable, with 8-Br-cAMP effect ranging from 2-fold to over 8-fold. The identity of the labeled material released by the [3H]cholesterol-loaded apoE-secreting cells into the chase medium was investigated. Over 96% of the radioactivity was recovered in the organic fraction after extraction. This organic extracted material was subjected to silica gel thin layer chromatography, and greater than 96% of the radioactivity migrated in the free cholesterol zone. Many control experiments were performed to probe the specificity of the apoE and 8-Br-cAMP response. We demonstrated that the active cAMP analogues dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP were as effective as 8-Br-cAMP in promoting cholesterol efflux from the apoE-secreting cells, while 8-Br-cGMP and two inhibitors of ACAT (58-035 and C1-976) had little effect (data not shown). The apoE and 8-Br-cAMP effect on cholesterol efflux was not dependent upon the addition of BSA to the chase medium, although the fold effect was lower in the absence of BSA (data not shown). BSA, presumably by blocking nonspecific protein binding sites on the culture dishes, led to increased accumulation of apoE in the medium, which varied with different lots of BSA. Treatment with 0.3 mM 8-Br-cAMP, in an experiment that led to a 4-fold increase in [3H]cholesterol efflux, had no effect on apoE levels in the chase medium (14 μg/ml). In dose-response experiments, the maximal dose of 8-Br-cAMP in promoting cholesterol efflux from apoE-secreting cells was determined to be 0.1-0.3 mM, and the half-maximal effect was calculated to be at approximately 40 μM (data not shown). Progesterone, which is reported to block cholesterol translocation from lysosomes (29Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreased the basal level of cholesterol efflux by 30%, but did not inhibit the increased efflux mediated by 8-Br-cAMP (data not shown). Phospholipid efflux was determined in experiments where cells were labeled with [3H]choline and chased in serum-free conditions in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cAMP. Organic solvent extraction of the chase media was used to determine radioactivity in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Similar to the cholesterol efflux effect, there was a large 8-Br-cAMP-dependent increase in phospholipid efflux from the apoE-secreting cells, but not from the control cells. (Fig. 1B). Phospholipid efflux from apoE-secreting cells was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP even if the cells were not cholesterol-loaded, although the stimulation fold was reduced by 19% compared with AcLDL-loaded cells (data not shown). In addition to determining the efflux of labeled cholesterol, we also directly measured the mass of free and esterified cholesterol in apoE-secreting cells with or without 8-Br-cAMP treatment. ApoE-secreting cells grown in 10% FCS contained approximately 15 μg of free cholesterol/mg of cell protein, and less than 1 μg/mg of cholesterol esters. ApoE-secreting cells were cholesterol-loaded by overnight incubation with 50 μg/ml AcLDL, and then chased for an additional 24 h with or without the addition of 0.1 mM 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 2). AcLDL incubation dramatically increased the levels of both free and esterified cholesterol. The cellular free, esterified, and total cholesterol were less in the 8-Br-cAMP chased cells compared with the control chased cells. These decreases occurred in the 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells without a substantial change in the ratio of free to esterified cholesterol (1.16 versus 1.19 for control and treated cells, respectively). The medium free cholesterol was also determined, revealing a substantial accumulation of cholesterol mass only in medium from the treated cells (18.4"

The expression of flt-1 gene is restricted to endothelial cells in vivo. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying endothelial-specific expression of this gene, we studied the functional significance of transcriptional motifs in the 200-base pair region of the human flt-1 gene promoter, which has been identified to confer cell type specificity. By point mutation analysis using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids in 293E1 cells, which express significant levels of flt-1 mRNA, we found that an Ets motif, E4, at −54 to −51 and a cAMP response element (CRE) at −83 to −76 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. Disruption of either this CRE or E4 within the promoter sequence of 90 base pairs resulted in a decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of 90%, indicating that co-existence of both of CRE and Ets motif E4 is necessary for transcription of the flt-1 gene. Co-transfection of an expression vector containing c-ets-1, c-ets-2, or c-erg cDNA with this 90-base pair sequence yielded a 5-8-fold elevation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, further supporting the idea that Ets family protein(s) participates in the regulation of the flt-1 gene. Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts of 293E1 and endothelial cells demonstrated the existence of protein factor(s) that specifically binds to CRE and Ets motif E4, respectively. Taken together, our results strongly suggest cooperation of a CRE and an Ets motif for the function of the flt-1 gene promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1991289203,"Inhibitors of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) and a related group of cysteine aspartases of the ICE/ced-3 family inhibit cell death in a variety of settings, including in PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons following withdrawal of trophic support. To assess the particular member(s) of the ICE/ced-3 family that are relevant to cell death and to position their activation within the apoptotic pathway, we have used specific substrates to measure ICE-like and CPP32-like enzymatic activity in naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells that had been deprived of trophic support (nerve growth factor and/or serum). Rapid induction of CPP32-like, but not ICE-like, activity was observed. c-Jun kinase activation and the action of bcl-2 and other survival agents, such as cell cycle blockers, a NO generator, N-acetylcysteine, aurintricarboxylic acid, and actinomycin D occurred at a point further upstream in the apoptotic pathway compared with the aspartase activation. In living cells, zVAD-FMK, a pseudosubstrate aspartase inhibitor, blocked the activity/activation of the aspartase at concentrations about one order of magnitude lower than those required to promote survival, raising the possibility that the CPP32-like aspartase is not the main death effector in this model.

Apoptosis is the predominant form of programmed cell death during development. It is characterized by cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and the absence of an inflammatory response. Apoptotic neuronal cell death occurs normally during development and may also occur in a variety of neurological disorders. The development of strategies to arrest apoptotic death of neurons may, therefore, be used to ameliorate a number of neurological afflictions (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar, 2Bredesen D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The temporal sequence of events leading from the apoptotic stimulus to nuclear fragmentation and death of cells, including neurons, is unknown, but a number of clues have emerged from the study of Caenorhabditis elegans, which exhibits a highly regulated pattern of cell death (3Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Three genes in particular have emerged as important in this respect: ced-3 and ced-4 act as a pro-apoptotic genes (4Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), whereas ced-9 acts as an anti-apoptotic gene (5Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R.

Bcl-2 and a related group of proteins, some of which have an anti-apoptotic effect and some of which are pro-apoptotic, are the mammalian homologues of ced-9 (6Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R.

However, the particular member(s) of the aspartase family that may be important in each system and their relative positions within the apoptotic pathway remain to be determined. The general principles outlined above are relevant to apoptotic neuronal cell death. Bcl-2 prevents neuronal cell death in a variety of settings (7Davies A.M. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CrmA inhibits cell death of chick dorsal root ganglia cells following withdrawal of NGF (29Gagliardini V.

We have shown, using naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons, that zVAD-FMK, a competitive irreversible inhibitor of ICE, and V-ICEinh, a newly designed peptide inhibitor that mimics the shared catalytic site of the cysteine aspartases of the ICE/ced-3 family, prevent cell death due to withdrawal of trophic support and to oxidative stress (31Troy C.M.

In this study, we have begun to investigate the specific aspartases that are activated in response to withdrawal of trophic support from neuronal cells. To achieve this, we used the strategy of measuring enzymatic activity using substrates of the most representative aspartases of each of the two subdivisions, i.e. ICE of the ICE-like and CPP32 of the ced3-like subdivision. To provide sufficiently homogeneous material for experimentation, we used cultured PC12 cells, which have proved to be useful for studying mechanisms of neuronal apoptotic death (33Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J.

Science. 1996; 270: 1326-1331Crossref Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). In these cells, as is the case of their sympathetic neuron counterparts, the withdrawal of trophic support in the form of NGF and/or serum evokes stereotyped apoptotic death of the entire population. This approach has enabled us to identify a CPP32-like aspartase activity that is greatly increased prior to apoptotic death caused by trophic factor withdrawal and whose activation is inhibited by a number of agents that suppress death. These studies also permit us to draw conclusions about the temporal sequence of events leading to apoptosis and to position this aspartase activity relative to other events in the apoptotic pathway. Finally, we have been able to evaluate the potential role of this enzyme in the apoptotic cascade. PC12 cells were grown as described previously (33Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar) on rat tail, collagen-coated dishes in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (complete medium). Neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were grown for at least 14 days in RPMI 1640 containing 0-1% horse serum and 100 ng/ml NGF. PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 or an empty neomycin-resistant construct (lines bcl-2.1 and PC12neo.1, respectively) were generated and characterized as described previously (39Batistatou A. Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4422-4428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were mechanically dissociated from 100-mm dishes after five rinses with serum-free RPMI 1640 and were washed with the same medium three to four times by centrifugation and resuspension. Cells were replated in collagen-coated 35-mm dishes in the case of the naive cells and in collagen-coated 24-well dishes in the case of the neuronally differentiated cells. At the indicated time points, the numbers of viable cells were determined by quantifying the number of intact nuclei, as described previously (33Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Counts were performed in triplicate and reported as means ± S.E. At the indicated time points following withdrawal of trophic support, naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were harvested for the assays of aspartase activity. Cells were rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then collected in a buffer of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cellular material was left for 20 min on ice and then was sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 160,000 × g, and the supernatant was quick frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C (9Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D.

Protein concentrations of the lysates were quantified using the Bradford method (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Lysate (25 μg of protein except where indicated) were incubated at 37°C in a buffer of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mM dithiothreitol with the fluorogenic substrates DEVD-AFC, which mimics the cleavage site on PARP, and YVAD-AFC, which mimics the cleavage site on pIL-1β. Typically, 15 μM DEVD-AFC and 25 μM YVAD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) were used. Cleavage of the substrates emitted a fluorescent signal that was quantified in a SLM 8000 fluorometer (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). Radioactively labeled substrates were generated by in vitro transcription/translation. An IL-1β construct encoding the 31-kDa pIL-1β protein was kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Hardwick (Johns Hopkins University) in a pSGS vector. Purified ICE, which was used as a positive control, was kindly provided by Dr. N. A. Thornberry (Merck Laboratories). A PARP construct encoding a 48-kDa truncated form of PARP (tPARP) comprising the first 338 N-terminal amino acids and including the cleavage site by CPP32 within the DNA-binding domain was constructed by Dr. John Collier in a PET15 vector and kindly provided to us by Dr. David Fisher (both of Harvard University). Following generation of mRNA using T7 RNA polymerase, translation was performed using reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) in the presence of S35-labeled methionine (DuPont NEN). The radioactively labeled products were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37°C with the indicated amounts of lysates of PC12 cells in a buffer of 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mM dithiothreitol. Subsequently, the products of the reaction were resolved by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 12 or 15%. The gel was dried and fluorography was performed (15Nicholson D.W. Ali A.

At the indicated time points, the cells were mechanically detached, and one-half were processed for the DEVD-AFC cleavage activity assay, as described above, while the other one-half were processed for the c-Jun kinase activity assay, as described previously. Briefly, c-Jun kinase activity was affinity purified from cell extracts with recombinant glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun. c-Jun kinase activity recovered from each sample was determined by an in vitro solid phase kinase radioassay. Glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun was resolved by PAGE (8.5% acrylamide), and incorporation of 32PO4 was quantified by autoradiography and densitometry (32Park D.S. Stefanis L. Yan C.Y.I.

Flavopiridol was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Worland (National Institutes of Health). Human recombinant NGF was kindly provided by Genentech. The fluorogenic substrate YVAD-AFC, which mimics the cleavage site at which ICE cleaves pIL-1β, was used to detect ICE-like protease activity in lysates of PC12 cells that were plated in serum-free medium for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h with or without NGF treatment. Under these conditions, approximately 75% of the untreated PC12 cells undergo apoptotic death within 24 h, whereas >90% of the NGF-treated cells survive (44Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). There was no difference in substrate cleavage between the two sets of lysates. The low level of activity observed was not inhibited by high concentrations of the competitive irreversible ICE inhibitors AcYVAD-CMK or zVAD-FMK (>10 × substrate concentration), implying that this was a nonspecific activity (data not shown). These results were confirmed with the use of radioactively labeled pIL-1β as a substrate. Despite demonstrable cleavage by purified ICE, there was no cleavage of pIL-1β by lysates of serum-deprived PC12 cells undergoing death (Fig. 1). In addition, there was no induction of YVAD-AFC cleavage in lysates of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells that had been deprived of NGF for 5, 24, or 36 h (data not shown). These findings indicate that PC12 cells do not show detectable activation of ICE-like protease activity before or during apoptotic death triggered by loss of trophic support. By contrast with our findings for ICE activity, lysates of serum-deprived PC12 cells consistently brought about cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC (Fig. 2A). This substrate mimics the PARP cleavage site by CPP32. The activity was inhibited in vitro by very low concentrations of the reversible pseudosubstrate inhibitor DEVD-CHO (apparent Ki, 0.12 nM). However, even with saturating concentrations of the inhibitor (1 μM with a substrate concentration of 15 μM), there was a very small amount of residual activity, which was calculated as 0.007 nmol of AFC released/μg protein/min. This activity appears to represent background nonspecific substrate cleavage activity and was subsequently subtracted from all measurements. With a concentration of 15 μM, DEVD-AFC cleavage by up to 100 μg of lysate protein was linear for at least 2 h. The apparent Km for the activity was calculated to be 16.7 μM. Significant DEVD-AFC cleavage activity was observed by 2 h following serum deprivation. By 5 h, the activity reached a peak and thereafter plateaued until 10 h. By 17 h, activity began to decrease. Lysates of serum-deprived PC12 cells that had been treated with NGF showed an approximately 7-fold lower activity (Fig. 2A). Parallel assessment of surviving cells revealed that the DEVD-AFC cleavage activity preceded the onset of death and roughly correlated with the rate of death (Fig. 2B). These results with DEVD-AFC were confirmed by measuring the cleavage of radioactively labeled tPARP (Fig. 3). The time course for the appearance of this activity following serum deprivation was similar to the one observed for the fluorogenic substrate. The 48-kDa substrate yielded products of approximate sizes of 28 and 20 kDa. This cleavage activity was inhibited by 50 nM DEVD-CHO (Fig. 4). The size of the products argues for cleavage of PARP at residue 216, as has been observed for CPP32 (15Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.D. Gallant M. Gareau Y.

Lysates of naive PC12 cells (4 μg of protein), harvested at 5 h following serum deprivation, and of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells (16 μg of protein), harvested at 24 h following NGF/serum deprivation, were incubated with radioactively labeled tPARP for 2 h at 37°C, in the presence or absence of 50 nM DEVD-CHO. The samples were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and fluorography was performed. Cleavage products are denoted by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar results were achieved with neuronally differentiated PC12 cells that were deprived of NGF in serum-free medium (Fig. 5). These also showed induction of DEVD-AFC cleavage activity that preceded cell death. However, the activity peaked later (after 24 h), was of a lower magnitude, and was more protracted in time course than for serum-deprived naive cells. This is consistent with the more gradual evolution of cell death of neuronally differentiated cells after NGF deprivation. Under these conditions, approximately 65% of cells undergo apoptotic death within 48 h (33Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of cells treated with NGF showed a much lower activity (Fig. 5). Cleavage of tPARP was again observed at the same site and was inhibited by 50 nM DEVD-CHO (Fig. 4). Our previous work has shown that the irreversible competitive pseudosubstrate inhibitors of ICE zVAD-FMK and AcYVAD-CMK, which act by mimicking the cleavage site on pIL-1β, offer protection from cell death in serum-deprived PC12 cells. zVAD-FMK is much more effective in this model, offering partial protection at a concentration of 10 μM and almost complete protection at 50 μM, whereas AcYVAD-CMK is only partially effective at a concentration of 250 μM (31Troy C.M.

Transformation, as measured by growth in soft agar, occurred only in the presence of appropriate ligand and only in cells expressing two different HER family members. Transfection of oncogenic neu (Tneu), conferred ligand-independent transformation only in cells which co-expressed HER1, HER3, or HER4, but not when expressed alone or with HER2. Cell lines were also tested for their ability to form tumors in animals. None of the cell lines expressing single HER family members was able to form tumors in animals with the exception of HER1, which was weakly tumorigenic. Although unable to form tumors when expressed alone, HER2 was tumorigenic when expressed with HER1 or HER3, but not HER4. Of all complexes analyzed, cells expressing HER1 + HER2 were the most aggressive. The relationship between HER1 activation, intracellular calcium fluxes, and phospholipase Cγ1 activation is well established. We found that activation of HER1 was required for the induction of a calcium flux and the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1. These activities were independent of, and unaffected by, the co-expression of any other family member. Further, heregulin stimulation of all cell lines including those containing HER1 did not demonstrate any effect on intracellular calcium levels or phospholipase Cγ1 phosphorylation. This demonstrates that heregulin induced cellular transformation by activating HER3- and HER4-containing complexes does not require the activation of either phospholipase Cγ1 or the mobilization of intracellular calcium.

Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have established that this family of receptors can associate with each other to form an array of heterodimer complexes (17Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol.

Therefore, the activation of one receptor could modulate the activities of other HER family members, when co-expressed in the same cell, and expand the repertoire of down stream signaling events. This is clearly the case for HER2, which in the absence of any HER2-specific ligand, can be transmodulated within a heterodimer complex by associating with other HER family members able to respond to their respective ligand(s). With the ability of these receptors to heterodimerize, it is essential that the study of any one receptor or heterodimer be done in a cell system devoid of endogenous HER expression. This became especially apparent in HER4-transfected NIH3T3 cells, that were able to form colonies in agar in response to both HRG and EGF (17Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4813-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The responsiveness to EGF correlated with the formation of a heterodimer complex between HER4 and the endogenous mouse EGF receptor (17Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4813-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To further examine the biochemical and biological properties of individual HER complexes, we have generated a collection of cell lines expressing all HERs alone or in all pairwise combinations in a clone of NIH3T3 cells (3T3-7d) (34Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D. Thimason A. Yoshinaga S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3884-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) devoid of detectable EGFR family members. We were able to demonstrate that transformation, as defined as growth in soft agar, was dependent upon the expression of multiple HER family members in the same cell, and was independent of intracellular calcium mobilization or PLCγ1 phosphorylation. 3T3-7d and HER-transfected 3T3-7d cell lines, previously characterized (34Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D. Thimason A. Yoshinaga S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3884-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 500 μg/ml G418 at 37°C in 5% CO2. All cell lines are mass cultures with the exception of HER2-, HER2 + 4-, and HER2 + 3-expressing lines where selected clones were isolated to equalize the level of HER2 expression. Transfection of Tneu (35Qian X. Dougall W.C. Fei Z. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar) was done using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were plated into a 32-mm dish, incubated overnight, and then transfected with 1.0 μg of Tneu plasmid and Lipofectamine for 5 h. Cells were fed and then passed into selection media the following day. Heregulin β2 used in all assays was synthesized as described previously (36Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12857-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the EGF domain of heregulin β2 was fused to the Fc portion of a human IgG1 gene, and this construct was transfected and expressed in COS cells. The heregulin portion of the purified IgG1 fusion was cleaved away from the Fc domain with thrombin and purified. EGF was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were trypsinized and approximately 1 × 104 cells were mixed with 0.4% agar, DMEM, 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), and plated on top of an existing basement layer of 0.6% agar. The basement agar layer consisted of DMEM, 10% FBS, plus 200 μg/ml EGF or HRG. 1 × 105 cells of 3T3-7d transfected cell lines expressing HER1, HER2, HER3, HER1 + 2, HER1 + 3, HER1 + 4, or HER2 + 3 cells were injected subcutaneously above the lateral aspect of the pelvis. Measurements were taken at week 4, and volumes were calculated. Cells grown in 100 mm dishes were lysed by adding 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) to the plate. Each HER was immunoprecipitated from the extract using 2 μg of receptor-specific monoclonal antibody (HER1-AB1, Oncogene Science; HER2-AB2, Neomarkers Inc.; HER3-AB3, Neomarkers Inc.; HER4-10-4-4 2B. D. Cohen, P. A. Kiener, J. M. Green, L. Foy, H. P. Fell, and K. Zhang, manuscript in preparation.). with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of goat anti-mouse IgG-linked agarose (Sigma). The mixture was mixed for 60 min at 4°C. Samples were washed twice with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Blotting for receptor expression was done using the following antibodies: HER1-06-129, Upstate Biotechnology; HER2-AB3, Oncogene Science; HER3-AB3, Neomarkers Inc.; HER4-SC-283, Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were done with PY20 from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PLCγ1 were developed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 461-481, which were conjugated to ovalbumin. All immunoblotting experiments used 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse or rabbit second antibody for detection (Dupont NEN) at a 1:500 dilution. The exposure times and PhosphorImager profile for the anti-phosphotyrosine blots were similar to enable a relative comparison in receptor phosphorylation intensity. The HER3 + 4 cell line was exposed longer, to enhance a weak signal, which is evident by the grainy background. The mobilization of intracellular calcium was followed essentially as described previously (37Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were detached from tissue culture plates by incubation for 5 min at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and then suspended in fresh culture medium containing 2 μM Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37°C. Cells were washed three times in analysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% glucose, 1% fetal calf serum) and resuspended to a final concentration of 1 × 106/ml immediately before analysis. Calcium level was determined from the fluorescence ratio (405:495 nm) with excitation at 350 nm in an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer using dual monochronometers and the Ca2+ acquisition mode. Calibration was established as described previously (37Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3T3-7d cell line which is devoid of detectable HER family expression were transfected with expression plasmids encoding each of the HER family members. Cell lines were isolated that expressed the receptors individually or all possible pairwise combinations. The level of receptor expression within each HER family subtype, as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western analysis using receptor specific antibodies, was similar in all cell lines (Fig. 1). The level of receptor activity in response to ligand, as measured by the change in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated. Cells were stimulated with EGF or HRG, and the HERs were immunoprecipitated with receptor-specific antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2). In the absence of added ligand, the steady state level of HER receptor phosphorylation was affected by the co-expression of other HER family members. Specifically, HER1 phosphorylation was elevated when expressed alone or when co-expressed with HER3. However, when co-expressed with HER2 or HER4, the level of ligand independent phosphorylation decreased. HER2 phosphorylation was elevated in all cell lines except when co-expressed with HER3. HER3 phosphorylation was stimulated when co-expressed with HER1 and HER2 but not HER4. HER4 phosphorylation was high when expressed alone or with HER1, but low when co-expressed with HER2 or HER3. These data suggest that receptor complexes can form in the absence of ligand, and the kinase activity of these complexes are differentially regulated.Fig. 2The level of HER tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand. HER transfected cell lines were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF or HRG for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were extracted in lysis buffer and receptors immunoprecipitated with specific monoclonal antibodies.

Each HER-expressing cell line is indicated on the left, and the receptor immunoprecipitated from that cell line is noted adjacent to each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With respect to ligand stimulation of cell lines expressing only one family member, HER1 was partially tyrosine phosphorylated in the absence of ligand and was further stimulated by addition of EGF. Similarly, HER2 was phosphorylated in the absence of ligand, however, as expected its level of phosphorylation did not change in response to either EGF or HRG. HER3, previously shown to be a defective tyrosine kinase (38Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), demonstrated a weak response to HRG. HER4 was partially activated in the absence of ligand, and could further be phosphorylated in response to HRG. The lower band in the HER4 immunprecipitates from HER2 + 3 and HER2 + 4 cell lines is not HER4 (data not shown). In cells expressing multiple receptors, stimulation of either receptor partner by EGF or HRG resulted in the increased phosphorylation of both receptors indicative of a heterodimer complex. However, in the context of a HER1 + 3 heterodimer, it was not possible to see a HRG dependent increase in HER1 phosphorylation. To address the biological activity of the 3T3-7d/HER transfectants, cells were seeded in soft agar to determine if colony formation occurred in the presence or absence of ligand stimulation (Fig. 3). All cell lines expressing only one HER family member were unable to promote colony growth even in the presence of ligand. In contrast, all cell lines expressing multiple HER family members were able to form colonies in agar in response to the appropriate ligand. Cell lines expressing HER1 + 3 and HER1 + 4 share the capacity to respond to both EGF and HRG unlike other cell lines that can respond to only one ligand. However, only the HER1 + 4-expressing cell line formed colonies in response to both ligands, whereas the HER1 + 3 cells responded to HRG but not EGF. This was surprising given the fact that EGF is able to activate both HER1 and HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the same cells (Fig. 2). The oncogenic form of HER2 (Tneu) which contains an activating mutation in the transmembrane domain, is able to dimerize and transform cells in the absence of ligand (18Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To further support our hypothesis that heterodimer formation was required for efficient growth in agar, Tneu was tested for its ability to induce ligand independent colonies in agar when expressed alone or in the presence other HER family members. Cell lines were generated by transfecting a Tneu expression vector into the 3T3-7d parent or 3T3-7d HER1-, HER2-, HER3-, or HER4-expressing cell lines and the level of Tneu expression determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A). Since the antibody used to detect Tneu also cross reacts with HER2, we were unable to clearly demonstrate the presence of Tneu expression independent of HER2 expression within the HER2/Tneu-expressing cell line. Transformation by Tneu was only evident in cells that co-expressed HER1, HER3, or HER4 (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing Tneu alone or co-expressed with HER2 were unable to form colonies in agar. These data demonstrate that the oncogenic activity of Tneu requires the co-expression of other HER members, excluding HER2, and demonstrates for the first time that Tneu is able to functionally heterodimerize with other HER family members. The requirement for heterodimer expression in cells to promote a transforming signal was further tested in vivo by determining the tumorigenic potential of 3T3-7d HER transfectants in nude mice. In general, cells expressing HER homodimers were unable to induce tumor growth. HER1-expressing cells, however, were able to induce a low level of tumor formation (Fig. 5). Co-expression of HER2 with HER1 was highly tumorigenic, identifying that HER1 + HER2 is much better than either receptor alone. Similarly, co-expression of HER2 with HER3 conferred tumor growth where each receptor alone did not. Interestingly, although able to form colonies in agar, cells expressing HER1 + 3 and HER1 + 4 were unable to form tumors in animals. In fact, co-expression of HER3 and HER4 with HER1 reduced the tumorigenic potential of HER1 alone, suggesting that these receptors are regulating the activity of HER1 in vivo. Together with the soft agar results, our data demonstrate that expression of multiple HER family members are required to efficiently transform cells in vitro and in vivo. It has been proposed that the mobilization of calcium is a key component in the regulation of cell proliferation (39Veigl M.L. Vanaman T.C. Sedwick W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 738: 21-48PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of calcium leads to a reversible growth arrest in normal cells, whereas, transformed cells are still able to grow (39Veigl M.L. Vanaman T.C. Sedwick W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 738: 21-48PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of HER1 by EGF results in the activation of PLCγ1 (40Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev.

To determine if activation of other HER family members also contribute to the mobilization of intracellular calcium, HER transfected 3T3-7d cell lines were stimulated with HRG and the level of intracellular calcium determined using the fluorescent calcium chelator Indo-1. In cell lines expressing HER1 alone or when co-expressed with HER2, HER3, or HER4, EGF induced an increase in intracellular calcium levels (Fig. 6A). In contrast, HRG did not have any effect on intracellular calcium in all cell lines tested including cells expressing HER2 + 3 and HER2 + 4 (Fig. 6, A and B). Stimulation of the endogenous mouse PDGF receptor with PDGF was used as a positive control to demonstrate that these cells are able to mobilize intracellular calcium flux in an unrelated receptor pathway (Fig. 6B). Removal of extracellular calcium by the addition of 5 mM EGTA to the extracellular media decreased the late phase of the calcium response, indicating that in addition to an intracellular component, extracellular calcium also contributes to the overall response (Fig. 6C). Having shown that HRG is unable to induce a detectable calcium response, we set out to determine whether HRG was also unable to induce PLCγ1 phosphorylation. Stimulation of the 3T3-7d transfectants expressing HER1, HER1 + 2, HER1 + 3 or HER1 + 4 with EGF or HRG resulted in an EGF, but not HRG, dependent increase in PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). The level of PLCγ1 phosphorylation did not significantly change by the co-expression expression of other HER family members with HER1, suggesting HER1 by itself is responsible for this action. Cells expressing HER2 + 3 and HER2 + 4 were also unable to induce PLCγ1 phosphorylation in response to HRG (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that the activation of HER complexes by HRG and subsequent induction of cellular transformation does not require the immobilization of intracellular calcium or the activation of targets related to the generation of second messengers such as PLCγ1. In analyzing the expression profile of HER family members in both normal and tumor tissues, it is often the rule and not the exception that multiple members are expressed within a given cell type. Our data suggest that expression of multiple HERs within a cell is required for efficient transformation of cells in response to ligand. None of the receptors when expressed alone could efficiently induce growth in soft agar. The lack of transformation by homodimer expression was not due to a lack of receptor kinase activity, for all homodimer complexes, especially HER1, demonstrated an increase in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand. This is supported by the fact that expression of Tneu, a potent transforming oncogene, induced colony formation in cells that co-expressed either HER1, HER3, or HER4 but not when expressed alone or co-expressed with HER2. The complementation of Tneu with HER1, HER3, and HER4 also suggests that Tneu can heterodimerize with other family members, although the biochemical identification of this heterodimer was not investigated. Lastly, cells expressing HER1 + 2 were able to form aggressive tumors in animals in a short time frame in contrast to cells expressing HER1 or HER2 alone. This was also reflected in the cells expressing HER2 + 3 in comparison to cells expressing HER2 and HER3 alone. Interestingly, cells"

Recently, it was observed that, in Bacillus stearothermophilus FPP synthase, a replacement of tyrosine with histidine at position 81, which is located on the fifth amino acid before the first aspartate-rich motif, caused the mutated FPP synthase to catalyze geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C-20) synthesis (Ohnuma, S.-i., Nakazawa, T., Hemmi, H., Hallberg, A.-M., Koyama, T., Ogura, K., and Nishino, T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 10087-10095). Thus, we constructed 20 FPP synthases, each of which has a different amino acid at position 81, and analyzed them. All enzymes except for Y81P can catalyze the condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate. The final products and the product distributions are different from each other. Y81A, Y81G, and Y81S can produce hexaprenyl diphosphate (C-30) as their final product. The final product of Y81C, Y81H, Y81I, Y81L, Y81N, Y81T, and Y81V are geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (C-25), and Y81D, Y81E, Y81F, Y81K, Y81M, Y81Q, and Y81R cannot produce polyprenyl diphosphates more than geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Substitution of tryptophan does not affect the product specificity of FPP synthase. The average chain length of products is inversely proportional to the accessible surface area of substituted amino acid. However, no significant relation between the final chain length and the kinetic constants Km and Vmax are observed. These observations strongly indicate that the amino acid does not come into contact with the substrates but directly contacts the ω-terminal of an elongating allylic product. This interaction must prevent further condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase catalyzes consecutive condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic substrates to give FPP, C-15 compound, as a final product and does not catalyze a condensation beyond FPP.

INTRODUCTIONIsoprenoids, which include over 23,000 known metabolites, are the most chemically diverse family of naturally occurring compounds. The essential and major biosynthetic step in all isoprenoid metabolism is the elongation of isoprene units by prenyltransferases (Fig. 1) (1Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 161-224Google Scholar). These enzymes, which consecutively mediate alkylation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP, C-5) 1The abbreviations used are: IPPisopentenyl diphosphateDMAPPdimethylallyl diphosphateGPPgeranyl diphosphateFPPfarnesyl diphosphateGGPPgeranylgeranyl diphosphateGFPPgeranylfarnesyl diphosphateHPPhexaprenyl diphosphate. by allylic diphosphates, are classified according to the chain length of the final product and the stereochemistry of double bond formed by the condensations. So far, a number of prenyltransferases have been determined from various organisms.For example, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (EC 2.5.1.1) catalyzes the sequential condensations of two molecules of IPP (C-5) with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C-5) to give a C-15 compound with E-stereochemistry. The product, FPP, occupies a central point leading to several branches of the pathway for the synthesis of important classes of compounds, including sterols, farnesylated proteins, hemes, respiratory quinones, sesquiterpenes, and dolichols. On the other hand, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C-20) synthase (EC 2.5.1.29) catalyzes the condensation of IPP to give (all-E)-GGPP, which plays as a precursor for carotenoids, chlorophylls, geranylgeranylated proteins, and archaebacterial membrane lipids.These prenyltransferases catalyze the same sort of condensation and have a similarity in amino acid sequences (2Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 3Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, every enzyme does not catalyze a further condensation of IPP than the general ultimate product. Until now it has been left in question how the consecutive condensations precisely stop at a destined step.Recently, our group succeeded in converting FPP synthase from Bacillus stearothermophilus to GGPP synthase using chemical random mutagenesis followed by an in vivo color selection (4Ohnuma S.-i.

From the analysis of the mutations in the FPP synthases whose product specificities had become the same as GGPP synthase, we defined three amino acids that could determine the final chain length; leucine at position 34, tyrosine at position 81, and valine at position 157. In particular, the mutated enzyme that has a substitution of histidine for tyrosine at position 81, which is situated at the fifth amino acid before the first aspartate rich consensus motif, the most effectively produces GGPP. Moreover, our group also showed that, in the case of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius GGPP synthase, the amino acid at the same position also determines the chain length of the product, GGPP (5Ohnuma S.-i.

Thus, in this paper, we precisely analyze the role of the amino acid at position 81 of B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase on chain length determination.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that the chain length of a final product is dramatically changed by replacement of only one amino acid at position 81, which is situated at the fifth amino acid before the first aspartate-rich motif, and have indicated that the average chain length of products is inversely proportional to the accessible surface area of the substituted amino acid.The crystal structure of avian FPP synthase has been determined to 2.6-Å resolution by Tarshis et al. (11Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The FPP synthase is composed of 13 α-helices jointed by connecting loops, and eight of them form a large central cavity. Two aspartate-rich motifs that are highly conserved among the prenyltransferase family are found on opposite walls of this cavity, and the active site of FPP synthase seems to be located in the large central cavity. In a previous report (4Ohnuma S.-i. Nakazawa T. Hemmi H. Hallberg A.-M. Koyama T. Ogura K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10087-10095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), our group showed a considerable structural similarity between avian and B. stearothermophilus FPP synthases and indicated that the tyrosine-81 of B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase is situated on a point 11-∼12 Å apart from the first aspartate-rich motif, which has been thought to bind the diphosphate moiety of an allylic substrate via the magnesium ion (1Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 161-224Google Scholar, 16Marrero P.F. Poulter C.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The distance is similar to the length of the hydrocarbon moiety of FPP. From these data, we suggested that the aromatic ring of tyrosine-81 might prevent more chain elongations than FPP. It supports this hypothesis that an amino acid having smaller accessible surface area can form a longer final product. Moreover, the fact that a mutated GGPP synthase with an aliphatic amino acid at that position yields products slightly longer than that with a nonaliphatic amino acid with a similar accessible surface area indicates that the amino acid at position 81 directly contacts with the ω-terminal of elongating product by hydrophobic interaction. On the basis of this, we propose a simple model for the condensation and termination mechanism of the FPP synthase reaction (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Simple model for consecutive condensations of IPP by FPP synthase. First, FPP synthase accepts IPP and DMAPP. After two consecutive condensations of IPP, the ω-terminal of the formed FPP reaches the amino acid at the fifth amino acid before the first aspartate rich motif. If the side chain of the amino acid is large, further condensation is inhibited, resulting in formation of FPP (route A). On the other hand, when the side chain is small, the condensation continues to give long products such as HPP (route B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The deduced amino acid sequence analysis of cloned prenyltransferase genes shows that all prenyltransferases have a significant sequence similarity. Three prenyltransferases that catalyze consecutive condensations beyond GGPP have been cloned, hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from B. stearothermophilus (20Koike-Takeshita A. Koyama T. Obata S. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18396-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and octaprenyl diphosphate synthase from E. coli (21Asai K.-i. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Okada K. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These enzymes have alanine at the position corresponding to position 81 of B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase. These data strongly suggest that this amino acid primarily enables the enzymes to catalyze the formation of products longer than GGPP, and that other amino acid sequences of these enzymes should determine the final product to be C-30, C-35, or C-40.We have mainly been discussing the final products of mutated FPP synthases. However, product distribution was also affected by mutation. For example, Y81M produces primarily GGPP from DMAPP. On the other hand, Y81N yields three products, FPP, GGPP, and GFPP. Thus, we checked whether or not the divergence of products of each mutated enzyme is related to other factors. The divergence values were not related to the accessible surface area, the hydrophobicity (14Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar), conformational preference parameters for secondary structure (15Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; : 45-148PubMed Google Scholar), or specific activity for DMAPP, GPP, and FPP. It has been reported regarding some prenyltransferases that the amounts of intermediate products are affected by reaction conditions, including substrate concentration, although the destined final product is not altered. Presumably, the mutations cause additional structural changes that affect the affinity of the enzyme for reaction intermediates. Further analysis should be done to understand the reason.

A Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding vha55, the 55-kDa vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) regulatory B-subunit, was characterized and mapped to 87C2-4 on chromosome 3R. A fly line was identified that carried a single lethal P-element insertion within the coding portion of gene, and its LacZ reporter gene revealed elevated expression in Malpighian tubules, rectum, antennal palps, and oviduct, regions where V-ATPases are believed to play a plasma membrane, rather than an endomembrane, role. The P-element vha55 insertion was shown to be allelic to a known lethal complementation group l(3)SzA (= l(3)87Ca) at 87C, for which many alleles have been described previously. Deletions of the locus have been shown to be larval lethal, whereas point mutations show a range of phenotypes from subvital to embryonic lethal, implying that severe alleles confer a partial dominant negative phenotype. The P-element null allele of vha55 was shown also to suppress ectopic sex combs in Polycomb males, suggesting that transcriptional silencing may be modulated by genes other than those with known homeotic or DNA binding functions.

The transmembrane protonophore is made of six copies of a 16-kDa proteolipid, linked by further subunits to a catalytic headgroup comprising three copies each of a 67-kDa A-subunit and a 57-kDa B-subunit. Traditionally, the A-subunit is described as catalytic, whereas the B-subunit is considered regulatory, although in reality the active sites for nucleotide binding and proton flux may lie in the interfaces between neighboring A- and B-subunits (4Liu Q.

Although there is known to be very high conservation within the V-ATPase family, the 57-kDa subunit is interesting as several transcripts are known, some of which are tissue-specific (5Puopolo K.

Monospecific antibodies against the lepidopteran plasma membrane V-ATPase were used to demonstrate plasma membrane V-ATPases immunocytochemically in salivary glands, Malpighian (renal) tubules, recta, and cuticular sensillae, suggesting an energization of transport by proton, rather than sodium, motive force in probably all insects (16Harvey W.R.

Accordingly, D. melanogaster not only contains a V-ATPase, but should embody the full range of plasma membrane and endomembrane roles for V-ATPase function, and our group has embarked on the characterization of V-ATPase genes with a view to dissecting the differing requirements of these roles using the genetic tools unique to Drosophila (21Rubin G.M.

The first steps in such a procedure, in D. melanogaster or any other species, are to clone and characterize the gene, obtain a chromosomal localization, and identify or produce a genetic null (a “knockout”), which may have an informative phenotype in its own right, but which provides a genetic background for subsequent genetic intervention. These are the steps reported here for vha55, the gene encoding the V-ATPase B-subunit in D. melanogaster; they represent the first knockout of a V-ATPase gene in an animal. Primers for polymerase chain reaction were based on two areas of particularly close homology in the then known sequences for the 57-kDa subunit (22Bernasconi P. Rausch T. Gogarten J.P. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), optimized for Drosophila codon preference (23Aota S. Gojobori T. Ishibashi F. Maruyama T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16 (suppl.): r315-r391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two templates were used: 100 ng of first strand cDNA from Manduca sexta midgut and 1 μl of plate lysate from a D. melanogaster head cDNA library, constructed in λZapII. PCR products were sequenced directly to establish their identity, and a D. melanogaster cDNA library, prepared from eya− adult fly heads, was screened by plaque hybridization using the D. melanogaster PCR product as a probe. Positives were obtained at 1:1000 and were observed to fall into one of three distinct strengths of hybridization. The insert of a single recombinant phage from the strongest hybridizing class of plaque was excised as a pBluescript plasmid, and the cDNA was sequenced over its entire length on both strands. Double-stranded sequencing was performed according to the Sequenase™ II protocol (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), with the aid of synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Total RNA was extracted from whole flies or from hand-dissected body segments by the RNAzol B method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of RNA was carried out in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in MOPS buffer and followed by transfer to a nylon filter. RNA was cross-linked to the filters by UV radiation. The Northern blot filters were probed with the vha55 cDNA or a control rp49 cDNA encoding a ribosomal protein, each labeled with 32P by random priming. Blots were prehybridized in Church buffer (7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, Na2HPO4 0.25 M, pH 7.2) at 55°C for 2-3 h and hybridized in Church buffer overnight. The filters were then washed at 55°C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, then 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and finally 0.1 × SSC, 0.1%SDS for 30 min. Filters were then exposed to Fuji x-ray film for 1-3 days. Genomic DNA was purified from pools of approximately 100 adult D. melanogaster (25Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar), cleaved with a range of restriction endonucleases, Southern blotted, and probed with 32P-labeled random-primed probes derived from the coding portion of the D. melanogaster vha55 or vha14 (26Guo Y. Kaiser K. Wieczorek H. Dow J.A.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) cDNAs. Filters were hybridized and washed to high stringency. Blots were prehybridized in Church buffer at 65°C for 2-3 h and hybridized in Church buffer overnight. The filters were then washed at 65°C with 2 × SSPE (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaH2PO4, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 7.7) + 0.1% SDS for 30 min then 0.5 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and finally 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. Filters were then exposed to Fuji x-ray film for 1-3 days. Single flies were homogenized in extraction buffer (27Gloor G. Engels W. Drosophila Information Newsletter. 1992; 71: 148Google Scholar) and 1-μl aliquots used as templates in a PCR reaction using primers known to bracket an intron at the 5′ end of the open reading frame. Results were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the identity of products verified by Southern blotting with vha55 cDNA as described above (not shown). The products of the reactions with l(3)j2E9/TM3 DNA template were cloned using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instruction, and the authenticity of the products established by sequencing, incidentally allowing the position of the intron to be fixed. Northern and Southern analyses were performed on laboratory stocks of Oregon R wild-type flies. P-element insertional mutants were obtained from the Bloomington stock center and lines carrying deficiencies from the Umea stock center or as kind gifts of Prof. Janos Gausz (Szeged, Hungary). Alleles of Polycomb (Pc) were obtained from the Umea stock center. Genetic markers were checked before use. Flies were reared on standard Drosophila medium at 25°C in a 12:12-h photoperiod. For crosses, virgin females were collected at 4-h intervals, mated singly to males, and tapped into fresh tubes daily for 1 week before discarding. Particular care was taken with Pc crosses to allow the progeny to grow under uncrowded conditions, as the penetrance of the phenotype is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions (28Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8136-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Emerging adults were collected for several days from each tube, to reduce the risk that certain classes of phenotype might be slower growing and thus underrepresented in early collections. Embryos were washed from staged egg plates, dechorionated, fixed, devitellinized, and stained for β-galactosidase according to standard protocols (25Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar). Larvae or adults were dissected in Drosophila saline, pinned out, fixed, and stained similarly. Staining patterns were viewed either under a Wild Stereomicroscope or a Leitz Ortholux microscope and photographed using Kodak Ektar film. An 830-bp PCR product was isolated from a D. melanogaster eya− head cDNA library by PCR with degenerate primers based on conserved domains in known V-ATPase B-subunits. The PCR product was sequenced directly to establish its identity and used to identify a cDNA from the same Drosophila head library. The 2.6-kb cDNA contained a long open reading frame of 1470 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 490 amino acids with deduced molecular mass close to 55 kDa (Fig. 1) Sequence identity at the amino acid level with known V-ATPase B-subunits is extraordinarily high (Fig. 2); only 11 of 490 residues differed between the M. sexta (29Novak F.J. Graf R. Waring R.B. Wolfersberger M.G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and D. melanogaster sequences, while the human brain sequence is 90% identical. Peptide sequence motifs were identified using the PROSITE data base. In common with all known F-ATPase (ATP synthase) A-subunits and V-ATPase B-subunits, the sequence shows the PPVNVLPSLS motif at 370 (Fig. 3) apart from a conservative V/I substitution at 396; it is thought that this motif is essential for ATPase function. This gene thus clearly encodes a B-subunit of a V-ATPase and was accordingly named vha55. The initiation site is consistent with those known for other sequences, and there is a canonical polyadenylation signal at 2529-2534, 25 bases before the start of the poly(A) region (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Alignment of known 57-kDa amino acid sequences, obtained with the PILEUP program (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI), using default parameters.

This is interesting, because in vertebrates the B-subunit is thought to be the most transcriptionally diverse subunit in this highly conserved proton pump (5Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vha55 cDNA has a 5′-untranslated region of 86 bp and a long 3′-untranslated region of 1019 bp (Fig. 1). Separate transcripts, differing in length of their 3′-untranslated regions, have been identified in kidney and brain, with brain cDNAs being 1 kb longer than those from kidney (5Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in humans, the B-subunit may be a useful target for selective therapeutic intervention against kidney or osteoclast isoforms (30Nelson N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Tissue- and sex-specific Northern blots showed that, in common with other recently characterized D. melanogaster V-ATPase subunits (26Guo Y. Kaiser K. Wieczorek H. Dow J.A.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Guo Y. Wang Z. Carter A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1283: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), vha55 was ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 3B). D. melanogaster (Oregon R) genomic DNA was cleaved with a range of restriction endonucleases, Southern blotted, and probed with vha55 cDNA. Hybridization and washing at either high (not shown) or low stringency suggests that this is a single-copy gene (Fig. 4). In accordance with this, salivary gland polytene chromosome squashes (25Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar) probed with vha55 cDNA revealed a single band at 87C (not shown). The availability of physical mapping clones spanning most of the D. melanogaster genome can allow genomic clones to be obtained rapidly when such localizations are known. In this case, six P1 clones spanning 87C (a kind gift of Dr. Stephen Russell) were screened by PCR with internal nondegenerate primers bracketing a 1.2-kb intron and so known to yield products of 430-bp off cDNA and 1600-bp off genomic DNA templates. Two positive clones (DS00602 and DS00681) were obtained, both previously mapped to 87C2, and their identities confirmed by Southern blotting of P1 DNA with vha55 cDNA (not shown). To confirm the localization, Df(3R)kar3J, a fly line carrying a deficiency spanning 87C1-87D1, was subjected to quantitative Southern analysis using a fragment of the vha55 cDNA as a probe. Fig. 5 confirms that the vha55 gene falls within the Df(3R)kar3J deficiency. A powerful tool in the analysis of any gene is the identification of mutant or null alleles. Two attempts to mutagenize vha55 by site-selected P-element mutagenesis (32Kaiser K. Goodwin S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. However, two lethal P-element insertions, l(3)j2E9 and l(3)05043 mapping to 87C2-3 and 87C6-8 respectively, were investigated on the basis that they might lie sufficiently close to the predicted location of vha55 (87C2-3) to permit mutagenesis by “local jumping,” a strategy that relies on the relatively common reinsertion of excised P-elements close to their previous locations. PCR off genomic DNA prepared from single flies, using the gene-specific primers described above, revealed that the line l(3)j2E9 carried a P-element insertion within the only known intron in vha55 (Fig. 6); these positions were verified by cloning and sequencing the PCR products and place the intron between bases 160 and 161 of the sequence reported in Fig. 1. The region covered by Df(3R)kar3J has been subjected to saturation mutagenic analysis, in which a total of just four lethal complementation groups have been identified (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of a large number of small deficiencies spanning 87C (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) permitted an accurate localization of l(3)j2E9 by complementation. l(3)j2E9 virgins, balanced over TM3 (carrying Stubble, a dominant marker), were crossed singly to males carrying each of a number of deficiencies (also balanced over TM3) with breakpoints in 87C. If any progeny had wild-type (Sb+) bristles, then this would show that the lethal mutation fell outside the deficiency. As can be seen (Fig. 7), the results place l(3)j2E9 within the interval 87C2-4. These results allow the l(3)j2E9 allele to be reconciled with known complementation groups at 87C. Despite a small discrepancy (87C2-3 cf. 87C4-5) between the documented positions of the two loci, l(3)j2E9 maps within the same combination of deficiencies diagnostic of SzA (=l(3)87Ca) (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As three ethyl methanesulfonate-induced alleles of SzA are still extant, it was possible to confirm that l(3)j2E9 (but not l(3)05043) is allelic to SzA (Table I). Additionally, the P-element was mobilized by crossing to the Δ2,3 transposase source, and 100 lines were established from progeny which had lost the w+ marker, and so represented independent P-element excisions. None of these was homozygous viable, revealing the presence of an undocumented additional source of lethality in the l(3)j2E9 line. However, this locus could be separated from the P-element insertion by five generations of outcrossing to w1118 flies, a maneuver which exchanges 97% of the genome by recombination. A selection of 10 independent P-element excision lines were able to complement both this outcrossed P-element stock and the defining deficiency spanning the locus, Df(3R)karSz29, while the outcrossed P-element stock remained unable to complement Df(3R)karSz29 (Table II). So the lethal locus which remains after P-element excision does not map to SzA. Therefore, the P-element insertion causes lethality at the SzA locus, and it is appropriate to name this allele vha55j2E9.Table IAllelism between lethal P-element insertions within 87C and SzACrossSb+Sb−l(3)j2E9 × SzA1077l(3)j2E9 × SzA90113l(3)j2E9 × SzA120137l(3)j05043 × SzA12150l(3)j05043 × SzA94272l(3)j05043 × SzA12813 Open table in a new tab Table IILoss of the P-element in l(3)j2E9 reverts lethality at 87CComplementing/total progenyex1ex2ex3ex4Df(3R)karSz29Df(3R)karSz2950 /14728 /9637 /12310 /29(0)l(3)j2E9(7CS)49 /1965 /535 /448 /250 /51 Open table in a new tab On this basis, existing detailed descriptions of the phenotypes associated with the 13 lethal alleles of SzA (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can be ascribed to genetic “knockouts” of the V-ATPase regulatory subunit, vha55. Severe ethyl methanesulfonate-induced alleles produce viable heterozygotes but a recessive embryonic lethal phenotype; whereas complete deletion of the gene produces later lethality, after the emergence of homozygous first-instar larvae (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that subunits carrying point mutations may misincorporate into and disrupt maternally derived V-ATPase holoenzymes earlier than the enzyme would have become ineffective by dilution among the cells of the developing embryo, so producing an earlier lethal phase. As a V-ATPase presumably needs all three of its B-subunits to function, this could provide a “dominant negative” phenotype characteristic of multisubunit proteins. We found the lethal phase of the vha55j2E9 homozygotes to be around the time of hatching, as seen with Df(3R)kar3J homozygotes (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that insertion of the 8-kb P-element completely disrupts the locus and is thus a genetic null. Affected larval Malpighian tubules in SzA− flies are also colorless, lacking characteristic luminal white concretion bodies (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This can be interpreted as a failure of V-ATPases to acidify the tubule lumen and precipitate urates or mineral concretions. The apical membranes of tubule cells are packed arrays of V-ATPases (34Harvey W.R. Cioffi M. Dow J.A.T. Wolfersberger M.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 106: 91-117PubMed Google Scholar); and D. melanogaster tubules are known to be highly sensitive to bafilomycin, a selective inhibitor of V-ATPases (19Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H.P. Görtz A. Skaer N.V. Brogan S. Kaiser K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 197: 421-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bertram G. Shleithoff L. Zimmermann P. Wessing A. J. Insect Physiol. 1991; 37: 201-209Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so tubules are natural sites to observe manifestations of defects in V-ATPase function. The tubule phenotype is cell autonomous in transplants of tubules to healthy flies, as would be expected for a V-ATPase mutant, and the failure of the transplanted cells to grow or thrive prompted Gausz to suggest that the SzA+ gene product was required for growth of most cell types (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P{LacW} element in vha55j2E9 contains a LacZ enhancer detector element, although PCR with P-element end-specific primers (not shown) revealed the orientation of the reporter to be opposite to that of transcription of vha55. Despite this, the LacZ pattern described below is plausible (Fig. 8) and is identical to those we have observed with P-element insertions into two other V-ATPase subunits. 2Y. Guo, unpublished observations. As would be expected of a housekeeping gene, expression was reported in most tissues; however, it was particularly strong in those epithelia where V-ATPases have been demonstrated immunocytochemically on plasma membranes of other insects (36Klein U. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 345-354PubMed Google Scholar): the Malpighian tubules (Fig. 8, B and C), the rectum (Fig. 8D) and the salivary glands and the cuticular sensillae (Fig. 8E). There is also staining of the uterus and female accessory glands, again suggesting a plasma membrane transport role for V-ATPase in this tissue, possibly in eggshell formation. Interestingly, the earliest embryonic staining was observed in a region of the anterior midgut (Fig. 8A) where the pH is particularly low (37Dimitriadis V.K. J. Insect Physiol. 1991; 37: 167-177Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This region of the midgut contains goblet cells structurally reminiscent of those of lepidopteran midgut, the model system in which a plasma membrane role for V-ATPases was first demonstrated (12Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Products of the Pc group of genes are thought to act cooperatively to elicit transcriptional silencing of genomic DNA in response to the initial transcription levels of homeotic genes in the embryo by binding untranscribed DNA and packing it into heterochromatin (38Moehrle A. Paro R. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). They thus help to preserve the “memory” of the homeotic selector genes by shielding inactivated genes from later access by transcription factors which might otherwise activate them ectopically. Mutant phenotypes of any of the Pc group (ectopic expression of sex combs on T2 and T3 legs of males) thus resemble a homeotic misassignment of T2 and T3 legs to a T1 fate. This model for transcriptional silencing may have general significance for the long term inactivation of genes during development. A previous screen for dosage-dependent suppressors or enhancers of Pc had identified a number of homeotic genes, together with several that were mapped but unidentified (28Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8136-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). One of the powerful suppressing loci was shown to be allelic to l(3)87Ca (28Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8136-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), a locus that we have now demonstrated to encode vha55. Given that most known suppressors of Pc are homeotic genes, Kennison and Tamkun's previous assignment was confirmed by generating vha55j2E9/Pc11 flies from a vha55j2E9/TM3(Sb) × Pc11/TM3(Sb, Ser) cross and scoring the male progeny for ectopic sex combs on the T2/T3 legs. This confirmed that hemizygosity for this V-ATPase subunit suppresses the ability of Pc to elicit ectopic sex combs (Table III), although it remains technically possible that this effect is due to interference with a nearby transcription unit, rather than with vha55. Indeed, there is evidence that SzA may be a complex locus (33Gausz J. Bencze G. Gyurkovics H. Ashburner M. Ish-Horowitz D. Holden J.J. Genetics. 1979; 93: 917-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and breakpoints in the 86-89E region can elicit transvection effects at the Ubx locus (39Lewis E.B. Am. Nat. 1954; 88: 225-239Crossref Google Scholar); it will require further work to exclude such possibilities.Table IIIDosage-dependent suppression of Pc phenotype by l(3)j2E9Class of progenyLegs with ectopic sex combsTotal T2/T3 legs scoredNumber%l(3)j2E9/TM3(Sb)0044l(3)j2E9/Pc1151436Pc11/TM3(Sb, Ser)146932 Open table in a new tab This study reports the gene knockout of a V-ATPase in an animal. The phenotype displayed here is straightforward and confirms that these genes are essential for normal embryonic development. The enhancer detector element also displays elevated gene expression in those epithelia thought to be energized by V-ATPases. This is because, whereas the acidification of endomembrane compartments requires only a few V-ATPase holoenzymes per vesicle, the plasma membranes of V-ATPase-energized epithelia contain essentially semi-crystalline arrays of V-ATPases (40Brown D. Sabolic I. Gluck S. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cioffi M. Tissue Cell. 1979; 11: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to suppose that so great a density of V-ATPases would require higher levels of transcription of the relevant genes, and so the extent of LacZ reporter expression can thus be considered to be at least a semi-quantitative estimate of vha55 expression. Once identified, such null alleles are powerful tools in the analysis of this and other V-ATPase genes. They both provide null backgrounds into which mutagenized genes may be reintroduced to rescue function in vivo and allow novel alleles to be generated by imprecise excision of the P-elements. Although the yeast model is ideal for the mutagenic analysis of endomembrane V-ATPases in unicellular organisms (42Anraku Y. Hirata R. Wada Y. Ohya Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that disruption of V-ATPase subunits in yeast is not obligatorily lethal, but results in a pH-dependent phenotype (43Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For multicellular animals, then, Drosophila may prove a more suitable model, which will allow an analysis in an organism which possesses the full spectrum of predicted endomembrane, epithelial, neuronal, and sensory phenotypes. In summary, this work provides a first description of the expression patterns and lethal phenotypes associated with a range of alleles of a V-ATPase subunit in Drosophila. It suggests that mutations will be lethal recessive and that, for at least those subunits which are present in multiple copies in the holoenzyme, severe alleles will be antimorphs. It also predicts that epithelial dysfunction may be detectable at an early stage in those tissues where V-ATPases play a plasma membrane role. As further V-ATPase mutations are identified, either in Drosophila or in other animals, it will be interesting to establish whether they match this prototype. We are most grateful to S. Arkison for technical help, to Dr A. Dornan for a preliminary chromosomal localization of the gene, and to Dr F. Lyall for invaluable discussions.

In order to investigate the role of brk in breast tumor development, we have examined the growth and transformation properties of human mammary epithelial cells engineered to overexpress Brk. Interestingly, like c-Src, overexpression of Brk leads to sensitization to EGF, and also results in a partially transformed phenotype. Further investigation of the latter activity was attempted by mutational analysis, targeting key residues known to affect tyrosine kinase activity in Src-like kinases. Mutation of amino acid residue Lys-219 to Met, by analogy to Src, abolished both kinase activity and transformation capacity. Mutation of amino acid residue Tyr-447 to Phe, however, resulted in a decrease in transforming potential without affecting kinase activity. These results suggest that while Src and Brk share some functional properties, they act differently during transformation. These differences are discussed in the context of the mechanisms underlying breast cancer development. brk (breast tumor kinase) shows homology to the src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and is expressed in breast carcinomas.

The most prevalent type of cancer found in western women is that of the breast, with an approximate probability of one in nine women developing the disease during the course of their lifetime (Kelsey and Berkowitz, 38Kelsey J.M. Berkowitz G.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5615-5623PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of all breast carcinomas are due to two recently isolated familial predisposition genes, BRCA1 (Miki et al., 57Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K.

However, the vast majority of breast carcinomas are sporadic and have a complex accumulation of molecular and cellular abnormalities that constitute the malignant phenotype. There is, hence, a considerable drive to identify, at a molecular level, factors that contribute to the normal development of the mammary gland, as well as alterations that might contribute to the progression from normal growth through malignancy to metastasis. To this end a number of somatic gene alterations, such as loss of expression of specific tumor suppressor genes have been found to occur in primary human breast tumors (Borg et al., 7Borg A. Zang Q.-X. Alm P. Olsson H. Sellburg G. Cancer Research. 1992; 52: 2991-2994PubMed Google Scholar; Eeles et al., 19Eeles R.A. Bartkova J. Lane D.P. Bartek J. Cancer Surv. 1993; 18: 57-75PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, there is increasing evidence that genetic alterations in growth factor signaling pathways can contribute to human breast malignancies. In this regard, activation of different protooncogenes have also been found in primary human breast tumors (Salomon et al., 75Salomon D.S. Ciardiello F. Valverius E.M. Kim N. Lippman M.E.

Additionally, transforming growth factor α and other members of the rapidly expanding EGF family of proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast carcinomas (Normanno et al., 64Normanno N. Ciardiello F. Brandt R. Salomon D.S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is now well established that members of the EGF receptor family of tyrosine kinases are also involved in neoplastic transformation of breast epithelial cells, where their overexpression present an inverse correlation with patient survival (reviewed by Rajkumar and Gullick (71Rajkumar T.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that ligand-activated receptor protein kinases transduce their signal through association with a number of specific cytoplasmic target proteins that contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. SH2 domains have been found in a diverse group of proteins, some containing enzyme activity, i.e. phospholipase C-γ-1 (Margolis et al., 55Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R.

Activated receptor tyrosine kinases have also been shown to associate with cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and Src-like proteins (Kypta et al., 42Kypta R.M. Goldburg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar; Luttrell et al., 53Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar). To date a large number of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases have been identified. Of these, approximately half demonstrate oncogenic potential, while others could be classified as antioncogenes (reviewed by Bolen (4Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2025-2031PubMed Google Scholar)). In this context, recent studies have shown the protein-tyrosine kinase activity in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of most malignant human breast tissue to be significantly higher than that from benign or normal breast tissue (Lower et al., 51Lower E.E. Franco R.S. Miller M.M. Martelo O.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 26: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Hennipman et al., 28Hennipman A. van Oirschot B.A. Smiths J. Rijksen G.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4773-4778PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase activity was found to be a prognostic indicator of decreased disease-free survival (Bolla et al., 5Bolla M. Rostaing-Puissant B.R. Chedin M. Souvignet C. Marron-Charriere J. Colonna M. Berland E. Chambaz E.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 26: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As part of a study aimed at identification of novel protein-tyrosine kinases, and examination of their potential involvement in human breast tumor development, we have recently reported the isolation and characterization of a cDNA from a human metastatic breast tumor, representing a novel non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, brk (breast tumor kinase) (Mitchell et al., 58Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the putative Brk protein sequence revealed it to be almost exclusively composed of three domains defined on the basis of sequence homology to other signaling molecules. From the N terminus, these are: an SH3, an SH2, and a catalytic domain. This arrangement and amino acid sequence homology (particularly in the catalytic domain) relate Brk most closely to the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases. However, Brk differs from the Src-like kinases in several respects, most notably in its lack of an N-terminal extension and predicted myristoylation site (Mitchell et al., 58Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the role of Brk in breast cancer, we have examined the effect of Brk overexpression in human mammary epithelial cells as well as murine embryonic fibroblasts. Here we report that Brk overexpression mitogenically sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells to EGF, and that Brk is partially transforming not only in these cells, but also in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Additionally, we demonstrate that Brk can interact directly with the EGF receptor. Our results provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Brk may contribute to the progression of breast tumor development. HB4a, an SV40-immortalized, but not transformed, human mammary luminal cell line (Stamps et al., 79Stamps A.C. Davies S.C. Burman J. O'Hare M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (5 μg/ml), and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml). MCF-10A, a spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line (Soule et al., 78Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% equine serum, hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), and EGF (10 ng/ml). NIH3T3, embryonic mouse fibroblasts (Jainchill et al., 32Jainchill J.L. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. All cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 12% CO2 atmosphere with the exception of HB4a, which were grown at 5% CO2 atmosphere. A rat monoclonal antibody to Brk, ICR 100, was raised by immunizing CBH/cbi rats via their Peyer's patches with recombinant Brk-glutathione S-transferase protein, and fusing cells from the mesenteric nodes into the Y3 rat myeloma as described previously (Dean et al., 17Dean C.J. Gyure L.A. Hall J.G. Styles J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 121: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the SV40 T-antigen, PAb416 (Harlow et al., 26Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. L. Crawford (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibody to the EGF receptor (E3138) was purchased from Sigma. 2 × 104 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes in 1% FCS and left overnight to settle. The medium was then changed to test medium containing various amounts of EGF (mouse submaxillary, receptor grade, from Sigma). At indicated time intervals, the cells were trypsinized and cell numbers determined using a Coulter counter (Coulter electronics). In all growth curves, the medium was changed every 3 days. The brk cDNA was excised from clone λt2 (Mitchell et al., 58Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar) using the KpnI and BamHI sites in the cloning vector (pBluescript SK−, Stratagene), blunted with Klenow polymerase, and ligated into SmaI digested pBluescript SK+. In one orientation, this resulted in the situation of a HindIII site at the 5′ end of the cDNA. Digestion at this site and HindIII site in the 3′-untranslated region of the brk cDNA produced a coding fragment that was ligated, in the sense orientation, into the HindIII sites of pRcCMV and pREP8 (Invitrogen). A coding cDNA fragment was isolated from the brk-pRcCMV expression vector by digestion with EcoRI, and ligated into the EcoRI site of pINA (Morgenstern and Land, 59Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) in the sense orientation. Point mutations were introduced into brk cDNA using the T7-Gen kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). Stable Brk expression in HB4a and NIH3T3 cells was achieved by calcium phosphate transfection followed by drug selection. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and left to settle overnight. The cells were then given fresh medium and, approximately 5 h later, transfected using 20 μg of DNA. Approximately 12 h post-transfection, the cells were shocked with 15% glycerol for 2.5 min. Forty-eight hours post-shock, drug selection was applied and maintained thereafter. The transfections generated on average 20-50 drug-resistant colonies/dish. NIH3T3 cells were transfected in triplicates and selected under 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418), while HB4a transfectants were transfected in duplicates and selected under 1 mM Histidinol in histidine-free medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum, insulin, hydrocortisone, and cholera toxin. In all cases, all drug-resistant colonies generated in a transfection, were pooled to generate a single population of cells, for the respective cell lines, in order to avoid clonal variability and artifacts arising through selective cloning pressures. Stable Brk expression in MCF10-A cells was achieved by retroviral infection. Briefly, brk cDNA was cloned into the retrovirus vector pINA, a derivative of the vector pgagneoSVR, in which the rat β-actin promoter replaces the SV40 promoter (Morgenstern and Land, 59Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this vector the neo gene is expressed under the control of the retrovirus long terminal repeat promoter and the brk gene under the control of the β-actin promoter. Using amphotropically packaged virus (1 × 105 colony-forming units/ml), 5 × 105 cells were infected in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene and selected in the presence of 2 mg/ml G418. Amphotropically packaged empty pINA vector was used as control retrovirus. Transformation of the cells was assessed by their ability to demonstrate anchorage-independent growth. To this end, drug-resistant transfected cells were grown in medium containing 0.4% agar at a density of 1 × 105 in six-well dishes. After 4-6 weeks of growth, the colonies were visualized by staining with 0.33% iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Rosenthal et al., 74Rosenthal A. Lindquist P.B. Bringman T.S. Goeddel D.V. Derynck R. Cell. 1986; 46: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate. Clones to be recovered from soft agar were picked before staining. Cells were seeded on to glass coverslips in 24-well dishes and left to grow. Exponentially growing cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min. Free aldehyde groups were then quenched with 0.1 M glycine for 10 min and the cells permeabilized using 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed extensively in PBS, and exposed to a monoclonal anti-Brk antibody (1:10). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) was used to visualize the primary antibody. The preparations were mounted in glycerol containing 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO) as an antifade agent (Johnson et al., 33Johnson G.D. Davidson R.S. McNamee K.C. Russell G. Goodwin D. Holborow E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and visualized on a fluorescence microscope. Whole cells lysed in Laemmli lysis buffer were subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Towbin et al., 80Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with 20% milk powder in PBS and probed with the primary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins (DAKO) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). 1 × 107 cells were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM CHAPS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na2VO3, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 20 min. The cell lysates were cleared by spinning at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and then incubated with antibody-coated Protein G for 18 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, and 5 mM EDTA) and finally resuspended in Laemmli lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, blotted, and probed as detailed above. Receptor number per cell and the dissociation constant of the ligand-receptor complex (Kd) were estimated using Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, 76Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17814) Google Scholar). EGF (20 μg) was radiolabeled with carrier-free Na125I (2 mCi) using IODOGEN (Pierce). Briefly, 60 μg of IODOGEN in 60 μl of chloroform was dried on to a polypropylene vial under nitrogen flow. EGF and 125I were then added in PBS, pH 7.4. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min, then the mixture was transferred to another vial and left to stand for 10 min. Carrier bovine serum albumin was added at 1 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, and the labeled ligand separated from free Na125I by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25M column pre-equlibriated with the same buffer. The fractions containing 125I-EGF were pooled. The specific activity of 125I-EGF was 120 μCi/μg EGF. Binding measurements were carried out in 0.14 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7, with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Collins et al., 10Collins M.K.L. Sinnet-Smith J.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11689-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the method of Green et al. (21Green M.R. Basketter D.A. Couchman J.R. Rees D.A. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 60-μl aliquot of 7:1 (v/v) mixture of dibutylphthalate:mineral oil in a microcentrifuge tube was overlaid with 175 μl of binding medium containing twice the desired 125I-EGF concentration. 5 × 105 cells were then added in another 175 μl of binding medium. Following incubation for approximately 12 h at 4°C, the cells were separated from the binding medium by sedimentation through the oil layer at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The tube tip containing the cells was then cut off and cell-bound radiolabel counted in an Innotron γ counter. The binding experiments were performed in triplicate using 200-fold excess of unlabeled EGF in controls. In order to study the biological functions of Brk in human mammary epithelial cells, we have expressed Brk in two existing cell lines, MCF10-A and HB4a. These cell lines were chosen as good representatives of this cell type since, unlike most other breast cell lines, their origin is unequivocally known to be normal breast epithelia. Following stable expression of Brk in HB4a and MCF10-A cells, we found no effect on the morphology of the cells. Additionally, using a monoclonal anti-Brk antibody, raised to recombinant Brk protein, we have found that Brk is uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 1). The apparent nuclear staining observed in Fig. 1A is nonspecific, since similar staining is observed in the vector transfected control cells, which do not inherently express Brk as demonstrated by Western blotting using the same antibody (Fig. 1B). The ability of stable brk-transfected HB4a cells to respond to mitogenic stimuli was examined by assessing the growth of the cells after exposure to a variety of growth factors, over a period of time. We found that fibroblast growth factors (a and b), nerve growth factor, PDGF-BB, insulin, and macrophage colony stimulating factor had no effect on the growth of these cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the cells respond mitogenically to EGF over a concentration range of 1-20 ng/ml. The data presented in Fig. 2, demonstrate that HB4a cells transfected with brk, HB4a-Brk, and HB4a cells transfected with vector only, HB4a-vector, fail to grow in medium with reduced serum (1% FCS). However, EGF at 1 ng/ml increases the proliferation of HB4a-Brk cells by more than 10-fold over a period of 7 days. HB4a-Brk cells respond to EGF optimally at 5-10 ng/ml, improving their growth by approximately 20-fold over that seen at 1% FCS. Notably, HB4a-vector control cells also begin to respond to this growth factor as the EGF concentration is increased from 1 to 5 ng/ml. However, the magnitude of the response of HB4a-vector cells to EGF remains constant and consistently lower than HB4a-Brk cells, over a range of 5-20 ng/ml EGF. In comparison to the vector controls, Brk overexpression improves the growth of HB4a cells by 2-3-fold in response to 1-10 ng/ml EGF. A similar mitogenic response to EGF was observed in MCF10-A cells stably expressing Brk, where, in comparison to vector-transfected controls, Brk overexpression improved the growth of MCF10-A cells by 35% in response to 1-5 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 3). Scatchard analysis was used to determine the EGF receptor density and affinity in HB4a-Brk and vector only transfectants, in order to examine the possibility that the differential mitogenic response of these cells to EGF may be a consequence of different EGF receptor density/affinity in the two cell populations. Hence, EGF receptor density and affinity was determined for three separate populations of cells derived from three independent transfections. Fig. 4 represents a typical Scatchard plot obtained. We have found the EGF receptor density in both HB4a-Brk and HB4a-vector cells to be 3.7 × 105 receptors/cell. Additionally, both cell populations display only one class of receptor, with an affinity of 29 × 10−9 M. Furthermore, the steady state levels of EGF receptor protein, as judged by Western blotting, are the same in both cell populations (data not shown). In an attempt to elucidate the role of Brk in the EGF-induced proliferation of Brk overexpressing mammary epithelial cells, we sought to examine Brk's ability to directly associate with the EGF receptor in these cells. To this end, co-immunoprecipitations of Brk with the EGF receptor were performed. The results, presented in Fig. 5, demonstrate that Brk interacts directly with the EGF receptor in Brk-overexpressing MCF10A cells even in the absence of exogenous EGF. Similar results were obtained for HB4a-Brk cells (data not shown). The transforming potential of Brk and structurally altered forms of Brk, was evaluated in HB4a and NIH3T3 cells, respectively, by examining the ability of transfected cells to escape contact inhibition when grown on tissue culture plastic together with their capacity to support anchorage-independent growth when grown in agar. Following stable transfection of brk and brk mutants in HB4a and NIH3T3 cells, respectively, we have found no effect on the morphology of these cells. Additionally, in both NIH3T3 and HB4a stable transfectants, we were unable to detect differences in the total amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of Brk and Brk mutants does not allow HB4a nor NIH3T3 cells to escape from contact inhibited growth. However, in comparison to the vector-transfected cells, overexpression of Brk in HB4a cells results in a significant increase in the number and size of the colonies formed in soft agar (Fig. 6). This phenomenon was also observed in NIH3T3 cells (Table I). Additionally, overexpression of Brk Y447F in NIH3T3 cells appears to reduce the ability of these cells to grow in soft agar when compared with Brk, while the K219M mutation appears to ab"

Activation of three prominent members of the MAPK family, i.e. extracellular response kinases (ERK), jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, was defined in vivo in order to establish their role, if any, in the cardinal response of skeletal muscle to insulin, the activation of glycogen synthesis. Insulin was found to activate ERK, JNK, and p38 in skeletal muscle. The time courses for activation of the three MAPKs by insulin, however, are distinctly different.

Voltage-gated Na+ channels initiate the action potential in most excitable cells. Na+ channels open in response to depolarization, resulting in Na+ influx through a Na+-selective pore. Within a few ms after opening, the channels convert to a nonconducting inactivated state, from which they recover only after repolarization. The rat brain Na+ channel consists of three glycoprotein subunits: α (260 kDa), β1 (36 kDa), and β2 (33 kDa) (reviewed in 1Catterall W.A. Physiol.

Studies using site-specific antibodies and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the intracellular loop between homologous domains III and IV (LIII-IV) is critically involved in inactivation (12Vassilev P.

Peptides containing the IFM motif can block open Na+ channels, consistent with the idea that these residues serve as an inactivation particle that enters the intracellular mouth of the pore and blocks it during inactivation (18Eaholtz G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it has been proposed that the intracellular loop between domains III and IV serves as an inactivation gate, which closes over the intracellular mouth of the pore and binds to a putative inactivation gate receptor via the IFM motif when the channel inactivates (1Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This mechanism of inactivation predicts that the amino acid residue at position 1489 should become inaccessible to reaction with intracellular reagents during the inactivation process. To test this idea, we have expressed a mutant Na+ channel with a cysteine residue at position 1489 and analyzed its reaction with charged methanethiosulfonate (MTS) 1The abbreviations used are: MTSmethanethiosulfonateMTSEAmethanethiosulfonate ethylammoniumMTSESmethanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonateMTSETmethanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammoniumWTwild type. derivatives and with silver. The effect of these reagents on inactivation of F1489C depends on the size of the charged group introduced and on its distance from the polypeptide backbone. The accessibility of residue Cys-1489 to reaction with MTS compounds applied from the cytoplasmic side depends on the functional state of the channel and is greatly reduced during steady-state inactivation. Our results are consistent with movement of Phe-1489 in the inactivation gate from the cytoplasm into the channel protein upon inactivation. methanethiosulfonate methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium wild type.

RNA encoding wild type (WT) and F1489C mutant Na+ channel α subunits and WT β1 subunits was synthesized in vitro using the Ambion mMessage mMachine kit.

Healthy stage V and VI oocytes were pressure-injected with 50-100 nl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of α and β1 subunits at a concentration of 10-200 ng/μl. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out 2-8 days after injection. The excised inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique (19Hamill O.P Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.C. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) was used to obtain both macropatch and single channel data. Before recording, the vitelline layer was removed as described (20Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pflügers Arch. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For macropatch recording, the bath solution contained 10 mM NaCl, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For single channel patches KCl was reduced to 90 mM. For treatment with Ag+, the bath solution contained 150 mM potassium aspartate, 1 mM Mg(NO3)2, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For macropatch recording, the pipette solution contained 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For single channel recording it contained 115 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The volume of the bath chamber was about 0.3 ml and was perfused continuously with bath solution (3 ml/min). Excised patches were placed in a stream of the bath perfusate. Currents were recorded with a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier and filtered at 8 (macropatch currents) or 5 (single channel currents) kHz prior to digitization at 30 kHz. Aqueous stock solutions of MTS ethylammonium (MTSEA), MTS ethylsulfonate (MTSES), and MTS ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) (Toronto Research Chemicals) were prepared just prior to the experiment, maintained on ice, and diluted in the bath solution immediately before use. Single channel openings were detected using standard half-amplitude threshold analysis after digital filtering at 2 kHz (21Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.C. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 483-587Google Scholar). Patches contained one to four channels. Channel number was estimated from the maximum number of overlapping openings at potentials where the probability of opening was high (22Horn R. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Open times, closed times, and first latencies were analyzed using PSTAT (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Overlapping openings were omitted from analysis. Averaged data are presented as mean ± S.E., except for single channel data, which are given as mean ± S.D. Data predicted by particular models were simulated assuming one or two channels in the patch. For simulation, the minimum detectable duration was set at that observed experimentally in our recording system after filtering. Histograms of simulated data were generated using the same criteria used in generating histograms of experimental data. These predicted histograms were compared with the experimental data and rate constants adjusted to produce good fits to the data. In general the rate constants of Scheme 1 (see below) are highly determined by the data. The sum of the rates leaving the inactivated state, f + h, was chosen to fit the major component of closed times. The sum d + g, the two rates for leaving the open state, was determined from the open time. Values for d, e, and g were chosen to fit the burst duration and give the correct fraction of short closed times. The opening rate constant, c, was chosen to fit the duration of the rapid flickers in the bursts of MTSET-modified channels. Finally, the ratio of c to e was determined from the ratio of the rapidly versus slowly activating fractions in the first latency histogram. Replacement of Phe-1489 by hydrophobic amino acids leaves inactivation almost unchanged, whereas replacement by hydrophilic or charged amino acids almost completely removes inactivation (48Scheuer T. West J.W. Wang Y.L. Catterall W.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A88Google Scholar). 2S. Kellenberger, J. W. West, T. Scheuer, and W. A. Catterall, manuscript submitted. We constructed mutant F1489C in order to examine the chemical reactivity of the amino acid residue at position 1489. Co-expression of the mutant α subunit F1489C together with the β1 subunit in Xenopus oocytes resulted in Na+ channels with altered inactivation; 8% of the Na+ current failed to inactivate by the end of an 11-ms-long depolarization compared with 2% for the WT channel (Fig. 1A). The midpoint for the voltage dependence of activation of F1489C measured in cell-attached macropatches was not changed in comparison with WT, while the midpoint for the voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted from −101 ± 6 mV for WT (n = 12) to −84 ± 4 mV (n = 3) for F1489C. Ag+ reacts with sulfhydryl groups to form a strong S-Ag bond (23Dance I.G. Polyhedron. 1986; 5: 1037-1104Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar). After reaction with Ag+, cysteines have increased hydrophilicity but are uncharged. When AgNO3 (500 nM) was applied to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out F1489C patches, inactivation was almost completely removed (Fig. 1B; 87 ± 6% noninactivating current, n = 4), and the peak current amplitude at −20 mV was increased by 49 ± 28% (n = 4). AgNO3 did not affect inactivation of WT channels (data not shown), but application of AgNO3 to the extracellular surface of WT or F1489C channels in outside-out patches reduced peak Na+ currents of both WT and F1489C substantially, suggesting that this reagent reacts with another cysteine residue in the Na+ channel in addition to the inserted Cys-1489. To avoid possible effects of reaction at this second site, we focused primarily on reaction with MTS reagents. Charged methanethiosulfonate reagents can be used to add either positively or negatively charged groups to cysteine residues by disulfide exchange (24Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 25Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). MTS reagents did not affect either the magnitude of WT Na+ currents or their rate of decay in four patches (data not shown). In contrast, the MTS reagents had marked effects on inactivation of F1489C mutant channels. Application of 50 nM MTSET, which adds a positively charged group, nearly completely blocked fast inactivation of F1489C Na+ channels (Fig. 1C). The smaller MTS reagents, MTSES (500 nM), which adds a negatively charged group, or MTSEA (150 nM), which adds a positively charged group, slowed inactivation significantly and also slightly increased the fraction of noninactivating Na+ current observed at the end of the pulse (Fig. 1, D and E). The difference between these results and those obtained with MTSET-treated channels was not caused by incomplete reaction of MTSES and MTSEA. Application of MTSET after MTSES treatment had no additional effect on inactivation, indicating that the reaction of F1489C with MTSES was complete (n = 2, not shown). Treatment with MTS reagents also increased peak sodium current (Fig. 1, C-E). The extent of increase was correlated with the magnitude of increase of mean open times that is observed with the different MTS reagents (see below), consistent with the conclusion that slowed inactivation allowed more superimposed channel openings and thereby increased peak current. Table I summarizes the effects of MTS reagents and Ag+ on voltage-dependent channel gating. Treatment of F1489C with MTS reagents led to a 4-9 mV negative shift in the apparent voltage dependence of activation. Treatment with AgNO3 resulted in a 14-mV negative shift. These apparent voltage shifts may be caused indirectly by slowing of inactivation, as observed for α-scorpion toxins and proteolytic enzyme treatment (26Gonoi T. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Gonoi T. Hille B. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2836-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Fig. 2 shows representative single channel traces and the corresponding ensemble averages (last traces in each column) at −20 mV for F1489C Na+ channels before and after reaction with MTS reagents. The ensemble averages were derived from all analyzed single channel openings at −20 mV and were similar in time course to the macropatch currents shown in Fig. 1. Unmodified F1489C channels open soon after depolarization and reopen several times during a 40-ms depolarization, consistent with the small fraction of noninactivating current observed in macropatch voltage clamp records (Fig. 2). Single channel open times are well fit by a single exponential with a time constant of 0.27 ms (Fig. 3A, Table II), consistent with the presence of a single predominant open state. The closed time distributions showed two components, which had time constants of 0.75 and 8.6 ms at −20 mV in patches containing two Na+ channels (Fig. 2, Fig. 3B, Table II). The frequent reopening of F1489C channels indicates that fast inactivation of these channels is reversible and that the longer components of closed times represent sojourns in the destabilized inactivated state.Fig. 3Single channel properties of unmodified and MTSEA- and MTSET-treated channels. Analysis of single channel kinetics. For modified channels, recordings were made before and after 3-min perfusion with 1.5 μM MTSEA or 500 nM MTSET. Data are from six (F1489C), two (F1489C + MTSEA) and two patches (F1489C + MTSET). A, single channel open time histograms at −20 mV. Patches containing one to four channels were used for F1489C and MTSEA-modified F1489C open time analysis. Patches containing one or two channels were used for MTSET. The solid lines are fits of single exponentials to the log binned data (47Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys.

The dotted lines show simulated open time distributions calculated using the parameters given in Table III. B, closed time histograms at −20 mV. Only closed times occurring after the first opening of a depolarization were analyzed. The solid lines are fits of the sum of two (F1489C, F1489C + MTSEA) or three (F1489C + MTSET) exponentials to the log binned data with durations >100 μs (47Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, Table II). The dotted lines show closed time distributions calculated from model simulations using the parameters given in Table III. Data are from patches with two channels for F1489C and F1489C + MTSEA. With F1489C + MTSET, data are from patches with one or two channels, but only sweeps with one active channel were analyzed. Sweeps with two active channels were readily detected due to the high probability of opening after MTSET modification. C, cumulative first latency distributions at −40 mV displayed on two different time scales. Distributions were corrected for the channel number (30Patlak J. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 333-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The dotted lines are fits to the double exponential equation p = f × (1 − exp(−(x − l)/a)) + (1 − f) × (1 − exp(−x/b)), where p is the probability, f is the fraction of the fast component, l is the lag, and a and b are the time constants of the fast and slow components, respectively. l, f, a, and b were 0.30 ms, 0.44, 0.52 ms, and 25.37 ms (F1489C); 0.30 ms, 0.63, 0.43 ms, and 19.37 ms (F1489C + MTSEA); and 0.21 ms, 0.65, 0.45 ms, and 4.00 ms (F1489C + MTSET). Data are from patches with two channels (F1489C, F1489C + MTSEA) and one or two channels (F1489C + MTSET). Null sweeps generally occurred in long runs and were omitted from this analysis.

Open table in a new tab Modification of F1489C channels by MTSEA increased channel open times approximately 2-fold (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A, Table II). This increase in mean open time is an important contributor to the slowed decay of the Na+ current following reaction with MTSEA (Fig. 1E). The major component of the closed time distribution was similar in duration to the predominant closed time in unmodified F1489C channels (Fig. 2). Thus, the increased open time is primarily responsible for the slight increase in sustained Na+ current after reaction with MTSEA (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the rate of inactivation was substantially decreased by modification with MTSEA, but the stability of the inactivated state was nearly unaffected. Modification of F1489C channels by MTSET caused even longer open times (Fig. 2). A single time constant of 1.47 ms was observed, approximately 4.6-fold longer than unmodified F1489C (Fig. 3A). MTSET-modified channels showed long bursts of openings, and both long and short channel closures were evident. Within bursts, the openings were interrupted by short closings, and bursts were separated by longer closings. The two main closed times estimated by fits to closed time histograms were 0.1 and 0.75 ms at −20 mV, far shorter than the corresponding values for unmodified F1489C channels (Fig. 3B, Table II). A smaller number of long closures were also observed, and these were often truncated by the end of the pulse (Fig. 2, Table II). The latency to first opening after depolarization gives information about the rates of transitions among the nonconducting states traversed by a channel before opening. First latency distributions from single WT rat brain type IIA Na+ channels are characterized by a rapid time course and a substantial number of sweeps in which no opening occurs (null sweeps). In mutants with destabilized inactivation, the null sweeps disappear and are replaced by a slower component of the first latency distribution, which represents channels that inactivate from a closed state and then open (28McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12346-12350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cumulative distributions of first latencies at −40 mV for unmodified and modified F1489C channels were corrected for the number of channels in the patch (30Patlak J. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 333-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar; Fig. 3C) and fit with two exponentials (Fig. 3C, dotted lines), yielding time constants of 0.52 and 25.4 ms for unmodified F1489C, 0.43 and 19.4 ms for MTSEA-treated channels, and 0.45 and 4.4 ms for MTSET-treated channels. The fast time constant, which reflects openings from closed states, is not significantly changed by treatment with MTS reagents, consistent with the hypothesis that derivatization of Cys-1489 does not affect activation kinetics. The slow time constant, which appears in mutants with disrupted inactivation, is similar for unmodified and MTSEA-treated channels but is faster for MTSET-treated channels. The fraction of unmodified F1489C channels opening with the fast time constant is 0.44, whereas it is 0.63 and 0.65 for MTSEA- and MTSET-treated channels, respectively. The slowly opening channels are hypothesized to be channels that first inactivate from the closed state before opening and then open later as observed for other noninactivating mutants (28McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12346-12350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The reduced fraction of long first latencies indicates that, after MTS modification, fewer channels inactivate from a closed state before opening. Thus, the rate of inactivation from closed states is reduced as well as the rate of inactivation from the open state. Quantitative description of the changes in single channel gating properties requires fitting to a specific model of the state transitions that underlie the opening and closing of the channel. The simple kinetic model shown in Scheme 1 has been used successfully to describe the gating of single Na+ channels during depolarizations to −40 mV or more positive membrane potentials (31Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 32Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F.

Upon depolarization, Na+ channels undergo voltage-dependent transitions through multiple closed states (states C1 through C3), open (state O) and then inactivate (state I). Channels can also pass directly from one (or more) closed states to the inactivated state as illustrated. The simple model shown in Scheme 1 is advantageous for simulation and fitting of single channel data because the rate constants are constrained by the requirement for microscopic reversibility in the C-O-I loop. We used the model in Scheme 1 to simulate our data for"

In HeLa cells containing an integrated HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) -driven reporter, we now show that the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, inhibits activation of the HIV-1 LTR by interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, UV light, and osmotic stress. Inhibition was 70-90% in all but the case of tumor necrosis factor stimulation, where inhibition was 50%. Each of these stimuli activated p38, which was inhibited by SB203580 in vitro and in vivo with an IC50 (between 0.1 and 1 μM) similar to that required to inhibit transcription. In contrast, SB203580 had no effect on JNK, which was also activated by these stimuli. The NFκB sites in the HIV-1 LTR were required for a response to cytokines but not to UV, and SB203580 remained capable of inhibiting UV activation in the absence of the NFκB sites. Studies in which SB203580 was added at different times relative to UV stimulation suggested that the critical p38-mediated phosphorylation event occurred between 2 and 4 h after UV treatment. These data indicate that p38 is required for HIV-1 LTR activation but that the action of p38 is delayed, presumably due to substrate unavailability or inaccessibility.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).In order to dissect how cytokines and environmental stresses activate HIV-1 gene expression, we examined the effect of one of these inhibitors, SB203580, on the activation of HIV-1 LTR-directed CAT gene expression by cytokines and cellular stress. Our results suggest that p38 is involved in a pathway leading to activation of the HIV-1 LTR by cytokines and cellular stress.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription in HeLa cells in response to UV, IL-1, TNF, or high osmolarity. While it has been observed previously that overexpression of MAP kinase kinase-3 and p38 can activate the HIV LTR (51Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), this did not prove that p38 is used during physiological stimulation since overexpression can give erroneous results, as has been observed with MAP or ERK kinase kinase 1 activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (52Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In contrast, by showing that a specific inhibitor of p38, SB203580, inhibits HIV-1 LTR driven transcription in the same dose range that p38 kinase was inhibited in vivo provides strong evidence for the direct role of p38 during physiological stimulation by UV, IL-1, TNF, and high osmolarity. These results suggest that p38 will also be important in the activation of HIV itself, and indeed, SB203580 inhibits HIV-1 replication in response to IL-1 and TNF in a chronically infected human monocytic cell line. 2L. Shapiro and C. A. Dinarello, personal communication.One particular advantage of using a specific p38 inhibitor has been our ability to show that the key role of p38 in HIV-1 transcription activation occurs some 2-4 h after UV treatment, a somewhat surprising result given the rapid activation of p38. This delay is most likely due to the late appearance of an immediate or downstream substrate of the p38 MAP kinase pathway either through de novo synthesis, post-translational modification or localization. In support of de novo synthesis is the finding that UV stimulated HIV-1 transcription is inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. While cycloheximide also induces p38, it did not prevent further activation of p38 by UV, 3S. Kumar, unpublished observations. so that the action of cycloheximide cannot be attributed to down-regulation of the p38 pathway. It is also unlikely that cycloheximide is inhibiting the synthesis of a secreted autocrine factor that stimulates the appearance of the p38 pathway substrate through a posttranslational mechanism. Previous studies have shown that UV activation of c-fos transcription in HeLa cells depends on activation of growth factor receptors, such as EGF (19Kramer M. Sachsenmaier C. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6734-6741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), but this happens immediately after UV stimulation, which is too soon to allow substantial contribution from secreted factors. In support of this, we found that suramin, a polyanionic inhibitor of growth factor receptor signaling, completely inhibited both p38 activation and HIV-1-directed transcription if added prior to UV stimulation, but only partially inhibited both (40-60%) if the suramin was added 1 or 2 h after UV (data not shown). This indicates that substantial growth factor receptor stimulation occurs immediately after UV stimulation, and only part of the stimulation occurs at later times where the autocrine factor might be involved. Hence we conclude that the delay in the requirement for activated p38 is most likely due to the time required for UV to stimulate synthesis of a substrate of this pathway.Although it is clear that p38 regulates transcription, the identity of the target transcription factor is not yet known. In the case of UV stimulation, our data show that SB203580 does not inhibit NFκB activation. Furthermore, previous studies with integrated HIV-1 LTR-CAT constructs in HeLa cells have shown that deletion of other upstream regulatory elements, including the NFκB and AP-1 sites, had no effect on UV induction (13Valerie K. Singhal A. Kirkham J.C. Laster W.S. Rosenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15760-15767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the exception of the SP1 sites, which had a partial effect, and the TATA box, which was essential for induction. These data argue that p38 affects a basal transcriptional component of the HIV-1 LTR promoter and not any of the previously described potential transcriptional targets of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, such as ATF2, Elk1, or CHOP (51Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 57Wang X. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar).While activation of the HIV-1 LTR by IL-1 and TNF directly does depend on NFκB, recent data suggests that the p38 pathway may affect a similar transcriptional component. Beyaert et al. (58Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) showed that TNF-induced IL-6 production could be replicated by a minimal NFκB promoter CAT construct and could be inhibited by SB203580. However, SB203580 did not affect the TNF-induced DNA binding ability of NFκB or the phosphorylation of its p55 or p65 subunits, leading the authors to conclude that p38 regulated a component of the basal transcriptional machinery that interacts with NFκB. As a precedent, it was recently reported that UV can regulate the activity of the TFIIH complex (59Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) although there is no data to indicate whether this is responsible for the effects we are observing. It is also important to point out that the levels of other mRNAs, such as β2 microglobulin, were not affected by p38 inhibition, arguing that the p38 cascade target is unlikely to be a general transcription factor but rather one involved in the regulated expression of HIV-1 promoter, such as a coactivator. Identification of this factor will help us to understand the role of p38 in stress-activated regulation of transcription.

Activation of viral gene expression can occur in response to a variety of stimuli including mitogens, cytokines, and environmental stresses such as UV light, heat shock, and oxygen radicals (3Duh E.J.

Rosenberg M. Nature. 1988; 333: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which these stimuli activate HIV gene expression is not completely understood.Cytokines and mitogens such as phorbol esters appear to activate HIV gene expression in part through the core enhancer present in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), which contains two consensus NFκB binding sites (6Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 7Tong-Starksen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deletions or mutations in the NFκB enhancer abolish transactivation by these stimuli.In contrast, the mechanism of UV-induced HIV-1 expression is more complex.

It has been suggested that UV light may activate HIV gene expression through DNA damage and chromatin decondensation, which leads to increased accessibility of transcription factors to the promoter (12Valerie K.

One of these MAP kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), is primarily involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation and is activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and phorbol esters, but only poorly activated by stress or inflammatory cytokine simuli (26Blenis J.

To this end, we have fused Myc of the MC29 retrovirus with the rat glucocorticoid receptor. This chimeric protein requires dexamethasone to undergo nuclear translocation and achieve an active conformation. We employed a differential hybridization approach to identify mRNAs that are induced or repressed in infected avian fibroblasts in response to dexamethasone. This screen yielded one mRNA underrepresented in the dexamethasone-treated cells. In Myc-transformed cell clones, its level decreases 6-fold as early as 4 h and more than 30-fold after 32 h of exposure to the hormone. This mRNA was also down-regulated by recombinant Myc retroviruses in rodent fibroblasts, including those refractory to transformation.Sequence analysis revealed that it is homologous to the 3′ untranslated regions of the mammalian thrombospondin-1 genes. Using an anti-thrombospondin antibody, we confirmed that rodent cells overexpressing Myc produce very small amounts of this protein. Also, they do not support efficient expression of a reporter gene driven by the thrombospondin-1 promoter. Thus, thrombospondin-1 is a bona fide target of Myc. Moreover, its silencing might pertain to the transforming activity of Myc, since in several systems thrombospondin-1 exhibits tumor suppressor properties, presumably due to its negative effect on neovascularization.

It has been since shown to be an integral component of other acutely transforming retroviruses of both avian and mammalian species (3Enrietto P.J.

Furthermore, its cellular homolog c-myc is frequently amplified or rearranged in human malignancies, such as Burkitt's lymphomas and mammary adenocarcinomas (4Johnston J.M. Carroll W.L. Leuk.

All myc genes encode nuclear phosphoproteins capable of transcription regulation through a somewhat poorly characterized activation domain at the N terminus of the proteins (for a recent review see 6Amati B. Land H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Gene activation is thought to also involve sequence-specific binding, through the basic region at the C terminus of Myc, to a simple DNA element CACGTG, termed the E-box. Consequently, transient expression of a reporter gene placed downstream of tandemly repeated E-boxes is positively, if weakly, regulated by overexpressed c-Myc (7Amati B. Dalton S. Brooks M.W.

Lee L.A. Dang C.V. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6999-7009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, c-Myc has also been shown to behave as a transcriptional repressor (16Bernards R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 859-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism of repression involves the initiator element found in a variety of cellular and viral promoters (17Roy A.L. Carruthers C. Gutjahr T. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1993; 365: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Li L.-h. Nerlov C. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) including that of the cyclin D1 gene (ccnD1). Indeed, overexpression of human c-Myc has been shown to cause significant reduction in the level of the endogenous ccnD1 mRNA (20Philipp A. Schneider A. Vasrik I. Finke K. Xiong Y. Beach D. Alitalo K. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4032-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Unlike other putative Myc targets, ccnD1 does possess oncogenic activity when coexpressed with ras (21Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar). However, since in proliferating cells Myc represses, not activates, ccnD1, this type of regulation does not seem to bear on the transforming activity of Myc. To identify transformation-relevant targets of Myc, we have chosen to use a hormone-regulated allele of v-myc. Fusions between hormone-binding domains and oncoproteins, including Myc (22Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), have been valuable in dissection of molecular mechanisms of neoplastic transformation (23Mattioni T. Louvion J.F. Picard D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and references therein). We thus generated a conditional mutant of the MC29 v-myc retrovirus (GRIM), 1The abbreviations used are: GRIMglucocorticoid receptor-immobilized MycGRglucocorticoid receptorQEFquail embryo fibroblasts4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifentsp-1the thrombospondin-1 geneTsp-1the thrombospondin-1 proteinRIPradioimmunoprecipitationCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. which expressed v-Myc as a triple fusion protein with Gag (the retroviral structural protein) and the ligand-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (24Tikhonenko A.T. Black D.J. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1499-1508PubMed Google Scholar). GRIM-encoded oncoprotein (P145grim) is only active when dexamethasone, a synthetic ligand for GR, is present in cell culture medium. Indeed, establishment of the transformed phenotype by dexamethasone-inducible v-Myc is strictly hormone dependent. No phenotypical changes are observed when infected cells are maintained in hormone-free media. Furthermore, transformation is absolutely dependent upon DNA binding by Myc since a variant with a mutated basic region (GRIMlost) lacks any transforming potential (24Tikhonenko A.T. Black D.J. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1499-1508PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that this system was well suited to study the early effects of Myc on gene regulation using differential hybridization techniques. Specifically, we set out to identify mRNA(s) that were induced or repressed after short exposure to dexamethasone in cells infected with the v-Myc-GR chimeric virus. We reasoned that this might lead to identification of new or suspected tumor susceptibility or tumor suppressor genes. glucocorticoid receptor-immobilized Myc glucocorticoid receptor quail embryo fibroblasts 4-hydroxytamoxifen the thrombospondin-1 gene the thrombospondin-1 protein radioimmunoprecipitation chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Primary quail fibroblasts (QEF) and clones derived therefrom were maintained in F10 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 1% heat-inactivated chicken serum, and 1% Me2SO. All rat cells (PC12, fibroblasts, and aortic smooth muscle cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Media for the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line (25Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) were also supplemented with 5% horse serum. Human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Media and sera were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells to be tested for thrombospondin-1 expression were either kept untreated or exposed to one of the following drugs: 10 μM dexamethasone (Sigma), 10 μM RU486 (UCLAF-Roussel, Romansville, France), 100 μM emetine (Sigma), or 0.25 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). Preparation of hormone-free media by charcoal/dextran stripping has been described earlier (24Tikhonenko A.T. Black D.J. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1499-1508PubMed Google Scholar). A differential hybridization approach was used to identify mRNAs over- or under-represented in GRIMwild- versus GRIMlost-infected QEF. Corresponding mRNAs were extracted and purified using Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (QIAGEN), converted into cDNAs using SuperScript plasmid system, and cloned into the pSPORT1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Pooled cDNA clones were transcribed in vitro using SP6 RNA-polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [32P]UTP (DuPont NEN). Both cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The radiolabeled RNAs were used as hybridization probes to screen replica filters representing the original libraries. With respect to individual RNAs, the specific activities of these probes were inevitably low; hence, only abundantly expressed cDNAs could be identified. Since such cDNAs comprise the vast majority of cDNA libraries, no subtractive enrichments were performed. Instead, several thousand random clones were checked using differential hybridization. RNase protection analyses were performed on cell pellets (typically 250,000 cells) using the Direct Protect kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The tsp-1 riboprobe was synthesized in vitro from the SP6 promoter using [α-32P]UTP (DuPont NEN) and represented the antisense strand of the cDNA clone (304 nucleotides) identified in the differential hybridization screening (see above). The gapdh riboprobe was similarly prepared with T7 RNA polymerase and was complementary to the 3′-terminal 170-nucleotide segment of the mRNA encoding chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (26Dugaiczyk A. Haron J.A. Stone E.M. Dennison O.E. Rothblum K.N. Schwartz R.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The rat tsp-1 clone was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of rat genomic DNA using primers encompassing the 3′-end of mouse tsp-1 exon 22 (27Lawler J. Duquette M. Ferro P. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1991; 11: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The compositions of the primers were as follows: GACTATGTAGATATGCTATTTAAATAA (forward) and GTACATAAGAAACAGTAATATACAAGT (reverse). The resultant fragment, 289 base pairs in length, was cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and the corresponding riboprobe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase. Since the internal DraI site was used to prepare the DNA template, the protected fragment was only 260 nucleotides long. The rat gapdh probe was prepared by transcribing the 3′-terminal 211-base pair fragment of the full-length cDNA clone (28Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar; downstream from the StyI site) with T7 RNA polymerase. The intensities of tsp1- and gapdh-protected fragments were quantitated using a phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics). Approximately 5 × 106 cells were left untreated or treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 24 h. They were subsequently labeled for 4 h with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were lysed in the Ab buffer (29Tikhonenko A.T. Linial M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 946-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2.5 μl of the A4.1 α-Tsp-1 monoclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4°C. Then, 2.5 μl of a secondary goat α-mouse IgM antiserum (TAGO Inc., Camarillo, CA) were added along with 50 μl of Gamma-Bind G Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and incubation continued at room temperature for another 90 min. Standard collection and washing techniques were applied, and the immunoreactive proteins were run on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described earlier (29Tikhonenko A.T. Linial M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 946-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 106 Rat-1A cells were electroporated with 5-20 μg of a circular plasmid expressing the CAT gene and 2 μg of the plasmid expressing β-galactosidase from a cytomegalovirus early promoter (30Spaete R.R. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electroporation conditions were as follows: 800 V/cm, 960 μF, ∼11 ms. CAT and β-gal were quantified in the same cell lysates prepared 48 h post-transfection using thin layer chromatography (31Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) and a fluorometric assay (32Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), respectively. The substrates for these enzymes, [14C]chloramphenicol and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, were purchased from DuPont NEN and Sigma, respectively. We were particularly interested in early targets of v-Myc, rather than genes whose altered expression would merely be symptomatic of transformation. Hence, QEF infected with the wild type GRIM retrovirus (GRIMwild) were maintained in glucocorticoid-free medium until the virus had spread and were then treated with dexamethasone for only 4 h. At this point, no changes in cell morphology or growth rates were apparent. To account for effects induced by the endogenous GR, we used, as a negative control, QEF infected with a transformation-incompetent GRIMlost derivative (24Tikhonenko A.T. Black D.J. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1499-1508PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with dexamethasone for the same interval. Out of several thousand clones checked, only one was reproducibly found to display a differential hybridization pattern. Since it reacted much more strongly with the GRIMlost probe, it represented a potential Myc-repressed gene. The cDNA insert was sequenced and compared with the GenBank data base. It appeared to be almost identical (Fig. 1), with only one gap, to the 3′-untranslated region of the human mRNA encoding Tsp-1 (33Hennessy S.W. Frazier B.A. Kim D.D. Deckwerth T.L. Baumgartel D.M. Rotwein P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are at least five highly homologous tsp genes (34Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, their 3′-untranslated regions are quite dissimilar (35LaBell T.L. Byers P.H. Genomics. 1993; 17: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This 3′-terminal diversity allowed us to conclude that we had cloned the 3′ end of the avian tsp-1 gene, rather than tsp-2 or −4, which had been previously identified in avian species (36Lawler J. Duquette M. Ferro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8039-8043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tucker R.P. Adams J.C. Lawler J. Dev. Dynamics. 1995; 203: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). tsp-1 encodes a secreted glycoprotein comprised of three identical 140-kDa polypeptide chains (34Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 38Lahav J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Tsp-1 has been reported to inhibit tumor neovascularization both in vitro and in vivo (39Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 40Iruela-Arispe M.L. Bornstein P. Sage H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5026-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This activity, at least in some systems, inversely correlates with growth rates and malignant progressions of primary tumors and metastases (41Zabrenetzky V. Harris C.C. Steeg P.S. Roberts D.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 42Weinstat-Saslow D.L. Zabrenetzky V.S. VanHoutte K. Frazier W.A. Roberts D.D. Steeg P.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6504-6511PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sheibani N. Frazier W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6788-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, its down-regulation would be consistent with the oncogenic activity of Myc. To confirm that tsp-1 mRNA is indeed down-regulated by P145grim, we performed RNase protection analyses on QEF acutely infected with either GRIMwild or GRIMlost and maintained either in the absence or in the presence of dexamethasone. Molecular clones of tsp-1 and chicken gapdh were used to prepare antisense hybridization probes. In quail fibroblasts (Fig. 2), the tsp-1 riboprobe protects the predicted 304-nucleotide RNA fragment (see “Experimental Procedures”) and also several slightly shorter fragments presumably truncated at cryptic polyadenylation sites in the AT-rich 3′-untranslated regions of tsp-1 (33Hennessy S.W. Frazier B.A. Kim D.D. Deckwerth T.L. Baumgartel D.M. Rotwein P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). gapdh encodes a housekeeping enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase whose mRNA does not vary significantly among different tissues (44Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Therefore, its 170-nucleotide protected fragment was used as an internal control to which all tsp-1 values were normalized. We found that when dexamethasone was omitted, GRIMwild- and GRIMlost-infected cells produced similar amounts of tsp-1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). In the presence of dexamethasone, however, tsp-1 mRNA was down-regulated 7-fold, but only in GRIMwild and not in GRIMlost cells. Thus, tsp-1 down-regulation by dexamethasone does require intact Myc and is not due to the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor. To corroborate this conclusion, we treated hormone-starved GRIMwild cells with RU486. RU486 is a synthetic antagonist of dexamethasone, which most likely prevents binding of the GR to the glucocorticoid-responsive elements in DNA (45Baulieu E.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 626: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, RU486 is able to serve as a ligand and to support gene regulation by chimeric receptors via non-glucocorticoid-responsive element sequences. Indeed, in the case of GR-Myc chimeras, RU486 triggers transformation as efficiently as does dexamethasone (data not shown). Predictably, RU486-treated QEF contain less tsp-1 mRNA than untreated (Fig. 2B). We also examined whether down-regulation of tsp-1 was peculiar to the GRIM system or could be observed in cells transformed by naturally occurring Myc variants. To this end, we infected avian fibroblasts with the wild type MC29 (MC29wild) and the MC29lost derivative (46Tikhonenko A.T. Hartman A.-R. Linial M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3623-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In MC29wild- but not MC29lost-infected cells, tsp-1 mRNA levels were severalfold lower than in uninfected cells, suggesting that v-Myc exerts the same repression as its artificial GR-Myc counterpart (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, QEF productively infected with a c-Myc-encoding retrovirus exhibited only a very subtle decline in the steady-state level of the tsp-1 mRNA (data not shown). This correlates with the observation that unmutated c-Myc, even when overexpressed, possesses only very weak transforming potential in avian fibroblasts (3Enrietto P.J. Cancer Surveys. 1987; 6: 85-99PubMed Google Scholar). We further used the GR-v-Myc system to assess the extent and kinetics of tsp-1 silencing. We have repeatedly observed that in retrovirally infected cultures, some cells always expressed very little or no v-Myc (immunofluorescence data not shown). This fraction of cells could account for rather high (∼15%) residual levels of tsp-1 mRNA in mass cultures expressing P145grim. We therefore analyzed several single cell GRIM clones that had been selected for a pronounced transformed phenotype in dexamethasone-containing media and, by inference, for high levels of v-Myc expression (24Tikhonenko A.T. Black D.J. Linial M.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1499-1508PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state levels of tsp-1 mRNA were assessed at different times after the addition of dexamethasone. In control uninfected QEF, the expression level of tsp-1 mRNA increases slightly during the first 4 h of exposure to dexamethasone and then levels off (Fig. 2D). This transient phenomenon may reflect the limited responsiveness of the tsp-1 promoter to glucocorticoids, previously reported for mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (negative response) (47Smith J.B. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16756-16765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (positive response) (48Huang L.Q. Whitworth J.A. Chesterman C.N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1995; 6: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we never observed any significant alterations in tsp-1 mRNA expression after prolonged (>24 h) stimulations (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In contrast, in the GRIM-producing clonal cell line B6 (Fig. 2E), the level of tsp-1 mRNA decreases more than 30-fold after 32 h of exposure to dexamethasone. Similar results were obtained for two other independent GRIM-producing clones (data not shown). Importantly, in GRIM clones tsp-1 mRNA levels decreased at least 6-fold as early as 4 h post-induction (Fig. 2E, two leftmost lanes). This implied that tsp-1 is an early or even an immediate early target of Myc, and its regulation might not require de novo macromolecule synthesis, as is the case during induction of tsp-1 by platelet-derived growth factor (48Huang L.Q. Whitworth J.A. Chesterman C.N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1995; 6: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If this scenario is correct, then down-regulation of tsp-1 by Myc could occur even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, such as emetine. We thus treated the GRIM/B6 clone with dexamethasone for 6 h in the presence and in the absence of emetine (Fig. 2F). While dexamethasone alone caused a sharp reduction in the tsp-1 mRNA level (compare lanes “−” and “Dex”), no inhibition was apparent when both drugs were present in the cell culture medium (lane “D+E”). We thus concluded that protein synthesis is required for GR-Myc to function as an inhibitor. Still, this observation is hard to interpret unambiguously. Myc proteins are extremely short-lived, and treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors dramatically reduces their steady-state levels (50Hann S.R. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2486-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Hence, we could not determine whether de novo protein synthesis is required to silence tsp-1 or merely to maintain an adequate level of P145grim. Our finding that tsp-1 mRNA levels are lowered by P145grim in transformed avian fibroblasts prompted us to investigate the effect of other alleles of Myc in other cell types. To extend the correlation between the down-regulation of tsp-1 and neoplastic transformation, we examined rodent Rat-1A cells, the only tissue culture system in which c-Myc itself can induce complete morphological transformation (51Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Probes specific for the rat tsp-1 and gapdh genes were designed to protect RNA fragments 260 and 211 nucleotides long, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). They were used to analyze mRNAs from Rat-1A cells infected with either the empty LXSN retroviral vector or a derivative LMycSN (52Blackwood E.M. Lugo T.G. Kretzner L. King M.W. Street A.J. Witte O.N. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which overexpresses human c-Myc protein. We found that in Rat-1A cells, overexpression of c-Myc caused more than a 5-fold reduction in tsp-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Thus, the effect of Myc on tsp-1 expression is not limited to primary avian fibroblasts and can be observed in mammalian cells susceptible to transformation by Myc. The positive correlation between the transforming potential of Myc and its ability to down-regulate tsp-1 raised the formal possibility that silencing of thrombospondin-1 is merely a marker of transformation, rather than a direct consequence of v-Myc activation. To address this concern, we used another rodent cell line, Rat-1. Unlike its derivative Rat-1A, Rat-1 is not susceptible to transformation by c-Myc alone (51Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ability of c-Myc to silence tsp-1 in Rat-1 cells was determined using a subclone expressing a fusion between c-Myc and the estrogen receptor (20Philipp A. Schneider A. Vasrik I. Finke K. Xiong Y. Beach D. Alitalo K. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4032-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This fusion utilizes a particular estrogen receptor variant (ER™), which is refractory to endogenous estrogens often present in the serum but sensitive to the synthetic ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). In addition, ER™ conveniently lacks the transcription activation domain present in the wild type receptor (53Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). We observed (Fig. 3B) that inclusion of 4-OHT in the cell culture medium for 24 h caused a profound decrease in the tsp-1 mRNA level in cells expressing Myc-ER™ (two leftmost lanes) but not in the control Rat-1 cells (two rightmost lanes). We thus concluded that down-regulation of tsp-1 by Myc does not require establishment of the transformed phenotype and can be directly attributed to the transcriptional activity of Myc. To extend our observation that tsp-1 mRNA is down-regulated in Myc-infected cells, we assessed the levels of its translation product. For this purpose, we carried out radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments using a commercially available monoclonal antibody to human thrombospondin-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the predicted molecular mass of the Tsp-1 polypeptide chain is 140 kDa, thrombospondin-1 usually migrates as a protein of almost 180 kDa due to extensive glycosylation (54Castle V.P. Ou X. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2899-2903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the α-Tsp-1 antibody precipitates one major protein of approximately 170 kDa from primary human foreskin fibroblasts (Fig. 4, lane 1). This band does not appear when the primary antibody is omitted from the RIP (lane 2). We thus conclude that it represents Tsp-1. The same protein is present in immunoprecipitates from primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells (lane 3) but not from rat PC12 cells (lane 4) lacking tsp-1 mR"

We have carried out mutations on E-cadherin, involving domain deletions as well as substitutions of specific amino acids, in order to identify the sites recognized by the integrin. Binding of αEβ7 required the presence of the first two N-terminal domains of E-cadherin. Deletion of extracellular domains 3 and 4 or truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin had no consequence on integrin binding. Substitution of a glutamic acid in the BC loop of the Ig structure of the fist, N-terminal, domain of E-cadherin abrogated binding of αEβ7. This mutation did not appear to affect the conformation of the domain nor the pattern of expression of E-cadherin on the cell surface. Synthetic peptides encompassing the first domain of E-cadherin had very little inhibitory effect on the interaction with αEβ7. Our results highlight structural dissimilarities between recognition of E-cadherin by αEβ7 and recognition of other members of the IgSF by integrins and show that the heterophilic (integrin binding) and homophilic sites in the N-terminal domain of E-cadherin are distinct.

Our results highlight structural dissimilarities between recognition of E-cadherin by αEβ7 and recognition of other members of the IgSF by integrins and show that the heterophilic (integrin binding) and homophilic sites in the N-terminal domain of E-cadherin are distinct. The cadherins are a superfamily of Ca2+-dependent homophilic cell adhesion molecules that regulate recognition and interaction between cells (1Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). E-cadherin, which is expressed by epithelial cells, plays an important role in embryonic development (1Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and in tissue morphogenesis (1Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev.

It is pivotal in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity (4McNeill H. Ozawa M. Kemler R. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and in tumor suppression (5Frixen U.H. Behrens J. Sachs M. Eberle G. Voss B. Warda A. Lochner D. Birchmeier W. J.

Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin is localized at the basolateral membrane and is concentrated at the adherens junctions (7Boller K. Vestweber D. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of E-cadherin is made up of five tandem repeats of approximately 110 amino acids each (1Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The adhesion specificity resides in the N-terminal extracellular domain and is dependent on the integrity of the amino acid sequence HAV (8Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin associates with the catenins, which provide linkage to the actin cytoskeleton (9Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The presence of the cytoplasmic domain is essential for the function of E-cadherin in homophilic cell-cell interactions and cellular organization (10Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 11Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). E-cadherin can associate with various membrane and cytoplasmic proteins (1Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 12Cowin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10759-10761Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and can transduce information from extracellular contacts, as well as initiate intracellular signaling pathways. The first, N-terminal, extracellular domain of E-cadherin has an Ig-like structure composed of seven anti-parallel β-strands arranged as two opposing sheets (13Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A calcium binding pocket is present at the interface between successive domains (13Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The protein is most likely to be expressed as a dimer (14Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), with the junction between domains 1 and 2 providing the interface for dimerization. Three calcium ions bound at the junction between domains 1 and 2 coordinate and stabilize the formation of the dimer (14Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). A general model for cadherin-mediated interactions has been proposed in which cadherin dimers on opposing cells form a zipper-like superstructure compounding weak adhesive interactions to form strong intercellular bonds (15Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.-F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in homophilic cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin has been shown to be a ligand for integrin αEβ7 (16Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russell G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 17Karecla P.I. Bowden S.J. Green S.J. Kilshaw P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This integrin shows a very narrow pattern of expression, being restricted to T lymphocytes in the vicinity of mucosal epithelia (18Cerf-Bensussan N. Jarry A. Brousse N. Lisowska-Grospierre B. Guy-Grand D. Griscelli C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 19Cerf-Bensussan N. Begue B. Gagnon J. Meo T. Eur. J.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The level of expression is particularly high on intraepithelial lymphocytes in the gut, a population that represents a large proportion of the total T cell complement of the body. In the present report, we describe mutagenesis studies on E-cadherin, involving both domain deletions and point mutations, that aim to identify the binding sites for αEβ7. Our results show that the N-terminal domains 1 and 2 of E-cadherin are both required for integrin binding and that a glutamic acid in the first domain is crucial for the interaction. The location of this residue in the loop connecting β-strands B and C and the identity of its neighboring amino acids highlight striking differences between the interaction of αEβ7 with E-cadherin and the interaction of other leukocyte integrins with the IgSF.

Rat mAb supernatants DECMA-1 (22Ozawa M. Hoschutzky H. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 49-56Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and ECCD-2 (23Shirayoshi Y. Nose A. Iwasaki K. Takeichi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were obtained from the hybridoma lines. Purified IgG prepared from a third E-cadherin mAb, ECCD-1(8), and from ECCD-2 were purchased from R&D Systems, Abingdon, U. K. mAb M290, specific for αEβ7, has been described previously (20Kilshaw P.J. Baker K.C. Immunol. Lett. 1988; 18: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MAC123, rat IgG mAb against an irrelevant antigen, was used as a control in immunofluorescence studies. FITC-labeled rabbit F(ab′)2 anti-rat IgG (Serotec, Oxford, U. K.) was used as a second step reagent for immunofluorescence staining. cDNA for mouse E-cadherin (24Ringwald M. Schuh R. Vestweber D. Eistetter H. Lottspeich F. Engel J. Dolz R. Jahnig F. Epplen J. Mayer S. Muller C. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in pBluescript SK+ was obtained from R. Kemler (Max-Planck Institute, Freiburg, Germany). Regions coding for extracellular domains EC1, EC2, EC3, and EC4 were separately deleted from the cDNA using the overlap extension PCR method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). The decision on domain boundaries was guided by the assignment of repeats in the E-cadherin sequence obtained from SwissProt Data Base (CADEmouse, AC P09803). EC1 is defined as amino acids 1-108, EC2 as amino acids 109-221, EC3 as amino acids 222-332, and EC4 as amino acids 333-439. To generate a full-length expression construct, the PCR, utilizing Pfu polymerase, was used with the primers: 5′-AGTGGATCCCCCAGATCTGAGCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACTTTCTAGACCCCTAGTCGTCCTCGCCAC-3′ (reverse). The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used for generating the domain deletion mutant DNA by PCR: deletion of EC1, 5′-CTCAGAAGACAGAAACGAACCCAGGAGGTGTTTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGTTTCTGTCTTCTGAGACC-3′ (reverse); deletion of EC2, 5′-GACAACAGGCCAGAGTTTAACCCGAGCACGTATCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACTCTGGCCTGTTGTCATT-3′ (reverse); deletion of EC3, 5′-AATGACAACGCTCCTGTCTTCATGCCTGCGGAGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAGGAGCGTTGTCATTAAT-3′ (reverse); deletion of EC4, 5′-AATGAAGCCCCCATCTTTATCCCAGAACCTCGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGATGGGGGCTTCATT-3′ (reverse). Each mutant DNA was prepared using PCR reactions to encompass the domains on each side of the deletion and a third reaction to join the two products. These mutants were constructed in pBluescript SK+, excised by digesting with BglII/XbaI, and ligated into pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen) at BamHI/XbaI sites. Another mutant was constructed in which the DNA sequence coding for the last 72 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (amino acids 657-728) were deleted. For this mutation, the primers 5′-AGTGGATCCCCCAGATCTGAGCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGCAGTCGACTAGAAGTTTCCAATTTCATCAGGATT-3′ (reverse) were used. The latter incorporates a stop codon. This mutant DNA was excised from pBluescipt SK+ using enzymes BglII/SalI and ligated into pcDNAI/Neo at BamHI/XhoI sites. The fidelity of each domain deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutations of single amino acids in domain 1 of E-cadherin were introduced by the site-specific mutagenesis method of Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides. Wild-type E-cadherin was subcloned into pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) and a Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, U. K.) was used to prepare the mutations. Six amino acids (Glu-31, Asp-44, Glu-54, Glu-56, Glu-86, and Glu-93) were mutated to alanine. The oligonucleotides used consisted of 28-36 DNA bases spanning the mutation sites and incorporating a single base change (A to C) in codons for aspartate or glutamate. DNA sequencing identified plasmids that contained the desired mutation, and these were transfected into mouse L cells. Wild-type and mutated E-cadherin cDNAs were stably transfected by the calcium phosphate method into mouse L cells, which do not normally express E-cadherin. Wild-type cDNA and domain deletion constructs were in the vector pcDNAI/Neo. Constructs carrying the point mutations were in pcDNAI/Amp, and these were cotransfected with pSV2*Neo (27Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) at a 10:1 molar ratio to permit selection. The transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, 10% FCS, 0.9 mg/ml geneticin (G418). After two weeks of G418 selection, transfectants expressing high levels of E-cadherin were isolated by cell sorting on a Facstar (Becton Dickinson), following immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin. Alternatively, they were treated with DECMA-1 and positively selected by panning on Petri dishes coated with affinity-purified sheep anti-rat Ig (Seralab, U. K.) at 10 μg/ml. L cell transfectants were lifted with 0.05% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution in the presence of 2.0 mM Ca2+ to maintain conformational integrity of E-cadherin (28Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with mAbs to E-cadherin followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG. Immunofluorescence was analyzed with a Facscan (Becton Dickinson) using Consort 30 or Lysys software. Transfected L cells expressing wild-type or mutated E-cadherin were seeded onto glass coverslips overnight so that they formed a confluent layer. For immunofluorescent staining, live unfixed cells on coverslips were incubated with mAb DECMA-1 supernatant for 12 min at room temperature, washed with medium (6 min), incubated with secondary FITC-labeled antibody for 12 min at room temperature and washed with medium (6 min). Stained cells were observed under an Odyssey XL laser scanning confocal microscope (Noran Instruments Inc.) using standard FITC filters. The atomic coordinates of E-cadherin domain 1 were obtained from Dr. M. Ikura (University of Toronto, Canada), and the structure was modelled on an Evans & Sutherland computer using the program FRODO. Two linear peptides, NRDKETKV and RENKKTDV, were synthesized in a Milligan Biosearch 9500 synthesizer using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids and a N,N-dimethylformamide solvent system. Peptide sequences were confirmed by Edman degradation using an ABI 470A protein sequencer with a 120APTH analyzer. Cyclic peptides, CDKETKC and CDKKTEC, and overlapping peptides of 15 amino acids each, spanning the first domain of E-cadherin, were made by Alta Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, U. K. Adhesion of MTC-1 cells to a monolayer of CMT93 or L cells was assayed as described previously (17Karecla P.I. Bowden S.J. Green S.J. Kilshaw P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Blocking antibody, M290 IgG, was used at 10 μg/ml. Peptides were used at the indicated concentrations. In some experiments, a variation of the assay was used: cells were plated on the 96-well plate for only six hours, instead of overnight, at a low density (1.0 × 104 cells/well instead of 3.5 × 104 cells/well). These conditions resulted in a sparse cell monolayer. The domain deletion mutants are schematically outlined in Fig. 1. In four of these (Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4) E-cadherin domains EC1, EC2, EC3, and EC4 were separately removed. Mutant Δcyt encoded E-cadherin lacking the last 72 amino acids in the C terminus of the cytoplasmic domain, which is the region required for binding to the cytoskeleton (10Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 11Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Expression of mutant E-cadherin by L cell transfectants was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal antibodies DECMA-1, ECCD-1, and ECCD-2 (Fig. 2). mAb MAC123 against an irrelevant antigen was used as a negative control. Previous studies have established that DECMA-1, which blocks the homophilic adhesion function of E-cadherin, recognizes an epitope located at the membrane proximal part of the extracellular region of E-cadherin (22Ozawa M. Hoschutzky H. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 49-56Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that ECCD-1, which also blocks E-cadherin homophilic function, binds to an epitope in EC1 (8Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The location of the epitope for ECCD-2 (23Shirayoshi Y. Nose A. Iwasaki K. Takeichi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) has not been reported. L cells transfected with the domain deletion mutant Δ1 showed no staining with either ECCD-1 or ECCD-2 but good staining with DECMA-1 (Fig. 2). Mutant Δ4 showed staining with ECCD-1 and ECCD-2 but not with DECMA-1. Transfectants expressing mutants Δ2, Δ3, and Δcyt showed staining with all three antibodies. The results confirm the location of epitopes for ECCD-1 and DECMA-1 and show that ECCD-2, which does not block the homophilic function of E-cadherin but does inhibit binding to αEβ7 (17Karecla P.I. Bowden S.J. Green S.J. Kilshaw P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), detects an epitope in domain EC1.Fig. 2FACS analysis of the cell surface expression of E-cadherin on L cells transfected with domain deletion mutant DNA. Cells expressing mutants Δ1 (A), Δ2 (B), Δ3 (C), Δ4 (D), and Δcyt (E) were stained with antibodies: MAC123, negative control (1); ECCD-1 (2); ECCD-2 (3); and DECMA-1 (4). Two divisions on the log scale represent one decade.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transfectants carrying the five E-cadherin domain deletion mutants were tested for adhesion to MTC-1 cells, which express αEβ7 at high levels (Fig. 3). Transfectants carrying wild-type E-cadherin or empty vector were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Mutants Δ1 and Δ2 showed no adhesion activity above background, whereas mutants Δ3, Δ4, and Δcyt supported the same level of adhesion as wild-type E-cadherin (Fig. 3). The adhesion activity of mutants Δ3, Δ4, and Δcyt was strongly inhibited by mAb M290, which blocks αEβ7 function. Studies on interactions between integrins and cell adhesion molecules of the IgSF have shown that certain conserved motives, which invariably include a highly exposed charged residue located within loop regions of the Ig structure, are important for recognition by integrins (29Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2065-2070PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we targeted for mutagenesis six exposed glutamic or aspartic acid residues in domain EC1 of E-cadherin; Glu-31, Asp-44, Glu-54, Glu-56, Glu-86, and Glu-93 were mutated to alanine. A computer-generated model of EC1 showing the location of the six amino acids is seen in Fig. 4. The level of expression of mutant E-cadherin on the surface of L cell transfectants was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence with E-cadherin antibodies (Fig. 5). All transfectants were able to bind antibodies DECMA-1, ECCD-1, and ECCD-2 at comparable levels. It is, therefore, unlikely that the mutations were sited within the epitopes detected by the EC1 antibodies, ECCD-1 and ECCD-2. The mutants were tested for adhesion to MTC-1 cells (Fig. 6A). The mutant E31A showed no adhesion above background levels, whereas all the other mutants supported adhesion of MTC1 cells to the same extent as wild-type E-cadherin. In all cases where adhesion activity was observed, it was inhibitable by the αEβ7 blocking antibody M290.Fig. 5FACS analysis of the cell surface expression of E-cadherin on L cells transfected with mutated E-cadherin DNA. Mutants E31A (A), D44A (B), E54A (C), E56A (D), E86A (E), and E93A (F) were stained with antibodies: MAC123, negative control (1); ECCD-1 (2); ECCD-2 (3); and DECMA-1 (4). Two divisions on the log scale represent one decade.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Adhesion assay with L cell transfectants expressing single amino acid substitution mutants of E-cadherin. MTC-1 cells were assayed for binding to L cell transfectants plated for either 24 h at high density to form a confluent monolayer (A) or for 6 h at low density to form a sparse monolayer (B). The hatched bars represent percent adhesion in the presence of blocking antibody M290. Results shown are the average of three experiments, and error bars represent the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Adhesion assays were also conducted in which a minimum period of time (six h) was allowed for the L cell transfectants to attach to the assay plate before the test. The purpose was to minimize potential redistribution of mutant E-cadherin to the basolateral surfaces of adjacent cells. Furthermore, the cells were plated at lower density to achieve a sparse distribution and thus enhance accessibility of mutant E-cadherin to the integrin. Under these assay conditions, the mutant E31A still failed to support adhesion to MTC-1 cells (Fig. 6B). From these results, we conclude that Glu-31 in the BC loop of E-cadherin domain EC1 is critical for binding αEβ7 and that, unlike the situation with other IgSF integrin ligands, the CD loop of E-cadherin, where Asp-44 is located, does not play a role. We investigated the cell surface distribution of mutant E-cadherin carrying the E31A substitution in a monolayer of L cell transfectants, similar to that used in the adhesion assay, to be certain that the mutant protein was exposed on the upper surface of the cells. L cell transfectants expressing wild-type E-cadherin or E31A mutant were grown on coverslips for 24 h to a confluent monolayer and then stained by immunofluorescence, without fixation, for E-cadherin. The labeled cells were observed by confocal microscopy to determine the cell surface localization of E-cadherin. In both transfectants, there was a strong staining pattern on the cell boundaries and weaker but consistent staining on the upper surface of the cells (Fig. 7). A linear peptide, NRDKETKV, which represents the sequence of amino acids 27-34 of E-cadherin domain EC1 and spans the entire BC loop, was tested for inhibitory activity in the adhesion assay (Fig. 8). A scrambled sequence, RENKKTDV, served as a control. The epithelial cell line CMT93 was used in these adhesion tests instead of E-cadherin transfectants because these cells show lower background levels of adhesion to MTC-1 cells (17Karecla P.I. Bowden S.J. Green S.J. Kilshaw P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). At 2.0 mg/ml, the NRDKETKV peptide had a small but significant effect, causing approximately 35% inhibition, whereas the control peptide had no activity. We also tested the shorter, cyclic peptide CDKETKC together with CDKKTEC as a control. It had no effect on adhesion (not shown). In an attempt to identify other sites in domain EC1 that may be involved in the interaction with the integrin, a panel of 22 overlapping peptides, each 15 amino acids long and spanning the entire domain EC1 of E-cadherin, was screened for inhibitory activity. None had any significant effect (not shown). The present report describes mutagenesis studies involving domain deletions and mutation of specific amino acids in E-cadherin with the objective of identifying sites recognized by the mucosal integrin αEβ7.

Grb7 is an SH2 and PH domain-containing molecule that is known to be overexpressed in some breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Here we show that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly bind to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in vitro. Grb7 association to the PDGF beta-receptor was dramatically reduced by replacement of tyrosine residues 716 or 775 with phenylalanine residues. Synthetic phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 inhibited binding of the Grb7 SH2 domain to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in a manner similar to but distinct from the binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain. Grb7 associated with activated PDGF beta-receptors in vivo, and the association was dramatically reduced by substitution of Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 with a phenylalanine residue. Furthermore, complex formation between Shc and Grb7 was observed after ligand stimulation of PDGF alpha- or beta-receptors in cells transfected with Grb7 cDNA or in the breast cancer cell line BT-474. Thus, Grb7 is implicated in PDGF signaling pathways in certain cell types by binding to the receptor directly or indirectly via Shc."

We have analyzed its role in the regulation of volume-activated chloride currents (ICl, vol) by loading the cells via the patch pipette with a peptide comprising the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II. This sequence harbors the binding site for the intracellular annexin II ligand, p11, and the peptide interferes with the annexin II-p11 complex formation. Loading of a CPAE cell with this peptide caused a gradual decrease in the amplitude of ICl, vol during repetitive stimulations with a 28% hypotonic extracellular solution. This run down of the current was virtually absent in untreated cells and in cells that were loaded with a mutated 14-amino acid peptide, which has a single amino acid replacement known to result in a more than 1000 times reduced affinity for binding to p11.

We conclude that annexin II-p11 complex formation is either directly or indirectly involved in the activation of ICl, vol in endothelial cells. Volume-activated Cl− channels have been described in various non-excitable cell types, including endothelial cells. They are supposed to play a major role in cell volume regulation, the control of intracellular pH, and the transport of organic osmolytes (1Strange K. Jackson P.S.

The biophysical and pharmacological properties of this current have been characterized, but its gating mechanism and its possible links to the cytoskeleton are still not understood. Annexins form a family of Ca2+-binding proteins and membrane phospholipid-binding proteins that are thought to participate in a variety of membrane-related events (for review, see 4Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 6Kaetzel A.M.

Several annexins bind to F-actin in vitro and may therefore be involved in the organization of the membrane-associated cytoskeleton (8Glenney J.R. BioEssays. 1987; 7: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Gerke V. Moss S.E. The Annexins. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 47-59Google Scholar). The microfilament binding annexin II also binds to another cellular protein ligand, the S100 protein p11 (10Weber K. Moss S.E. The Annexins. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 61-68Google Scholar). P11 forms dimers, and annexin II-p11 interaction thus leads to the formation of an (annexin II2)-(p11)2 heterotetramer. Monomeric annexin II is at least in part cytosolic, whereas the heterotetramer appears to be restricted to the cortical cytoskeleton (11Zokas L. Glenney J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kube E. Becker T. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 14175-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p11 binding site is contained within the 14 N-terminal residues of annexin II, which form an amphiphilic α-helix (13Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 8: 2435-2442Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A similar specific and high affinity binding to p11 is also observed for a synthetic peptide spanning the 14-residue sequence (Ac-(1-14)) but not for a mutated peptide in which one of the crucial hydrophobic residues for p11 binding (Leu-7) has been replaced by glutamic acid (14Becker T. Weber K. Johnsson N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4207-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the effects of the synthetic annexin II peptide Ac-(1-14) and the mutated Ac-(1-14)-peptide (L7E) on volume-activated Cl− currents. Disrupting the annexin II-p11 complex in the presence of Ac-14 significantly inhibits volume-activated Cl− currents, whereas the mutated peptide does not affect these currents. It is concluded that annexin II-p11 complex formation directly or indirectly modulates mechano-sensitive Cl− channels of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Cells from a cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell line (CPAE, 1The abbreviations used are: CPAEcalf pulmonary artery endothelial cellsHTShypotonic solutionMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cells.

Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 in air. calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells hypotonic solution Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Whole-cell membrane currents were measured in nonconfluent single endothelial cells using ruptured patches. Currents were amplified with an EPC-9 (List Electronic, Germany) patch clamp amplifier and sampled at 4-ms intervals (2048 points per record, filtered at 100 Hz). The voltage protocol consisted of a step to −80 mV for 1.2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV, followed by a step to −150 mV for 0.4 s, and a 5.2-s linear voltage ramp to +100 mV, before stepping back to the holding potential. This protocol was repeated every 15 s. Cells were superfused with normal Krebs' solution containing (in mmol/liter) 132.2 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 11.5 glucose, 11.5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1 M NaOH. Its osmolality, as measured with a Wescor 5500 osmometer (Schlag Instruments, Gladbach, Germany), was 290 mosm/kg H2O. To induce cell swelling, we switched from a modified, isotonic solution containing (in mmol/liter) 94.6 NaCl, 4.2 CsCl, 0.9 MgCl2, 1.1 CaCl2, 8.2 glucose, 8.2 HEPES, 81 mmol/liter mannitol, adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1 M NaOH to a hypotonic solution with the same composition from which mannitol was omitted (HTS, 209 mosm/liter). CsCl was used in these solutions to block the endothelial inwardly rectifying K+ currents. The internal pipette solution contained (in mmol/liter) 40 CsCl, 100 Cs+ aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 4 Na2ATP, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 M KOH. The annexin-peptides, acetyl-STVHEILCKLSLEG (Ac-(1-14), derived from the authentic sequence of the annexin-II N terminus which contains the p11 binding site, and the mutant, acetyl-STVHEIECKLSLEG (L7E-Ac-(1-14), Glu for Lys exchanged at position 7, resulting in a more than 1000 times reduced affinity for p11) were loaded into the cell via the patch pipette. The peptides were applied at a concentration of 100 μM, which is about 100 times higher than the estimated annexin II concentration in CPAE cells (see below). For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were loaded with 2 μmol/liter Fura-II/AM or via the patch pipette with 200 μmol/liter penta-K+ salt of Fura-II (molecular mass of 832 Da). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored using a photomultiplier-based system to measure the emission of the dye that was excited alternatively at 360 and 390 nm via a rotating filter wheel. Correction for autofluorescence, calibration, and calculation of the apparent free Ca2+ concentrations were described in detail elsewhere (15Nilius B. Oike M. Zahradnik I. Droogmans G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Neher E. Sellin L.C. Libelius R. Thesleff S. Neuromuscular Junction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 65-76Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature between 20 and 22°C. Mean ± standard error of the mean were calculated from pooled data. Significance was tested by means of the Turkey-Kramer Multiple comparison test (level, p < 0.01). Total cellular protein from 7.8 × 106 CPAE or MDCK cells was extracted by boiling the washed cells in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). About 25 μg of protein of each cell type were separated in SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) and then analyzed by immunoblotting (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Annexin II and p11 were stained using the mouse monoclonal antibodies H28 and H21, respectively (19Osborn M. Johnsson N. Wehland J. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Peroxidase coupled antibodies (Dako) were employed as secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL chemoluminescence system (Amersham-Buchler). The peptide comprising the N-terminal 14 amino acids of bovine annexin II (STVHEILCKLSLEG) (25Oike M. Schwarz G. Sehrer J. Jost M. Gerke V. Weber K. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the L7E mutant version (STVHEIECKLSLEG) were synthesized on an automated sequencer (model 9050; Milligen). To verify the purity a small aliquot of the preparation was deprotected and subjected to automated sequence analysis. When a purity of >95% was obtained, the bulk of the preparation was treated with acetic anhydride to acetylate the N-terminal residue. Completion of this reaction was monitored by the Kaiser test (20Kaiser E. Colescott R.L. Bossinger L.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (3513) Google Scholar). The acetylated peptides were removed from the resin and deprotected by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% ethanedithiol, and then purified by C18 reverse phase HPLC. The correctness of synthesis and acetylation was also verified by mass spectroscopy of the purified product. Western blotting was employed to analyze the expression of annexin II and p11 in CPAE cells. In these experiments epithelial MDCK cells were included for comparison as we had previously characterized the ratio of monomeric versus p11-complexed annexin II in this cell type (21Harder T. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A reveals that annexin II and p11 are expressed at similar levels in both CPAE and MDCK cells. Since MDCK cells contain more than 90% of their annexin II in the (annexin II)2-(p11)2 complex (21Harder T. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), this comparison indicates that the majority of CPAE annexin II is also found in the heterotetrameric complex. Semi-quantitative Western blots were employed to assess the total amount of annexin II in CPAE cells. Here the signal of a given amount of purified annexin II was compared with that of the annexin II band present in total protein extract from a known number of CPAE and MDCK cells (not shown). From this comparison we estimated the annexin II concentration in CPAE cells to be approximately 1 μM. The competing annexin II peptide Ac-(1-14), which has a similar affinity for p11 binding, was loaded into the CPAE cell via the patch pipette at a concentration of 100 μM. This 100 times excess over the endogenous annexin II concentration will be sufficient for an efficient competition of the Ac-(1-14) with the endogenous annexin II for p11 binding and to disrupt the endothelial annexin II-p11 complexes. Endothelial cells are very flat (approximate height 1 μm), and the diffusion time of the peptide may thus be considerably longer than that estimated for round cells (22Pusch M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 414: 204-211Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To obtain a rough idea of this diffusion time, we have added the penta-potassium salt of Fura-II to the pipette solution and monitored the time course of its emission (excitation wavelength of 360 nm) after breaking into the cell (Fig. 1B). The estimated mean time constant for eight cells was 112 ± 12 s. This value is in good agreement with the calculated value of 105 s for a molecular mass of 832 Da, an access resistance of 17 ± 2 MΩ, a capacitance 52 ± 4 pF, and a cell volume of 2600 ± 100 μm3 (n = 17), taking into account a cell thickness of approximately 1 μm and the membrane surface area calculated from the membrane capacitance. The diffusion time constant for the exchange of Ac-(1-14) (molecular mass of 1573 Da) between pipette and cell calculated with the same method is about 150 s. We include only data that have been obtained from cells that had a stable seal for at least 30 min. During this period, which is about 10 times longer than the diffusion time constant, the peptide will diffuse into the cell and compete with the endogenous annexin II for binding to p11. During this period the purpose is to follow the changes in amplitude of ICl, vol during repeated stimulations with hypotonic solution. In order to attribute possible changes of the current to the peptide, we have to ascertain that no significant run down of the current occurs in the absence of the peptide. Fig. 2 shows data from a typical experiment in which a cell was repetitively exposed to hypotonic challenges. The time course of the volume-activated current (ICl, vol) at −80 and +100 mV was reconstructed from the average currents during the initial voltage step to −80 mV and from a voltage window around +100 mV during the voltage ramp, respectively (Fig. 2A). It is obvious that the amplitude of the current does not significantly decay during repeated stimulations. Fig. 2B shows some representative current-voltage relations (I-V curves) that were constructed from the current measured during the voltage ramp at the times indicated in Fig. 2A. Shortly after breaking the plasma membrane (trace a), the whole cell current shows a prominent inwardly rectifying K+ current at negative potentials, which was blocked by substituting external KCl by CsCl (trace b). The residual current in these cells is mainly a Cl− current and has been extensively described elsewhere (1Strange K. Jackson P.S. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 994-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Oike M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2940-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Szücs G. Buyse G. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Membr.

Physiol. 1996; 431: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This limited run down of ICl, vol is consistent with our observations in a previous report where we showed that the volume-activated Cl− current runs down very slowly by about 15% after 60 min (24Szücs G. Heinke S. De Greef Ch. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The currents activated by a hypotonic challenge (HTS) are slightly outwardly rectifying and reverse around −10 mV. The discrepancy between this potential and the Cl− equilibrium potential (−23 mV) can be explained by the permeability of this anion-selective channel for the aspartate present in the patch pipette. 2T. Voets, G. Droogmans, V. Manalopoulos, and B. Nilius, unpublished observations. The pipette solution in these experiments contained 200 μM Fura-II, which allowed us to monitor the diffusion of this dye with a molecular mass of 55% of that of Ac-(1-14) into the cell and to record the changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) during cell swelling. In order to exclude effects that might be related to changes in [Ca2+]i, such as the activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels, we have restricted our analysis to cells in which no significant changes in [Ca2+]i could be observed. Results obtained in cells loaded with the Fura-II salt are comparable with those in cells loaded with Fura-II/AM or in the absence of the Ca2+ probe. Some cells showed a “delayed” and incomplete recovery of the current induced by cell swelling. If, however, a slightly hypertonic solution was used to shrink the cells after an hypotonic challenge, the recovery was fast and complete (not shown). Apparently, some cells lose their ability to shrink to their initial volume during these extremely long lasting protocols. This phenomenon was observed in control cells and in cells loaded with either peptide. It can therefore not be attributed to an effect of the peptides. The same experimental procedure was used to analyze the effect of the annexin peptide Ac-(1-14) on ICl, vol. Loading a CPAE cell via the patch pipette with 100 μM Ac-(1-14) resulted in a gradual decline of the amplitude of ICl, vol during repetitive hypotonic challenges (Fig. 3A). This run down was much more pronounced than in control cells that were not loaded with the peptide. The entry of Fura-II-5 K+ into the cell, as monitored by the changes in intensity of the emitted light of the dye after excitation at 360 nm, is represented in Fig. 3B. Some representative I-V curves are represented in Fig. 3C, from which it is obvious that neither the reversal potential nor the shape of the IV curve was significantly different from those in control cells. We have also made use of a mutated peptide (L7E Ac-(1-14)) to ascertain whether the effect of the peptide is due to a specific interference with the annexin II-p11 complex formation. This peptide contains a single glutamate for leucine replacement at position 7, and has a 1000 times lower affinity for p11. Fig. 4A shows the changes in membrane current measured at 0 mV during repetitive applications of hypotonic solution in a cell loaded with 100 μM of the mutated peptide. The sharp deflections in the current trace are caused by the voltage protocols that were applied every 15 s. It is obvious that the amplitude of the volume-activated current at this potential is not significantly different for the various stimulations with hypotonic solution. This cell was also pre-loaded with Fura-II/AM to monitor concomitantly the changes in [Ca2+]i, as shown in panel B. Except for the two fast Ca2+ transients shortly after breaking into the cell and during the first stimulation with hypotonic solution, [Ca2+]i was fairly constant during the whole course of this recording. Panel C shows the time course of the current at −80 and +100 mV as reconstructed from the voltage protocols. It is obvious from these data that the run-down of ICl, vol in the L7E Ac-(1-14)-loaded cells is much less pronounced than in cells loaded with the Ac-(1-14)-peptide. The reversal potential of the volume-activated current as measured from the I-V relationships (Fig. 4D) was close to the Cl− equilibrium potential and was stable during the long-lasting experiment. Fig. 5 summarizes the results obtained for the different experimental conditions. Except for a few cells, ICl, vol did not significantly run down during loading of the cells with either Fura-II/AM, the K+-penta salt of Fura-II, or the mutated peptide (Fig. 5, A-C). In contrast, all cells loaded with the p11 binding peptide, Ac-(1-14), show a marked run down of ICl, vol (Fig. 5D). To quantify these data, we have pooled the measurements between 3 and 10 min and those between 25 to 35 min after breaking into the cell (Fig. 5E). For Fura-II/AM, Fura-II-5 K+, and L7E Ac-(1-14)-loaded cells, these data were not significantly different, while the 30-min current density of the cells loaded with the mutated peptide was significantly smaller than the 5-min value (Fig. 5, D and E). Volume-activated Cl− channels, ICl, vol, are involved in a variety of biologically important cell functions such as volume regulation, Ca2+ signaling, cell proliferation, and pH regulation (see 1Strange K. Jackson P.S. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 994-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 2Nilius B. Eggermont J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar for a review). The molecular identity and the gating mechanism of these channels are still unresolved. Volume-activated channels are likely to be modulated by cytoskeletal components (25Oike M. Schwarz G. Sehrer J. Jost M. Gerke V. Weber K. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in endothelial cells the general polymerization status of actin and tubulin does not play a prominent role for activation of ICl, vol (25Oike M. Schwarz G. Sehrer J. Jost M. Gerke V. Weber K. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but this analysis did not allow a precise evaluation of a possible contribution of the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton. Annexins are membrane-binding proteins that also bind to actin. Annexin IV has been shown to modulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels (26Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have analyzed the possible involvement of a prominent annexin found in the cell cortex, annexin II, in the regulation of plasma membrane based mechano-sensitive anion channels. Annexin II is found in two physical states within cells, as a monomeric cytosolic protein and in a heterotetrameric complex with the S100 protein p11. While it is generally assumed that proteins of the S100 family act intracellularly by binding to and thereby regulating the activity of specific target proteins, annexin II is among the few unambiguously identified targets of an S100 protein (for review see 27Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). P11 binding to annexin II alters its biochemical properties (28Powell M.A. Glenney J.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and also affects its intracellular distribution since only the (annexin II)2-(p11)2 complex but not the monomeric annexin II is tightly incorporated in the cortical cytoskeleton (30Zokas L. Glenney J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that most of the annexin II in CPAE cells is found in the complex with p11, and we have used a synthetic peptide consisting of the 14 N-terminal amino acids of annexin II with an acetylated N-terminal serine (Ac-(1-14)) to specifically target the annexin II-p11 complex. This peptide efficiently competes with the endogenous annexin II for p11 binding and thus interferes with annexin II-p11 complex formation (13Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 8: 2435-2442Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This peptide was applied at a concentration that is about 100-fold higher than that of the endogenous annexin II. Taking into account that its affinity for p11 is similar to that of annexin II (13Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 8: 2435-2442Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the peptide excess should completely disrupt the endogenous annexin II-p11 complex. We have shown that this peptide, but not a mutant version with a strongly reduced affinity to p11, inhibits ICl, vol. It is therefore likely that annexin II-p11 complex formation is required for activation of ICl, vol. Co-activation of Ca2+-dependent channels can be excluded in our experiments because we selected only those experiments in which no substantial Ca2+ fluctuations could be observed. Annexin II is present in caveolae and caveolae-like structures that might be important membrane regions involved in the unfolding of the cell surface during swelling (32Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that in a caveolin-deficient rat thyroid cell line (FRT cells) hypotonic challenges elicit only small currents, which in addition occur with a long delay (time for half-maximal activation of 337 ± 37 s, n = 6, compared with 68 ± 12 s, n = 25 for CPEA cells in this study, or 106 ± 11, n = 4 for caveolin-positive MDCK cells as used in 33Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This might be a further indication of the functional significance of annexin II for the activation of volume-sensitive currents. ICl, vol is not regulated by [Ca2+]i in vascular endothelium but needs a permissive submicromolar Ca2+ level for activation by an increase in cell volume (34Szücs G. Heinke S. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such Ca2+ concentrations are also necessary for the Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin II to the anionic inner surface of the membrane (6Kaetzel A.M. Dedman J.R. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 171-176Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the failure in the activation of ICl, vol after intracellular Ca2+ depletion beyond this threshold might be related to the annexin-membrane dissociation under such conditions. In summary, our data provide the first evidence for the regulation of volume-sensitive Cl− channels by a member of the family of Ca2+-dependent membrane binding annexins."
https://openalex.org/W2087732324,"We have investigated the role of DnaJ in protein degradation by examining the degradation of intrinsically unstable proteins by Lon protease in vivo. In Escherichia coli, Lon protease is responsible for the rate-limiting step in degradation of highly unstable proteins such as SulA, RcsA, and lambdaN protein, as well as for about 50% of the rapid degradation of abnormal proteins such as canavanine-containing proteins. We found that Lon-dependent degradation of both SulA and lambdaN protein was unaffected in cells lacking functional DnaJ, whereas Lon-dependent turnover of canavanine-containing proteins was slower in dnaJ mutant cells. DnaJ also affected the slow SulA degradation seen in the absence of Lon. The rate of degradation of RcsA was reduced in dnaJ mutants, but both Lon-dependent and Lon-independent degradation was affected; abnormal, canavanine-containing proteins were similarly affected. Both the RcsA that accumulated in dnaJ mutant cells and the SulA that accumulated in lon dnaJ mutant cells was aggregated. The abnormal proteins that partitioned to the insoluble pellet became solubilized over time in dnaJ+ cells but not in dnaJ- cells. Therefore, the co-chaperone DnaJ is not essential for Lon-dependent degradation and may act in protein turnover only as an accessory factor helping to maintain substrates in a soluble form. Such an accessory factor is apparently necessary for abnormal proteins and for RcsA. The relative rates of degradation and aggregation of specific protein targets may determine the importance of the chaperone systems in turnover of a given protein."

INTRODUCTIONRecent evidence suggests a regulatory role for signal transduction molecules in vesicle-mediated transport along both the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Several heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in different steps of membrane trafficking (1Bomsel M. Mostov K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Second messengers and protein kinases have also been shown to influence various transport processes. For instance, cAMP and protein kinase A activity have been reported to stimulate apical directed transcytosis and secretion in epithelial cells (3Eker P. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. Sandving K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18607-18615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Takuma T. Ichida T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and protein kinase C have also been implicated in transport regulation. Association of ADP-ribosylation factor and coatomer proteins to Golgi membranes was increased by treatment with agents that activate protein kinase C (8De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Science. 1993; 364: 818-820Google Scholar). Constitutive transport from the TGN to the cell surface, regulated secretion, apical exocytosis, and transcytosis have all been shown to be modulated by protein kinase C activity (7Pimplikar S.W.

Together, these studies extend previous observations on the requirement for protein phosphorylation in certain transport steps such as protein transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex (13Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), formation of secretory vesicles from the TGN (14Ohashi M. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Particular isoforms of both protein kinases A and C have been localized in the ER and the Golgi complex (16Rios R.M. Celati C. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Keryer G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1723-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Nigg E.A. Schäfer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M.

A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, in what way these kinases modulate either organelle structure and/or transport processes. Other evidences indicate an essential role for protein kinases in particular transport steps. Transport of hydrolases from the TGN to either the yeast vacuole or mammalian lysosomes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (13Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J.

Therefore, the available evidences indicate that different protein kinases regulate membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells although the importance and extent of such control is unclear at present. In this study we have investigated the role of cAMP and protein kinase A activity on transport along the entire exocytic pathway. We studied the constitutive transfer of an integral membrane glycoprotein, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein, from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface. The results indicate a stimulatory role for protein kinase A on different steps along this route and emphasize the influence of this activity on Golgi structural organization.DISCUSSIONThe transport machinery responsible for vesicle budding, targeting, and fusion is under regulation. Protein kinases and second messengers seem to be involved in this control. We have studied the role played by cAMP and protein kinase A on protein transport along the exocytic pathway. The results indicate that protein kinase A stimulates several transport steps in this route although the extent of regulation varies. Thus, transport from the TGN to the cell surface was shown to be dependent on activated protein kinase A (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), whereas transport from the ER to the cis-/middle Golgi (Fig. 5) or from the intermediate compartment to the TGN (Fig. 6) was sensitive to but did not require protein kinase A activation. This could reflect the involvement of particular transport molecules in each case. In a similar way, the effects of protein kinase A activation on transport activities can differ from one cell system to another. In Madin-Darbin canine kidney-polarized cells, for example, transport from the ER to the Golgi and from the TGN to the basolateral surface was insensitive to protein kinase A activation, whereas transport to the apical surface was stimulated (7Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the protein kinase A substrates relevant to transport processes would be selective proteins required for a particular transfer event rather than molecules involved in multiple transport reactions.Transport from the TGN to the cell surface was blocked by H-89 (Fig. 4B) and stimulated by IBMX + FK treatment (Fig. 9B). The first agent has been shown to specifically inhibit protein kinase A (30Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it is commonly accepted that incubation with either IBMX or FK leads to protein kinase A activation by increasing the intracellular level of cAMP. In principle, the increased number of VSV-G molecules detected at the surface of cells chased in the presence of IBMX + FK could result from an inhibitory effect of these agents on protein uptake by endocytosis. However, we used 125I-labeled epidermal growth as a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis, and we determined that the internalization rates did not differ significantly between control and treated cells. 2M. Alonso, M. Muñiz, J. Hidalgo, and A. Velasco, unpublished observations. It is then plausible to assume that an increased level of cAMP caused by IBMX + FK incubation stimulate export of VSV-G from the TGN to the cell surface. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of H-89 cannot be explained by a decrease in the cellular levels of ATP necessary for transport (Fig. 1) (36Balch W.E. Elliott M.M. Keller D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14681-14689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the data support a positive regulatory role for protein kinase A in vesicle transport from the TGN to the cell surface in nonpolarized cells. This transport step has been commonly considered to occur constitutively. However, recent reports indicate that it is influenced by different signal transduction molecules (6Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Buccione R. Bannykh S. Santone I. Baldassarre M. Facchiano F. Bozzi Y. Di Tullio G. Mironov A. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3523-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this context, changes in the intracellular concentration of cAMP and other second messengers could control vesicle formation and/or protein sorting at the TGN by exerting a regulatory role on the protein machinery responsible for these activities.In general results obtained with IBMX and FK were consistent with a stimulatory role of activated protein kinase A on transport. However, these agents also gave rise to important modifications of Golgi structure which could mask their influence on transport activities. Thus, although by immunofluorescence ER to Golgi transport was accelerated in IBMX + FK-treated cells (Fig. 7), acquisition of endo H resistance was hindered in the altered Golgi complex (Fig. 9A). Also, transport out of the Golgi complex was decreased in cells exposed to IBMX and FK for a prolonged time causing retention of VSV-G protein in this organelle (Fig. 7H). For these reasons we believe that both the ability to process glycoproteins and to produce functional transport vesicles were affected in the Golgi complex modified by IBMX and FK treatment. The modifications consisted in intercisternae fusion within the Golgi stacks which gave rise to irregular Golgi compartments and miscompartmentalization of resident Golgi proteins (Fig. 8, A and C). These structural changes were derived from an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP since they were also observed in cells incubated with cholerae toxin (Fig. 8, D-H) or treated with cAMP analogs. Interestingly, an increase in cAMP has been reported to induce alkalinization of the trans-Golgi lumen (37Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4967-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and to affect protein glycosylation (6Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In any case, these observations suggest a regulatory role for protein kinase A on the maintenance of the structural organization of the Golgi complex.Protein kinase A is an ubiquitous regulatory enzyme activated by cAMP binding which in turn phosphorylates specific protein substrates. Cell signaling processes that are mediated by protein kinase A begin with the activation of a plasma membrane receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. These modulate cAMP production by acting on cAMP-phosphodiesterase and adenylate cyclase. It is becoming increasingly evident that a similar signaling pathway controls intracellular membrane trafficking. Several kinds of heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gαs, Gαi, and XLαs proteins, have been detected in intracellular membranes and implicated in vesicular transport along both the exocytic and endocytic routes (1Bomsel M.

It is postulated that these proteins transmit signals to effectors that could regulate transport in a still undetermined way. While ER- and Golgi-associated protein kinases (17Nigg E.A. Schäfer G.

A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) are potential downstream effectors, other evidences suggest that second messengers and protein kinases are not necessarily involved (44Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be important to determine in which way protein kinase A controls transport reactions. INTRODUCTIONRecent evidence suggests a regulatory role for signal transduction molecules in vesicle-mediated transport along both the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Several heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in different steps of membrane trafficking (1Bomsel M. Mostov K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Second messengers and protein kinases have also been shown to influence various transport processes. For instance, cAMP and protein kinase A activity have been reported to stimulate apical directed transcytosis and secretion in epithelial cells (3Eker P. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. Sandving K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18607-18615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Takuma T. Ichida T.

Transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkERendoplasmic reticulumVSVvesicular stomatitis virusVSV-GVSV G glycoproteinIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineFKforskolindibutyryl-cAMPN6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate8-Br-cAMP8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphateH-89N-[2-(-p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamideSp-cBIMPs5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate Sp isomerendo Hendoglycosidase HNRKnormal rat kidneyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. to the apical surface but not to the basolateral surface was stimulated by agents that activate protein kinase A (6Jilling T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and protein kinase C have also been implicated in transport regulation. Association of ADP-ribosylation factor and coatomer proteins to Golgi membranes was increased by treatment with agents that activate protein kinase C (8De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Science. 1993; 364: 818-820Google Scholar). Constitutive transport from the TGN to the cell surface, regulated secretion, apical exocytosis, and transcytosis have all been shown to be modulated by protein kinase C activity (7Pimplikar S.W.

Together, these studies extend previous observations on the requirement for protein phosphorylation in certain transport steps such as protein transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex (13Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), formation of secretory vesicles from the TGN (14Ohashi M. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Particular isoforms of both protein kinases A and C have been localized in the ER and the Golgi complex (16Rios R.M. Celati C. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Keryer G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1723-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Nigg E.A. Schäfer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M.

A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, in what way these kinases modulate either organelle structure and/or transport processes. Other evidences indicate an essential role for protein kinases in particular transport steps. Transport of hydrolases from the TGN to either the yeast vacuole or mammalian lysosomes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (13Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J.

Therefore, the available evidences indicate that different protein kinases regulate membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells although the importance and extent of such control is unclear at present. In this study we have investigated the role of cAMP and protein kinase A activity on transport along the entire exocytic pathway. We studied the constitutive transfer of an integral membrane glycoprotein, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein, from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface. The results indicate a stimulatory role for protein kinase A on different steps along this route and emphasize the influence of this activity on Golgi structural organization."

During normal processing the βAPP is cleaved by β secretase, producing a large NH2-terminal secreted derivative (sAPPβ) and a COOH-terminal fragment beginning at Aβ1, which is subsequently cleaved by γ secretase releasing secreted Aβ. Most secreted Aβ is Aβ1-40, but ∼10% of secreted Aβ is Aβ1-42. Alternative βAPP cleavage by α secretase produces a slightly longer NH2-terminal secreted derivative (sAPPα) and a COOH-terminal fragment beginning at Aβ17, which is subsequently cleaved by γ secretase releasing a ∼3-kDa secreted form of Aβ (P3). Several of the βAPP isoforms that are produced by alternative splicing contain a 56-amino acid Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain known to inhibit proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. To determine whether the KPI domain influences the proteolytic cleavages that generate Aβ, we compared Aβ production in transfected cells expressing human KPI-containing βAPP751 or KPI-free βAPP695. We focused on Aβs ending at Aβ42 because these forms appear to be most relevant to AD. Using specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we analyzed full-length Aβ1-42 and total Aβ ending at Aβ42 (Aβ1-42 + P3(42)). In addition, we analyzed the large secreted derivatives produced by α secretase (sAPPα) and β secretase (sAPPβ). In mouse teratocarcinoma (P19) cells expressing βAPP695 or βAPP751, expression of the KPI-containing βAPP751 resulted in the secretion of a lower percentage of P3(42) and sAPPα and a correspondingly higher percentage of Aβ1-42 and sAPPβ. Similar results were obtained in human embryonic kidney (293) cells. These results indicate that expression of the KPI domain reduces α secretase cleavage so that less P3 and relatively more full-length Aβ are produced. Thus, in human brain and in animal models of AD, the amount of KPI-containing βAPP produced may be an important factor influencing Aβ deposition.

Instability of simple repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites) has been observed in sporadic tumors of the colon, stomach, pancreas, bladder, hematopoietic system, lung, ovary, breast, and skin and in most tumors from hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (for reviews, see 1Speicher M.R.

One possible mechanism for the instability of simple repetitive DNA tracts is due to DNA polymerase slippage (3Kunkel T.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this model, the nascent and template DNA strands dissociate from each other during replication and reanneal in a misaligned configuration, forming a DNA intermediate containing a loop with unpaired repeating units or a hairpin if the looped-out nucleotides are complementary. These secondary DNA structures are referred to as insertion/deletion mismatches (IDM), 1The abbreviations used are: IDMinsertion/deletion mismatchesdI Endodeoxyinosine 3′-endonucleasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. depending on whether the loop occurs on the nascent or template DNA strand, respectively. If left unrepaired, these IDM structures will be fixed into the genome in subsequent rounds of replication, resulting in the expansion or contraction of repeating DNA units. insertion/deletion mismatches deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Defects in DNA mismatch repair in eukaryotes were shown to result in an increase in the instability of repetitive DNA sequences (4Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These findings led to the identification of human MutS and MutL homologues and the genetic basis for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (1Speicher M.R. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar, 2Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); mutations in any of the four known human mismatch repair genes, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2, are associated with most of these cancers. Similar to the bacterial MutS protein, hMSH2 protein recognizes and binds to DNA containing mismatches (5Fishel R. Ewel A. Lescoe M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5539-5542PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, hMSH2 protein can form stable complexes with IDM DNA structures containing up to 14 unpaired nucleotides, suggesting its involvement in the repair of these secondary DNA structures (6Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, crude extracts from certain cancer cell lines defective in mismatch repair still retain the ability to repair heteroduplexes containing 5, 8, or 16 unpaired bases (7Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These data suggest that novel mechanisms other than the MutS/MutL-dependent repair system are present for the repair of heteroduplexes containing IDM structures. This is further indicated by the fact that a large proportion of the sporadic tumor cell lines exhibiting microsatellite instability do not appear to have mutations in the mismatch repair genes (8Liu B. Nicolaides N.C. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Parsons R.E. Jen J. Papadopolous N. Peltomaki P. de la Chapelle A. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel activity that binds to DNA insertion/deletion mismatches was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting the existence of a novel IDM repair pathway other than the MutS/MutL-dependent pathway (9Miret J.J. Parker B.O. Lahue R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic studies suggest that S. cerevisiae RTH1 5′- to 3′-exonuclease (10Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) are also involved in mismatch repair and contribute to the maintenance of microsatellite stability. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease (dI Endo) is a deoxyinosine-specific endonuclease from Escherichia coli. In addition to deoxyinosine, the enzyme also recognizes DNA containing an AP site, urea residue, and mismatched base pairs and cleaves the DNA containing the lesion in a strand-specific manner (12Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol.

The gene coding for the enzyme was found to be encoded by the same gene for endonuclease V (nfi), 2Guo, G., Ding, Y., and Weiss, B. (1997) J. Bacteriol., in press. which was found to be identical to orf 225 coding for a putative protein of unknown function. 3M. Yao and Y. W. Kow, manuscript in preparation. nfi (orf 225) is located at 90 min of E. coli genome (GenBank™ accession number U00006, 15Blattner F.R. Burland V.D. Plunkett III, G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). nfi was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector pET 22b(+), resulting in plasmid pETI-2.3 Therefore, a large quantity of the homogeneous enzyme can be purified from bacteria BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pETI-2 after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Its ability to cleave DNA containing base mismatches prompted us to find out whether the enzyme also cleaves DNA containing insertion/deletion mismatches as well as other DNA secondary structures. Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (Operon, Alameda, CA) were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and were eluted from the gels by an IBI electroeluter. Oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham International) using T4 polynucleotide kinase or 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]cordycepin 5′-triphosphate (DuPont NEN) using deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase following instructions from the enzyme supplier (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The labeled oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed to the appropriate complementary strands at 1:1 ratio in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol by heating the mixture to 90°C and cooling down gradually to room temperature. The resulting heteroduplexes were used in endonuclease assays. To purify deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease, 4 liters of BL21(DE3) haboring pETI-22 were grown in Luria Broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mM, followed by further incubation at 37°C for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and mixed with 30 ml of buffer B (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 M NaCl). An equal volume of 0.10-0.11-mm glass beads was added to the cell suspension and homogenized in a Braun MSK homogenizer for 3 min with CO2 cooling. The glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 min (Sorvall GS3 rotor) at 4°C. The glass beads and debris were re-extracted with 30 ml of the same buffer, and the supernatant was collected and pooled. To the pooled supernatant, an equal volume of precipitation buffer (buffer B with 30% PEG-8000) was added and stirred gently with a magnetic stirrer at 4°C overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 20 min (Sorvall GS3 rotor) at 4°C. The supernatant (120 ml) was designated as Fraction I. Fraction I was diluted 10-fold with buffer A (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto 50 ml of SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by gravity at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A and was eluted with a linear gradient (480 ml) from 0.1 M to 0.6 M NaCl in buffer A. Eight ml of each fraction was collected, and the peak fractions containing the 25-kDa protein were pooled as Fraction II. Fraction II was diluted with buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) until the concentration of NaCl was about 0.02 M as measured by conductivity and loaded onto a 50-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia) by gravity at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was then washed with 200 ml of buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient (480 ml) from buffer C to buffer C containing 0.3 M NaCl. The enzyme preparation after Q-Sepharose Fast Flow was apparently homogeneous as judged from silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C for further assay. Standard reaction contained 20 fmol of DNA substrates with either strand labeled. The reactions were incubated alone or with 1.2 ng of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.34 mM MnCl2 at 37°C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of sequencing loading buffer (90% formamide, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by denaturing PAGE as described previously (12Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of dI Endo to cleave IDM-containing oligonucleotides was monitored by an endonuclease assay. The cleavage of oligonucleotide heteroduplex substrates by dI Endo produces shorter oligonucleotides that migrate faster than the parental DNA substrates in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 summarized the result with a heteroduplex containing a hairpin (Duplex HP). As a reference, a heteroduplex containing an A/A mismatch (Duplex A/A) with the same sequence context surrounding the lesion was also included in this study. It was previously shown (14Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the strand specificity of dI Endo on mismatch-containing DNA is governed by the 5′ terminus; the enzyme cleaves the DNA strand with the mismatch closer to the 5′ end. Both DNA strands are cleaved by the enzyme if the mismatch is located in the middle of the oligonucleotide duplex. Since the mismatch in Duplex A/A is at the 19th nucleotide from the 5′ terminus of the top strand and the 20th nucleotide from the 5′ terminus of the bottom strand, both top and bottom strands were found to be cleaved by dI Endo (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 7 and 8, respectively). The enzyme cleaved both the top and bottom strands at two locations, one immediately 3′ and the other one nucleotide 3′ to the mismatch. When the top strand of Duplex A/A was 5′-end-labeled, the major cleavage site (68% of total top strand cleavage) was observed at the phosphodiester bond immediately 3′ to the mismatch, thus generating a 19-mer. A second cleavage site was observed at the phosphodiester bond one nucleotide 3′ to the mismatch, generating a 20-mer (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, when the bottom strand of Duplex A/A was labeled, the major cleavage site (65% of total bottom cleavage) was observed at the phosphodiester bond one nucleotide 3′ to the mismatch, generating a 21-mer (Fig. 1B, lane 8). These results confirm our previous observations (14Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that while deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease predominantly cleaves deoxyinosine-containing DNA one nucleotide 3′ to the mismatch, additional cleavage sites by the enzyme can be observed on mismatch-containing DNA duplex depending on sequence context surrounding the mismatches. When DNA heteroduplex containing a hairpin (Duplex HP) was used as a substrate for dI Endo, similar cleavage patterns were observed (Fig. 1B). Both DNA strands were cleaved by dI Endo, with a relative cleavage rate of 1:3 for top strand:bottom strand (20% and 60% of total cleavage for top and bottom strand, respectively). When the top strand of Duplex HP was 5′-end-labeled, the major cleavage product migrated as a 36-mer (75% of total top strand cleavage, Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the major cleavage site was immediately 3′ to the hairpin. In addition, the enzyme also cleaved the phosphodiester bond one nucleotide 3′ to the hairpin, generating a minor cleavage product migrating as a 37-mer (lanes 3 and 4). When the bottom strand was 5′-end-labeled, the major cleavage product observed was a 21-mer (63% of total bottom strand cleavage, lanes 9 and 10), indicating that the cleavage site was one nucleotide 3′ to the hairpin. There were two additional minor cleavages induced by the enzyme on the bottom strand, one immediately 3′ (20% of total bottom strand cleavage) and the other two nucleotides 3′ to the hairpin (17% of total bottom strand cleavage), generating two minor products migrating as 20- and 22-mers, respectively (lanes 9 and 10). The nuclease activity on the heteroduplex containing a hairpin was due to an endonucleolytic activity that is associated with dI Endo and not a contaminating 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity that could not bypass the hairpin. This was demonstrated by using 3′-end-labeled Duplex HP as a DNA substrate. Using Duplex HP containing 3′-end-labeled top strand, two cleavage products were observed, migrating as 18- and 19-mers (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). When the bottom strand of Duplex HP was 3′-end-labeled, three cleavage products were observed, migrating as 18-, 19-, and 20-mers (Fig. 1B, lanes 11 and 12). The cleavage patterns generated using 3′-end-labeled substrates are consistent with those observed for 5′-end-labeled heteroduplexes. To show that dI Endo also cleaved DNA containing unpaired nucleotide loops, heteroduplexes containing loops of 2 to 14 nucleotides were prepared (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that dI Endo cleaved both DNA strands of loop-containing heteroduplexes. Two cleavage sites on the bottom strand were observed for all the heteroduplex DNA substrates containing loops ranging from 2 to 14 unpaired nucleotides. When the bottom strands of Duplex L2, L4, L8, and L14 were 5′-end-labeled, the major cleavage product derived from each of these DNA substrates migrated as a 21-mer (by comparing the position of the cleavage products derived from Duplex A/A, Fig. 2B, lanes 11 and 12). Therefore, dI Endo predominantly cleaved the bottom strand of loop-containing heteroduplexes at the phosphodiester bond one nucleotide 3′ to the loop. An additional product which migrated one nucleotide faster was also observed, indicating that the additional cleavage site was immediately 3′ to the loop. Similarly, two cleavage sites were observed on the DNA strand containing the loop (the top strand, Fig. 2B, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). In order to determine the cleavage sites on the top strand, Duplexes L2, L4, L8, and L14 with 3′-end-labeled top strand were used as DNA substrates. The major cleavage product derived from each of these DNA substrates (Fig. 2C, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10) migrated as an 18-mer, which was one nucleotide smaller than the major product derived from Duplex HP (Fig. 1B, lane 12), indicating that the enzyme cleaved one nucleotide 3′ to the unpaired loop. In addition, a minor cleavage product which migrated as a 22-mer was observed, especially with heteroduplexes containing 8 and 14 nucleotide loops (Fig. 4B, lanes 7-10), suggesting that the enzyme could also cleave the DNA two nucleotides inside the loop from the 3′ duplex juncture.Fig. 4Cleavage of dI Endo on a flap and pseudo Y DNA structure. A, sequences of flap and pseudo-Y DNA. The major cleavage sites are indicated by arrowheads. B, the DNA strand with the single-stranded tail was either 5′- or 3′-end-labeled. Twenty fmol of the flap or pseudo-Y DNA structure were incubated alone (−) or with 0.6 ng of dI Endo (+) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.34 mM MnCl2 at 37°C for 15 min, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Lanes 1 and 2, 5′-end-labeled flap DNA; lanes 3 and 4, 5′-end-labeled pseudo-Y DNA; lanes 5 and 6, 3′-end-labeled flap DNA; lanes 7 and 8, 3′-end-labeled pseudo-Y DNA. For comparison, 5′-end-labeled (lane 9) and 3′-end-labeled (lane 10) flap DNA treated with E. coli DNA polymerase I were also included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the endonucleolytic activity associated with dI Endo on duplexes containing IDM structures was not due to possible contamination in the enzyme preparation, a substrate competition assay was performed. Duplex PAL (Fig. 3A) containing a hairpin was used as a substrate for dI Endo. It is interesting to note that dI Endo is more active on the top strand of Duplex PAL (Fig. 3B) as compared to Duplex HP (Fig. 1). For Duplex PAL, the relative cleavage of top and bottom strands induced by dI Endo was 3:1, respectively (under the same reaction conditions, the top strand was cleaved 65% while the bottom strand was only cleaved 20%). Using Duplex PAL with 5′-end-labeled top strand as DNA substrate, the endonucleolytic activity of dI Endo was assayed in the presence of an unlabeled I/T pair containing DNA duplex (Duplex I/T which has the same DNA sequences as Duplex A/A except that the mismatch A/A pair was replaced with an I/T pair), which is a specific substrate for dI Endo (Fig. 3C). The results were compared with those obtained with a nonspecific competitor, Duplex A/T, which has the same DNA sequences as Duplex I/T except the I/T pair was replaced with an A/T pair. Fig. 3C showed that the presence of a 4-fold excess of the I/T-containing duplex to the enzyme resulted in 50% reduction of the hairpin cleavage activity. However, in the presence of a 20-fold excess of the normal DNA duplex, the hairpin cleavage activity was inhibited only by 20%. The results further substantiated that the endonucleolytic activity on these DNA structures was due to deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease. In the above experiments, a weak 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity was also noticed, releasing 3 to 4 nucleotides from the 5′ termini of these oligonucleotides. The exonuclease activity did not seem to be a contaminant since the activity co-purified with the deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease activity over a series of chromatographic columns including Mono S, Mono Q, phenyl-Superose, and Affi-Gel Blue. 4M. Yao and Y. W. Kow, unpublished observations. The presence of a weak exonuclease activity and its ability to cleave DNA containing different secondary structures led us to think that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease might be functionally similar to yeast RTH1 class nucleases. RTH1 class nucleases are a group of 5′- to 3′-exonucleases which is named RTH1 nuclease in S. cerevisiae (16Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

These nucleases shared sequence homology to the 5′-exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase I of E. coli (21Robins P. Pappin D.J.C. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

In addition, yeast RTH1 mutants exhibit high sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate (16Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and increased instability of simple repetitive DNA sequences (10Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting that RTH1 nuclease participates in the repair of base damages and mismatch repair. In addition to the 5′-3′-exonuclease activity, this class of nucleases recognize flap and pseudo-Y DNA, being able to cleave the 5′-unpaired tail of these DNA substrates. It is thus interesting to examine whether deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease can also cleave both the flap and pseudo-Y DNA. Fig. 4 shows that dI Endo efficiently cleaved the 5′-single-stranded tail of 5′-flap and pseudo-Y DNA. The cleavage site was found to be similar to that induced by E. coli DNA polymerase I, being one base inside the double strand juncture (25Lyamichev V.D. Brow M.A. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Similar to RTH1 class nucleases, dI Endo cannot cleave the 3′-single-stranded tail of pseudo-Y and 3′-flap DNA.4 Our data presented here demonstrated that in addition to deoxyinosine and mismatched base pairs, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease from E. coli recognized and cleaved DNA containing insertion/deletion mismatches, suggesting that the enzyme might have a role in the repair of these abnormal DNA structures. It was previously shown that methyl-directed mismatch repair system in E. coli recognizes poorly DNA containing loops larger than five nucleotides (26Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, whether E. coli possesses the ability to repair DNA containing larger loops is controversial (27Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Levinson G. Gutman G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5323-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29Fishel R. Kolodner R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3046-3052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancies observed in earlier studies might be due to the assay systems employed. Most of the data on the biological processing of these abnormal DNA structures in E. coli were obtained from bacterial transformation assays using plasmids containing loops of various sizes. These systems are uncoupled from DNA replication. Since these abnormal DNA structures are generated during DNA replication by strand slippage, a recently proposed arm-directed repair model by Leach (30Leach D.R.F. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which suggests that the repair of these secondary structures is directed by the replication fork, thus appeared to be quite attractive. The cleavage efficiencies of dI Endo on these DNA structures is comparable with those observed previously for mismatches as well as deoxyinosine.4 These novel biochemical activities suggest that the enzyme might be involved in the repair of secondary DNA structures, especially those generated on the lagging strand during DNA replication. 1) The endonucleolytic activity of dI Endo on flap and pseudo-Y DNA structures and 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity are functionally homologous to those of the RTH1 class nucleases, which are required for lagging strand DNA synthesis. 2) The mismatch and hairpin cleavage activities of the enzyme appear to track from 5′ termini of heteroduplexes (14Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The endonucleolytic activity of the enzyme on DNA mismatches increases severalfold when a 5′ nick is present, suggesting that the enzyme binds to the nick and tracks the DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction.2 The ability of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to recognize both DNA strands of IDM containing duplexes suggests that the strand specificity of the enzyme is directed by mechanisms other than the DNA structure, possibly a 5′ terminus or 5′ nick, similar to the case with simple base mismatches (14Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 This is reasonable since strand slippage can occur on both template and nascent strand. If slippage occurs on the template strand, repair (cleavage) on the strand without the loop (nascent strand) will prevent deletion. On the other hand, if slippage occurs on the newly synthesized strand, repair (cleavage) of the loop in nascent strand will prevent expansion. Therefore, in order to prevent deletion or expansion due to polymerase slippage, a strand-directed mechanism must be able to recognize the nascent strand and correction (cleavage) be made only on the nascent strand. It has been shown previously that a nick can direct a MutS independent mismatch repair in E. coli (31Lahue R.S. Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is probably the mechanism used in mammalian cells for strand-specific mismatch repair (32Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 33Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease tracks DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction from a 5′ terminus or a 5′ nick and induces cleavage 3′ to the mismatch or IDM structures, the enzyme thus fulfills the requirements for a factor that can initiate the repair of mismatches or IDM structures, especially those generated on the lagging strand during DNA synthesis, since there is always a 5′ nick or a 5′ terminus on the lagging strand. It is interesting to note that the enzyme consists of only 223 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 24.9 kDa, yet it possesses complicated enzyme activities for DNA metabolism. If present, the eukaryotic/human counterpart of dI Endo may play an important role in maintaining genome stability which has been shown to be associated with many different human diseases and cancers.

We have shown previously that coatomer can be reversibly disassembled in vitro and that during disassembly partial complexes form, comprising α-, β′-, and ϵ-COP, γ- and ζ-COP, and β- and δ-COP (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated coatomer assembly and find that the same subunit-subunit interactions occur during assembly in vivo. Assembly takes about 1-2 h and is inhibited by BFA. We have also found that coatomer, once it has formed, is very stable and that no significant amounts of partial coatomer complexes exist within interphase cells at steady state. Antibodies against β-COP and β′-COP were prepared and affinity purified as described (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol.

Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) were maintained as described earlier (26Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Dishes (6 cm) of nearly confluent cells were starved of methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) by incubation for 30 min in Met/Cys-free MEM. Cells were then pulsed for 5 min with 200 μCi/6-cm dish of [35S]Met/Cys (Pro-mix, Amersham Corp.) in 400 μl of Met/Cys-free medium. The chase was initiated by washing the cells with normal MEM and incubation in this medium for the appropriate time. For analysis of coatomer half-life, cells were diluted 1/20 in 6-cm dishes 1 day before labeling. For labeling, cells were incubated in labeling medium (9 parts Met/Cys-free MEM, 1 part normal MEM) containing 15 μCi/ml [35S]met for 10 h. The cells were then washed 2 × in MEM containing 5 mM met and chased in this medium for the appropriate time. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold HB (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA) and lysed in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IP: HB containing 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM 1:10 phenanthroline, 2 μM pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The lysates were cleared for 10 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 50% slurry in IP) was added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and specific antibodies were added to the supernatant. Typical antibody amounts used were as follows: 2 μg of affinity-purified anti-EAGE or anti-β′-COP, or 0.5 μl of anti-ζ-COP antiserum. After incubation for 1 h at 4°C, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added and the mixture incubated for further 2 h at 4°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 5 × with 1 ml of IP and then 1 × with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. To immunoprecipitate monomeric ζ-COP we first immunodepleted coatomer from the samples (since the anti-ζ-COP antibodies recognize both monomeric and coatomer-associated ζ-COP). Samples were first incubated with anti-EAGE antibodies and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose as described and the beads removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated again with 2 μg of CM1A10 and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 12 h at 4°C to remove remaining coatomer (this removed >90% of coatomer compared with the starting material). The supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-ζ-COP antibodies as described above. Cells from four 10-cm dishes were washed 2 × with HB, scraped into 1 ml of HB containing protease inhibitors, and passed 20 times through a 25-gauge needle. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant collected and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting high speed supernatant (cytosol) was used for experiments. Samples (300 μl) were loaded on 5-30% sucrose gradients (11.3 ml) made in either HB, for cytosol, or IP, for cell extracts, and centrifuged in a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 18 h at 4°C. Fractions (600 μl) were collected from the top, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for analysis by immunoblotting or diluted with an equal volume of IP for immunoprecipitation. Reduced proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa COPs were resolved using a modified gel system containing 6 M urea and an acrylamide:bis ratio of 100:1 (11Stenbeck G. Harter C. Brecht A. Herrmann D. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Wieland F.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2841-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Quantitation of radiolabeled proteins was performed with a ScanJet Plus (Hewlett-Packard) using the Deskscan and Almage programs on the Macintosh. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and incubated with primary antibodies, each at 1:2,000, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel) at 1:2,500. Peroxidase labeling was detected by ECL (Amersham). To study assembly of coatomer in vivo we employed a pulse-chase approach. Cells were radiolabeled for 5 min with [35S]Met/Cys, chased for various lengths of time with unlabeled amino acids, and cell lysates immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against different coatomer subunits. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In initial experiments we studied the incorporation of β-COP into coatomer. 5 min after labeling, β-COP appears to be monomeric (Fig. 1A). During the chase other radiolabeled COPs associate until at 1-2 h coatomer assembly is complete. There is an order of association, with δ-COP associating at an earlier time (5-20 min) than α-, β′-, and γ-COP (20-60 min), and ϵ-COP associating last (40-120 min; Fig. 1, A and B). To ensure that we observe indeed assembly (and not exchange of labeled for unlabeled COPs, for example), we analyzed the density of β-COP on sucrose gradients during the chase period (Fig. 2). At early times (0-20 min) β-COP sediments near the top of the gradient at the position expected for monomeric protein. During the chase it shifts to fraction 11 (∼13 S) concomitant with the appearance of other labeled COPs. What we observe during the chase therefore reflects assembly of coatomer subunits. After 1 h virtually no monomeric β-COP remains, showing that it is all incorporated into coatomer or that what remains is degraded. Importantly the subunit stoichiometry at 120 min is the same as that obtained from an overnight metabolic labeling (data not shown). This indicates that each pool of unassembled subunit is the same and that there is not unequal incorporation of unlabeled subunits into the complex. The one exception is ζ-COP where the amount of labeled protein is less than that observed with overnight labeling. This can, however, be explained by there being a significant pool of monomeric unlabeled protein in the cell at steady state (15Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6). The radiolabeled coatomer formed during these pulse-chase experiments is functional and can be recruited onto membranes in a GTP-dependent manner (data not shown).Fig. 2Sucrose gradient analysis of β-COP during assembly into coatomer. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for the indicated times before lysis and fractionation on a 5-30% sucrose gradient.

After 5-min chase ∼40% of α-COP and 20% of δ-COP has already associated with β′-COP (Fig. 3, A and B). β-, γ-, and ϵ-COP associate more slowly, and as expected, assembly is complete at 120 min. Identical results were obtained with CM1A10 antibody (data not shown), demonstrating its previously unknown antigen to be β′-COP. The interaction between β′- and α-COP seen at an early stage in assembly is entirely consistent with in vitro data showing that α-, β′-, and ϵ-COP interact directly within coatomer (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations with antibodies to ζ-COP showed that it associates at early time points exclusively with γ-COP and δ-COP. After 5-min chase ∼50% of γ- and δ-COP is complexed with ζ-COP (Fig. 3, C and D). α-, β-, and β′-COP are next with ϵ-COP having the slowest association kinetics. Again, these findings support in vitro data showing that γ- and ζ-COP interact directly in coatomer (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). δ-COP appears relatively promiscuous in that it interacts independently with β-COP, α- and β′-COP, and γ- and ζ-COP early during coatomer assembly. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of these other COPs with anti-δ-COP antibodies at early time points (data not shown). Addition of BFA to mammalian cells rapidly results in the removal of coatomer from membranes, leading ultimately to membrane tubularization and fusion (28Klausner R. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). To study whether coatomer assembly may be regulated by levels of soluble coatomer in the cell we used BFA to inhibit binding of coatomer to membranes to increase its soluble pool. Addition of 1 μg/ml BFA almost completely abolished incorporation of β-COP into coatomer (Fig. 4). BFA also inhibited association of ζ-COP with other COPs and blocked the incorporation of β′-COP into coatomer, although the interaction between α- and β′-COP was not affected (data not shown). This effect of BFA was apparent within 20 min of the chase and did not appear to be due to nonspecific toxic effects, since overall protein synthesis was normal, as was synthesis of β-COP, at least when measured during the 5-min pulse period (data not shown). BFA did also not cause coatomer subunits within the preformed complex to dissociate (not shown). To study coatomer stability in vivo exponentially growing cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 10 h and then chased in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine. Coatomer was immunoprecipitated from cells lysed at 8-h intervals during the chase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Coatomer is degraded slowly; a logarithmic scale graph of the decay of labeled protein gives a half-life of approximately 28 h (Fig. 5C). The stoichiometry of radiolabeled COPs remains the same at all times during the chase showing that each subunit is degraded at the same rate and suggesting that subunits in the complex do not exchange with newly synthesized COPs. In support of this suggestion, we have failed to observe incorporation of transfected, tagged β-COP into pre-existing coatomer complexes in vivo (data not shown). We also examined the stability of monomeric ζ-COP, the only COP to exist in significant amounts as a free subunit at steady state (15Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Fig. 6), by first immunodepleting coatomer from samples prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-ζ-COP antibodies. Monomeric ζ-COP is degraded at a similar rate to ζ-COP in coatomer with a half-life of ∼32 h (Fig. 5, B and C). Recent results have demonstrated that coatomer is recruited onto endocytic membranes (3Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, δ- and γ-COP were not detected on endosomes, suggesting that either the antibodies did not cross-react with endosomal δ- and γ-COP, or that partial complexes lacking these subunits bind to endosomes (3Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether coatomer subcomplexes exist in cells, we analyzed the distribution of each COP on a sucrose density gradient. There was a major peak for each subunit at fraction 11 (∼13 S), the position of coatomer (Fig. 6). There was no detectable α-, β-, β′-, γ-, and δ-COP and only small amounts of ϵ-COP at lower densities. Identical results were obtained with cytosol and Triton X-100 cell extracts that had been prepared in different buffers (data not shown). This shows that these subunits do not exist in partial complexes at steady state. There was a significant amount of ζ-COP in fractions 2 and 3, corresponding to monomeric protein. This agrees with the findings of Kuge et al. (15Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and shows that this is the only COP to exist in significant amounts separately of the COP-complex. We have shown that coatomer assembly in vivo takes ∼1-2 h and that during assembly the following subunits interact directly with each other, α-COP with β′- and δ-COP, β-COP with δ-COP, and γ-COP with ζ- and δ-COP (Fig. 7). This corroborates results obtained during in vitro disassembly of coatomer showing direct interactions of α-COP with β′- and ϵ-COP, of γ-COP with ζ-COP, and of β-COP with δ-COP (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The strongest subunit interactions within coatomer are therefore also those that form earliest during assembly of the complex, thus suggesting that partial complexes form early during assembly and are then brought together to form coatomer. We have recently found that a related form of COPI is essential for endosome function (3Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some (e.g. ζ-COP) of the coat subunits involved in endocytosis appear to be significantly more conserved with coatomer involved in transport between the intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi network than others (γ- and δ-COP (3Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar)). It has thus been tempting to speculate that various forms of coats can be generated by exchange of coatomer subcomplexes from a soluble pool of different “modules.” Variation of these modules would define specific functions of coatomer or target coatomer to different subcellular sites. Since partial coatomer complexes are transient and not found in significant amounts in the cell at steady state, exchange of such modules must either be very rapid, or more likely, coatomer once assembled maintains its structure and subunit composition during its lifetime. Since heterogeneity of coatomer subunits has been described at the biochemical and post-translational level (29Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we speculate that variety of coats is produced by stable assembly of different combinations of distinct partial coatomer complexes. Thus endosomal coatomer may have similar subunit composition and structure to the previously characterized coatomer, with differences predominantly in (some of) its subunits. The finding that complexes with different protein compositions did not co-immunoprecipitate in the pulse-chase experiments, even though some of the antibodies used did cross-react with endosomal COPs, also supports this conclusion. We cannot be sure at the moment, however, if we are observing the assembly of one or more types of coatomer complex in the pulse-chase experiments. Most likely the three subcomplexes of coatomer (α-, β′-, and ϵ-COP; γ- and ζ-COP; β- and δ-COP) are responsible for different coatomer functions within the context of the seven-subunit complex (see Fig. 7). These different functions include ARF-regulated binding of coatomer to specific organellar membranes, interaction of coatomer with defined cargo, and assembly of coatomer into a coat. It has been shown that the α-, β′-, ϵ-COP trimer is a membrane binding subcomplex of coatomer (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and interacts with a KKXX motif present on cargo transported between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (7Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 23Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of this subcomplex to membranes is not regulated by GTP (24Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies to ζ-COP prevent binding of coatomer to membranes; yet, this COPI subunit appears not to be directly involved in coatomer membrane interaction (15Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, antibodies directed against the “EAGE epitope” of β-COP stabilize coatomer membrane binding. 2J. Scheel, R. Pepperkok, M. Lowe, G. Griffiths, and T. E. Kreis, submitted for publication. We conclude therefore that the α-, β′-, ϵ-COP trimer is involved in binding of coatomer to membranes and that β-COP may be involved in the (ARF-dependent) regulation of this interaction. More detailed experiments using purified coatomer subcomplexes should help their further characterization in coatomer specific function. It is possible that chaperones are involved in coatomer assembly. Possible candidates are a protein at ∼70 kDa, which transiently co-immunoprecipitates with β-, β′-, and ζ-COP (Figs. 1A and 3, A and C), as well as a doublet at ∼45 kDa, which appears transiently associated with assembling ζ-COP (see Fig. 3C). However, the 45-kDa doublet was not found associated with other assembling subunits and appeared variably, like the 70-kDa protein, between experiments and so we cannot at the moment exclude them to be cross-reacting contaminants. Further experiments are required to clarify the specificites of these putative interactions. We could not detect any other proteins associated in stoichiometric amounts with assembling coatomer subunits using different lysis conditions or chemical cross-linking (data not shown). Although it is possible that chaperones associate transiently with coatomer subunits during assembly, it is also tempting to speculate that δ-COP may function in this capacity. It is indeed striking that δ-COP associates with several other COPs independently early during coatomer assembly. Alternatively, δ-COP may associate rapidly with these other COPs during coatomer assembly, because it has a central position in the complex and interacts with several subunits. Further experiments should help elucidate more precisely the exact role of δ-COP in the process of coatomer assembly. The finding that the stoichiometry of radiolabeled COPs remains during a prolonged chase is consistent with en bloc binding of coatomer to membranes (14Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fact that monomeric ζ-COP is also long lived in the cell suggests that it may function independently of the coatomer complex. What might this function be? One possibility, that it regulates the rate of assembly of coats by binding to the coatomer binding site on membranes, does not appear to be true, since ζ-COP does not interact on its own with the coatomer binding site on membranes (15Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Its function therefore remains unclear at the moment and awaits further experiments. How might BFA inhibit coatomer assembly? One possibility is that assembly occurs on membranes and that BFA exerts its effect by preventing membrane binding of newly synthesized COPs. This seems unlikely, however, since the same assembly intermediates were found in cytosol preparations devoid of membranes (not shown). Alternatively, since BFA also inhibits membrane traffic, assembly might be regulated by the rates of vesicular transport. However, aluminum fluoride, an activator of trimeric G proteins, which in contrast to BFA, increases binding of coatomer to membranes (30Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and also inhibits secretion, did not inhibit assembly (not shown). We therefore favor the possibility that assembly may be regulated by levels of soluble coatomer within the cell. One might imagine a mechanism whereby a sensor in the cytoplasm measures the amount of soluble coatomer and if this becomes too high, as in the case of BFA, then assembly is inhibited. Such a mechanism would provide a means of regulating the amount of coatomer within the cell and would resemble in principle other feedback mechanisms used to regulate levels of protein complexes in the cell, as in the case of tubulin for example (31Bachurski C.J. Theodorakis R.M. Coulson R.M. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4076-4086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 167-172PubMed Google Scholar). aminopeptidase β-naphthylamide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These enzymes generally have broad substrate specificity and occur in several forms. Of such enzymes, Ap-B (EC 3.4.11.6), which was discovered in 1964 from a rat duodenal supernatant fraction (2Hopsu V.K. Kantonen U.-M. Glenner G.G. Life Sci. 1964; 3: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), catalyzes specifically the removal of unsubstituted, N-terminal Arg and Lys residues from peptides and β-naphthylamide (NA) or other synthetic derivatives. The rate of arginine release is typically about twice that of lysine (3McDonald J.K. Barrett A.J. McDonald J.K. Barrett A.J. Mammalian Proteases. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Inc., London1986: 48-55Google Scholar). Although there are numerous reports on the enzyme, conclusive evidence on the characterization of the enzyme is restricted to its Cl−-dependent activation (4Hopsu V.K. Mäkinen K.K. Glenner G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and sensitivity to inhibition by bestatin (5Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Suda H. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1976; 29: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and Arphamenine B (6Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Ohuchi S. Okuyama A. Suda H. Takita T. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1983; 36: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since earlier reports based on inhibition and restoration experiments utilizing metal chelators and divalent metal ions (4Hopsu V.K. Mäkinen K.K. Glenner G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Suda H. Aoyagi T. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Kawata S. Takayama S. Ninomiya K. Makisumi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Ap-B has been regarded as a metalloenzyme; but there is some controversy on this point. Söderling and Mäkinen (9Söderling E. Mäkinen K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) used atomic absorption spectrophotometry to measure the zinc content of this enzyme, but they detected no zinc. On the other hand, Ocain and Rich (10Ocain T.D. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported that this enzyme was inhibited by L-lysine thiol, a compound that would be expected to inhibit the enzyme by interaction with a catalytic zinc ion in the active site. In the current study, we cloned Ap-B cDNA and found that the enzyme belongs to the family of zinc metallopeptidases and contains the zinc-binding domain in its sequence. In addition, by an atomic absorption experiment we demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme contains a zinc ion, which we presume to be catalytic. Various aminoacyl-NAs (Arg-, Bz-Arg-, Leu-, IIe-, Val-, Ala-, Pro-, Ser-, Tyr-, Phe-, Met-) were obtained from Sigma, and NAs (Lys-, His-, Asp-, Hyp-, Trp-, Gly-) were from Koch-Light Lab., Ltd. (Colnbrook, United Kingdom). Restriction and modifying enzymes were from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Takara Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and Daiichi Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Protein was usually measured by the method of Hartree (11Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). However, when the sample solution contained a reducing agent, the protein concentration was measured by the method of Ross and Schatz (12Ross E. Schatz G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); and if the sample solution contained a microquantity of protein, the method of Sargent (13Sargent M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used, with bovine serum albumin used as the standard. Enzyme activity using Arg-NA as substrate was measured by a slight modification of the method of Hopsu et al. (14Hopsu V.K. Mäkinen K.K. Glenner G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture comprised 10 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15 μmol of NaCl, 0.04 μmol of substrate, and an appropriate amount of enzyme plus water to 200 μl. After incubation at 25°C for 20 min, 500 μl of 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 10% Tween 20 and 200 μl of Fast Garnet GBC (0.8 mg/ml H2O) were added to the reaction mixture. The absorbance of the resulting diazo dye was measured at 530 nm. When the reaction mixture contained a reducing agent, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid; then the amount of β-naphthylamine liberated was estimated by the method of Goldbarg and Rutenburg (15Goldbarg J.A. Rutenburg A.M. Cancer. 1958; 11: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of β-naphthylamine per min at 25°C. For isolation of the rat liver cDNA, mRNA from rat (female Wistar) liver was obtained by use of a mRNA isolation kit; then the cDNA was constructed with a Uni-ZAP synthesis kit from Stratagene. From this library, 1.5 × 105 plaques were screened immunologically with polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the human placental Ap-B (described below). pBluescript phagemids containing cDNA inserts between EcoRI and XhoI sites were excised from the Uni-ZAP clones by use of ExAssist helper phage. VCSM13 helper phage were used for the single-stranded rescue procedure. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination reaction method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using overlapping subclones prepared from either M13 mp18 and/or M13 mp19 generated by digestion of the insert with appropriate restriction endonucleases and using the single-stranded pBluescript SK (−) phagemid. Specific oligomers were purchased from Sawaday Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and used as primers to fill in remaining gaps in the sequence. Fig. 1 shows the restriction map and sequence strategy. The purification procedure was developed from that reported by Nagata et al. (17Nagata Y. Mizutani S. Nomura S. Kurauchi O. Kasugai M. Tomoda Y. Enzyme. 1991; 45: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with the following modification. Human placenta was obtained at normal full-term delivery. Immediately after delivery, the membranes and cord were dissected away, and the placenta was washed free from blood with cold 0.9% NaCl and cut into small pieces (311 g, wet weight). It was then homogenized with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (20,000 rpm, 3 min) in 8 volumes of 0.9% NaCl. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant fluid was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (40-65% saturation) with solid ammonium sulfate. All following purification steps were carried out at 4°C, if not otherwise specified. Each step used sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0 (buffer A) or 1 mM, pH 6.8, containing 1 mM mercaptoethanol (buffer B)). The ammonium sulfate fraction was dialyzed against buffer A and then applied to a DEAE-Toyo column (2.8 × 35 cm) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 2 volumes of the starting buffer and then eluted with 50 mM NaCl in buffer A (flow rate, 143 ml/h). The pooled enzyme solution was dialyzed against buffer B and concentrated in collodion bags to 35 ml. The concentrated material was then applied to a hydroxyapatite column (2.8 × 16 cm) equilibrated with buffer B and eluted with a linear phosphate gradient from 1 to 100 mM in buffer B (flow rate, 83 ml/h). Active fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM mercaptoethanol, concentrated in a collodion bag to 2 ml, and then loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.6 × 95 cm; flow rate, 33.5 ml/h). The pooled enzyme solution was dialyzed against buffer B and solid ammonium sulfate (25% saturation) was then added to it. The ammonium sulfate solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.6 × 16 cm) and eluted with double linear gradient (ammonium sulfate concentration, 25% to 0%; ethylene glycol, 0% to 50%) in the buffer (flow rate, 84 ml/h). Enzyme fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 mM mercaptoethanol, and concentrated to 0.65 ml. This enzyme preparation was mixed with an equal volume of 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C until used. Four hundred microliters of the purified enzyme (in 25% glycerol solution) were loaded onto a 10% SDS disc gel (10 tubes). Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current of 8 mA/gel for 7 h with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 used as a running marker. The gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, and the main band was cut out and then homogenized with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The homogenate was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a 2-kg male rabbit. Four such injections were given over a 2-week interval. Ten days after the last injection, the animal was bled from the carotid artery. The selective reactivity between purified human placental enzyme and its antiserum was verified by the double immunodiffusion technique and Western blot analysis. The antiserum was stored at −80°C. The purity and molecular weight of the purified enzyme were determined by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme or Escherichia coli cells were added to an equal volume of sample buffer containing 4% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 2 or 20 min, respectively. An appropriate amount of the purified enzyme or E. coli extract was used in each study. Uniform polyacrylamide slab gel (10%) with a 5% stacking gel was run at room temperature until the bromphenol blue reached the bottom of the slab. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue or used for Western blot analysis. The purified enzyme and crude cell extract were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% separating gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot apparatus. The membranes were blocked at room temperature in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20. Rabbit anti-human Ap-B antiserum was diluted 1:3000 with the same buffer, and the membranes were incubated in it overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the membranes were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. After the membranes had been washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the bands were visualized by use of an alkaline phosphatase color development kit (Bio-Rad). Cultures of E. coli SOLR cells infected with the recombinant pBluescript phagemid were grown at 37°C to A600 = 0.2 in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 mg of ampicillin. Then isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mM, and the bacteria were incubated overnight. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the cells were suspended in 70 ml of 0.9% NaCl and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment at 9 kHz for 1 min, repeated three times at intervals of 5 min. A clear supernatant fluid was obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min, to which solid ammonium sulfate was added (65% saturation). The pellet obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed against this same buffer. This solution (21.2 ml) was then applied to a DEAE-Toyo column (2.8 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After the column had been washed with 130 ml of the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.3 M in the buffer (flow rate, 174 ml/h). As in the case of the purification of the placental enzyme, the active enzyme fraction was then applied to a hydroxyapatite column (0.6 × 5 cm). After the hydroxyapatite column had been washed with 30 ml of buffer B, the enzyme was eluted with a linear phosphate gradient from 1 to 100 mM in the buffer (flow rate, 28 ml/h). The enzyme fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM mercaptoethanol, and then concentrated to 0.5 ml. This enzyme preparation was mixed with an equal volume of 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C until used. Zinc determinations were performed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry with a Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometer SM-30(Shimazu Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Absorbance peak heights were measured at 307.6 nm. For the zinc determination, the enzyme was applied to a Nick column (containing Sephadex G-50; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with distilled water. Then the eluted solution was divided into three parts for analysis of zinc and protein and for determination of amino acid composition. The sample for zinc analysis was lyophilized, dissolved in 0.01% metal-free nitric acid, and appropriately diluted. Ten-microliter samples were loaded into pyrolytically coated graphite tubes. All values shown are averages of duplicate determinations on four different dilutions of sample. Zinc concentrations were quantified by comparing unknowns with zinc standard solutions (0, 50, 75, and 100 ng; Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd.). Amino acid composition of the sample described above was determined after hydrolysis under vacuum in HCl vapor at 105°C for 24, 48, and 72 h, followed by precolumn derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate (Waters Associates, PICO-TAG method) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Ap-B was purified to homogeneity from human placenta, as summarized in Table I and was shown to give one main band and some minor ones by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Therefore, to obtain specific antibody, it was necessary to excise this main band for use as an immunogen. The enzyme hydrolyzed only Arg- and Lys-NA (activity ratio, 100:45), and the activity was inhibited by 1 mM bestatin, o-phenanthroline, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, which chemicals are known as inhibitors of Ap-B. The specific activity for hydrolysis of arginyl-NA, 14.3 units/mg of protein, was higher than the values for human (17Nagata Y. Mizutani S. Nomura S. Kurauchi O. Kasugai M. Tomoda Y. Enzyme. 1991; 45: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), rat (4Hopsu V.K. Mäkinen K.K. Glenner G.G. Arch. Biochem.

To express the protein in E. coli, we excised the pBluescript phagemids from these positive clones. Two of the five clones had a high Arg-NA-hydrolyzing activity, so we expected them to contain a full-length cDNA. The molecular mass of the insert cDNA and the nucleotide sequence of the 5′ region of the insert cDNA of both clones were the same; therefore, we concluded that the clones were identical. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA are shown in Fig. 3. The ATG codon numbered as 1 must be the translation initiation site, since the nucleotide sequence around it (GCCATGG) corresponds to Kozak's rule (19Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). In the 3′-noncoding region, a polyadenylation signal was found at 2,164-2,169. The open reading frame of 1947 base pairs encoded a 649-amino acid polypeptide with a theoretical molecular mass of 72,545 Da. On the other hand, the molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was estimated to be about 70,200 ± 2,300 (mean ± S.D.) Da by SDS-PAGE and 73,200 ± 600 (mean ± S.D.) Da by gel filtration with Sephacryl S-300 as determined by a logarithmic regression program. These data are approximately the same as the theoretical value. The deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 3) also contained the HEXXH consensus sequence (residues 324-348) with a second glutamic acid separated by 18 amino acids, which is the structural signature of members of the zinc metallopeptidase family (20Jongeneel C.V. Bouvier J. Bairoch A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 21Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Search of the Swiss Prot (EMBL) protein sequence data base with the primary structure of rat liver Ap-B showed significant similarity to the leukotriene-A4 hydrolase of rats (36.5% identity over 598 amino acids) (22Makita N. Funk C.D. Imai E. Hoover R.-L. Badr K.F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), humans (37.2% identity over 596 amino acids) (23Minami M. Ohno S. Kawasaki H.

Gene. 1995; 161: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lower but highly significant levels of amino acid sequence identity were found between Ap-B and the Ap-N of rats (23.7% identity over 363 amino acids) (26Watt V.M. Yip C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (24.6% identity over 362 amino acids) (27Olsen J. Cowell G.M. Kønigshøfer E. Danielsen E.M. Møller J. Laustsen L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The homology was especially striking in the region (amino acid residues 151-353) containing the consensus zinc-binding motif, and the identity between Ap-B and rat leukotriene-A4 hydrolase was 55.2% (Fig. 4). However, when the amino acid sequence of Ap-B was compared with that of other aminopeptidases (yeast Ap, mouse pre-B-cell antigen, human Ap-N, and rat zinc Ap), the consensus sequences of zinc-binding domains (30Caprioglio D.R. Padilla C. Werner-Washburne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14310-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), regions II and III shown in Fig. 4, were not conserved.Fig. 4Ap and leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LKHA) sequence alignment. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat Ap-B (amino acids 151-353) is aligned with the sequences of human Ap-A (30Caprioglio D.R. Padilla C. Werner-Washburne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14310-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (amino acids 204-421), rat Ap-N (28Nanus D.M. Engelstein D. Gastl G.A. Gluck L. Vidal M.J. Morrison M. Finstad C.L.

Amino acids identical with those of Ap-B are indicated by asterisks in Ap-A, Ap-N, and leukotriene-A4 hydrolase sequences; bars, gaps.

It had a specific activity of 27.0 units/mg protein, which corresponded to 117-fold purification from ammonium sulfate fraction with a recovery of 57%. The relative rate of hydrolysis of various aminoacyl-NAs by the recombinant enzyme was approximately the same as that of human placental Ap-B. (activity ratio: Arg:Lys = 100:44.4). The other synthetic substrates were not hydrolyzed at all. The pH optimum (pH 7.4) and the molecular mass did not differ significantly between the two enzymes. Km values (mean ± S.D.) for Arg-NA of the purified enzymes were (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−4 M (placental) and (2.3 ± 0.2) × 10−4 M (recombinant). The catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km, (M−1. s−1)) of the two enzymes toward Arg-NA was almost the same order of magnitude: placental, 340,000; and recombinant, 460,000. Ki values (mean ± S.D.) of the recombinant enzyme were (5.4 ± 0.3) × 10−8 M for bestatin (competitive inhibition), (2.2 ± 0.1) × 10−4 M for o-phenanthroline (mixed type noncompetitive inhibition), and (4.9 ± 2.2) × 10−8 M for p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (uncompetitive inhibition) as determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot by a linear regression program. The modes of inhibition of the recombinant enzyme activity were the same as those previously reported for other mammalian enzymes (7Suda H. Aoyagi T. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Kawata S. Takayama S. Ninomiya K. Makisumi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The zinc content of the recombinant enzyme, determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, was 1.14 ± 0.28 (mean ± S.D.) and 1.16 ± 0.12 (mean ± S.D.) mol zinc per mol of enzyme as calculated from protein assay and amino acid composition, respectively. Thus we conclude that Ap-B has 1 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme. We were successful in cloning the cDNA encoding rat Ap-B. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the HEXXH consensus sequence of zinc metallopeptidases with an additional glutamic acid 18 amino acids away, which constitutes the active site of metallopeptidases such as Ap-N, Ap-A, and leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (23Minami M. Ohno S. Kawasaki H. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Jörnvall H. Shimizu T. Seyama Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13873-13876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ap-B has been also proposed to contain a zinc ion in its active site based on inhibition kinetics of a lysine thiol (10Ocain T.D. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and of a reduced bestatin isostere (31Harbeson S.L. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7301-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, Söderling and Mäkinen (9Söderling E. Mäkinen K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that Ap-B contained no zinc, as judged from atomic absorption results, and concluded that Ap-B could not be classified as a metallopeptidase. We showed that the recombinant enzyme has 1 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme by the same atomic absorption experiment. In the report of Rawlings and Barrett (32Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), metallopeptidases formed 30 families of catalytic types, and these families were represented by 5 clans. Ap-B is a member of the M1 family in the HEXXH + E metallopeptidase clan (MA), which includes Ap-A, leukotriene-A4 hydrolase, and membrane alanylAp in mammals and alanyl/arginyl-Ap and Ap yscII in Saccharomyces. We calculated that the theoretical molecular mass of rat liver Ap-B is 72,545 Da, which is approximately the same as the molecular mass of human enzymes from: skeletal muscle, 72,000 Da (33Mantle D. Lauffart B. McDermott J.R. Kidd A.M. Pennington R.J.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); brain, 70,000 Da (34McDermott J.R. Mantle D. Lauffart B.

In line with this, we found that whole E. coli lysates containing recombinant Ap-B showed three bands by Western blot analysis. One band had the same electrophoretic mobility as the purified enzyme, but the other two bands were estimated to have a lower molecular mass, which we supposed to be degraded enzyme protein (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the purified Ap-Bs from rat muscle (38Parsons M.E. Godwin K.O. Pennington R.J.T. Int. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and porcine liver (8Kawata S.

Ap-B from human erythrocytes has relatively weak endopeptidase activity in hydrolyzing the internal Gly4-Phe5 bond of bradykinin (43Mäkinen K.K. Mäkinen P.-L. Biochem.

If this is true, Ap-B would seem to be a bifunctional enzyme like previously reported peptidases (45Kirschke H. Langner J. Wiederanders B. Ansorge S. Bohley P. Broghammer U. Acta. Biol. Med.

Therefore, using bradykinin and neurotensin as substrates, we tested the endopeptidase activity of our recombinant enzyme. Both bioactive peptides were split at one internal bond site (data not shown). Although the enzyme action was completely inhibited by 1 mM o-phenanthroline, the site of hydrolysis of two peptides was different from that of the thimet oligopeptidase (50Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The endopeptidase activity in the recombinant enzyme is probably due to the contamination of some other metalloendopeptidase. However, at present, we do not know whether Ap-B has its own endopeptidase activity or not.

https://openalex.org/W1994423670,"To characterize tissue-specific differences in insulin signaling, we compared the mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by insulin in the mitogenically active 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with the metabolically active 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In both cell lines, insulin significantly increased p21ras·GTP loading (1.5-2-fold) and MAP kinase activity (5-8-fold). Inhibition of Ras farnesylation with lovastatin blocked activation of p21ras and Raf-1 kinase in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, this was accompanied by an inhibition of the stimulatory effect of insulin on MAP kinase. In contrast, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, despite an inhibition of activation of p21ras and Raf-1 by lovastatin, insulin continued to stimulate MAP kinase activity. Fractionation of the cell lysates on the FPLC Mono-Q column revealed that lovastatin inhibited insulin stimulation of ERK2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERK1) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and had no effect on the insulin-stimulated ERK2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results demonstrate an important distinction between the mechanism of insulin signaling in the metabolically and mitogenically active cells.

Insulin activates MAP kinase by the Ras-dependent pathway in the 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and by the Ras-independent pathway in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin's interaction with its cell surface receptor triggers both metabolic and mitogenic cellular responses. Insulin binding activates the tyrosine kinase of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, which immediately phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc. Phosphorylated sites of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc bind Src homology-2 domain-containing intermediates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorPKCprotein kinase CGAPGTPase-activating proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMAPmitogen-activated proteinMEKMAP/ERK kinaseMEKKMEK kinase. and Grb-2, which, in turn, propagate insulin signaling downstream. PI 3-kinase appears to be involved in regulation of glucose transport and protein synthesis, while Grb-2 association with Sos appears to be an important step in activating the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase pathway (reviewed in 1Cheatham B.

Although many intermediates of the insulin signaling have been identified, numerous questions remain unanswered. In particular, most of the signaling molecules activated by insulin are also significantly stimulated by other growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and EGF (2Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C.

However, in contrast to these growth factors, only insulin elicits defined metabolic responses, suggesting that additional steps must be involved in the mechanism of insulin action. Recent studies from our laboratory have identified significant differences between the regulation of certain aspects of insulin signaling in metabolically responsive 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mitogenically responsive 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (3DePaolo D.

For example, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PI 3-kinase and PKC exert a constitutively inhibitory influence on GTPase-activating protein (GAP), allowing insulin signaling to proceed through Sos and p21ras. Removal of this inhibitory influence results in activation of GAP and inhibition of the p21ras·GTP loading. The inhibitory influence of PI 3-kinase and PKC on GAP activation was not observed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (3DePaolo D. Reusch J.E.-B. Carel K. Bhuripanyo P. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Mol. Cell.

Differentiation of adipocytes was induced via the following protocol. Cells were refed with fibroblast growth media when 80% confluent. Two days later, cells were fed differentiation media (DMEM containing 25 mM glucose, 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 mM L-glutamine, 2.5 ml of 10 × PBS, 0.055 g of isobutylmethylxanthene, 20 ml of deionized water, 250 μl of 49 mM dexamethasone, and 2.5 mg of insulin). On day 4, cells were fed adipocyte growth media (DMEM containing 25 mM glucose with 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1 μg/ml insulin). Cells were refed adipocyte growth media without insulin every 2 days and used on days 10-12. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were grown to confluence and serum-starved overnight. Cells were stimulated for 10 min with 100 nM insulin, rinsed three times with PBS, and lysed with 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 100 μM Na3VO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT)). Cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Samples (normalized for protein) were incubated with 5 μl of Raf-1 antibody for 90 min on ice.

Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Pellets were washed in RIPA buffer, RIPA without aprotinin, and two times in PAN buffer (10 mM Pipes, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Pellets were resuspended in PAN buffer, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended in 20 μl of PAN buffer, and incubated at 30°C for 15 min in 10 μl of 2 × PAN buffer plus 1000 units/ml aprotinin, 4 μl of 100 mM MnCl2, 1 μl of MEK, 2 μl of 0.1 mM ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 5 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 60 min at 100 V. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Confluent cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 10 min. Cells were placed on ice, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). Lysates were quickly vortexed, and then centrifuged (5 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C). Supernatants were absorbed to 0.5-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) columns (prewashed with three 1-ml aliquots of 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2, at 4°C). Columns were washed with three 1-ml aliquots of the above buffer and eluted with 1 ml of the above buffer containing 1 M sodium chloride. Twenty microliters of the collected eluent were incubated for 10 min at 30°C with 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 μM Na3VO4, 20 mM MgCl2, 200 μM ATP, 0.45 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 400 μM EGFR-(662-681) peptide (Macromolecular Resources, Ft. Collins, CO), 50 μg/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, PKI 5-24 (Bachem, Torrance, CA), and 1 mM EGTA). The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 25% trichloracetic acid, and 45 μl of the mixture was spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose squares. The squares were washed four times in 75 mM phosphoric acid, washed once in 100% acetone, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. In several experiments, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK1/2 antibody and the precipitates used in the MAP kinase assay. Confluent cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 10 min. Cells were placed on ice, rinsed with PBS, and collected in ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (5 mM EGTA, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2). Cells were sonicated and then centrifuged (5 min at 14,000 × g at 4°C). Supernatants were filtered, assayed for protein content, and fractionated into 266-μl fractions on a Mono-Q FPLC column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) using a linear gradient (13.3 mM increase in salt/fraction) from 0 to 800 mM sodium chloride (with 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2). Twenty microliters of each collected fraction was incubated for 10 min at 30°C with 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 μM Na3VO4, 20 mM MgCl2, 200 μM ATP, 0.9 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont), 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 50 μg/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, PKI 5-24 (Bachem), 1 mM EGTA). The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 25% trichloracetic acid, and 45 μl of the mixture was spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose squares. The squares were washed four times in 1 liter of 75 mM phosphoric acid (7 min/wash), washed once in 100% acetone, dried, and counted in a scintillation β counter. Fractions exhibiting high kinase activity were concentrated to 40 μl, boiled in 10 μl of 5 × Laemmli sample buffer, and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting was performed with JNK (Santa Cruz), ERK1 and ERK2 (Santa Cruz), and p38 kinase antibodies using the ECL system (Amersham). Confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were serum- and phosphate-starved for 24 h and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.25 mCi/ml) overnight. Cells were then incubated with insulin (100 nM) for 10 min. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to insulin. The increment in percent p21ras·GTP was determined as described previously (10Draznin B. Chang L. Leitner J.W. Takata Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19998-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras antibody (Y13-259), and the nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography. GTP and GDP were visualized by autoradiography and using acid molybate reagent, cut, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All statistics were performed by Student's t test, with p value < 0.05 considered significant. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. in comparison to control groups. To investigate the role of p21ras in mediating insulin activation of MAP kinase, we initially employed the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitor lovastatin to block the activation of p21ras by insulin in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lovastatin blocks farnesylation of p21ras, thus decreasing the pool of the intracellular Ras available for subsequent activation by growth factors, including insulin (9Reusch J.E.-B. Bhuripanyo P.

Lovastatin (2 μg/ml for 18 h) significantly inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate p21ras·GTP loading in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). However, insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity was inhibited by lovastatin in the 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (by 85%), but not in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). Despite complete inhibition of Ras stimulation, insulin continued to activate MAP kinase (5-8-fold) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Fig. 2Basal and insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity in control and lovastatin-treated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes.

This enzyme catalyzes farnesylation of p21ras, which is necessary for its subsequent activation. The presence of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor completely blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, but had no effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3). We have recently observed that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, depletion of PKC with prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester, TPA, results in activation of GAP and inhibition of the insulin-induced p21ras·GTP loading (4Schubert C. Carel K. DePaolo D. Leitner W. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15311-15314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this paradigm to further examine the role of p21ras·GTP in mediating insulin's effect on MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cells treated with TPA (100 nM for 18 h) were unable to increase p21ras·GTP formation in response to insulin (4Schubert C. Carel K. DePaolo D. Leitner W. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15311-15314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but responded fully to activation of MAP kinase by insulin (Fig. 4), suggesting that the latter is activated by a Ras-independent pathway. Assuming a linear progression of the insulin signal from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERK1/ERK2, we compared the involvement of Raf and MEK kinases in the activation of MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. Activation of Raf-1 kinase activity by insulin was clearly Ras-dependent in both cell lines, as lovastatin inhibited insulin-stimulated Raf-1 activity in fibroblasts and adipocytes (Fig. 5). Similarly in both cell lines, the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, was equipotent in inhibiting the activation of MAP kinase by insulin in both cell lines (Fig. 6), implying the importance of MEK as the upstream activator of MAP kinase in both fibroblasts and adipocytes.Fig. 6Effect of MEK inhibitor (PD98059) on basal and insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. Cells were pretreated with PD98059 (20 μM) for 1 h prior to a 10-min incubation with (shaded bars) or without (open bars) insulin (100 nM). In both cell lines, PD98059 completely abolished stimulatory effect of insulin on MAP kinase. Results represent mean ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to confirm that in fibroblasts insulin stimulates MAP kinase activity via the Ras-dependent pathway, we examined the effect of insulin on MAP kinase in the Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with the dominant negative mutant (N17) of Ras. As shown in Fig. 7, insulin failed to stimulate MAP kinase activity in these cells. In the experiments described above, MAP kinase activity reflected the total cellular kinase activity assayed using the EGF receptor peptide as a substrate. Conceivably, differential expression of various members of the MAP kinase family (11Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.C. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar) may explain the differences in response to insulin between the adipocytes and fibroblasts. To examine this possibility, we fractionated cell lysates from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes on FPLC Mono-Q column and measured MAP kinase activity in each fraction. Two major peaks of MAP kinase activity were detected in both cell types. The first peak corresponded to ERK2 and the second smaller peak to ERK1. Insulin activated ERK2 and ERK1 in both cell types. Inhibition of p21ras activation with lovastatin resulted in a decreased ability of insulin to stimulate ERK2 in fibroblasts (Fig. 8A), but had no effect on the activation of ERK2 by insulin in adipocytes (Fig. 8B). Finally, to verify the effect of insulin on ERK1/2, we determined MAP kinase activity in the ERK1/2 immunoprecipitates of control and lovastatin-treated cells. Insulin's effect on MAP kinase was completely blocked in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, but remained unaffected in the adipocytes (Fig. 9). It is well known that insulin stimulates both p21ras·GTP loading and MAP kinase in most cells expressing insulin receptors (15deVries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M. Th. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 16White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been assumed that these two events are obligatorily coupled in these cells. The main point of the present study is that, at least in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, these events are parallel but independent of each other. Insulin stimulates both p21ras and MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but inhibition of p21ras by lovastatin, farnesyltransferase inhibitor, or PKC depletion does not affect insulin's ability to stimulate MAP kinase in these cells (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This is in direct contrast to 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, where activation of p21ras is an obligatory step for MAP kinase activation (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Despite differential regulation, the Mono-Q pattern of the MAP kinases is similar in both cell lines (Fig. 8), indicating that the same MAP kinase family members are differentially regulated in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes: one via a Ras-dependent and the other via a Ras-independent pathway. Several MAP kinases (ERK1/2, JNK/SAP, p38/HOG1, p57 MAP), MEKs (MEK1, −2, −3, −5, and −6), Rafs (A-Raf, c-Raf-1, B-Raf), and MEK kinases (MEKK-1, −2, and −3) have been identified and cloned (11Kyriakis J.M.

Various members of these families may be either differentially expressed in various tissues, differentially localized intracellularly, or differentially regulated within the same tissue. Any one of these possibilities can explain the existence of Ras- and Raf-dependent and Ras- and Raf-independent activation of MAP kinase observed previously (6Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem.

Regulation of different MAP kinases involves preferential influence of different MEKs, MEKKs, and Raf kinases (5Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Recent comparison of various MEKKs indicated that greater degree of selectivity for ERK1/2 or JNK pathways was apparent only at modest levels of expression of MEK1, −2, or −3 (19Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, activities of MEKKs have been found to be quite distinct from the activities of Raf-1 and B-Raf kinases (6Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 7Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

The present data support the existence of diverse signaling pathways and for the first time suggest that these diverse pathways can be activated by the same ligand, depending upon the differentiated phenotype. It appears that in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, insulin activates ERK1/2 via the traditional Ras-dependent pathway. In contrast, in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin stimulates ERK1/2 via a Ras- and Raf-independent pathway. The signaling molecules within the Ras-independent pathway are unknown. ERK1/2 is believed to be activated by its own kinase, MEK1/2 (5Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar), and MEK1/2 activation appears to be essential for insulin signaling in both adipocytes and fibroblasts, since the MEK inhibitor blocked insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation in both cell lines (Fig. 6). MEK itself is a dual specificity kinase, which is activated by the upstream serine/threonine kinases Raf and MEKK. The present data suggest that activation of MAP kinase by MEK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes may occur in the absence of Ras and Raf activation, suggesting that MEK is activated by another MEK kinase. Haystead et al. (29Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Shirazi A. Fadden P. Mosse C. Dent P. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12804-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently identified a novel insulin-responsive MEK kinase (I-MEKK) in Wistar rat adipocytes. This kinase was distinct from Raf and showed rapid phasic kinetics in response to insulin but not phorbol ester. They have proposed that in adipocytes, I-MEKK may represent a divergence point between the insulin- and PKC-mediated signal transduction pathways. It remains unknown whether or not this new insulin-responsive MEK kinase is Ras-dependent. Although 3T3-L1 adipocytes are derived from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts as a result of differentiation, there are numerous distinctions between the two lines. The major difference, however, is that 3T3-L1 adipocytes are terminally differentiated, metabolically active, and non-dividing cells, whereas the 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are mitogenically active, growing, and propagating cells. Conceivably, with differentiation, the influence of insulin shifts to a different signaling cascade. It would be of great importance to investigate whether or not insulin activates MAP kinase via a Ras-independent pathway in other fully differentiated and metabolically active cells. Until this question is answered, one should exercise a great deal of caution in extrapolating results obtained in non-metabolically responsive cells (and/or non fully-differentiated cells) to metabolically active insulin target cells.

Heat shock proteins comprise a highly conserved set of polypeptides taking part in a number of protein folding processes such as the prevention of aggregation or premature protein folding, acceleration of the rate of polypeptide folding into the native state, and assembly or disassembly of oligomeric protein complexes (1Gething M.-J.

The levels of heat shock proteins are often increased after cellular stress, as observed in many disease states including ischemia, inflammation, oxidant and tissue injury, cardiac hypertrophy, fever, and cancer (3Morimoto R.I.

Members of the Hsp70 1The abbreviations used are: Hspheat shock proteinHscheat shock cognateDTTdithiothreitolBiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein. and Hsp60 protein family have been the most extensively studied heat shock proteins. Hsp70 isoforms are highly conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, with multiple and distinct members present in yeast and humans. Hsp70 proteins all have a highly conserved ATP-binding domain and a more divergent peptide-binding domain which may dictate substrate specificity (4Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J.

Although much research on the biochemical function of heat shock proteins has been centered on the putative role these proteins play in their interaction with non-native conformations of heat-denatured target proteins, there is a growing body of evidence implicating Hsp70 isoforms in interacting with native protein substrates. One of the first physiological roles observed for a heat shock protein family member was in the Hsc70-dependent dissociation of clathrin from coated vesicles (9Rothman J.E. Schmid S.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 5-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism is now known to involve first the binding of a DnaJ-box containing protein Auxilin to the native clathrin lattice and subsequent recruitment of Hsc70 (10Ungewickell E.

Auxilin is subsequently released while Hsc70 promotes disruption of clathrin-clathrin interactions causing triskelion release. A second Hsp70 homologue clearly involved in a physiological interaction with native protein complexes is the Escherichia coli DnaK protein. DnaK is essential for normal cellular physiology of E. coli (reviewed in 11Georgopoulos G.A. Ang D. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Morimoto R. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C.

Its role during bacteriophage λ DNA replication also requires the Hsp40 homologue, DnaJ protein, and involves their interaction with and dissociation of a native, oligomeric protein-protein complex at the λ origin of replication, thus catalyzing initiation of DNA synthesis. Similarly, DnaK and DnaJ proteins can together aid in dissociation of inactive RepA dimers into active monomers promoting initiation of P1 phage DNA replication. Importantly, DnaK and DnaJ proteins have been recently shown to bind not only to denatured polypeptide substrates, but to native bacteriophage replication proteins RepA and λ-P protein (15Wawrzynow A.

These results suggest that heat shock protein family members can recognize specific determinants on native polypeptides, although the specific domains involved in these interactions have not yet been defined. Intriguingly, members of the Hsp70 protein family have been shown to interact with the human tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb (17Nihei T. Takahashi S. Sagae S. Sato N. Kikuchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1702-1705PubMed Google Scholar), although the significance of these interactions is not clear. Earlier studies have shown that mutant p53, but not wild-type p53, bound to Hsp/c70 in tumor cell lines (18Pinhasi K.O. Michalovitz D. Ben Z.A. Oren M. Nature. 1986; 320: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Hinds P.W. Finlay C.A. Frey A.B. Levine A.J. Mol.

Cheng K. Frey A.B. Stein R. Hinds P.W. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent data also demonstrated that human Hsp40, the eukaryotic homologue of DnaJ, is also part of the complex of mutant p53 and Hsp/c70 (22Sugito K. Yamane M. Hattori H. Hayashi Y. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Tsuchida N. Ohtsuka K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutant p53 protein in tumor cell lines is often in an unfolded or denatured conformation as defined by expression of a normally hidden antibody epitope, PAb240 (23Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. Embo J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 24Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that the heat shock protein holoenzyme complexes may be recognizing unfolded domains on mutant p53 or may be promoting the unfolding of mutant p53 protein. Recently, a novel biochemical reaction was observed for an Hsp70 homologue; DnaK alone can mimic the action of mammalian protein kinases by interacting with and activating the latent sequence-specific DNA binding activity of wild-type human p53 protein (25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) without changing its tetramerization state, suggesting that the activation reaction has an allosteric component (26Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). DnaK protein cannot reactivate heat-denatured p53 (27Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating that the mechanism of activation of latent p53 is not related directly to the interaction of DnaK protein with a denatured substrate, as observed previously with RNA polymerase (28Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby DnaK protein can mimic the effects of protein kinases to activate latent p53 has not been addressed. We have localized a likely interaction site on human p53 protein for DnaK and compared the binding of eukaryotic members of the Hsp70 family to the same domain. Notably, three distinct isoforms of the stress 70 protein family cannot substitute for DnaK protein in the human p53 activation reaction. Further analysis of DnaK activation of murine p53 has led us to define two COOH-terminal domains on p53 which appear to be involved in the mediation of DnaK protein activation. These results underscore the likelihood that DnaK protein activation of latent p53 is similar to that of protein kinases and define a two-component biochemical system for studying the function of DnaK protein as it interacts with and changes the activity of a native protein substrate. Human Hsp70 and Hsc70 were expressed in E. coli and purified as published elsewhere (7Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recombinant hamster Grp78 expressed in E. coli and was obtained from StressGen Corp. Non-biotinylated peptides were obtained from Pfizer. A DnaK over-expressing strain was obtained from Dr. Maciej Zylicz, Gdansk, Poland. The cells were grown shaking in LB media at 30°C to an OD600 nm of 0.5, when they were quickly heat-shocked by 2-fold dilution in prewarmed (55°C) LB media. Subsequently, the incubation was continued for another 3 h at 42°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10% sucrose, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, to an O.D. equivalent to 150. The cell suspension was lysed for 45 min on ice by adding KCl to 0.25 M, DTT to 2 mM, lysozyme to 0.5 mg/ml, benzamidine to 1 mM, and leupeptin to 1 μg/ml. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and then loaded onto a Q50-Sepharose column at a protein (mg):resin (ml) ratio of 10:1. Bound protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 M KCl (in buffer B, containing 10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA). Fractions containing DnaK were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10% sucrose, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM benzamidine, and leupeptin to 1 μg/ml (buffer A). Dialyzed protein was applied to an ATP-agarose column (Sigma A-2767) in buffer A at a protein (mg):resin (ml) ratio of 20:1. After washing in buffer A containing 1 M KCl and equilibration in buffer A, DnaK was eluted in buffer A containing 10 mM ATP. Recombinant human p53 was expressed in BL21 E. coli cells at room temperature using a T7 expression system (29Midgley C.A. Fischer C.J. Bartek J. Vojtesek B. Lane D. Barnes D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which latent p53 tetramers were purified from soluble lysates (25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). p53 was purified by a modification of a published protocol (37Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, human p53 was purified using heparin-Sepharose (Hi-Trap, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), phosphocellulose (P-11, Whatmann), and Superose-12 (Pharmacia) column chromatography. Murine wild-type p53 was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as described for human p53 (37Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Murine wild-type p53 and the point mutant Ala-309 were also expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9 cells) as described elsewhere (27Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein was purified using heparin-Sepharose (Hi-Trap, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with a linear KCl gradient from 0.1 to 1 M KCl in buffer B. Peptides used in this assay were purified and obtained from Chiron Mimotopes and contain a biotin group at the Nh2 terminus linked to the amino acid sequence SGSG. Peptides are 15-mers representing the linear amino acid sequence of human or murine p53. DnaK (1.5 μM) was incubated with 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM peptide in reaction buffer (15% glycerol, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP) for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were run on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel at 50 V for 3 h, then blotted onto nitrocellulose as described (30Harlow E. Lane D.P. J. Cell Sci. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 479-504Google Scholar) and the peptides were detected with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Sigma) and ECL (Amersham). p53 protein (12 ng) was incubated in 10 μl of a buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100) with casein kinase II from rabbit muscle (31Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or recombinant human casein kinase II obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (0.1 milliunit). Incubations were performed for the indicated times at 30°C and reactions were added to 10 μl of DNA binding buffer containing radioactive target DNA as described below. Binding conditions are described in detail elsewhere (25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA binding buffer contained 20% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the specific p53 consensus site (25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 32El Deiry W. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ32-P]ATP and used with a 20-fold excess of supercoiled nonspecific, non-labeled competitor DNA (pBluescript II SK+, Stratagene). Incubations of p53 with DnaK or peptide were performed for 30 min at 30°C in a 10-μl reaction buffer. Then 10 μl of DNA binding buffer containing 5 ng of labeled p53 consensus site and 100 ng of pBluescript were added to the reaction mixture, incubated on ice for 30 min, loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, and run at temperatures from 4°C to 12°C. For the quantification of the radioactive signals a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) was used. DnaK can activate latent, wild-type, and some mutant forms of p53 protein for sequence-specific DNA binding (31Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is undefined, it is clear that the tetramerization status of p53 is preserved after activation, indicating that DnaK does not dissociate tetramers into smaller units (26Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). DnaK activation of p53 also requires energy in the form of heat, as the reaction cannot proceed at 0°C (see below). In addition, DnaK partner proteins DnaJ and GrpE are not required for this interaction, 2S. Hansen, C. A. Midgley, D. P. Lane, B. C. Freeman, R. I. Morimoto, and T. R. Hupp, unpublished observations. reducing the likelihood that substrate targeting and turnover, putatively associated with GrpE and DnaJ function, are required for DnaK function in this system. Given the simplicity of the two-component activation reaction driven by DnaK protein, studying the mechanism of p53 interaction with DnaK may not only provide insight into how p53 protein activity is altered by interacting proteins, but it may give insight into the mechanism whereby DnaK interacts with a native protein substrate. Modification of a COOH-terminal negative regulatory domain on latent p53 has been shown to trigger the activation of DNA binding by other proteins. Binding of the monoclonal antibody PAb421 or phosphorylation by either casein kinase II, protein kinase C, or cdc2/cyclins can activate latent p53 (25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 33Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), whereas the monoclonal antibody ICA-9 binding to the casein kinase II site can reverse the activation (37Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). As the target site for activation of p53 by DnaK has not been determined, we investigated a possible interaction of DnaK with the COOH-terminal regulatory domain. A series of synthetic peptides was screened for the ability to interfere with the activation of human p53 DNA binding by DnaK. Reactions were divided into two stages by first incubating p53 and DnaK in the absence or presence of synthetic peptides at 30°C and then assaying for sequence-specific DNA binding at 0°C. Synthetic peptide 379-393 derived from the COOH terminus of p53 competed effectively with DnaK (Fig. 1A, lanes 8-10 versus lane 3). The concentration of DnaK in the reaction was 1.4 μM and the amount of peptide required for 50% inhibition of DnaK activity in this assay was approximately 0.5-1 μM. These results suggest that DnaK protein targets the COOH-terminal domain of p53. In addition, the requirement for stoichiometric amounts of inhibitory peptide suggest that, although DnaK protein is required in a 50-fold molar excess over p53 protein, inhibition of most of the DnaK is required to block p53 activation. The requirement for high levels of DnaK protein may depend on an altered conformation of DnaK at higher protein concentrations, as in one biochemical system, it is the absolute DnaK protein concentration and not the molar ratio of DnaK to its substrate that dictates chaperone activity (38Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the specific activity of Hsp70 isoforms may be sensitive to changes in their conformation or oligomeric structure (39Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition by peptide 379-393 is specific for DnaK since PAb421 (Fig. 1, lanes 5-7 versus lane 2) and casein kinase II (lanes 11-13 versus lane 4) activation of p53 were not blocked by this peptide. Peptide 379-393 was unable to compete with casein kinase II activation of p53 despite harboring the phosphorylation site for this kinase. Short synthetic peptides containing the casein kinase II phosphorylation site of p53 have only a relatively weak homology to the defined consensus motif of the casein kinase II site and have previously been shown to be ineffective as substrates for this enzyme.2 Additional structural determinants within the p53 homotetramer may contribute to casein kinase II specificity. The inability of a flanking peptide harboring the PAb421 antibody epitope (40Stephen C.W. Helminen P. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 58-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (peptide 369-383) to compete with DnaK activation indicates that peptides at stoichiometric concentrations do not in general inhibit the biochemical function of DnaK in this reaction (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). Peptide 369-383 is, however, biochemically active as it did inhibit p53 activation by PAb421 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Peptide 374-388 was also effective in competing with DnaK activation of p53 (Fig. 1C, lanes 6-9 versus lane 1). Together, these data indicate that amino acids 389-393 and 374-378 do not contribute to DnaK specificity while amino acids 379-388 play an important role in p53 recognition by DnaK (Fig. 7). Thus, this suggests that one important step in DnaK activation of p53 involves an interaction with a motif situated in between the casein kinase II and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. We examined whether the synthetic peptides derived from the COOH terminus of p53 were inhibiting activation of p53 protein by DnaK due to direct binding to DnaK. A slightly different subset of peptides was chosen for this analysis in order to define a minimal site of interaction. DnaK and the respective peptides were co-incubated at 30°C, bound peptide was separated in a native polyacrylamide gel assay, and analyzed by Western blot via streptavidin binding to the biotinylated peptides (Fig. 2). DnaK did not interact with peptide 366-380, but showed weak binding to peptide 371-385, thus amino acids 381-385 define an important component of the DnaK binding site. Peptide 376-390 formed a stoichiometric complex with DnaK and exhibited the strongest binding to DnaK. The peptide 379-393 bound weaker to DnaK, as the presence of the last three acidic amino acids in the peptide may reduce the stability of complex formation with DnaK. Therefore, the last few amino acids do not contribute to the DnaK binding site, but rather seem to reduce binding. This is consistent with the fact that DnaK is a more potent activator of latent p53 protein when the final four amino acids are removed (41Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18165-18174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and that peptide 379-393 has a slightly reduced inhibitory activity toward DnaK in comparison with peptide 374-388 (Fig. 1C, lane 4 versus lane 8). Together, these results indicate that DnaK can form a stable and stoichiometric complex with specific p53 peptides and refine assignment of the DnaK interaction site on p53 protein to amino acids 381-388 (Fig. 7). Bacterial DnaK belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family and is very homologous to its human members (Table I). Although Hsp70 homologues can exhibit quite distinct substrate specificities (6Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), peptides that bind to bacterial DnaK with a high affinity contain some similar hydrophobic properties that match the consensus binding sequence for some mammalian heat shock proteins (4Blond-Elguindi S.

Biol. 1994; 241: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that some conservation of substrate specificity may exist. As such, we investigated whether mammalian Hsp70 isoforms can also bind directly to peptides derived from the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of human p53. Hsp70 family members studied include Grp78, Hsc70, and Hsp70 (see below).Table I.Interaction of Hsp70 isoforms with COOH-terminal peptides of p53Heat shock proteinSimilarity to DnaKIdentity to DnaKBinding to p53 COOH-terminal peptides366-380371-385376-390379-393%DnaK100100−+++++++Human Hsc7066.849.0−++++++++Human Hsp7066.950.1−++/−+/−Human Grp78/BiP69.251.2−−−−(hamster)Human Grp7575.060.4NDaND, not determined.NDNDNDa ND, not determined.

Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). An affinity panning approach of peptide libraries in bacteriophages has identified an optimal heptameric motif for the molecular chaperone BiP with a high content of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids (4Blond-Elguindi S.

Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Recombinant hamster Grp78 (BiP), however, did not show any binding to our COOH-terminal p53 peptides (Table I). The 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, Hsc70, is a constitutive member of the Hsp70 family found in the nucleus and cytosol, just like stress-induced Hsp70 (1Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Human Hsp70 and Hsc70 proteins have been well characterized biochemically with respect to their ability to interact with denatured protein substrates (7Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although human Hsp70 protein did not bind to the COOH-terminal p53 peptides (Table I), human Hsc70 protein exhibited strong binding to the same peptides as observed with DnaK (Fig. 3). However, Hsc70 protein binding to the COOH-terminal p53 peptides was less avid than that observed for DnaK, which has been inferred previously, based on the relative ability of a COOH-terminal p53 peptide to compete with bovine Hsc70 and DnaK protein binding to unfolded lactalbumin (6Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of this conserved interaction of DnaK and Hsc70 with the COOH-terminal p53 peptide is not yet clear. Evidence that mammalian Hsp/c70 proteins may modulate the p53 pathway comes from the observation that overexpression of Hsc70 protein can suppress focus formation of rat fibroblasts induced by mutant p53 plus ras or myc plus ras (45Yehiely F. Oren M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian Hsc70/Hsp70 binds to mutant p53 synthesized in reticulocyte lysates unless the COOH-terminal 28 amino acids have been removed (46Hainaut P. Milner J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that one interaction site for human Hsc70 protein may reside in the p53 protein COOH terminus and that human Hsp70 does not interact similarly. Despite the similarity of Hsc70 and DnaK in binding to COOH-terminal human p53 peptides, Hsc70 was not able to substitute for DnaK in activating latent human or murine p53 for DNA binding (data not shown). This suggests that: 1) another factor may be required to function in concert with Hsc70 to activate p53 protein; 2) that the reduced affinity of Hsc70 is sufficient to preclude activation of p53 protein; 3) that DnaK protein has at least one other recognition site on p53, and 4) DnaK activation is not directly related to binding to the COOH-terminal region.

Improved methods for the chemotherapeutic manipulation of parasitic diseases depends upon the exploitation of fundamental metabolic or biochemical differences between the parasite and the mammalian host. Basic investigations of metabolic pathways in parasitic protozoa have been hampered by the inability to select directly for mutants genetically defective in some component of the metabolic pathway. This impediment has been circumvented in part by the implementation of DNA transfection methods that now permit the genetic engineering of trypanosomatid chromosomes by targeted gene replacement (1Cruz A.

Protozool. 1991; 38: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the finding that genes can be efficiently targeted by homologous recombination has created new avenues for mutationally altering parasites that lack specific gene sequences, thereby enabling direct assessment of gene function. The protocols for the generation of knockout parasites have routinely involved the sequential replacement of both alleles of a genetic locus with two different targeting constructs, each containing flanking regions from the targeted gene encompassing independent selectable markers. Although double targeted gene replacement has permitted the construction of a variety of knockout mutants in both Leishmania (6Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parasitol. 1994; 67: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the process for generating these strains is both time-consuming and laborious, and the restricted number of available drug resistance markers limits the introduction of multiple homozygous mutations within a single parasite population for biochemical and cellular studies. These barriers can be surmounted in part by the creation of homozygous knockout strains using only a single targeting construct. Such a strategy has been exploited in mammalian cell lines by selecting for loss-of-heterozygosity after a single round of gene targeting by increased drug pressure (18Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The purine salvage pathway offers an excellent opportunity to examine whether Leishmania express the metabolic machinery to undergo loss-of-heterozygosity, because several purine salvage enzymes metabolize cytotoxic purine analogs, thereby affording a powerful negative selection scheme to detect the phenomenon. These enzymes include hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) 1The abbreviations used are: HGPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferaseAPRTadenine phosphoribosyltransferaseneorneomycin phosphotransferase genehygrhygromycin phosphotransferase geneHPP4-hydroxypyrazolopyrimidine or allopurinolAPP4-aminopyrazolopyrimidinePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s). and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), which initiate the metabolism of 4-hydroxypyrazolopyrimidine (HPP, allopurinol) and 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine (APP), respectively (19Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both HPP and APP are toxic to Leishmania spp. at relatively low concentrations (9Iovannisci D.M.

We now describe the generation of homozygous null mutants of both hgprt and aprt in Leishmania donovani by targeted gene replacement using only a single targeting construct. The construct is used to target the first allele by transfection, and the loss of the wild type allele from the functional heterozygote is selected directly in a subversive substrate of the encoded gene product. Recently, Guerios-Filho and Beverley have demonstrated that loss-of-heterozygosity can also occur at the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) locus of Leishmania major (23Gueiros-Filho F.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5655-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). [8-14C]Hypoxanthine, [8-14C]guanine, and [8-14C]adenine, all at 45-60 mCi/mmol, were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1320 Ci/mmol) were acquired from DuPont NEN. All restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were bought from either Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs, and Thermus flavus DNA polymerase was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). The pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG vectors that encompass the neomycin phosphotransferase (neor) and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hygr) genes, respectively, were generously provided by Dr. Stephen Beverley (Harvard Medical School). Probes encompassing neor and hygr were obtained by excision of pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG with BamHI/SpeI and SpeI alone, respectively. A probe for the α-tubulin gene (α-tubulin) from Leishmania enriettii was kindly provided by Dr. Scott Landfear of the Oregon Health Sciences University (Portland, OR). Geneticin (G418), hygromycin, HPP, and APP were all obtained from Sigma. The sources of all other materials, chemicals, and reagents employed in these experiments have been reported previously and were of the highest purity commercially available. L. donovani promastigotes were cultivated in completely defined DME-L culture medium (24Iovannisci D. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Single cell cloning of parasites was carried out in semi-solid DME-L medium as reported (24Iovannisci D. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The DI700 cell line is a wild type clone of the Sudanese 1S strain of L. donovani that was used as the initial recipient strain for transfections. For the purposes of the genetic manipulations reported in this report the DI700 cell line is denoted H+/+A+/+, where H refers to HGPRT, A to APRT, and + is the wild type allele. Sensitivities of wild type and mutant strains to G418, hygromycin, HPP, and APP were determined as described (9Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L. donovani genomic DNA and plasmid DNA were isolated by standard protocols (25Wilson K. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Stringer J.R. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1665-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Quantitative densitometry was performed with a Molecular Dynamics Phosphoimager SI driven by Molecular Dynamics Scanner software (version 1.0). IP Lab Gel (version 1.5g) analysis software was used to calculate the density of each band. In all samples, the intensity of the hybridization signals obtained with probes from the hgprt and aprt loci and to neor and hygr were normalized to the intensity of the α-tubulin band of the same sample, and the results were expressed as corrected arbitrary units. Primers employed in the amplification of 5′- and 3′-flanking segments of the L. donovani hgprt and aprt by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are shown and named with their restriction enzyme sites underlined: 5′H5′, 5′-TCTAAGCTTGCGACCGGAGATCACGCACCT-3′; 5′H3′, 5′-TCTGTCGACGCATGGAGCAATGTCAGGAGA-3′; 3′H5′, 5′-TCTCCCGGGCGATGGAAGGGGTGAGACCGCCGT-3′; 3′H3′, 5′-TCTAGATCTACGAAACCTTTACAACTGTGGGT-3′; 5′A5′, 5′-TCTAAGCTTGGACGGCAGAGATACGCCAGACG-3′; 5′A3′, 5′-TCTGTCGACAACTAAGCGGACAAGAGCGTAAG-3′; 3′A5′, 5′-TAACCCGGGAGCAACTCCTTCAGTCCTTCTC-3′; ′A3′, 5′-GAAGATCTCATCAGCGGCGGGGACACAGAG-3′. The hgprt (21Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and aprt (22Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) genes were originally isolated from a cosmid library of L. donovani DNA and subcloned as 3.5-kb EcoRI and 5.4-kb BamHI-XbaI fragments in pBluescript KS+, respectively. 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the hgprt and aprt genes were then identified by restriction mapping and Southern blotting and amplified by PCR for subcloning into the targeting vectors. PCR primers for amplifying the 3′-flanking regions of the hgprt were determined from nucleotide sequence information obtained from the 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment. The PCR primers for the hgprt 5′-flanking region were determined from a 5.2-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment that was isolated from the cosmid clone from which hgprt was cloned. PCR primers for subcloning both 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the aprt were determined after mapping and sequencing appropriate segments of the 5.4-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment from the aprt-containing cosmid. Standard PCR conditions (10-15 cycles; 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 90 s) for amplification of plasmid DNA sequences were employed (21Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense primers used in the PCR were 5′H5′ and 5′H3′ for the 1.7-kb hgprt 5′-flanking region, 3′H5′ and 3′H3′ for the 1.8-kb hgprt 3′-flanking region, 5′A5′ and 5′A3′ for the 1.4-kb aprt 5′-flanking region, and 3′A5′ and 3′A3′ for the 1.5-kb aprt 3′-flanking region. PCR products for the flanking regions of hgprt and aprt were separated on agarose gels, purified using the GeneClean Kit (Intermountain Scientific Corp., Bountiful, UT), digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into the pertinent sites of the pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG plasmids, respectively. Each of the two flanking regions of both loci were ligated sequentially into the appropriate vectors containing the drug resistance markers. The final vector constructs employed for allelic replacement were designated pX63-NEO-Δhgprt and pX63-HYG-Δaprt, respectively. All plasmid constructs were purified as described (25Wilson K. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Stringer J.R. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1665-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and checked for identity and orientation by nucleotide sequencing. Parasites were transfected by electroporation using conditions fundamentally identical to those previously described (6Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The deletion constructs were cleaved with HindIII and BglII prior to electroporation to liberate the linear targeting fragment from pX63-NEO-Δhgprt and pX63-HYG-Δaprt. Linearized targeting DNAs were designated on the basis of the nomenclature of the plasmid from which they were excised, without the initial letter; X63-NEO-Δhgprt from pX63-NEO-Δhgprt and X63-HYG-Δaprt from pX63-HYG-Δaprt. Cells after transfection were maintained in liquid medium for 24 h prior to selection. To isolate hgprt heterozygotes, wild type cells were transfected with X63-NEO-Δhgprt and selected on plates containing 16 μg/ml G418. aprt heterozygotes were generated after transfection with X63-HYG-Δaprt and isolated on plates containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 16 μg/ml G418. Heterozygosity was established by Southern blotting using appropriate probes. To obtain null mutants of hgprt and aprt, the appropriate heterozygotes were selected in 1 mM HPP (containing 16 μg/ml G418) or 100 μM APP (containing 16 μg/ml G418, 1 mM HPP, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin). All mutant strains created by targeted gene replacement were maintained in medium containing the drugs from which it and its progenitors had been selected. L. donovani cell pellets containing 2 × 109 parasites were extracted by sonication in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. 0.5% Triton X-100 was added to the lysis buffer, as HGPRT activity in Leishmania is associated with a particulate fraction (27Hassan H.F. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 81B: 1037-1040Google Scholar). Cell supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 35 min at 4°C and processed as described (19Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HGPRT and APRT enzymatic activities were measured as described (28Allen T. Henschel E.V. Coons T. Cross L. Conley J. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Recombinant L. donovani HGPRT and APRT were purified by affinity chromatography as reported (21Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to purified L. donovani HGPRT and APRT were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by conventional protocols (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Promastigotes were lysed by in SDS sample buffer, and 20,000 × g cell supernatants were prepared by centrifugation. Lysates from 2 × 106 cells were loaded onto each lane, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad), and Western blot analysis was performed by standard methodologies (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The stratagem for the derivation of hgprt and aprt null mutants by a combination of targeted gene replacement and direct selection in cytotoxic substrate is displayed in Fig. 1. Starting with the DI700 wild type H+/+A+/+ strain, a single wild type hgprt allele was disrupted by targeted gene replacement using the X63-NEO-Δhgprt construct (shown in Fig. 2B) to generate the hgprt heterozygote, H+/nA+/+. The homozygous null mutant of hgprt, Hn/nA+/+, was then obtained from the H+/nA+/+ heterozygote line by direct negative selection in 1.0 mM HPP, a subversive substrate of the L. donovani HGPRT (19Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with amply demonstrated antileishmanial properties (20Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Hn/nA+/+ cell line was then transfected with the aprt knockout construct X63-HYG-Δaprt (shown in Fig. 2E) to produce the aprt heterozygote, Hn/nA+/h, within the hgprt− genetic background. Finally, the aprt heterozygote was subjected to selective pressure in 100 μM APP, a cytotoxic substrate of the L. donovani APRT (9Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tuttle J.V. Krenitsky T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to generate the hgprt−, aprt− double knockout mutant Hn/nAh/h.Fig. 2Restriction maps of the hgprt and aprt genomic loci, the plasmid constructs used in the targeted gene replacements, and the novel alleles encompassing the drug resistance cassettes. Figure shows restriction maps of the wild type hgprt locus (A), the X63-NEO-Δhgprt targeting construct (B), the neor-replaced hgprt locus after homologous recombination with the X63-NEO-Δhgprt construct (C), the wild type aprt locus (D), the X63-HYG-Δaprt targeting construct (E), and the hygr-targeted aprt locus obtained after replacement by X63-HYG-Δaprt (F). Expected restriction fragment sizes from the hgprt locus after digestion with EcoRI or from the aprt locus after digestion with BamHI/SalI are marked. The positions of probe A from the hgprt coding region, probe B from the 3′ flank of hgprt, probe C from the aprt coding region, and probe D from the 5′ flank of aprt are shown under the appropriate genomic loci. hgprt and aprt coding regions are indicated by the black rectangles, whereas corresponding 5′- and 3′-flanking regions that were amplified by PCR to create the gene targeting constructs are indicated by the lightly shaded rectangles. The antibiotic resistance markers, neor and hygr, are indicated by the white boxes and designated by neo and hyg, respectively, and the corresponding pX-based flanking regions from the L. major dhfr-ts are indicated by the gray shaded boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from wild type and mutant strains confirmed the existence of the new alleles that had been created after a single round of gene targeting followed by direct selection for loss of the second wild type allele (Figs. 3, 4, 5). The maps of the genomic loci of hgprt and aprt and the novel alleles created by homologous recombination of the X63-NEO-Δhgprt and X63-HYG-Δaprt constructs into the hgprt and aprt loci, as well as the restriction fragments employed in the Southern blot experiments, are shown in Fig. 2. The differences in the new hgprt alleles can be observed in Fig. 3. The disrupted hgprt allele could be distinguished from the wild type allele by an altered EcoRI restriction pattern (Fig. 3). After digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI and hybridization to probe B (shown in Fig. 2A) corresponding to a portion of the 3′-flanking region of hgprt, only the expected 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the wild type allele was observed in the wild type H+/+A+/+ cell line (Fig. 3A, probe B). It should be noted that the 4.6-kb EcoRI restriction fragment corresponds to the expected size of the wild type hgprt allele even though the original hgprt clone was isolated as a 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment from a cosmid (21Allen T.E. Hwang H.-Y. Jardim A. Olafson R. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, fine mapping of the cosmid indicated that the 3′ EcoRI restriction site of the original 3.5-kb EcoRI insert was located within the cosmid DNA sequence. In contrast, a band of 6.4-kb (Fig. 3A, probe B) was observed in all strains in which the wild type hgprt allele had been disrupted by X63-NEO-Δhgprt. The cell line heterozygous for hgprt, H+/nA+/+, also retained a copy of the wild type hgprt allele, as illustrated by the presence of the 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment derived from the wild type locus (Fig. 3A, probe B). The Hn/nA+/+ strain generated by selection of H+/nA+/+ cells in HPP (Fig. 1), as well as its progeny, i.e. the Hn/nA+/h and Hn/nAh/h cell lines, did not display the wild type 4.6-kb EcoRI band and revealed only the expected 6.4-kb displacement by X63-NEO-Δhgprt (Fig. 3A, probe B). The losses of the wild type hgprt alleles by targeting and then selection were verified further by hybridization of genomic DNA from the five cell lines to probe A encompassing the protein coding portion of hgprt (Fig. 3A, probe A). The 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment from the wild type allele was observed only in the H+/+A+/+ and H+/nA+/+ cells and not in the Hn/nA+/+, Hn/nA+/h, and Hn/nAh/h lines (Fig. 3, probe A).Fig. 4Hypoxanthine and adenine phosphoribosylation assays by L. donovani cell extracts.

Densitometric ratios of the signal intensities from the 4.6 EcoRI band hybridized to either probe A (A/T) or probe B (Bu/T) to that obtained with genomic DNA hybridized to α-tubulin (see Fig. 3A) were 0.273 and 0.115 (A/T) and 0.105 and 0.044 (Bu/T) for the H+/+A+/+ and H+/nA+/+ cell lines, respectively.Table IQuantitative densitometry of hybridization signals of wild type and mutant L. donovani that have been created by targeted gene replacementCell lineBand relative densitometric ratioA/TBl/TBu/TC/TDl/TDu/TN/TH/TH+/+A+/+0.2730.10500.6840.0050.6770.0480H+/nA+/+0.1150.0440.1320.80200.8161.1060Hn/nA+/+000.1700.78500.7091.0810Hn/nA+/h000.1530.5020.2630.4521.0160.118Hn/nAh/h000.1570.0160.64301.3290.251 Open table in a new tab Disruption of the aprt locus in the Hn/nA+/h and Hn/nAh/h cell lines that were targeted by X63-HYG-Δaprt was also authenticated by Southern blotting (Fig. 3B). Digestion of genomic DNA with SalI/BamHI and hybridization to either probe C from the aprt coding region or probe D derived from the aprt 5′-flanking region (Fig. 2D) revealed the presence of the 3.5-kb SalI/BamHI restriction fragment from the wild type allele in H+/+A+/+, H+/nA+/+, Hn/nA+/+, and Hn/nA+/h cells (Fig. 3B, probes C and D). A new allele corresponding to the integration of the X63-HYG-Δaprt drug resistance cassette into the wild type aprt locus was detected in the Hn/nA+/h and Hn/nAh/h cell lines (Fig. 3B, probe D). Only a 1.4-kb SalI fragment is detected in SalI/BamHI restricted DNA from Hn/nAh/h cells after hybridization to probe D (Fig. 3B, probe D), while the Hn/nA+/h presumptive heterozygote contained both the 3.5- and 1.4-kb bands (Fig. 3B, probe D). The disruption of the wild type aprt alleles was confirmed by hybridization of the same blot with probe C (Fig. 2B) obtained from the aprt coding region. The 3.5-kb wild type SalI/BamHI fragment was observed in all cell lines, except Hn/nAh/h (Fig. 3B, probe C). Quantitative densitometry of the autoradiograms probed with aprt fragments and with the α-tubulin probe (Fig. 3B, α-tubulin probe) confirmed the sequential allelic replacements (Table I).

This supported the concept that the gelatinases may be thought of as type IV collagenases (17Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Robey P.G. Abe S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The interactions of cells with extracellular matrix components are largely mediated by the integrin family of receptors, which are transmembrane heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of non-covalently associated α and β subunits (18Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar). Cellular adhesion to type IV collagen occurs mainly via the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Kühn K. Eble J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 256-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The recognition sites for α1β1 and α2β1 within collagen IV have been located in the immediate vicinity of the gelatinase A cleavage site, about 100 nm from the N terminus of the molecules. This region is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds between the three α(IV) chains and can be isolated as a triple-helical cyanogen bromide fragment, CB3[IV], allowing detailed studies of the structure of the conformation dependent recognition sites (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Because of the close vicinity of the gelatinase A cleavage site to the recognition sites for α1β1 and α2β1 binding, the question arose as to whether gelatinase A treatment impairs the ability of collagen IV to interact with α1β1 and α2β1. We therefore incubated different collagen IV preparations, isolated from the murine Engelbreth-Holm Swarm (EHS) tumor and from human placenta, with gelatinase A and subsequently investigated the degradation products and their ability to bind cell-associated and purified α1β1 and α2β1. Collagen IV molecules, in which the stabilizing intramolecular disulfide bonds within the CB3[IV] region had been reduced, were cleaved at 25°C to 30°C by gelatinase A into the two characteristic fragments 100 and 300 nm long (9Fessler L.I. Duncan K.G. Fessler J.H. Salo T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9783-9789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to bind α1β1 and α2β1 was, however, hardly impaired by this enzyme treatment. Incubation at 37°C destroyed the molecules completely. Collagen IV molecules with intact disulfide bonds in the CB3[IV] region were more stable to cleavage with gelatinase A. At 30°C no cleavage could be observed, but at 37°C the molecules were not only split at the gelatinase A-specific cleavage site, but also slowly degraded from the C-terminal end of the triple-helical domain. However, the ability to interact with the two integrins α1β1 and α2β1 remained unchanged. Their recognition sites seemed to be especially stabilized by the intramolecular disulfide bonds of the CB3[IV] region.DISCUSSIONThe CB3[IV] region of collagen IV is of special interest. It is the only segment of the triple-helical domain that is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds, and it contains the recognition sites for the integrins α1β1 and α2β1 (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since it has been observed that the triple-helical domain of collagen IV can be cleaved by bacterial collagenase (4Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and by a collagen IV-specific tumor collagenase in the immediate vicinity of the N-terminal region of CB3[IV] (9Fessler L.I. Duncan K.G. Fessler J.H. Salo T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9783-9789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated to what extent the capacity of collagen IV to bind α1β1 and α2β1 is modified by treatment with gelatinase A.The ability of a 68-kDa metalloproteinase to cleave collagen IV into two fragments was first shown by Sato et al. (11Salo T. Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3058-3063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fessler et al. (9Fessler L.I. Duncan K.G. Fessler J.H. Salo T. Tryggvason K.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9783-9789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who treated cell-derived native collagen IV molecules at 35°C with a partially purified enzyme from metastatic mouse PMT sarcoma. Both gelatinase A (MMP2) and gelatinase B (MMP9) have been reported to cleave EHS-derived type IV preparations into two fragments, comprising one and three quarters of the intact molecule under specific conditions (12Collier I.E.

Activity always appeared to be temperature-sensitive, although to different degrees, ranging from negligible activity at 30°C to rapid and complete degradation at 37°C (16Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 29Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21929-21934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed a rapid transition from no detectable cleavage of EHS type IV at 30°C to complete breakdown at 37°C, with little detection of distinct intermediates.To initiate our study, we reassessed the action of gelatinase A against type IV collagen in our laboratories. Although most type IV collagen is prepared from the EHS tumor in ostensibly the same way, in the presence of reducing agents (22Kleinman H.K. McGarvey L.M. Liotta L.A. Gehron-Robey P. Tryggvason K. Martin G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) we have found that the extent of reformation of the disulfide bonds may vary from that seen in preparation A (unstable) to that in preparation B (stable). In our experience, commercial preparations of EHS-derived type IV collagen are similar to ours and can vary significantly in the extent of disulfide bonding. In collagen IV preparations, which are more like the native protein with intramolecular disulfide bridges within CB3[IV], the temperature of the specific gelatinase cleavage would be shifted to higher temperatures.During preparation of collagen IV from human placenta and other tissues, bacterial collagenase preferentially cleaves the collagen IV network at an N-terminal site, close to the CB3[IV] region. Following this treatment, dimeric molecules can be extracted from the tissue. Dimers in solution are susceptible to further attack by bacterial collagenase. 2A. Ries and K. Kühn, unpublished data. From these results one may assume that the C-terminal three quarters of type IV collagen are particularly protected by the supermolecular structure of collagen IV and that the cleavage site N-terminal to CB3[IV] is more exposed to proteolytic attack and thus may also be accessible to cells. Similarly in the case of soluble collagen IV, this particular region will be preferentially cleaved under mild conditions by bacterial collagenase and gelatinase A. Our data show that the status of the disulfide bonds within the CB3[IV] region and the NC1 domain may be critical in the conformational stability of soluble type IV collagen and hence in gelatinase A susceptibility. Thus, at 30°C gelatinase A cleaved the monomeric molecules of preparation A, N-terminal to CB3[IV] into the typical one and three quarter fragments. At 37°C the molecules were completely degraded. In molecules of preparation B with the disulfide-stabilized CB3[IV] region, specific cleavage of this area was shifted to higher temperatures, and in addition, at 37°C, further digestion from the N terminus prevented. Under these conditions, however, a slow digestion of the triple-helical molecule from the C terminus was observed. In contrast, dimeric collagen molecules were found to be completely stable against gelatinase at 37°C. Here both ends of the triple helix are sealed: the N terminus by CB3[IV], and the C terminus by the hexameric NC1 complex formed by end-to-end aggregation of two molecules (4Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 6Siebold B. Qian R.-Q. Glanville R.W. Hofmann H. Deutzmann R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).It is striking that gelatinase A, in contrast to bacterial collagenase, is unable to attack the triple-helical domain of the dimeric collagen at 37°C, although the triple helix, in particular in the neighborhood of non-triple-helical interruptions, should be relaxed at this temperature. This may in part be caused by the different specificity of the two enzymes. In the relaxed regions, bacterial collagenase attacks all Pro-Gly and Hyp-Gly bonds, which occur frequently along the α chains. Gelatinase A cleaves mainly between Gly and X, if position X is occupied by hydrophobic or polar charged residues. However, not all of these bonds are sensitive; in addition, hydroxyproline in position Y prevents gelatinase A cleavage of the Gly-X bond. Thus, bacterial collagenase will find many more cleavable peptide bonds in a given relaxed region than gelatinase A and is therefore able to attack collagen IV at lower temperatures. Neither gelatinase nor bacterial collagenase are able to cleave peptide bonds protected in an intact triple helix. Between 10 and 15°C, collagen I molecules in solution are not attacked within the triple-helical domain. Digestion occurs slowly via the relaxed ends and stops in polar regions with low numbers of Pro-Gly bonds (34Stark M. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).It is an open question whether the recognition sites of the CB3[IV] region, which have been characterized using collagen molecules in solution, are accessible when incorporated into the macromolecular network. The data observed on the resistance or sensitivity of the different collagen IV preparations to gelatinase A relative to bacterial collagenase allow some conclusions to be drawn on the proteolytic sensitivity of type IV collagen in vivo. Collagen IV molecules in the native network seemed to be well protected against proteolysis. Only the 60-nm-long stretch between the N-terminal region of the molecules, involved in overlapping intermolecular aggregation, and the CB3[IV] region appears to be sensitive to proteolytic attack (4Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). It is interesting that this stretch is rich in non-triple-helical interruptions (33Brazel D. Pollner R. Oberbäumer I. Kühn K. Eur J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether gelatinase A alone can cleave at this site when collagen is incorporated into a network is not clear and has to be proven. One has to take into account that in vivo gelatinase A will be accompanied by other MMPs, which will broaden the specificity and increase the probability of cleavage. It is notable that both stromelysin-1 and collagenase- 3 can cleave type IV collagen more efficiently than the gelatinases (30Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3V. Knäuper and G. Murphy, unpublished data.We investigated the effect of gelatinase A on the integrin binding ability of collagen IV, which is located in the CB3[IV] region. The susceptibility of these sites conformed precisely to that of the proteolysis study in that α2β1 and to some extent α1β1 integrin binding were only lost upon gelatinase A cleavage of the reduced preparation A and remained viable after digestion of preparation B or dimers. Bacterial collagenase cleaved type IV collagen such that these sites also remained intact. Its central region between the two disulfide knots, comprising the α1β1 recognition site with a denaturation temperature of 50°C (20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), remained stable against gelatinase A. In contrast, the somewhat relaxed triple-helical end regions of F1 were partly digested. Thus the N-terminal recognition site of α2β1 was removed under these conditions. Since the second, C-terminal site of F1 was still intact, binding of α2β1 was reduced only slightly.The question arose as to whether the results obtained with isolated integrin reflected the situation occurring in cell attachment to collagen IV. We addressed this point using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and a rat glioblastoma cell line RuGLi, since these lines have been shown to interact with collagen IV via the integrins α2β1 and α1β1, respectively (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Other integrins expressed by these cells did not seem to be involved. The results of the cell attachment assays supported the data from the integrin binding experiments.This resistance of the integrin recognition sites against proteolytic attack may have some implications for in vivo situations, e.g. for the penetration of tumor cells through basement membranes. The receptors α1β1 and α2β1 at the surface of cells may remain occupied by the resistant recognition sites even when the collagen IV network is largely degraded. They may thus prevent further interaction of cells with intact molecules of the surrounding macromolecular network and may modify the ability of the cells to move through basement membranes. On the other hand, one could speculate that excessive amounts of protease-resistant recognition sites may inhibit invasion by blocking too many of the integrin sites needed for adhesion and migration. INTRODUCTIONGelatinase A treatment of reduced and denatured CB3[IV] showed many susceptible peptide bonds. Disulfide-stabilized triple-helical CB3[IV] could only be cleaved at the N and C termini, where partial unraveling of the helix had occurred. We conclude that gelatinase A is unlikely to significantly cleave the intact, stabilized triple-helical region of CB3[IV] in vivo, which protects the major recognition sites for the integrins α1β1 and α2β1 of type IV collagen.The macromolecular organization as well as the biomechanical stability of basement membranes is mainly determined by the network of type IV collagen (1Kühn K.

Subsequently, purified members of the MMP family, notably gelatinase A (MMP2) and gelatinase B (MMP9) have been shown to degrade type IV collagen preparations in vitro (10Liotta L.A. Abe S.

This supported the concept that the gelatinases may be thought of as type IV collagenases (17Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Robey P.G. Abe S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The interactions of cells with extracellular matrix components are largely mediated by the integrin family of receptors, which are transmembrane heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of non-covalently associated α and β subunits (18Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar). Cellular adhesion to type IV collagen occurs mainly via the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Kühn K. Eble J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 256-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The recognition sites for α1β1 and α2β1 within collagen IV have been located in the immediate vicinity of the gelatinase A cleavage site, about 100 nm from the N terminus of the molecules. This region is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds between the three α(IV) chains and can be isolated as a triple-helical cyanogen bromide fragment, CB3[IV], allowing detailed studies of the structure of the conformation dependent recognition sites (2Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Because of the close vicinity of the gelatinase A cleavage site to the recognition sites for α1β1 and α2β1 binding, the question arose as to whether gelatinase A treatment impairs the ability of collagen IV to interact with α1β1 and α2β1. We therefore incubated different collagen IV preparations, isolated from the murine Engelbreth-Holm Swarm (EHS) tumor and from human placenta, with gelatinase A and subsequently investigated the degradation products and their ability to bind cell-associated and purified α1β1 and α2β1. Collagen IV molecules, in which the stabilizing intramolecular disulfide bonds within the CB3[IV] region had been reduced, were cleaved at 25°C to 30°C by gelatinase A into the two characteristic fragments 100 and 300 nm long (9Fessler L.I. Duncan K.G. Fessler J.H. Salo T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9783-9789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to bind α1β1 and α2β1 was, however, hardly impaired by this enzyme treatment. Incubation at 37°C destroyed the molecules completely. Collagen IV molecules with intact disulfide bonds in the CB3[IV] region were more stable to cleavage with gelatinase A. At 30°C no cleavage could be observed, but at 37°C the molecules were not only split at the gelatinase A-specific cleavage site, but also slowly degraded from the C-terminal end of the triple-helical domain. However, the ability to interact with the two integrins α1β1 and α2β1 remained unchanged. Their recognition sites seemed to be especially stabilized by the intramolecular disulfide bonds of the CB3[IV] region."

NR cell multiplication results from the frequent activation and subsequent retroviral transduction of two related serine/threonine protein kinases, the c-mil/c-raf or c-Rmil/B-raf genes. We also showed that a very early event in the activation of these proto-oncogenes is the synthesis of chimeric mRNAs containing viral and cellular sequences joined by a splicing mechanism. In the current study, we have examined the ability of RAV-1 to induce proliferation of quail NR cells. By using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique, we identified, in several proliferating quail NR cultures infected with RAV-1, a chimeric mRNA containing cellular sequences joined to the RAV-1 splice donor site. These cellular sequences are derived from a gene designated R10, which is expressed through a 1.9-kilobase (kb) mRNA detected in several embryonic tissues. A second transcript of 2.3 kb is specifically expressed in the NR, where both transcripts are developmentally regulated. The R10 cDNA encodes a 251-amino acid polypeptide that contains a leucine zipper motif. It exhibits significant similarity with the putative D52/N8L protein, encoded by an mRNA reported previously to be overexpressed in human breast and lung carcinomas. By using polyclonal antibodies specific for its amino-terminal and leucine zipper-containing regions, we identified the R10 gene product as a cytoplasmic protein of 23 kDa in cultured avian fibroblasts. A second protein of 30 kDa is detected in post-mitotic NR cells that express the 2.3-kb transcript. We also show, by in vitro transcription/translation and immunoprecipitation, that the R10 protein can readily form homodimers, presumably through its leucine zipper motif.

Although its precise physiological roles are still not known, EGF is a potent mitogen for many epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and it regulates cellular migration and differentiation in vitro (3Carpenter G. Wahl M.I. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar).

Various findings suggest that expression of the EGF gene in SGs may be regulated by androgens. The male mouse SG contains higher levels of EGF mRNA than its female counterpart, and EGF-positive cells contain androgen receptors (17Rall L.B. Scott J. Bell G.I. Crawford R.J. Penschow J.D.

Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, EGF mRNA levels are increased in SGs of female mice given androgen and, conversely, are decreased in SGs of castrated males (22Gubits R.M. Shaw P.A. Gresik E.W. Onetti-Muda A. Barka T. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1382-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that the EGF gene could also be regulated by estrogens (23DiAugustine R.P. Petrisz P. Bell G.I.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate transcription of the EGF gene have not been delineated. As an initial step, we have begun to characterize the EGF promoter. In the present study, we have refined the mapping of transcription start sites, shown the putative promoter to be active in vitro and in vivo, investigated possible regulation by androgens and glucocorticoids, and assessed the role of a TATA-like sequence. Luciferin, dexamethasone, and dihydrotestosterone were from Sigma; the 129SV mouse genomic library and pBluescript SK+ vector were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); and radionucleotides were from DuPont NEN.

Human anti-TFIID antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of North Carolina Nucleic Acids Core Facility. Recombinant human TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIA were gifts from Robert Roeder (Rockefeller University, New York, NY); the mouse glucocorticoid receptor expression vector was donated by Keith Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco, CA); and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-luciferase construct was obtained from Ron Evans (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). EGF cDNA probes were gifts from Graeme Bell (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), and the rat androgen receptor expression vector was provided by Elizabeth Wilson (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The nucleotide sequence of the EGF HindIII-XhoI fragment was determined from both strands by the University of North Carolina Automated DNA Sequencing Facility.

Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Lee D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 1121-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The integrity and concentration of RNAs were verified by gel electrophoresis. Primer extension and S1 nuclease analyses were performed with 10-20 μg of total RNA as previously reported (35Blasband A.J. Rogers K.T. Chen X. Azizkhan J.C. Lee D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), unless otherwise specified. End-labeled primers were complementary to EGF sequences +131 to +170 (primer 1), +43 to +80 (primer 2), −37 to −76 (primer 3), and −260 to −221 (primer 4) (see Fig. 2A). S1 nuclease probes were generated as previously detailed (35Blasband A.J. Rogers K.T. Chen X. Azizkhan J.C. Lee D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Primers 1 or 2 were annealed to denatured HX-luc (see Fig. 4A) and extended with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The resulting radiolabeled double stranded products were digested with BanI (−150 bp), and the single stranded probes were isolated from alkaline denaturing gels. Intensities of +1/+2 and +28 primer extension and S1 nuclease products were determined by laser scanning densitometry (UltraScan XL; LKB Produkter, Bromma, Sweden).Fig. 4Expression of EGF promoter-luciferase constructs in transfected cells.

The EGF XX and SX fragments were cloned directly into the corresponding pGL2-basic polylinker sites, whereas the EGF DX fragment was inserted into SmaI-XhoI-cleaved pGL2-basic. The EGF HX fragment was excised from XX-luc using a 3′-HindIII site in the polylinker and cloned into the HindIII site of the pGL2-basic in the correct orientation (Fig. 4A). The EGF TTTAAA sequence (−33 to −28 bp) was mutated to a BstBI site (TTCGAA) in SX-luc using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the SX fragment was subcloned into the ampicillin-sensitive pALTER 1 vector, and a single stranded template was prepared. The first mutant strand was synthesized by annealing the TTCGAA and ampicillin repair oligonucleotides to the single stranded DNA template in the presence of T4 DNA polymerase and ligase. The resulting ligation products were transformed into repair-minus BMH cells for second-strand synthesis of the mutant template. Mutant DNA was isolated and transformed into DH5α, and clones corresponding to the double stranded mutated sequence were selected on ampicillin-containing plates. The mutation was confirmed by cleavage with BstB1 and dideoxy sequencing. EGF-luciferase constructs were cleaved within the luciferase gene at unique XbaI or BglII sites, and linear templates were isolated from agarose gels prior to use in runoff transcription assays. Transcriptions in vitro were performed using the HeLaScribe nuclear extract in vitro transcription system, with a linear cytomegalovirus (CMV) template included as a positive control. Reactions were carried out in the presence of [α32P]dUTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 50 μCi/reaction) as described by the manufacturer. Alternate reactions were performed in the absence of radioactivity, and the resulting RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to use as templates in primer extension assays. CHO, NRK-52E, and COS cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (maintenance media). For transfection, cells were grown to 50-60% confluence, and complete media were replaced with serum-free media. At time 0, DNAs (1 μg of pGL2-basic or the molar equivalent of larger constructs) were introduced via LipofectAMINE treatment (6 μl of LipofectAMINE/35-mm2 culture dish) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells were rescued 6-8 h later by the addition of 1 volume of complete media containing 20% serum. After 24 h, transfection media were removed and replaced with maintenance media or, for experiments shown in Fig. 6, media containing steroid hormones. After 42-48 h (or 18-24 h of hormone treatment), cells were harvested for assay. All transfections were performed in duplicate. Plated cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (4°C), pelleted at 14,000 rpm, and resuspended in 300 μl of 100 mM K2HPO4 (pH 7.8). Cells were then lysed with three successive freeze-thaw cycles, and the luciferase activity of individual samples was measured in duplicate. Lysate (100 μl) was placed in the luminometer, and reactions were initiated by automatic injection of 200 μl each of luciferin reagent (200 μM luciferin in 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8) and assay buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM ATP, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured for 15 s at ambient temperature immediately following the addition of reagents (AutoLumat LB953 luminometer; Berthold Analytical Instruments, Inc., Nashua, NH). Relative light units were corrected for lysate protein content. Double stranded DNA probes encoding the EGF promoter TTTAAA sequence (5′-TCGACAGAGCTTTAAAAAGGAGAG-3′) and the adenovirus major late promoter TATAAA sequence (5′-GGGCTATAAAAGGC-3′) were radiolabeled with 32P and separated from free radionucleotide using a G-50 column. Purified recombinant TBP (His6-human TBP, 7.1 ng) and TFIIA (8 ng) were added to 20-μl binding reactions containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 17 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4% Ficoll, 0.5 μg poly(dI-dC), 5 mM spermidine, 0.0125% Nonidet P-40, and 75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. For competition reactions, a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA was added prior to the addition of the probe, and samples were incubated for 15 min on ice. The probe (0.06-0.12 ng, 40,000 cpm) was then added, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at 25°C. Resulting products were separated on native 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 × Tris/glycine/EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5% glycerol. For supershift reactions, the probe, TBP, and TFIIA were first incubated for 15 min on ice, and then 3 μg of human anti-TBP antibody was added for 20 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. To evaluate the hormonal and tissue-specific regulation of the mouse EGF gene, we isolated genomic sequences containing the EGF promoter and 5′-flanking region from a 129SV mouse liver genomic library. The probe was a 603-bp fragment generated from a mouse kidney genomic DNA via polymerase chain reaction amplification and primers encompassing the putative EGF promoter (36Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Eight positive λ-FIX II clones were characterized by restriction enzyme cleavage; the largest (7B) contained approximately 17 kb of sequence 5′ to exon 1 of the EGF gene as well as approximately 4.5 kb of intron 1 sequence (15Gray A. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1983; 303: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Scott J. Urdea M. Quiroga M. Sanchez-Pescador R. Fong N. Selby M. Rutter W.J. Bell G.I Science. 1983; 221: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The 22-kb NotI fragment from clone 7B was shuttled into pBluescript SK+ vector, and a partial restriction enzyme map was determined by Southern blotting using the aforementioned 603-bp probe (Fig. 1). Predicted restriction fragments were confirmed by Southern analysis of mouse genomic liver DNA to exclude possible gene rearrangements or splicing events that might have occurred during the cloning process. Using S1 nuclease analysis, a single primer, and mouse SG and kidney RNAs, Pascall and Brown (36Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) previously identified a single prominent and two minor downstream EGF mRNA 5′-ends. By comparison with a molecular weight ladder, they associated the prominent band with a cytosine residue. Since the mouse EGF promoter contains multiple TA-rich elements that could function as atypical TATA boxes (see Fig. 2A), we wanted to exclude possible transcription initiation at other sites in the flanking regions. Additionally, we wanted to more accurately map transcription initiation sites by comparison with sequence ladders derived from the EGF promoter region itself. Accordingly, we synthesized a set of four oligonucleotide primers, each of which corresponded to sequences downstream of three putative TATA box-like sequences as well as the previously reported EGF 5′-end (Fig. 2A). Primers 1-4 were used in primer extension assays, whereas radiolabeled primers 1 and 2 were used to make S1 nuclease probes with uniform 5′-ends produced by BanI cleavage (see Fig. 2A). Since EGF mRNA is expressed at particularly high levels in adult mouse SG and kidney but is present at very low or undetectable levels in brain (17Rall L.B. Scott J. Bell G.I. Crawford R.J. Penschow J.D. Niall H.D. Coghlan J.P. Nature. 1985; 313: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), 2S. E. Fenton, unpublished observation. we used total mRNA from these three tissues as templates in the primer extension and S1 nuclease assays. Fig. 2B shows that when radiolabeled primer 1 was used in primer extension assays with SG and kidney RNAs, a prominent cluster of two or more bands of roughly 170 bases in length was observed. Primer 2 confirmed this result and resolved the cluster to two principle bands; by comparison with an EGF promoter sequencing ladder generated from the same primer, these two bands corresponded to adjacent adenosine residues located immediately 3′ to the cytosine previously identified by Pascall and Brown (36Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We hereafter refer to the most 5′-adenosine residue as +1. Using RNAs from SG and kidney, primer 1 also detected a less prominent 5′-end corresponding to an adenosine at +28 and occasionally other minor extension products as well. The +28 site likely corresponds to a minor 5′-end previously identified (36Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in SG samples, which they associated with an adenosine residue located two bases further upstream. The +28 product could not be confirmed with primer 2, since the latter corresponds to sequences from +43 to +80. However, S1 nuclease assays performed with SG and kidney RNAs and probes generated from primers 1 (Fig. 2B) and 2 (data not shown) yielded prominent products corresponding to both the +1/+2 and +28 sites. In contrast, primer extension reactions with primers 3 and 4 (Fig. 2A) did not yield products with any of the mouse RNAs tested, even when higher concentrations of RNA were used (20 versus 10 μg). The fact that +1/+2 and +28 primer extension and S1 nuclease products were most abundant in SG versus kidney RNA and were not detected with brain samples is consistent with the relative EGF mRNA abundance in these tissues as judged by Northern blot analysis (17Rall L.B. Scott J. Bell G.I. Crawford R.J. Penschow J.D. Niall H.D. Coghlan J.P. Nature. 1985; 313: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).2 Collectively, these data confirm and refine the previously reported EGF mRNA 5′-ends (36Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specifically, they indicate that transcription of the EGF gene in SG and kidney initiates at two sites, with the +1/+2 site being dominant. Interestingly, densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs shown in Fig. 2B revealed that the +1/+2 site is used 7-fold more frequently than the +28 site in SG, but only 2-fold more frequently in kidney. This suggests that transcription is selectively enhanced via the +1/+2 site in SG. Functional activity of the putative EGF promoter has not been previously demonstrated. Accordingly, we tested its activity both in vitro and in vivo. To assay its ability to direct transcription in vitro in the presence of crude HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Promega), an XhoI fragment containing 6.7 kb of sequence 5′ of the start site was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (XX-luc), and runoff templates were produced by cleavage at unique sites (BglII or XbaI) within the luciferase gene. The dihydrofolate reductase and CMV promoter constructs were also linearized and used in conjunction with radiolabeled molecular weight markers for size comparisons. As expected, the ScaI-linearized dihydrofolate reductase template produced two bands of 780 and 736 bases (37Pierce A.J. Jambou R.C. Jensen D.E. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6583-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas the linearized CMV template yielded a product of 363 bases (Fig. 3). Transcription of the XbaI-cleaved EGF-luciferase template produced two closely spaced products not observed with the parental luciferase vector. The larger product was a diffuse band(s) of approximately 401-410 bases; the smaller, more distinct product had an estimated length of 385 bases. These sizes are similar to those expected on the basis of nucleotide sequence for runoff products initiated at the +1/+2 (404 bases) and +28 sites (376 bases), respectively (Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, transcription of an EGF-luciferase template that had been cleaved at a BglII site closer to the EGF promoter produced two similarly spaced bands of appropriately reduced size (data not shown). Additionally, although transcription of alternate EGF-luciferase templates containing 390 (SX-luc) or 2000 (HX-luc) bases of 5′-flanking sequence produced comparable products, a template containing only 30 bases of 5′-flanking sequence (DX-luc) did not yield identifiable transcripts (data not shown). The latter result suggests that sequences upstream of −30 are required for EGF promoter activity in vitro. To verify correct initiation in vitro, transcripts derived from the XhoI-XhoI EGF-luciferase construct were assayed by primer extension using primer 1. Fig. 3 shows that a dominant extension product corresponding to the +1/+2 site was obtained together with minor, smaller products. Notably, despite the generation of an in vitro transcript the size of which appeared consistent with initiation at +28 (Fig. 2B), no corresponding extension product was observed. However, aberrant minor products were evident at bases +41 and +55. Transcriptional activity in vivo was established via transient transfection of EGF-luciferase constructs into cultured cell lines. EGF fragments possessing a common 3′-end (XhoI; +314) but containing 6.7 kb (XhoI-XhoI; XX), 2.0 kb (HindIII-XhoI; HX), 0.4 kb (SacI-XhoI; SX), and 0.03 kb (DraI-XhoI; DX) of sequence 5′ to the transcriptional start site were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2 (Fig. 4A). The final vectors were then transiently transfected into CHO and NRK-52E cells, and the resulting luciferase activity was measured after 48 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, EGF promoter activity was confirmed in both cell types, although the effect on luciferase activity of increasing amounts of EGF 5′-flanking sequence differed considerably between the two cell lines. Thus, in CHO cells, optimal activity was obtained with SX-luc, which yielded a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the promoterless vector; the inclusion of an additional 5′-flanking sequence decreased luciferase expression from HX- and XX-luc to only 2.2- and 1.3-fold above background, respectively. In contrast, in NRK-52E cells, the larger HX- and XX-luc constructs were most active, yielding 60- and 62-fold increases in luciferase activity over background, respectively. In both CHO and NRK-52E cells, the DX-luc construct, which contained only 30 bases of 5′-flanking sequence, was inactive, consistent with the in vitro transcription results described above. Primer extension assays performed with primer 1 and poly (A)+ RNA from cells transfected with XX-, HX-, and SX-luc yielded extension products that by comparison with an EGF promoter sequence ladder corresponded to initiation at the +1/+2 site (data not shown). Although in NRK-52E cells, SX-luc was less active than larger t"

We prepared a single-stranded phagemid template containing a dT41 sequence to test the ability of pol γ to extend a primer through a defined oligo(dT) tract. pol γ terminates in the center of this dT41 sequence. This replication arrest is abrogated by addition of single-stranded DNA-binding protein or by substitution of 7-deaza-dATP for dATP. These features are consistent with the formation of a T·;A*T DNA triplex involving the primer stem. Replication arrest occurs under conditions that permit highly processive DNA synthesis by pol γ. A similar replication arrest occurs for T7 DNA polymerase, which is also a highly processive DNA polymerase. These results suggest the possibility that DNA triplex formation can occur prior to dissociation of DNA polymerase. Primers with 3′-oligo(dA) termini annealed to a template with a longer oligo(dT) tract are not efficiently extended by pol γ unless single-stranded DNA-binding protein is added. Thus, one of the functions of single-stranded DNA-binding protein in mtDNA maintenance may be to enable pol γ to successfully replicate through dT-rich sequences."

In the present study, we examined the ability of newly synthesized receptor to bind ligand. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met and prepared for affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose. Mannose receptor in the flow-through and eluted fractions was detected by fluorography following immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Labeled mannose receptor was found exclusively in the nonbinding fraction until 10 min of chase. Following a 60-min chase, 67-86% of newly synthesized receptor was precipitated from the bound column fraction. The half-time for development of receptor binding activity was determined to be 35-40 min compared with a 45-min half-time for development of endoglycosidase H resistance. Mannose receptor synthesized by cells incubated in brefeldin A required more than 120 min to acquire endoglycosidase H resistance and maximal binding activity.

Like other calcium-dependent animal lectins (3Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the MR binds ligand through the cooperative interaction of multiple CRDs, homologous sequences containing invariant residues and structural features that mediate interactions with sugar and calcium (4Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eight CRDs of the mannose receptor are arranged linearly along a single polypeptide backbone that crosses the membrane once to form a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (5Taylor M.E. Conary J.T.

Trans. 1993; 21: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expressed alone, only CRD 4 of the MR exhibits binding activity, recognizing monomeric sugars for which the receptor has affinity. Sugar binding by CRD 4 requires two calcium ions in a pH-dependent interaction that leads to calcium and ligand dissociation under acidic conditions (9Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity binding of naturally occurring proteins bearing high-mannose structures requires the expression of CRDs 4 and 5 together, while binding of extended polymeric ligands is dependent upon CRDs 4-8 (8Taylor M.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2385-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial translation product exhibits an average Mr of 154 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and is sensitive to Endo H digestion. The receptor matures to its 162-kDa, Endo H-resistant form with a half-time of about 45 min. The observed shift in electrophoretic mobility following synthesis reflects mainly addition of negatively charged sialic acid residues to O-linked sugars, with the maturation of N-linked chains to hybrid and/or complex forms contributing only slightly to the change in Mr. Carbohydrate recognition recently has been found to play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the secretory pathway and the protein products generated within. Calnexin and calreticulin are resident ER lectins that bind and retain monoglucosylated oligosaccharides for presentation to a glucosyltransferase which detects improperly folded proteins before they can exit the ER (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). A resident protein of the intermediate compartment, ERGIC53, binds mannose and may facilitate transport of glycoproteins between the ER and Golgi (12Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Arar C. Carpentier V. Le Caer J.P. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Roche A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 270: 3551-3553Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ER, intermediate, and early Golgi compartments are rich in potential MR ligands (i.e. proteins with high-mannose chains), which could act as retention or retrieval factors. In addition, the environment of the early secretory pathway, with a neutral pH and abundant calcium (14Hendriks R.J.M. Fuller S.D. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 22: 101-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), should favor MR ligation. However, the half-time for development of Endo H resistance reported for the MR suggests that the receptor is not retained in or returned to the ER following synthesis (10Lennartz M.R. Cole F.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2385-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Empirically, the MR is too restricted in its cellular distribution to function intracellularly as a molecular chaperon. Further, data from experiments with oligosaccharide-processing inhibitors suggest that engagement by endogenous membrane proteins may target the MR for early degradation (15Chung K.-N. Shepherd V.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14637-14641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the binding activity of the MR must be regulated in the biosynthetic pathway so as to avoid intracellular ligation. In this study we have examined the ability of the mannose receptor to bind ligand while it is localized to early secretory compartments. Utilizing metabolic pulse labeling, affinity chromatography, and a battery of inhibitors of post-translational transport and processing, we demonstrate that the mannose receptor is synthesized as an inactive precursor requiring transport from the ER for acquisition of binding activity. We present data suggesting that MR activation is an enzyme-mediated event, and possible mechanisms are discussed.

Collection of antiserum and characterization of antibody specificity were described previously (10Lennartz M.R. Cole F.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2385-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood monocytes were obtained by counter-current elutriation. Briefly, concentrated lymphocytes were centrifuged over Ficoll-Hypaque and interfaces (buffy coats) were collected. Leukocytes were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mM EDTA to remove platelets. Monocytes were isolated in a J2-21 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) using a JE-6 elutriator rotor with two Sanderson separation chambers as described (16Pommier C.G. O'Shea J. Chused T. Takahashi T. Ochoa M. Nutman T.B. Bianco C. Brown E.J. Blood. 1984; 64: 858-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of monocytes was ascertained by sizing in a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Monocytes were plated at a density of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% human AB serum (heat-inactivated) for 1 h and then maintained in 12.5% human AB serum for up to 6 days as reported previously (10Lennartz M.R. Cole F.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2385-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed 4 or 5 days post-plating. Cells were incubated for 30 min in Cys- and Met-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. For the pulse, the starvation medium was replaced with the same media containing 0.1-0.3 mCi/ml Tran35S-label. Chase media contained a 1000-fold excess of both unlabeled Cys and Met and replaced the pulse media after thorough washing of the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. For experiments utilizing oligosaccharide-processing inhibitors, BFA, or monensin, cells were preincubated with drug for the amount of time noted in the text, and drugs were present in all experimental media unless indicated otherwise. For experiments with AlF, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min between the pulse and chase, during which time a fluoroaluminate complex was formed by sequential addition of aluminum sulfate and potassium fluoride to final concentrations of 10 μM and 10 mM, respectively. Control cultures received potassium chloride instead of potassium fluoride. In all experiments, cell plates were frozen at −20°C prior to membrane preparation. The following steps were performed on ice. Cells were harvested by scraping in 5 mM Tris and 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, and were homogenized by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Membrane pellets were solubilized by resuspension in loading buffer (1.25 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 15 mM Ca2+, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Solubilized membranes were applied to mannose-Sepharose columns (17Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) pre-equilibrated in loading buffer and rocked overnight at 4°C. The flow-through fraction was collected and reserved for immunoprecipitation. The columns were washed extensively with loading buffer and eluted with 4 bed-volumes of loading buffer containing 0.2 M D-mannose. Fractions to be immunoprecipitated were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants were incubated overnight with the indicated polyclonal rabbit antiserum. Protein A-Sepharose was added and samples were incubated for an additional hour. Beads were washed three times by suspension in 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation. For Endo H digestion, samples were incubated with 0.2 units/ml Endo H for 17 h at 37°C. Beads were then boiled for 5 min in buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed and impregnated with Enlightening (DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were dried onto filter paper and exposed to film at −80°C for 1-5 days. MR was immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled human monocyte-derived macrophages. Precipitated material was treated with or without Endo H and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A representative autoradiograph is shown in Fig. 1. Initially, MR was completely sensitive to Endo H digestion, shifting approximately 4 kDa in apparent molecular mass (lanes 1 and 2). By 30 min of chase, a portion of the receptor's N-linked oligosaccharides resisted removal (lanes 3 and 4). More than 95% of the labeled MR exhibited Endo H resistance 60 min after the pulse (lanes 7 and 8). Densitometric analysis (Fig. 2B) confirmed the reported half-time of 45 min for maturation of MR N-linked oligosaccharides. A protein band with an Mr of approximately 200 kDa was nonspecifically precipitated by all antisera, including normal rabbit serum (lane 9).Fig. 2A lag period occurs before newly synthesized MR exhibits ligand-binding activity.

Following elution of the columns with mannose, both the flow-through and eluted fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-MR antiserum. Immediately after the pulse, all labeled MR was immunoprecipitated from the flow-through or nonbinding fraction (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The failure of MR to bind mannose-Sepharose at this time point was apparent in each of nine experiments, even after prolonged exposure of the gels to film (not shown). By 20 min of chase (lanes 5 and 6), about 10% of the receptor bound to the column. The ratio of bound to nonbinding receptor increased with chase time (lanes 7-12). After a 90-min chase, >90% of the labeled receptor was bound and specifically eluted (lanes 11 and 12). The ability of the higher-mobility, Endo H-sensitive form of the MR to bind mannose residues is evident in Fig. 2A (lanes 5, 7, and 9). However, nearly all of the lower-mobility, mature form of the receptor is localized to the bound column fraction at each time point following its initial appearance. This observation suggests that the shift in apparent molecular weight occurs in temporal and spatial proximity to the activating event(s). Fig. 2B illustrates the kinetic relationship between the maturation of oligosaccharide side chains and development of binding activity. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs from several experiments revealed a half-time of 35-40 min for MR activation compared to a 40-45-min half-time determined for maturation of N-linked carbohydrates. The effect of BFA on MR maturation can be seen in Fig. 3. MR synthesized in the presence of BFA exhibits an Mr of about 154 kDA rather than the 162 kDA of control cells for up to 3 h post-translation (Fig. 3A, lane 7). The failure of the MR to undergo its characteristic shift in electrophoretic mobility presumably reflects the inaccessibility of the MR to trans-Golgi compartments containing sialyltransferase in BFA-treated cells (18Lippincott-Schwartz J. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The processing of N-linked sugars occurs in BFA-treated macrophages as assessed by development of Endo H resistance but is slowed approximately 2-fold compared to controls. Approximately 120 min of chase was required before complete resistance to Endo H digestion was developed (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8). Affinity chromatography of newly synthesized MR from BFA-treated cells revealed that activation was retarded but not diminished by the drug pretreatment. Fig. 3B shows the amount of MR precipitated from the bound column fraction of control and BFA-treated cell lysates. After 90 min of chase, the amount of MR from control cells that was bound to the column was maximal (lanes 1 and 3), while only about half of the labeled MR from BFA-treated cells was retained (lane 2). The half-time for development of MR binding activity was approximately 85 min as assessed by densitometric analysis of several autoradiographs. By 180 min of chase, nearly all of the labeled MR from treated cells was specifically eluted from the mannose-Sepharose (lane 4). The slowed kinetics of activation in BFA-treated cells corresponds to the delayed development of Endo H resistance (Fig. 3A) and probably reflects the disorganization of post-translational processing in these cells. Cells were treated with agents which disrupt the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides prior to metabolic labeling and affinity chromatography. A representative autoradiograph of MR immunoprecipitated from the bound column fractions is shown in Fig. 4. Pretreatment with castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, deoxymannojirimycin, or swainsonine failed to prevent activation of the MR by 60 min of chase. These drugs inhibit the activities of α-glucosidase, α-glucosidase I and II, α-mannosidase I, and α-mannosidase II, respectively, and prevent maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides to complex forms (19Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 661-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the similar electrophoretic mobilities of the control and experimental receptor bands, Endo H sensitivity was confirmed for all receptor protein made in the presence of the inhibitors for each experiment (data not shown). Deoxynojirimycin and, to a lesser extent, deoxymannojirimycin had a toxic effect on the cells, which displayed a lower rate of protein synthesis. Experiments conducted in the presence of tunicamycin, which prevents addition of N-linked oligosaccharides (19Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 661-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were inconclusive due to the high toxicity of the drug to human macrophages. However, MR synthesized in tunicamycin-treated cells exhibited an Mr of 150 kDa, suggesting a lack of O-glycosylation and presumably inhibition of receptor transport out of the ER. This form of the receptor failed to bind an affinity column following metabolic labeling (not shown). The effect of blocking O-glycosylation or the function of trans-Golgi enzymes on receptor activation is illustrated in Fig. 5. Incubation of cells with phenyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor of O-glycosylation (20Kuan S.-F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Young Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused production of MR with an Mr of 156 kDa (lane 3). Treatment of cells with monensin (21Mollenhauer H.H. Morre D.J. Rowe L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) blocked terminal sialylation of the MR and generated a receptor protein with an Mr of about 154 kDa (lane 2). MR from both treatment samples became resistant to Endo H digestion with kinetics similar to control (not shown). When applied to mannose-Sepharose columns, newly synthesized MR from treated cells did not differ from controls in the time required to achieve a binding state. By 90 min of chase, a majority of the receptor molecules were bound and eluted specifically from the column (lanes 1-3). To block ER-to-Golgi transport (22Burgoyne R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with AlF prior to and throughout the chase period following a 2-min pulse with Tran35S-label. The presence of AlF4− was inhibitory to MR maturation, preventing development of Endo H resistance (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4) normally observed after the chase (lanes 1 and 2). The effect of AlF on MR transport was reversed by an additional 60-min chase in media lacking AlF4−, but reversal was dependent on extensive washing of cells prior to the second chase period. Recovery from the transport block was characterized by maturation of N-linked side chains, which became resistant to Endo H within the 60-min chase period (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6). Acquisition of MR binding activity was also inhibited by the presence of AlF4− (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-4), with all labeled MR from treated cells immunoprecipitated from the nonbinding fraction after affinity chromatography. Removal of AlF4− from the chase media resulted in the shift of labeled MR from the nonbinding to the bound column fraction, indicating that resumption of biosynthetic transport allowed activation of the MR for ligand binding. We have examined the activity of newly synthesized mannose receptor in human monocyte-derived macrophages. We observed that the human MR undergoes a lag period (t1/2 = 35-40 min) between synthesis and detectable binding activity. We believe this delay represents a distinct change from an inactive to an active binding state that occurs as the receptor is being transported through the biosynthetic pathway. In support of this hypothesis, maturation of MR activity can be arrested by blocking transport to the Golgi. Aluminum fluoride, an activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins (24Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15595-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevents dissociation of β-COP from vesicles mediating anterograde transport from the ER (25Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism remains unclear (22Burgoyne R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melancon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13325-13330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AlF4− mimics the effect of GTPγS in curtailing transport to the cis-Golgi cisternae and clearly prevents processing of the MR by Golgi enzymes. The kinetics with which the receptor becomes capable of binding ligand suggest an early Golgi localization for the activating event. The MR develops Endo H resistance with a half-time of approximately 40-45 min via the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides to hybrid and complex forms in the medial Golgi area (27Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). While these modifications are temporally and perhaps spatially related to maturation of receptor activity, processing of N-linked sugars does not influence development of MR activity; Endo H-sensitive MR can clearly bind ligand. The initial step in addition of O-linked sugars is thought to occur in the intermediate compartment between the ER and Golgi (28Tooze S.A. Tooze J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One function of O-GalNAc-linked sugars is to cause a rodlike extension of polypeptides in space (29Varki A. Freeze H.H. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 22: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The determination of MR primary structure has revealed that potential sites for O-glycosylation all lie between presumed sugar binding domains (5Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could form a basis for development of MR activity through induction of a conformational change leaving critical CRDs accessible for binding. However, incubation of macrophages with an inhibitor of O-glycosylation, phenyl-GalNAc (20Kuan S.-F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Young Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), affected only the resulting Mr of the receptor, not its activity. Further evidence for the early Golgi stacks as the site of MR activation is derived from our results using BFA-treated cells. BFA has been shown to disrupt the transport of newly synthesized proteins beyond the medial or trans-Golgi cisternae by blocking anterograde transport from the ER and causing fusion of the early Golgi stacks with the ER (30Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized MR from BFA-treated macrophages becomes Endo H-resistant with slowed kinetics when compared to controls but fails to attain its mature Mr, presumably because terminal glycosylation of both N- and O-linked sugars is prevented. Development of MR activity is also slowed but not inhibited by BFA treatment. This result suggests that activation of newly synthesized MR may be an enzyme-mediated event, which is slowed by disruption of the sequential processing reactions normally occurring in the Golgi. The kinetics with which MR bound affinity columns following synthesis in the presence of monensin were similar to controls and support the idea that activation occurs prior to transport into trans-Golgi cisternae. Although transport to the trans-Golgi is not inhibited by monensin, the pH of this compartment is neutralized, which affects the activity of enzymes localized there and prevents the processing and sorting events that normally occur (21Mollenhauer H.H. Morre D.J. Rowe L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These processing steps are not prerequisite to MR activation. If the MR becomes active prior to entering the trans-Golgi cisterna, the question of why it does not become bound to other newly synthesized and resident glycoproteins remains. One possibility is that the microenvironment does not favor MR binding. A pH gradient exists across the Golgi stacks that is most acidic in the later Golgi region. Since MR binding has a neutral pH optimum (33Stahl P.D. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), certain Golgi compartments may not promote ligation of the MR. Insufficient calcium would also preclude MR ligation intracellularly (34Diaz R. Wileman T.E. Anderson S.J. Stahl P. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We currently favor the hypothesis that an enzyme activity triggers a change in MR conformation that allows exposure of critical binding domains in proper configuration for ligand binding. This suggestion is based on the AlF4− and BFA experiments presented here and on the ability of CRDs to bind ligand following translation in vitro. The type of enzyme activity responsible for MR activation requires definition, although several possibilities are evident. The existence of a binding-site antagonist that may be removed by proteolysis or other event has not been ruled out, although no co-precipitating bands have been visualized in fluorographs of MR immunoprecipitated soon after synthesis. It is more likely that the outermost N-terminal regions of the MR form a block to ligand binding that is removed by the action of our undefined enzyme. One well characterized enzyme responsible for conformational changes in newly synthesized proteins is protein disulfide isomerase I, which is known to reside mainly in the ER and intermediate compartment (35Freedman R. Nature. 1987; 329: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15984-15990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the N-terminal domain and the CRDs of the MR are rich in cysteine residues, which presumably play a role in forming and maintaining MR structure. It is improbable that protein disulfide isomerase mediates the activation of the MR due to our localization of initial binding activity to the Golgi stacks. However, a similar activity with effects on protein conformation may localize to later secretory compartments. Efforts are underway to clarify the activating event in intact and semipermeabilized macrophages."

Embryonal carcinoma cells mimic the early embryo and have proven to be a useful model for study of development. These stem cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro into cell types that resemble those found at various stages of early mouse development (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Progression of F9 teratocarcinoma embryonic stem cells can be divided into two separate events, the production of primitive endodermal and of parietal endodermal cells. When F9 cells are exposed to retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RAretinoic acidPEprimitive endodermtPAtissue plasminogen activatorMAPmitogen-activated proteinIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateDAG1,2-diacylglycerolPLCphospholipase CFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyEGFepidermal growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. alone, cells become flat and show typical endodermal morphology, which is the functional equivalent of primitive endoderm (PE) of normal embryogenesis, and express the protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, a PE marker) as well as components of the basal lamina, such as type IV collagen and laminin B1 (2Rickles R.J. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1563-1569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels in F9 cells treated in combination with RA promote primitive endodermal cells to a parietal endoderm-like phenotype in early mouse embryogenesis (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). retinoic acid primitive endoderm tissue plasminogen activator mitogen-activated protein inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 1,2-diacylglycerol phospholipase C fast protein liquid chromatography epidermal growth factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Many complex biological processes such as oncogenesis, differentiation, and early neonatal mouse development have been shown to be regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins, such as Gsα and Giα2. In the F9 mouse teratocarcinoma model of early mouse development, Giα2 levels decline precipitously in response to the morphogen RA as the cells commit to PE (3Galvin-Parton P.A. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of RNA antisense to Giα2, but not to Giα1 or Giα3, induces progression to PE in the absence of RA (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Giα2, a G-protein that antagonizes Gsα with respect to one known effector adenylylcyclase, blocks stem cells from progression to PE even in the presence of RA (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of Gsα or its constitutively active mutant form induced PE in the absence of RA (5Gao P. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1460-C1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RA-induced decline in Giα2 triggers F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells to progress to PE via activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (6Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Giα2 suppresses the commitment of stem cells to primitive endoderm, while Gsα expression somehow eliminates the suppression and/or induces differentiation itself. In an effort to identify the effector for the Giα2/Gsα axis with respect to regulating development of PE from stem cells, we expressed chimera with N-terminal substitutions of Giα2 in the Gsα molecule. Using stably transfected clones of F9 cells expressing elevated levels of the chimeric G-proteins, we probed the downstream events to the level of MAP kinase and progression to PE. The results identify a central role of phospholipase C in the regulation by Giα2/Gsα, via protein kinase C and MAP kinase activation. Additionally, substitution of region -(55-64) of Giα2 for Gsα and the C-terminal 36 amino acids of Giα2 for the corresponding 38 C-terminal residues of Gsα promotes progression to PE in the absence of the morphogen and identifies these regions as important determinants for regulation of phospholipase C. Wild-type and stably-transfected clones of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma stem cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated 10-cm Falcon Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% of fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The expression vector pCW1 harboring cDNA constructs encoding either wild-type and constitutively activated mutants of Giα2 and Gsα or chimera of Giα2/Gsα under the control of the SV40 early promoter were used to stably transfect F9 stem cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Clones were selected (500 μg/ml) and maintained (100 μg/ml) in the presence of the active form of gentamicin analogue, antibiotic G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of crude membrane fractions (5 μg) from each subclone were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were stained with antibodies specific for either Gsα (CM129) or to Giα2 (CM112). The immune complexes were made visible by staining with a second antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) coupled to calf alkaline phosphatase. Cyclic AMP accumulation was determined by the competitive protein binding assay (7Brown B.L. Albano J.D.M. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Cell aliquots (105) were washed and incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (2 × 106 cells/ml) with the indicated agents for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ethanol maintained at −70°C. Aliquots of cells were assayed in triplicate in either the absence or the presence of the β-adrenergic agonist (−)isoproterenol (100 μM) or the diterpene activator of adenylcyclase, forskolin (50 μM). The activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the hallmark of the PE phenotype. Stem cells induced to PE produce and secrete tPA as well as assume a characteristic morphology, i.e. extended spindle shape with defined foci of growth (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). For production of PE, all-trans-RA (100 nM, Eastman Kodak) was added for 4 days to induce progression to PE (8Darrow A. Rickles R.J. Strickland S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For tPA determinations, the culture medium of cells was assayed using the amidolytic assay (9Andrade-Gordon P. Strickland S. . 1986; 25: 4033-4044Google Scholar). One unit of tPA is arbitrarily defined as that amount of tPA produced at a reaction rate of 10−7ΔA405 min−2 (change in the optical absorbance at 405 nm divided by the square of the time, in min). For phase-contrast microscopy, the cells were cultured for 4 days and then fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, viewed, and photographed by phase-contrast microscopy using a Zeiss Axiophot system. Cells (106) were cultured in 6-well plates for 4 days in the presence and absence of RA (100 nM). Cells were harvested and subjected to treatment with perchloric acid. After neutralization, the mass of IP3 was determined by a competitive protein binding assay of [3H]IP3, using the IP3 receptor present in rabbit cerebellar membranes (10Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Colvin J.S. Synder S.H. Nature. 1987; 325: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Binding assays contained 106 cells, 2.5 nM [3H]IP3, and a 100-μl aliquot of binding protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3. Reaction tubes were incubated for 10 min at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The resultant pellets were washed, suspended in 4 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells plated in 6-well plates (106) were grown to confluence for 4 days in the absence or presence of RA. Total cellular lipids were extracted into chloroform. DAG content was measured using the DAG kinase assay (11Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) employing thin-layer chromatography to separate radioactivity incorporated into phosphatidic acid generated from the reaction. The DAG mass was calculated from a standard curve with authentic sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. Cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes for 4 days, released by treatment with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA, and homogenized on ice in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 25 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). Homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 min, and supernatants were collected after microcentrifugation. Protein kinase C was partially purified by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (0.2 g of DE52, Whatman) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) (12Yasuda U. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakuriai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The cell extract was applied to the column, which was then washed with buffer B. The protein kinase C was eluted in buffer C (buffer B plus 0.2 M NaCl). Protein kinase C activity was assayed using a commercially prepared assay (Life Technologies, Inc.) that utilizes a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μM acylated myelin basic protein substrate-(4-14) and activator phorbol myristic acid (10 mM) in combination with phosphatidylserine (0.28 mg/ml) or the presence versus absence of the pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide, protein kinase C-(19-36) (20 μM) (13Bell R.M. Hannun Y. Loomis C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the DEAE-purified homogenate and incubated at 30°C for 5 min. Twenty μl of the reaction sample were spotted onto a P-81 phosphocellulose filter, which was then washed with 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid. Protein kinase C activity is expressed as picomoles of 32P transferred to the myelin basic protein peptide substrate (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C.

Expression of Giα2 (1-54)/s displayed levels of cyclic AMP accumulation, in contrast, similar to the GsαG225T mutant. Expression of either Giα2 or Q205L Giα2 inhibited by >50% cyclic AMP accumulation in response to either the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or to the diterpene forskolin. The patterns for cyclic AMP accumulation by clones expressing the various subunits and chimeras were similar for the basal, isoproterenol-stimulated (100 μM), and forskolin-stimulated (50 μM) conditions. These data demonstrate that, when stably expressed in the context of F9 teratocarcinoma cells, Gsα stimulates, Giα2 inhibits, and substitution of Gsα with increasing N-terminal regions of Giα2 attenuates activation of adenylylcyclase. Thus, the G-proteins expressed have retained the ability to recognize receptor, bind and exchange GTP, and to activate one known effector, adenylylcyclase, as previously noted (15Osawa S. Dhanasekaran N. Woon C.W. Johnson G.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Gupta S.K. Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Secretion of tPA is a hallmark for stem cell differentiation to PE (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Using the sensitive amidolytic assay (9Andrade-Gordon P. Strickland S. . 1986; 25: 4033-4044Google Scholar), we measured the ability of clones expressing Gsα, GsαG225T, and chimeras of Gsα with increasing substitution of Giα2 to progress to PE, both in the absence and presence of the morphogen RA (Fig. 4). Expression of either GsαG225T or wild-type Gsα promoted progression to PE in the absence of morphogen, as evidenced by expression of the tPA marker. In combination with RA, expression of Gsα markedly potentiated (3-fold), whereas expression of Giα2 suppressed (>50%), the progression to PE heralded by tPA production. Substitution of Gsα N-terminal sequence with increasing amounts of Giα2 sequence attenuated the effect on progression. The markedly elevated response to Gsα expression was reduced to that of the empty-vector control by substitution in the N terminus with as little as seven residues of Giα2 and reduced progressively below the control by expression of Giα2 (1-54)/s, Giα2 (1-122)/s, and Giα2 (1-212)/s chimeras. The Giα2 (1-54)/s construct, which displayed the highest activation of adenylylcyclase (Fig. 3), strongly inhibited stem cell progression, as measured by tPA production. Further analysis of the N and C termini of Gsα by substitution with Giα2 sequences identified two regions of the molecule critical to progression of stem cells to PE in either the absence (Fig. 5) or the presence (not shown) of RA. Although expression of Giα2 (1-54)/s strongly activates adenylylcyclase (Fig. 3) and inhibits progression (Fig. 4), expression of Giα2 (1-64)/s strongly promoted progression of stem cells to PE with respect to expression of Gsα although both chimeras were equivalent with respect to activation of adenylylcyclase. Substitution of Gsα C-terminal domain with that of Giα2, Gsα/I (320-355), enhanced the progression to PE in the absence of morphogen for Gsα and the Giα2 (1-64)/s, but not for either the Giα2 (1-54)/s or Giα2 (1-122)/s chimera (not shown). The inability of agents that elevate intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation, like cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, and forskolin, as well as the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP itself to induce differentiation of F9 stem cells (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 2Rickles R.J. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. J. Biol.

Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1460-C1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with the lack of correlation observed between activation of adenylylcyclase and promotion of PE observed herein. The differential effects of expression of Giα2 (1-54)/s on cyclic AMP accumulation (strongly stimulated) versus tPA secretion (strongly inhibited) highlight this point. The recent demonstration that suppression of Giα2 leads to increased phospholipase C activity in a variety of cells (17Watkins D.C. Moxham C.M. Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), prompted us to evaluate the PLC response by measuring IP3 and DAG generation (Fig. 6). Expression of Gsα and GsαG225T increased IP3 accumulation in the absence of morphogen. Substituting Giα2 N-terminal sequence from 7 to 212 residues for Gsα attenuated IP3 accumulation. This trend was broken, however, by clones expressing the Giα2 (1-64)/s chimera, which displayed nearly a 4-fold increase in IP3 accumulation over that observed in stem cells transfected with the empty vector alone (Fig. 6, left panel). These stimulated levels of IP3 generated in clones promoted to PE through expression of the Giα2 (1-64)/s chimera are in excess of those in F9 cells promoted to PE by RA itself. Expression of the Gsα/I-(38) chimera substituted in the N-terminus with Giα2 also promoted markedly enhanced PLC activity. The PLC activity of the clones expressing Gsα, G225T Gsα, Giα2 (1-64)/s, and Gsαi (320-355) chimeras remained elevated even when the clones were induced with RA (Fig. 6, center panel). DAG levels, explored in the absence of morphogen, confirmed the observations derived from IP3 mass measurements. Although equivalent with respect to adenylylcyclase activation (Fig. 3), the Giα2 (1-54)/s and Giα2 (1-64)/s chimeras can be differentiated by the ability of the latter to increase IP3 accumulation, to increase DAG accumulation (Fig. 6, right panel), and to promote conversion of stem cells to PE in the absence of morphogen (Fig. 5). Activation of PLC activity, evidenced by elevated IP3 and DAG levels, implicates protein kinase C in the signaling by the chimera. Analysis of protein kinase C activity in the absence of morphogen revealed a pattern of stimulation of protein kinase C (Fig. 7, left panel) not unlike that of IP3 and DAG accumulation (Fig. 6). Expression of GsαG225T and Gsα itself markedly activated protein kinase C, while substitution of Giα2 sequence in the N terminus of Gsα attenuated the elevated activity. The Giα2 (1-64)/s chimera, in contrast to the other members of the array of chimeras with increasing Giα2 substitution, displayed activation of protein kinase C similar to that of G225 Gsα, the constitutively active mutant of Gsα. Expression of the Gsαi (320-355) C-terminal substituted chimera also strongly activated protein kinase C. The rank order and relative scale for protein kinase C activation and progression to PE, measured by tPA secretion (Fig. 7, right panel), is remarkably similar. The MAP kinase regulatory network is an important conduit for signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus. We explored MAP kinase activity only in clones expressing chimeras that induce progression to PE in the absence of retinoic acid (Fig. 8). The peak values of MAP kinase activity were resolved on Mono-Q FPLC separations and assayed with the EGF receptor peptide. In close agreement with the effects of expression of the Gsα and Giα2 (1-64)/s chimeras uniquely on protein kinase C and differentiation, MAP kinase was strongly activated. Expression of the constitutively active form of Giα2 Q205L, providing a useful control, inhibits MAP kinase activation, much like it inhibited PLC activation, and the activation of protein kinase C and progression to PE. Immunoblotting of fractions from Mono-Q FPLC reveal multiple, phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase in extracts from the cells stably expressing the Giα2 (1-64)/s chimera that progress to PE in the absence of RA as compared with the MAP kinase forms in the F9 stem cells (Fig. 8B). These changes in MAP kinase activity and profiles on FPLC separations were noted previously in a comparison of extracts prepared from F9 stem cells with cells promoted to PE by treatment with RA (6Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The similarities between the rank orders for protein kinase C activation (Fig. 7, left panel), MAP kinase activity (Fig. 8), and progression to PE (Fig. 7, right panel) implicate both protein kinase C and MAP kinase in the regulation of stem cell conversion to PE. The progression of F9 stem cells to PE is induced by the morphogen RA. Early gene products include Gsα (18Chan S.D.H. Strewler G.J. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20081-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ERA1/Hox1.6 (19LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and RARα,β (20Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wu T.-C.J. Wang L. Wan Y.-J.Y. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which are synthesized within the first day of induction by RA. Giα2 expression falls precipitously (3Galvin-Parton P.A. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), early in RA-induced progression. Mimicking the decline in Giα2 via expression of antisense RNA promotes progression to PE in the absence of RA, while constitutive expression of Giα2 blocks the ability of RA to induce progression (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Likewise, enhanced expression of either wild-type Gsα or the G225T-activated mutant provokes progression in the absence of RA, mimicking the rise in Gsα induced early by RA (18Chan S.D.H. Strewler G.J. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20081-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Giα2 has been shown to tonically inhibit PLC activity, and elimination of Giα2 de-represses basal PLC as well as potentiates hormonal stimulation of PLC (17Watkins D.C. Moxham C.M. Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the decline in Giα2 triggers activation of PLC, protein kinase C, and MAP kinase as stem cells are induced to PE (6Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Gsα/Giα2 axis is shown in the present work to control stem cell progression via this pathway. Using activated mutants of these G-protein α-subunits and chimeras with various N- and C-terminal substitutions of Giα2 in Gsα revealed several important insights. Comparison of the effects of expressing the activated mutants and chimeras on progression with those on cyclic AMP accumulation clearly eliminates adenylylcyclase as the effector for progression, although it is the most prominent effector controlled by the Gsα/Giα2 axis. Based upon the concordance of the data for the activation of downstream elements by the activated subunits and chimeras, the target for regulation of progression appears to be PLC. Activation of PLC and protein kinase C by Gsα chimeras with N-terminal sequence of Giα2 demonstrated high sensitivity to even the smallest substitution, Giα2 (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V.

Substitution of Giα2 sequence at the C terminus, in contrast, enhanced the activation of PLC, protein kinase C, and MAP kinase, and progression to PE. Unexpectedly, substitutions in the N-terminal region of Gsα residues-(62-86) (corresponding to Giα2 sequence-(55-64)) were found to have a profound effect on PLC regulation, suggesting that this region of the Gsα molecule, when aligned with the crystal structure of other heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits (22Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), is involved in regulation of PLC (Fig. 9, highlighted in blue). This region of the molecule is the site of the insertion of the intervening peptide sequence GGEEDPQAARSNSDG that distinguishes the long and short forms of Gsα, a product of differential splicing of mRNA (24Robishaw J.D. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9587-9590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although speculation, this intervening sequence may act as an inhibitor of PLC activation in the long form of Gsα, providing an explanation for the profound increase in PLC activation occurring in the Giα2 (1-64)/s chimera that lacks this short region (14Gupta S.K. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Osawa S. Dhanasekaran N. Woon C.W. Johnson G.L.

Biochem. 1991; 47: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The -(62-86) region of Gsα is also topographically distinct from the region (Fig. 9, highlighted in yellow) implicated in the control of adenylylcyclase (25Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as well as from the regions on the aligned sequence of Gqα (α-helix 3) recently shown to be involved in PLC activation, as deduced by alanine scanning mutagenesis (26Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of this interesting region of Gsα and its influence on PLC activation will be required. Our results do suggest that signaling via PLC, regulated via the Gsα/Giα2 axis, is critical to induction of stem cell progression to PE, and presumably mammalian embryogenesis."

The purpose of this paper was to obtain large amounts of soluble Bcl-2 protein for structural and functional studies. Mouse Bcl-2(1-203) (missing the COOH-terminal hydrophobic tail) was produced in bacterial inclusion bodies, solubilized in guanidine, and refolded by dialysis. The resulting protein was monomeric in nondenaturing solution and was active in protecting mouse T hybridoma cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Refolded Bcl-2(1-203) showed no tendency to homodimerize by gel filtration or analytical ultracentrifugation. Limited proteolysis experiments identified a region between the BH3 and BH4 homology domains of Bcl-2(1-203) which was extremely susceptible to digestion by several common proteases, but not by a cell extract known to contain CPP-32-like (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family) protease activity. The protease-sensitive sites were located within a 50-residue stretch that contained most of the nonconserved and proline residues of Bcl-2(1-203). Trypsin-cleaved Bcl-2(1-203) eluted in the same position as the undigested protein on gel filtration in nondenaturing solution, indicating that the two portions of the molecule connected by the protease-sensitive region associate stably and noncovalently. The solution properties of Bcl-2(1-203) suggest that it consists of two noncovalently associated domains connected by a long protease-sensitive linker and that its structure is similar to that of Bcl-xL, which has been determined by x-ray and NMR analysis. Bcl-2 is a cytoplasmic integral membrane protein with potent anti-apoptotic activity but whose mechanism of action is poorly understood. The purpose of this paper was to obtain large amounts of soluble Bcl-2 protein for structural and functional studies. Mouse Bcl-2(1-203) (missing the COOH-terminal hydrophobic tail) was produced in bacterial inclusion bodies, solubilized in guanidine, and refolded by dialysis. The resulting protein was monomeric in nondenaturing solution and was active in protecting mouse T hybridoma cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Refolded Bcl-2(1-203) showed no tendency to homodimerize by gel filtration or analytical ultracentrifugation. Limited proteolysis experiments identified a region between the BH3 and BH4 homology domains of Bcl-2(1-203) which was extremely susceptible to digestion by several common proteases, but not by a cell extract known to contain CPP-32-like (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family) protease activity.

Bcl-2 was first detected as a t(14:18) chromosomal translocation in follicular B cell lymphomas/leukemias (1Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) which placed the Bcl-2 gene under the control of the Ig heavy chain promoter, resulting in its overproduction. Subsequent work indicated that overexpression of Bcl-2 prolonged cell survival (2Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and inhibited programmed cell death induced by multiple, diverse stimuli including growth factor withdrawal, glucocorticoids, and γ-irradiation (3Reed J.C.

Bcl-2 is an intracellular transmembrane protein and was the first member described of a new family of structurally related proteins which now includes Bax, Bak, Bcl-x, ced-9, Mcl-1, A1, NR13, Bad, and Bik, all of which either promote or inhibit programmed cell death (5Yin X.M.

A number of studies have identified four domains that are highly conserved among Bcl-2 family members and which are required for Bcl-2 function. From the NH2 terminus, these Bcl-2 homology regions are designated BH4, BH3, BH1, and BH2 (see Fig. 6). Mutational analyses of Bcl-2 have shown that amino acid residues within BH4, BH1, and BH2 are required for its anti-apoptotic activity (7Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.C. Tschopp J. J.

In addition, immunoprecipitation or yeast two-hybrid experiments have demonstrated that Bcl-2 forms homodimers using residues within BH4, BH1, and BH2 (9Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Bcl-2 also heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, resulting in enhanced cell survival (9Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray and NMR structures of the cytoplasmic portion of Bcl-xL, a molecule sharing 35% amino acid sequence identity with Bcl-2, have been published (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The structure consists of seven associated α-helices and a long flexible region that connects the first and second helices. The first helix (α1) comprises most of BH4, whereas the remaining helices lie in the COOH-terminal part of the molecule which contains BH1, BH2, and BH3. The flexible domain corresponds to a region of the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 molecules which exhibits the greatest variability in amino acid sequence between molecules from different species and Bcl-2 family members. Unlike the BH1-4 regions, the flexible domain can be deleted without loss of anti-apoptotic activity (7Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Since most previous studies have focused on Bcl-2 rather than Bcl-x, it is important to establish that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x have similar structures. Previous work showed that mouse Bcl-2 truncated at residue 203 (approximately 12 residues NH2-terminal of the transmembrane portion) retained biologic activity (8Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Borner C. Olivier R. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Martinou J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current paper we have produced recombinant mouse Bcl-2(1-203) in bacteria. We show that refolded Bcl-2(1-203) is active, contains a long, protease-sensitive portion that corresponds to the Bcl-2 variable region, and that the NH2- and COOH-terminal portions remain noncovalently associated following digestion. Our data indicate that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x have similar structures. DNA encoding Bcl-2(1-203) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a plasmid containing a full-length murine Bcl-2 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Jeff Huth, NIDDK, Bethesda, MD) using 5′ primer CTTGCAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGCGCAAGCCGGGAGAACA and 3′ primer GTTAGCAGCCCTCGAGTTATTACATGCTGGGGCCATATA. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned directly into pCR™II with an Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) TA cloning kit. The insert encoding Bcl-2(1-203) was removed by digestion with NdeI and XhoI and subcloned into NdeI/XhoI sites of pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI). Sequence analysis using the dideoxy chain termination procedure confirmed that the insert contained the correct Bcl-2(1-203) sequence. The BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the pET21aBcl-2(1-203) plasmid for protein expression. Transformed bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.4-0.8 and induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (Calbiochem) as described (17Kurucz I. Jost C.R. George A.J.T. Andrew S.M. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3830-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of 5 × TE (1 × TE = 0.01 M Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) for each 500 ml of culture. Chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the bacteria were incubated 1 h at 30°C and then frozen at −20°C. After thawing, purified inclusion bodies were prepared by washing (17Kurucz I. Jost C.R. George A.J.T. Andrew S.M. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3830-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purified inclusion bodies were stored at −70°C. Purified inclusion bodies containing Bcl-2(1-203) protein were solubilized in 6 M guanidine HCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol and diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in the same solvent. This solution was dialyzed at 4°C against 10 volumes of TE containing 0.4 M arginine, 1 mM dithiothreitol for 24 h with two solution changes. The dialyzed protein was concentrated with Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and fractionated on a 100 × 2.6-cm Sephacryl S-200 preparative gel filtration column in the same solvent (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The peak corresponding to monomeric Bcl-2(1-203) was collected, concentrated, and stored at 4°C. In later experiments, the guanidine-solubilized protein was dialyzed twice against 10 volumes of TE containing 0.4 M arginine and twice against 10 volumes of borate-buffered saline (BBS 1The abbreviations used are: BBSborate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusing.; 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium borate, pH 8.5) at 4°C, centrifuged for 10 min at 32,000 × g, and the supernatant concentrated. Protein prepared in this way was as homogeneous as Bcl-2(1-203) that had been purified by gel filtration. borate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing. The transient transfection death assay was performed as described previously (18Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar) except that refolded Bcl-2 protein instead of a Bcl-2 plasmid expression vector was electroporated into cells. Bovine serum albumin or Bcl-2(1-203) refolded protein (approximately 1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against RPMI 1640 with 20 mM HEPES. 2B4.11 cells were pelleted and resuspended in the protein solution to which 5 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase reporter and 10 μg of pCIFas (expression vector for human Fas) DNA were added per cuvette. Following electroporation, the cells were cultured in medium or treated with dexamethasone or anti-Fas monoclonal antibody CH11 (Kamiya, Thousand Oaks, CA). The transfected cells were incubated overnight and assayed for β-galactosidase as described (18Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was done with a Pharmacia PhastSystem™. Homogeneous 20% gels and pH 3-9 gels were used for SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing (IEF), respectively. All gels shown in this study were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Analytical gel filtration was done using an HR 10/30 Superdex 75 column in BBS on a Pharmacia FPLC™ unit. Protein concentration was determined using a calculated E280 of 1.7 for a 1 mg/ml solution (19Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal protein sequencing was done by Patricia Spinella, Protein Expression Laboratory, NIH, using an Applied Biosystems Protein Sequencer. Trypsin-digested Bcl-2(1-203) was run on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene disulfide membrane, and individual bands were sequenced. Detergent extracts from anti-Fas-treated apoptotic Jurkat cells were a gift from Dr. Ming-Lei Wu, NCI. They were prepared essentially as described (20Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and hydrolyzed the fluorogenic substrate ZDEVD-AFC (which measures CPP-32-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family proteolytic activity) at a 1:250 dilution. Molecular weights were determined by equilibrium sedimentation by David Millar (NIDDK) using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Bcl-2(1-203) was dialyzed against BBS and loaded into centrifuge cells at concentrations of 0.44, 0.27, and 0.13 mg/ml. Equilibrium runs were done for 48 h at 5°C at a rotor speed of 12,000 rpm. Data were analyzed using Beckman software. Mouse Bcl-2(1-203), a 22.5-kDa protein that lacks the membrane-spanning region, was produced in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. Fig. 1A shows that induced bacteria produced large amounts of a 25-kDa protein that was easily purified by washing the inclusion bodies. After solubilization in guanidine and dialysis, the resulting protein eluted on gel filtration in nondenaturing solution as a single peak with an Mr of 22,000 (Fig. 1B). Column-purified Bcl-2(1-203) gave a single band by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and two very closely spaced bands by IEF near the predicted isoelectric point of 6.05 (Fig. 1C). The IEF results revealed minor heterogeneity, perhaps due to partial deamidation of Asn or Gln residues. NH2-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the refolded protein was indeed Bcl-2 (see Fig. 6). Bcl-2(1-203) protein was soluble at 1-2 mg/ml in physiological buffers but precipitated at higher concentrations; typical yields were 5-10 mg of refolded Bcl-2(1-203)/liter of bacteria. Since misfolded proteins tend to aggregate in nondenaturing solvents (21Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and precipitate on IEF gels, these data suggest that Bcl-2(1-203) was folded correctly. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-2(1-203) inhibits dexamethasone-induced, but not Fas-mediated, apoptosis in the mouse T cell hybridoma 2B4.11 (18Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). To determine if the bacterially expressed and refolded Bcl-2(1-203) protein was functionally active, 2B4 cells were electroporated with either bovine serum albumin or Bcl-2(1-203) protein (Table I). A plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was cotransfected to provide a measure of viable, transfected cells (18Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar). The refolded Bcl-2(1-203) protein inhibited dexamethasone-induced death, at two different concentrations, but did not block anti-Fas-induced death. Thus, the bacterially produced Bcl-2(1-203) protein showed qualitatively the same anti-apoptotic activity as the transfected full-length Bcl-2 gene.Table IBcl-2(1-203) inhibits apoptosisProgrammed cell death inducer% CytotoxicityBSABcl-2Experiment 1Dex (10 nM)34−8Dex (100 nM)5618Anti-Fas mAb (5 ng/ml)4641Experiment 2Dex (10 nM)3316Dex (100 nM)5726Anti-Fas mAb (5 ng/ml)2822 Open table in a new tab Because Bcl-2 has been reported to homodimerize (9Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 10Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we asked whether recombinant Bcl-2(1-203) would form aggregates in solution. Initial studies using size exclusion chromatography at different Bcl-2(1-203) concentrations failed to reveal stable self-association. Analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation was therefore used as a more sensitive probe of aggregation. At equilibrium, the mass distribution data were best fit by a single species with a molecular mass of 23 kDa, with less than 3% aggregate, over the full concentration range tested (Fig. 2). The highest concentration of Bcl-2(1-203) in the centrifuge cell exceeded 0.5 mg/ml (22 μM). At this concentration we would have detected self-association if the Kd had been 200 μM or less. We next probed the structure of Bcl-2(1-203) by limited proteolysis using three relatively nonspecific proteases. When Bcl-2(1-203) was incubated with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or papain, discrete bands were produced by each of the proteases at low protease:Bcl-2 ratios (Fig. 3). Trypsin digestion at a weight ratio as low as 1:6,400 gave two major fragments migrating at about 15 and 10 kDa. Chymotrypsin also produced two bands, one larger than the 15-kDa tryptic fragment, and one smaller than the 10-kDa peptide. Finally, papain produced a 12-kDa band and a larger fragment that disappeared rapidly. The fact that very low concentrations of three different proteases each produced one or two large fragments suggests that Bcl-2(1-203) contains one or more regions that are highly exposed, with the remaining regions being protected from proteolytic attack. In view of its high susceptibility to cleavage by common proteases, Bcl-2(1-203) was also tested with extracts from Jurkat cells that contained CPP-32-like (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family) protease activity. After a 30-min incubation at 37°C, undiluted cell extract did not cleave Bcl-2(1-203) (data not shown). Bcl-2(1-203) was digested with trypsin for various times, and the reaction products were examined by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B) showed that by 10 min, most of the Bcl-2(1-203) was digested into the two major fragments described above. Both bands appeared simultaneously, suggesting that they were produced by a single cleavage of the intact Bcl-2 molecule. In contrast, these same samples, when analyzed by gel filtration in nondenaturing solution (Fig. 4A) showed little evidence of fragmentation into peptides of the size observed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the two tryptic peptides remained associated by noncovalent interactions. To confirm this, Bcl-2(1-203) was digested with trypsin, fractionated by gel filtration, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Two gel filtration peaks were analyzed. The fraction (Fig. 5A, peak B) eluting at 21 kDa (the same position as intact, monomeric Bcl-2(1-203)) consisted of cleaved protein (Fig. 5B, lane 4), clearly demonstrating that the tryptic fragments associated noncovalently. The high molecular weight fraction (Fig. 5A, peak A), probably consisted of aggregated low molecular weight peptides since no large fragments were seen by SDS-PAGE with either Coomassie (Fig. 5B, lane 3) or silver (not shown) staining.Fig. 5Digested Bcl-2(1-203) behaves as monomeric protein in nondenaturing solution. Panel A, Bcl-2(1-203) (0.5 mg) was digested 15 min at 37°C with a 1:1,600 weight ratio of trypsin to Bcl-2, and the reaction was terminated with soybean trypsin inhibitor. After sitting overnight at 4°C, the sample was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a 10/30 Superdex 75 column in BBS. Two fractions, fraction A corresponding to highly aggregated material and fraction B corresponding to monomeric Bcl-2(1-203), were collected and concentrated. Panel B, SDS-PAGE analysis of undigested Bcl-2(1-203) (lane 1), digested Bcl-2(1-203) prior to fractionation (lane 2), peak A (lane 3), and peak B (lane 4). Peak A probably consisted of small peptides that aggregated on standing but dissociated in SDS and ran off the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the protease-sensitive sites of Bcl-2(1-203), three tryptic fragments were NH2-terminally sequenced (Fig. 6). Fragment 2, the 15-kDa band, was produced by cleavage at Arg68 and fragment 3, the 10-kDa band, had the same NH2-terminal sequence as intact Bcl-2(1-203). Thus it is likely that cleavage at Arg68 produced fragments 2 and 3. Fragment 1 was a very faint band that migrated at the same rate as the high molecular weight chymotryptic fragment. It arose by cleavage at Phe49 and was probably due to contaminating chymotrypsin in our trypsin preparation. In view of the fact that Bcl-2(1-203) contains potential trypsin and chymotrypsin sites throughout the molecule, it is clear that residues 49 and 68 were particularly susceptible to proteolytic attack. Refolded mouse Bcl-2(1-203) is a biologically active protein that is soluble and monomeric in nondenaturing solution. By contrast, misfolded proteins almost invariably aggregate in solution (21Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and lack biological activity. It is highly likely, therefore, that the recombinant Bcl-2(1-203) used in this study was folded correctly. Bacterially produced mouse Bcl-2(1-203) has thus provided a source of soluble protein suitable for probing the structure and function of the Bcl-2 cytoplasmic domain. Previous reports showed that Bcl-2 homodimerizes in mammalian cells or in yeast two-hybrid systems (9Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 10Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar); in contrast, Bcl-xL fails to homodimerize (22Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that recombinant Bcl-xL does not dimerize either in solution or in the crystal (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). However, the failure of recombinant mouse Bcl-2(1-203) to self-associate even at relatively high protein concentrations appears to be inconsistent with previous results. One reason for this inconsistency could be that residues COOH-terminal to 203 are required for homodimerization. Hanada et al. (10Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) showed by yeast two-hybrid analysis that residues between 196 and 218 in human Bcl-2 (193-215 in the mouse) are necessary for homodimerization, but whether residues between 203 and 215 are required for self-association is not known. Another reason might be that bacterially produced Bcl-2 lacks post-translational modifications, present in yeast or mammalian cells, which are required for homodimerization. Bcl-2 can be phosphorylated (23Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 24Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but other modifications are also possible. The most striking feature of the Bcl-2(1-203) molecule is its extraordinary susceptibility to a variety of proteases. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain all rapidly produced one or two well defined fragments at low protease:Bcl-2 ratios, even though multiple potential cleavage sites were present throughout the molecule. The sites cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin were located within a region of Bcl-2 which is highly variable in amino acid sequence between species and between Bcl-2 and Bcl-x (shaded residues in Fig. 6). The Bcl-2 variable region is also rich in the helix-breaking residue, proline, which varies from 20 to 24% in the variable regions of mouse, chicken, and human Bcl-2 compared with 3-4% in the conserved regions. Interestingly, this region also contains very few aspartate residues, the cleavage site for interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family proteases, which may explain why Bcl-2(1-203) was not susceptible to proteolysis by the Jurkat cell extracts. The exquisite sensitivity of the Bcl-2 variable region to proteolysis is readily understood from the Bcl-xL NMR and x-ray results (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), assuming that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have similar structures. Both NMR and x-ray analyses indicate that the Bcl-xL variable region is highly mobile, flexible, and exposed to solvent. The conserved regions, on the other hand, are rigid, compact, and mostly inaccessible to solvent. It is therefore not surprising that the variable region exhibits a high preferential susceptibility to proteolytic attack. In Bcl-xL, the two portions of the molecule which are joined by the variable loop form a globular structure consisting of seven interacting α-helices with the helix in the NH2-terminal portion (BH4), making extensive hydrophobic contacts with helices in the COOH-terminal region (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Our observation that the cleaved Bcl-2 molecule behaves as it were the undigested, monomeric protein in nondenaturing solution demonstrates that the two halves of the Bcl-2 molecule associate with high affinity, as might be expected from the x-ray structure of Bcl-xL. Thus, the biochemical analysis of Bcl-2(1-203) indicates that it most likely has the same general structure as Bcl-xL. A long variable region has been preserved in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x of all species, suggesting that it has an important function. However, in transfection experiments, this region is not required for anti-apoptotic activity (7Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the variable region may serve as a site for proteolytic attack or other modification in vivo, to control Bcl-2 function or turnover. We were unable to detect degradation of Bcl-2(1-203) by interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family proteases, but other proteolytic activities would be expected to cleave Bcl-2 rapidly. Cleaved Bcl-2 could lose its ability to neutralize death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family, thus leading to apoptosis. Another possible function of the variable region might be to serve as a long, flexible linker that would allow the BH4 region of one molecule to interact with either another Bcl-2 molecule or with other Bcl-2 family members, even when Bcl-2 family members were present at low densities. For this to happen, however, the stable association between BH4 and the COOH-terminal region within a molecule would have to be disrupted. Regulation of the internal association between these regions, perhaps by post-translational modification, might therefore be an important aspect of Bcl-2 structure and function. We thank Drs. Pierre Henkart and John Ashwell for thoughtful suggestions concerning the manuscript.

NK cells have the ability to lyse tumor cells and play a crucial role in the control of viral infections. NK cells, like cytolytic T cells (CTL), respond specifically to polymorphic determinants of MHC class I molecules. NK cells express receptors that bind to these molecules. However, instead of activating the cytolytic response as in CTLs the recognition of MHC class I turns off the NK cells. Therefore, virus infected and malignant transformed cells are lysed by NK cells as a consequence of loss of MHC class I surface expression (for reviews, see 1Robertson M.J. Ritz J.

In addition to the allotype MHC class I specific receptors almost all human NK cells express the low-affinity receptor for the Fc portion of IgG, FcγRIII-A (CD16-A). FcγRIII-A belongs to the family of immunoglobulin G receptors (FcγR) involved in the clearance of immune complexes, phagocytosis of opsonized pathogens, and various forms of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (3Van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The FcγRIII-A α chain forms a multimeric transmembrane receptor complex with homo- and heterodimers of the FcϵRIγ subunit and/or CD3ζ subunit (4Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V.

FcγRIII is also highly expressed in PMN but as a single chain receptor attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, FcγRIII-B. The transmembrane FcγRIII-A receptor on NK cells mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and all other antibody-dependent responses (7Werfel T. Uciechowski P. Tetteroo P.A.T. Kurrle R.

The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked FcγRIII-B receptor on PMN is involved in cell activation but its detailed role is less clear (10Hundt M. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J.

Other surface molecules like FcγRII-A and CR3 receptors are likely to be involved in the activation process of PMN after FcγRIII-B cross-linking (13Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Stöckl J. Majdic O. Pickl W.F. Rosenkranz A. Prager E. Gschwantler E. Knapp W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5452-5463PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the expression of functionally distinct FcγRIII isoforms is given by the presence of the highly homologous FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes (15Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments of reporter gene constructs indicate that differences in the proximal −198/−10 gene promoter regions might be crucial for directing the expression of the FcγRIII-A and B receptors to NK cells and PMN, respectively (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The characterization of the molecular events leading to NK cell-specific FcγRIII-A expression is complicated by the finding that transcripts initiating outside the −198/−10 Pprox promoter exist in NK cells (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Schmidt R.E. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of these FcγRIII-A transcripts, designated a2/3 and a5/6, demonstrated that they encode the known FcγRIII-A receptor. The coexpression of FcγRIII-A transcripts with alterations in the extracellular domain were also evident but could not be linked to the distinct a2/3 and a5/6 mRNA start sites. The medial −1817/−850 region of the FcγRIII-A gene containing the a2/3 and a5/6 initiation sites functioned as a transcriptional regulator in the immature NK cell line YT. This control region consisted of the two independent promoters Pmed1 (−942/−850) and Pmed2 (−1376/−1123). The 93-bp −942/−850 Pmed1 promoter was further characterized. It contained a cis-acting DNA element important in conferring optimal and YT cell-specific promoter activity within its first 21 bp. These results suggested that this DNA element might be a useful target for identification of YT and NK cell restricted transcription factors. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN), peripheral blood mononuclar cells (adherent cell fraction, MO), and NK cells were prepared according to standard conditions described elsewhere (9Uciechowski P.

The γ/δ T cell (MK1) and cytotoxic T cell (1B3) clones derived from donors with distinct CD16 subsets from sorted fractions were generated by limiting dilution. Clones were plated at 1 cell/well onto a feeder layer with irradiated allogeneic PBL and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cells (Laz509) (8Uciechowski P. Werfel T. Leo R. Gessner J.E. Schubert J. Schmidt R.E. Immunobiology. 1992; 185: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Human tumor cell lines HL60 and YT used for transfection experiments were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplements (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HL60 is a promyelocytic cell line and YT a cell line with NK cell characteristics (20Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yodoi J. Teshigawara K. Nikaido T. Fukui K. Noma T. Honjo T. Takigawa M. Sasaki M. Minato N. Tsudo M. Uchiyama T. Maeda M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, HL60 cells were induced to express the FcγRIII-B receptor isoform upon culturing in the presence of 1.2% Me2SO (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The strategy to obtain cDNA clones for a1, a2/3, and a5/6 related transcription initiation sites was nearly identical to that described recently (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Starting with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from NK cells, the reverse transcription reaction was performed using 20 pmol of a FcγRIII-A gene-specific primer reverse complementary to EC1 sequences from exon V. The cDNA pools were subsequently tailed with 15 units of TdT (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 0.1 mM dATP for 10 min at 37°C. After purification of the reaction mixture, one-fifth was used for PCR amplification with 10 pmol of oligo(dT)17-adaptor, 25 pmol of adaptor, and 25 pmol of a second internal EC1 primer in a total volume of 100 μl. 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) was added and the mixture was annealed at 56°C for 2 min. The tailed cDNA was extended at 72°C for 30 min. PCR conditions were as described (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified RACE PCR products were digested with SalI and BglII and cloned into SalI/BamHI-digested pKS+, as outlined in Fig. 2. Miniprep plasmid DNA was sequenced using the 32P-labeled second EC1 primer. Analysis of the distinct FcγRIII transcript classes by primer extension and RNase protection assay was performed according to methods described previously (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (22Chirgwin J.W. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). The complementary oligonucleotide used for primer extension, 5′-CTTCCTCGTGTTACCCAGGTCCTGCGGATT-3′ (−795 to −824), corresponds to the genomic FcγRIII-A sequence relative to the translation start codon (ATG). 10-50 μg of various RNAs were annealed to this 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide. The extension products were sized by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The dideoxynucleotide sequencing ladder of a plasmid containing the sequence with the transcription start sites was used as a molecular weight marker and run in parallel. For RNase protection analysis of a2/3 and b2 transcription initiation sites, the 236-bp HincII/ApaI restriction fragment from the FcγRIII-A gene (−942 to −707) was inserted into the pBluescript KS(+) vector. For analysis of transcripts encoding for extracellular alterations an SalI/PvuII fragment containing the EC1/EC2 exon border (position 258 to 406) of the pGP5 derived NA1 FcγRIII-B cDNA (23Peltz G.A. Grundy H.O. Lebo R.V. Yssel H. Barsh G.S. Moore K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was used and cloned into pKS+. The respective antisense RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase. All other conditions were the same as described previously (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNAs were reverse transcribed using 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR for amplification of the cDNA pool was started following a denaturing step at 94°C with the addition of Taq DNA polymerase after 10 min at 85°C. 35 cycles were done each including a 40-s denaturing step at 94°C, a 30-s annealing step at 52°C or 64°C depending on the primer pair in use, a 45-s extension step at 72°C, followed by a final 5-min extension at 72°C. 5′ primers specific for the distinct 5′-UTR of a2/3 (5′-AATCCGCAGGACCTGGGTAACAC-3′, −824 to −802) and a5/6 (5′-TCCACCCCTAACAAGTATC-3′, −1157 to −1139) transcript classes were used with the same reverse complementary 3′ primer specific for the 3′-UTR originally described for a1 (5′-CAGAGGCCTGAGGATGATGGGGTTGC-3′, +829 to +854) (15Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The constructs were generated by cloning FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genomic sequences from −10 to −198, from −10 to −1817/−1821, from −850/−846 to −1817/−1821, from −850/−846 to −942/−947, and from −850/−846 to −921/−925 into the BamHI/BglII site of the promoterless luciferase expression vector pLuc. For promoter assays in the presence of the FcγRIII-A or the FcγRIII-B enhancer the sequence from position +10/+712 of both genes were cloned as a PvuII subfragment into the KpnI site 3′ to the luciferase gene. 5′ and 3′ deletion mutants were prepared from the medial −1817/−850 FcγRIII-A control region by the use of restriction sites at positions −1579, −1376, −1123, −942, and −921 for subcloning. Relevant deletion mutants from the corresponding FcγRIII-B region as well as some hybrid constructs were similarly generated. All constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method and purified over two rounds of centrifugation in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients. YT or HL60 cells, maintained at 1 or 2 × 107 cells/ml, were electroporated with 10 or 80 μg of the various reporter plasmids at 270 V and 750 or 2400 microfarads, using a Eurogentec gene pulser followed by transfer to 15 ml of prewarmed RPMI/10% fetal calf serum medium. Twenty hours after transfection cells were harvested and washed once in PBS. Cells were extracted in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) by two cycles of freezing and thawing. Luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold biolumat in 22.5 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.2 mM Luciferin. Functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human FcγRIII-A gene and the respective region of the highly homologous FcγRIII-B gene led to the identification of the Pprox (−198/−10) promoter regions which display different tissue-specific transcriptional activities in NK cells and PMN (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, RACE-PCR cloning indicated that additional FcγRIII-A mRNA start sites occurring outside the Pprox region exist in NK cells. From a total analysis of 11 cloned RACE PCR products 3 cDNA clones assigned as a2/3 were identified to initiate at two sites from −860 and −849 in a separate exon spliced from position −795 to −44 (a2) or to −62 (a3) (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We now extended the RACE PCR analysis and isolated 17 additional cDNA clones containing the 5′ ends of FcγRIII-A transcripts from NK cells. 7 clones contained the 5′-UTR of transcript class FcγRIII-A a1 (start sites at −20, −27, and −33) and 7 other clones contained a2 but not a3 starting at −865, −871, −877, −881, and −891 (summarized in Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The remaining 3 cDNA clones contained sequences from a further upstream region of the FcγRIII-A gene and represented novel transcript classes assigned as a5/6 (Fig. 2). FcγRIII-Aa5 initiate at positions −1278 and −1254, whereas FcγRIII-Aa6 initiated at −1273. These 5′-untranslated ends of the a5/6 transcripts were encoded by exon I ending at position −900 (a5) or alternatively at −946 (a6) and spliced to −44 now recognized as the 5′-border of exon III. This splice site at −44 was used by a2 as well as a5/6 transcripts. That position is the strongest protected fragment in RNase protection experiments from FcγRIII-A expressing NK cells but not from FcγRIII-B expressing PMN (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Next, we performed primer extension and RNase protection to determine the a2/3 start sites more precisely. In the RNase protection experiments the FcγRIII-A specific riboprobe ranging from −942 to −707 covering the 3′-border of exon II at −795 from the ATG was used, as described under “Materials and Methods.” This analysis was done using RNA from various cells types. Multiple bands were observed preferentially in NK cells and 1B3 T cells, in very reduced amounts in culture activated peripheral blood monocytes but not in U937, HL60, and YT cell lines (Fig. 3). As shown on the right side of Fig. 3 one major protected fragment which mapped to position −887, as well as several minor products ranging from −865 to −889 were observed in NK cells. Consistent with these data, primer extension experiments located the a2/3 transcription initiation sites to the same region, with the major site identified at position −865 and minor sites at −867, −871, −872, −873, −878, −880, and −884. We also analyzed transcription initiation from the same region of the FcγRIII-B gene using RNA from Me2SO-treated HL60 cells and PMN (lanes 3, 9, and 13 in Fig. 3). Differentiation of HL60 cells by Me2SO resulted in no induction of FcγRIII-Bb2 transcript initiation. In contrast, induction of FcγRIII-Bb1 transcript initiation is evident (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both primer extension and RNase protection identified the major FcγRIII-Bb2 mRNA start site in PMN at position −875 from the ATG translation start codon. That the −875 start site in PMN is specifically driven by the FcγRIII-B and not the FcγRIII-A gene was assessed by RT-PCR cloning and sequence analysis from PMN of two NA-2 homozygous donors. Specificity was demonstrated for several independent cDNA clones by the presence of nucleotides T and C at positions 147 and 141 within the exon V encoding the EC1 domain, as shown in Fig. 4, left side. The heterogeneity and the level of transcription of the distinct FcγRIII-A as well as FcγRIII-B mRNAs suggested the presence of simultaneously active but separate transcriptional control regions within each FcγRIII gene in their respective cell types. Alternative FcγRIII promoters could regulate the tissue-specific expression of transcripts encoding for additional FcγRIII-A or FcγRIII-B gene derived receptor-related isoforms within a single cell. As a first step testing this possibility we performed RNase protection experiments with a riboprobe containing a partially overlapping sequence from exons V/VI encoding the two extracellular EC1 and EC2 domains of FcγRIIIA. For the synthesis of the riboprobe a 147-bp portion of the cDNA pGP5 from the SalI site in exon V to the PvuII site in exon VI was subcloned in sense orientation upstream of the phage T7 promoter within the pKS+ plasmid to generate pEC1-2, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Analysis was done by hybridizing the EC1/EC2 spanning riboprobe made from pEC1-2 to various FcγRIII-A positive and negative RNAs. As expected, in the negative HL60, U937, Jurkat, and YT cell lines and with the control yeast tRNA no FcγRIII-A specific fragments protected by the riboprobe were detected. Interestingly, NK cells, 1B3 cytotoxic T cells, MK1 γ/δ T cells, and culture activated monocytes, all of them encoding the FcγRIII-A receptor on the cell surface, demonstrated coexpression of full-length transcripts along with transcripts containing alterations within the EC1/EC2 domains. As shown in Fig. 4, two protected fragments of 73/74 and of 147 nucleotides can be distinguished. The 147-nucleotide fragment matched the used EC1/EC2 overlap. The 73/74-nucleotide fragment was mainly protected from exon V derived EC1 sequences. Using an exon IV/V overlapping riboprobe only one protected fragment was observed (data not shown). These results indicated the effective transcription of normal FcγRIII-A as well as splice alternatives beyond exon V. Whether such splice variants led to the production of FcγRIII-A related receptors remains to be addressed. To determine the potential correlation between exon V/VI splice variants and separate clusters of transcription initiation we performed RT-PCR analysis using RNA from NK cells with distinct a2/3 or a5/6 specific 5′-UTR primers and a single 3′ end primer complementary to known FcγRIII-A 3′-UTR sequences, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Using this strategy of amplification, a2/3 and a5/6 main products of 928/946 and 1156/1110 bp were generated indicating no gross alteration within exons V and VI encoding for the extracellular domains (Fig. 5). This was also verified by sequence analysis (data not shown). Therefore, the transcript classes a2/3 and a5/6 encode for the same FcγRIII-A receptor in NK cells as originally demonstrated for a1 (15Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Differences in the cell type specific activities of the proximal −198/−10 FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B Pprox gene promoters were most evident in combination with enhancer elements. Such elements might be provided by intronic sequences from +10 to +712 between exon III and IV or the more upstream regions from −1817 or −1821 to −198 in both genes, as described recently (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Schmidt R.E. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The newly identified FcγRIII-A and -B transcription initiation clusters now suggest that differential promoter activities would not be restricted to the proximal −198/−10 regions but could also be located to the stimulatory −1817/−1821 to −198 upstream regions. To examine this possibility we first linked the −1817/−850 and −1821/−846 fragments from the FcγRIII-A/B upstream regions covering with their most 3′ ends the a2/3 or b2 mRNA start sites to the promoterless luciferase gene. The reporter plasmids pIII-A(−1817/−850) + (intr.A)Luc and pIII-B(−1821/−846) + (intr.B)Luc which also contain their respective intron enhancers cloned downstream to the luciferase gene were then transfected into HL60 and YT cells. These two cell lines were used in all our functional studies. Although presenting a more immature phenotype they can serve as model systems for PMN and NK cells, as described earlier (16Gessner J.E. Grussenmeyer T. Kolanus W. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1350-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the −1817/−850 region of FcγRIIIA produced a strong luciferase activity in the immature NK cell line YT. The amount of activity observed in HL60 cells was strongly reduced and a weak expression was seen only in the presence of the intron enhancer. Compared with the complete −1817/−10 and the proximal −198/−10 regions the −1817/−850 sequence caused a significant higher promoter activity but a similar cell type specificity with preferential expression in YT cells. Such promoter activities were not detected in transfected Jurkat T cells and myeloid U937 cells (data not shown). From these data we conclude that in addition to the −198/−10 FcγRIII-A Pprox promoter the −1817/−850 upstream region acts as an YT specific transcriptional regulator. This region will be referred to as the medial control region of the FcγRIII-A gene. Surprisingly, the same −1821/−846 medial region from the FcγRIIIB gene did not produce significant luciferase activity in HL60 cells even in the presence of its endogenous intron enhancer. Very low activity could be detected in YT cells. As shown in Fig. 6, this was in sharp contrast to the results when using the complete −1821/−10 and the proximal −198/−10 FcγRIII-B regions. Reporter plasmids containing these latter sequences produced very strong promoter activities specific for HL60 cells. Our data indicate that HL60 cells lack some factors necessary for proper function of the medial but not the proximal FcγRIII-B promoters. Based on these observations we focused in our subsequent analysis mainly on the FcγRIII-A medial control region. After establishing the contribution of the FcγRIII-A medial control region in YT cell-specific expression we addressed the question whether the cis-acting sequences from this region were sufficient and responsible for constitutive promoter activity and cell type specificity. Two series of 5′ and 3′ deletion mutants were generated and cloned upstream to the luciferase gene into reporter plasmids lacking the endogenous intron enhancer and tested by transfection into YT cells. This approach provided evidence that the FcγRIII-A medial control region consists of two separate promoters, termed Pmed1 and Pmed2. These two promoter activities appeared to be YT cell specific. All of the deletion mutants were almost negative for luciferase expression when transfected into HL60 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7, different FcγRIII-A 5′ deletion mutants originating at position −1817 produced variable amounts of luciferase activities in YT cells suggesting the presence of compensatory enhancer, repressor as well as promoter elements. The original reporter plasmid pIII-A(−1817/−850)Luc produced luciferase activities in the range of 15 to 23 ×103 relative light units (RLU) which were set as 100% relative activity. As an internal standard we used the pTK luciferase control plasmid. Deletion of the most upstream region from −1817 to −1579 drastically reduced activity indicating the presence of a stimulatory element. Further deletion to position −1376 caused an increase to full luciferase expression. This suggested that negative regulatory sequences reside in the −1579 to −1376 region which might be compensated by the enhancer element from the most upstream region. To analyze whether the −1579 to −1376 region acted as a silencer, this part of the FcγRIII-A gene was cloned upstream to the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter into the pTK luciferase control plasmid and transfected into YT cells. A reduction in the expression levels down to 26% was achieved indicating that this property of repression is transferable to a heterologous promoter (data not shown). Luciferase activity continued in more extensive 5′ deletion mutants containing the −942 to −850 sequence covering all of the mapped a2/3 mRNA start sites. The −942/−850 sequence within the FcγRIII-A med"

Previously, we presented experimental results suggesting that dephosphorylation of phosphorylated tyrosine moieties of specific cellular proteins is involved in the early stage of MEL cell differentiation, which includes induction of the differentiation by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (7Kondo K.

Kume T. Oishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 67: 17116-17120Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and lack of tyrosine dephosphorylation in differentiation-defective mutant cells (11Watanabe T. Kume T. Oishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 67: 17116-17120Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Furthermore, two intracellular protein factors implicated in MEL cell differentiation had characteristics of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein and a PTPase, respectively (12Watanabe T. Oishi M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar). In more recent studies, we found that transcripts of two new PTPases, termed RIP and PTPβ2, were induced at a very early stage of differentiation (13Kume T. Tsuneizumi K. Watanabe T. Thomas M.L. Oishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4709-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have cloned full-length cDNA for RIP (14Chida D. Kume T. Mukouyama Y. Tabata Y. Nomura N. Thomas M.L. Watanabe T. Oishi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and PTPβ2. Here we report cloning of a full-length cDNA for PTPβ2 and show that introduction and subsequent expression of the full-length PTPβ2 cDNA in MEL cells, but not RIP cDNA, convert a significant portion (20-38%) of the cells to erythroid-like cells. Dominant-negative experiments using altered PTPβ2 cDNA constructs further suggested that PTPβ2 is involved in triggering MEL cell erythroid differentiation.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that expression of a specific PTPase, PTPβ2, induced biochemical and physiological changes that are quite similar to those associated with in vitro and in vivo erythroid differentiation. Those include: 1) induction of hemoglobin and ALAS-E and glycophorin transcripts, 2) loss of growth proficiency, 3) cellular commitment to erythroid cells, and 4) sensitivity to specific inhibitors for MEL cell erythroid differentiation. The dominant-negative experiments using transfectants expressing altered PTPβ2 transcripts further suggest that PTPβ2 is involved in in vitro erythroid differentiation induced by conventional erythroid-inducing agents.The results presented above, however, are still premature to conclude that PTPβ2 is actually responsible for triggering erythroid differentiation. For example, although all the characteristics induced by the expression of PTPβ2 so far examined were essentially the same as that observed in erythroid differentiation, the maximum efficiency of differentiation (20-38%) by the expression of PTPβ2 was approximately half of those (70∼80%) obtained by conventional erythroid-inducing agents. Several possibilities can be considered to explain the difference. Expression, stability, or intracellular location of the PTPβ2 induced through the artificial cDNA constructs may be different from that induced by erythroid-inducing agents. Alternatively, another cascade of molecular events may exist besides the PTPβ2 dephosphorylation cascade, and activation of that or both cascades leads to the full induction.There have been reports concerning expression of β-globin and other erythroid-specific genes by transcription factors (3Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Expression of transcription factors implicated for erythroid-specific gene expression, such as SCL and MafK, substantially increased the level of expression of β-globin (3Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and ALAS-E (3Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) transcripts in MEL cells as well as the number of benzidine-positive cells, which reached 10-20% (29Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or 24-54% (3Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) of the total population. It is not clear, however, from these reports whether the expression of these transcription factors resulted in erythroid differentiation that accompanied growth arrest and cellular commitment, features specific to erythroid differentiation. As we reported previously, induction of PTPβ2 transcripts starts at a very early stage of differentiation, as early as 6 h after addition of inducing agents (13Kume T. Tsuneizumi K. Watanabe T. Thomas M.L. Oishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4709-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas induction of these transcription factors starts at a later stage (24 h) of differentiation for SCL (29Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or no induction at all occurs during differentiation for MafK (T. Yamamoto, personal communication). Along with the pleiotropic induction of erythroid-specific genes and phenotypes by the expression of PTPβ2, this involvement of PTPβ2 in erythroid differentiation, if any, should be in a step quite upstream of the differentiation cascade, well before it differentiates into more specific cascades including β-globin gene expression that occurs at later stages. If this is the case, one could speculate that PTPβ2, with a transmembrane domain in the molecule (Fig. 1), is a membrane-associated mediator of a signal from the cell surface, which is generated by erythroid-inducing agents, to nuclei where a series of transcription factors specific to erythroid genes are subsequently activated.The molecular mechanism of how expression of a single specific PTPase (PTPβ2) converts MEL cells to the ones whose characteristics are very similar to erythroid cells is, of course, a matter of speculation at this stage of the research. Induction of PTPβ2 may dephosphorylate a specific phosphotyrosine-containing protein whose dephosphorylation triggers a molecular cascade for terminal differentiation. Alternatively, induced PTPβ2 may dephosphorylate a broad range of cellular proteins rather nonspecifically and that among the dephosphorylated proteins, there may be one (or more) specific protein that is responsible for erythroid differentiation. Western blot analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing cellular proteins indicated no significant changes in the patterns of major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following ZnCl2 treatment (data not shown), suggesting that induction of PTPβ2 dephosphorylates only a limited number of specific proteins. Experiments to identify the target proteins using more sensitive detection procedures are currently underway.

Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), and loops connecting segments generally are short. Proposed periplasmic loops are about 2-8 residues long and appear not to project into the periplasm since they are resistant to proteolysis (9Hengge R. Boos W. J.

The third and the sixth loops (P3 and P6) lack charged amino acids, P2 and P5 each contain a single arginine, and P1 and P4 are the most polar with 3 or more charged residues. The cytoplasmic loops are longer (∼9-30 residues) and contain more charged residues, and four of the 5 loops (C1-C4) can be cleaved by several endoproteases (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem.

For thermodynamic reasons, sec-independent insertion is thought to occur via “helical hairpins” composed of interacting, antiparallel α-helices formed from consecutive odd- and even-numbered segments and their short intervening polar loops (15Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Formation of a helical hairpin may increase the net hydrophobicity of the sequence sufficiently to drive polar loop residues across the lipid bilayer and provide a means of masking interior hydrophilic residues via association of relatively polar faces of the helices. Experimental evidence for the helical hairpin model is limited. Inverted leader peptidase and M13 procoat, both two-segment proteins, apparently insert into the membrane via helical hairpins since deletion of the even-numbered segments of the proteins blocks sec-independent translocation of their periplasmic loops (16Cao G. Cheng S. Whitley P. von Heijne G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26898-26903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, lactose permease, a twelve-segment transport protein, can assemble in the membrane in an active form starting from co-expressed, contiguous fragments separated within the first or fourth periplasmic loops (17Zen K.H. McKenna E. Bibi E. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8198-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that intact hairpins are not required for insertion of all segments of the transporter. We have investigated the topology of the pBR322 Tet protein using N-terminal fusion proteins between MBP and Tet (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When a nonsecretable, signal peptide-deleted MBPΔ2-26 domain (19Weiss J. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is fused at the N terminus of the Tet protein, the Tet sequence inserts normally into the inner membrane, and cells expressing the fusion protein (designated CMT10) are tetracycline-resistant. Segment and loop topology in the Tet portion of hybrid proteins can be established by protease digestion. In this study, we investigate the nature of membrane insertion elements in pBR322 Tet using CMT10-related fusion proteins truncated either at the distal ends of Tet periplasmic loops that follow odd-numbered segments 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 or at the distal ends of cytoplasmic loops following segments 6, 8, and 10. Periplasmic loop truncation of the Tet sequence reduces the efficiency with which C-terminal odd-numbered hydrophobic segments and polar loops insert into the membrane. In contrast, these sequences insert efficiently when the next even-numbered segment is present in the sequence. MBP-Tet fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain PR722 (F′Δ(lacIZ)E65 pro+/proC::Tn 5 Δ(lacIZYA)U169 hsdS20 ara14 galK2 rpsL20 xyl5 mtl1 supE44 leu) (New England Biolabs Inc.).

The construction of malEΔ2-26-tet fusion plasmids pCMT10, pCMTΔRV, pCMTΔB, pCMTΔE, and pCMTΔS has been described elsewhere (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Codon changes in tet DNA were introduced using a phosphorothioate in vitro mutagenesis procedure (21Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). pBR322 tet DNA (22Bolivar F. Rodriguez R.L. Greene P.J. Betlach M.C. Heynecker H.L. Boyer H.W.

The two halves of the tet coding sequence were cloned individually into bacteriophage M13mp18 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11406) Google Scholar) to produce M13mp18 Tet-D1 and Tet-D2 vectors. The Tet-D1 vector contains the HindIII-SalI fragment from plasmid pBR322, whereas the Tet-D2 vector contains a SalI-BglII fragment from the pBR322 derivative vector, pAB9 (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Single-stranded M13 Tet-D1 and Tet-D2 DNAs were prepared and annealed to mutagenic oligonucleotides to prime synthesis of mutant DNA strands in vitro. The following oligonucleotides were used to introduce stop codons at the indicated tet codons: oligo I104, 5′-GGACGCTAGGTGGCCGGCATC-3′; oligo P162, 5′-GCATGCATGATTCCTTG-3′; oligo W243, 5′-TTTCGCTGAAGCGCGAC-3′; oligo Q278, 5′-GCGAGAAGTAGGCCATT-3′; oligo W301, 5′-GCGAGGCTAGATGGCCT-3′; oligo G338, 5′-AGCTTCAATGATCGCTC-3′; and oligo W366, 5′-AGCACATGAAACGGGTT-3′. Underlined nucleotides differ from wild type. After completing in vitro mutagenesis, mutagenized double-stranded DNAs were transformed into strain TG1. Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy chain-termination sequencing of single-stranded plaque DNAs using the Sequenase procedure (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Tet domain 1 truncation mutant expression vectors (pI104 and pP162) were constructed by substituting BamHI-SalI fragments from mutagenized phage DNAs for the corresponding region of the pCMT10 expression vector (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Tet domain 2 truncation mutant vectors (pW243, pQ278, pW301, pG338, and pW366) were constructed by substituting SalI-EcoRI fragments from mutagenized phage DNAs for the corresponding region of the vector pCMT10RI. pCMT10RI was constructed from pCMT10 by converting a HindIII site downstream of the malEΔ2-26-tet fusion gene to an EcoRI site using EcoRI linkers (New England Biolabs Inc.). IMVs were prepared by French press lysis of expression strains as described previously (18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Vesicle sidedness was determined by assaying NADH dehydrogenase (23Futai M. J. Membrane Biol. 1974; 15: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Measurements indicated that IMV preparations contained ∼90% inside-out vesicles. IMVs were subjected to partial digestion with trypsin (L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma), chymotrypsin (Sigma, Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated), and endoproteinase LysC (Promega) under the conditions described in the figure legends and by Miller et al. (18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CpY (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) digestions were conducted in 0.05 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37°C. CpA and CpB (Sigma) digestions were conducted in 0.025 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.005 M MgSO4, 0.3 mM CoSO4 buffer at 37°C. CpW (Sigma) digestions were conducted in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) at 37°C. CpY and CpW digestions were stopped with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and CpA and CpB digestions were stopped by adding EDTA to reactions. Carboxypeptidase digestions were performed using the minimum mass ratio of carboxypeptidase:IMV protein required to maximally digest fusion proteins. In some cases, digestion was maximal within ≤1 h, but in other cases, 18-h incubations were required to attain equilibrium digestion. Mock carboxypeptidase digestions were conducted by incubating membranes in buffers without enzymes for up to 18 h at 37°C. CpY maintains ∼80% of its activity in an 18-h incubation at 37°C (24Lewis W.S. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20818-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis reactions were heated to 95°C for 5 min in sample loading buffer containing 3% SDS and were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide-bisacrylamide-SDS gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205421) Google Scholar) and Western immunoblotting using anti-MBP antiserum, as described previously (18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intensities (I) of stained bands were determined by scanning immunoblots with an LKB Ultrascan XL laser densitometer. Percentages of molecules accessible to carboxypeptidases were calculated using the formula: % accessible = (Iproduct/(Iprecursor+ Iproduct)) × 100. Intensities of background bands co-migrating with digestion products were determined by scanning mock-digested lanes and were subtracted from carboxypeptidase product intensities. Truncation mutants I104, P162, W243, W301, and W366 were constructed by substituting stop codons for codons specifying amino acids at the distal ends of periplasmic loops P2-P6 (Fig. 1 and Table I). Termination sites were selected so that truncated proteins contained polar amino acids normally found in the loops. Membrane insertion of C-terminal odd-numbered segments and loops was analyzed by subjecting truncation mutants to CpY digestion in IMVs. Carboxypeptidases have been used previously to probe membrane boundaries of transmembrane segments in proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin (26Liao M.-J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4194-4199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and porcine Na+/K+-ATPase (27Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CpY was selected for digestion of odd-numbered segment truncation mutants because the yeast enzyme is able to hydrolyze through proline residues (28Hayashi R. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2296-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are present in segments 3, 5, 7, and 11. Reactions were performed for 18 h to achieve maximal digestion of proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). In most cases, digestion end points within the Tet polypeptide chain were determined by comparing the size of products to engineered fusion protein size standards (Table I).Table I.Tet sequences present in truncated MBP-Tet fusion proteinsFusion proteinTruncation regionaLocation of truncation sites.Tet segmentsbRemaining segments.Last Tet amino acidcLast amino acid in the Tet sequence.No. of C amino acidsdNumber of C-terminal amino acids added to the Tet sequence by construction procedures.CMTΔRVP11Asp342CMTΔBP21-3Ile982I104P21-3Arg1030CMTΔEC21-4Gly1344P162P31-5Ala1610CMTΔSC31-6Arg1902W243P41-7Arg2420Q278C41-8Lys2770W301P51-9Gly3000G338C51-10Gln3370W366P61-11Thr3650a Location of truncation sites.b Remaining segments.c Last amino acid in the Tet sequence.d Number of C-terminal amino acids added to the Tet sequence by construction procedures. Open table in a new tab Treatment of the I104 truncation mutant with CpY generated a digestion product that migrated comparably with a chymotryptic fragment of I104 (CT3), which serves as a size marker for MBP-Tet proteins terminating in the C1 loop (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The size of the CpY product indicates that the enzyme removed the P2 loop and segment 3 sequences from I104 and stopped hydrolyzing the protein in the C1 loop. Only about half of the molecules of I104 were digested, and digestion reached a maximum level in 1 h (Table II).Table II.Carboxypeptidase accessibility of C-terminal segments and polar loops of truncation mutantsI104P162CMTΔSW243Q278W301G338W366%aPercentages of molecules accessible to carboxypeptidases were measured by scanning laser densitometry of the gels in Figs. 2 and 6, as explained under “Experimental Procedures.”44 (1)bDigestion times are given in parentheses (h).35 (1)92 (0.5)24 (1)85 (1)17 (1)87 (0.25)12 (1)48 (18)34 (18)93 (1)54 (18)86 (18)37 (18)87 (0.5)35 (18)a Percentages of molecules accessible to carboxypeptidases were measured by scanning laser densitometry of the gels in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, as explained under “Experimental Procedures.”b Digestion times are given in parentheses (h). Open table in a new tab P162 also was digested by CpY (Fig. 2). Comparison of the size of the P162 product with the CMTΔE size standard indicates that the enzyme removed loop P3 and segment 5 from the protein before stopping in the C2 loop (Fig. 1). The percentage of P162 digested reached a maximal level in 1 h and was ∼9-14% less than that obtained by digestion of I104 (Table II). The C-terminal segments and loops of domain 2 truncation mutants, W243, W301, and W366, also were susceptible to CpY digestion (Fig. 2). In each case, 18 h of treatment with enzyme was required for maximum hydrolysis of exposed sequences (Table II). Products from W301 and W366 migrated comparably with size standards Q278 and G338, respectively, that terminate in cytoplasmic loops immediately upstream of segments 9 and 11 (Fig. 1). Again, digestion stopped before the next even-numbered segment upstream, and not all truncated molecules could be cleaved. Mutant W243 was unique in that two digestion products were produced during an 18-h incubation with CpY (Fig. 2, lane 11). The larger product migrated just faster than the undigested protein, and the smaller product co-migrated with an endogenous degradation product present in untreated W243 membranes. The smaller product also co-migrated with the CMTΔS size standard that terminates in loop C3 (Table I). The combined amount of the two products (54%) was calculated after subtracting the contribution of the endogenous band present in the undigested sample in lane 9. The data indicate that CpY removed P4 and segment 7 from some W243 molecules but stopped digesting others before reaching the C3 loop. Segment 7 is one of the most hydrophobic segments in the protein (H = +0.71) and may resist digestion by associating with the membrane. Periplasmic loop truncation mutants were subjected to partial endoproteolysis in IMVs to probe the membrane topology of odd-numbered segments when they are not located at the C termini of the proteins. A range of enzyme concentrations was used to generate partial digests containing fragments from all cytoplasmic loops of the Tet protein that can be cleaved (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The nonsecretable MBP domain of the fusions is resistant to digestion at the enzyme concentrations used. As in the case of carboxypeptidase digestions, cytoplasmic loops cut by enzymes were identified by comparing fragment mobilities with those of fusion protein size standards. Digestion of W243, W301, and W366 with endoproteinase LysC, which hydrolyzes peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysines, generated fragments KC1 from W301 and W366 and KC2 from all three proteins (Fig. 3A). 2Endoproteolysis fragments are labeled according to the nomenclature used for fragments produced from the full-length MBP-Tet fusion protein, CMT10 (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Comparison of the mobilities of these fragments with those of the Q278 and CMTΔS standards shows that the Tet domain is cleaved at Lys272 and/or Lys277 in loop C4 (KC1) and at Lys186 in loop C3 (KC2) (Fig. 1). A minor endoproteinase LysC fragment that migrated faster than the CMTΔRV standard also was observed in digests of W243 and is thought to arise from cleavage at Lys2 located immediately after MBP. Segment topology in W243, W301, and W366 also was probed by partial digestion with trypsin (Fig. 3B). Four digestion products were produced from each mutant: 1) a doublet of fragments (T1) that migrated comparably with the C3 loop standard, CMTΔS; 2) a fragment (T2) that migrated comparably with the C2 loop standard, CMTΔE; and 3) a fragment (T3) that migrated between the CMTΔB (loop P2) and CMTΔRV (loop P1) standards. There are five potential trypsin sites in region C3 for generation of the T1 doublet (Lys186, Arg189, Arg195, Arg204, and Arg207) and two potential sites in region C2 for generation of T2 (Arg129 and Arg131). The only amino acids that could give rise to the T3 fragment are Arg69 and Arg72 in region C1. It is unlikely that Arg73 in C1 or Arg190 in C3 can be cleaved because trypsin does not hydrolyze peptide bonds in which arginine precedes proline (4Eckert B. Beck C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11663-11670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combined endoproteinase LysC and trypsin digestion data indicate that segment topology is normal upstream of the C-terminal segments of the W243, W301, and W366 mutants. Membrane topology of internal sequences in the 3- and 5-segment mutants, I104 and P162, was probed by partial digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The C2 loop of P162 was cut by trypsin as indicated by production of the T2 fragment (Fig. 4). Possibly, a small amount of a T3 digestion fragment also was produced by trypsin digestion, but the amount of the band produced is difficult to evaluate due to migration of an endogenous degradation product at this position on the polyacrylamide gel. Nonetheless, the C1 loop of P162 clearly was cleaved by chymotrypsin as indicated by the presence of a CT3 fragment migrating between the CMTΔB and CMTΔRV standards. CT3 is approximately the same size as the T3 fragment produced from longer fusions, and the most likely site for production of CT3 is Phe-70 in C1 (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Results with I104 were similar in that C1 was cleaved by chymotrypsin, producing fragment CT3 (Fig. 5). Chymotrypsin cleavage of the C1 loop of I104 is consistent with the observation that CpY can digest into this loop in IMVs. The continued accessibility of both C1 loops to chymotrypsin indicates that major topological changes, such as segment and loop “flipping” across the membrane, have not occurred. In addition, odd-numbered segments and periplasmic loops appear to be inserted when the next two segments are present in the Tet sequence.Fig. 5Trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion of the I104 mutant. IMVs (400 μg/ml) were digested with enzymes and analyzed by Western immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Trypsin (T) digests shown are: 25 μg/ml (lane 6), 50 μg/ml (lane 7), and 75 μg/ml (lane 8). Chymotrypsin (CT) digests shown are: 37.5 μg/ml (lane 9), 75 μg/ml (lane 10), and 125 μg/ml (lane 11). A mock digested sample was run in lane 5. Size standards were analyzed in lanes 1-4. The CT3 digestion fragment is labeled to the right of the blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of even-numbered segments on the efficiency of odd-numbered segment insertion also were investigated directly using the CMTΔS, Q278, and G338 cytoplasmic loop truncation mutants. In these mutants, the Tet sequence is terminated within cytoplasmic loops following segment 6 (CMTΔS), segment 8 (Q278), or segment 10 (G338) (Fig. 1 and Table I). Because all three proteins proved to be refractory to CpY digestion, the pancreatic enzymes, CpA and CpB, and the wheat enzyme, CpW, were used instead to analyze the location of the C-terminal tails of the proteins. CpA and CpB were combined in digests because CpB is able to hydrolyze basic residues from the ends of polypeptides, whereas CpA is not. CpW can hydrolyze all residues from target polypeptides. The CMTΔS and G338 fusion proteins were highly susceptible to digestion by CpA and CpB (Fig. 6 and Table II). Within 30 min of incubation, 87% of G338 molecules were digested by the enzymes. Similarly, 93% of CMTΔS molecules were digested by CpA and CpB during a 1-h reaction. The Q278 truncation mutant was highly susceptible to digestion with CpW (Fig. 6 and Table II). Removal of the C4 loop tails from 86% of the molecules of this mutant was achieved during an 18-h digestion period. In the case of each fusion protein, digestion products migrated well above fusion protein size standards terminating in the upstream periplasmic loop. The data indicate, therefore, that the distal odd-numbered segments of the proteins are protected from digestion if the next even-numbered segment is present. Addition of even-numbered segments appears to improve insertion of the distal odd-numbered segments. We have demonstrated that five odd-numbered segments and their attached periplasmic loops in pBR322 Tet are inefficiently inserted into the lipid bilayer in the absence of downstream segments. Distal sequence deletions blocked membrane insertion of 34-54% of the C-terminal odd-numbered segments in these periplasmic loop truncation mutants. In contrast, odd-numbered segments and periplasmic loops inserted efficiently if the next even-numbered segment was present in the sequence, as discussed below. In the I104 truncation mutant, segment 3 and the P2 loop are not inserted in the membrane in 48% of the molecules based on the observation that I104 could be digested by CpY as far upstream as loop C1. In contrast, the membrane topology of both segments 3 and 4 appears to be normal in the five-segment mutant, P162. This conclusion is based on observations that loop C1 of P162 could be cleaved by chymotrypsin, loop C2 could be cleaved by trypsin, and CpY digestion of P162 molecules did not proceed upstream of loop C2. Segments 3 and 4 of P162 are able to insert into the membrane despite the fact that segment 5 is not inserted in 34% of P162 molecules. Therefore, insertion of segment 4, but not segment 5, correlates with insertion of segment 3. Based on the results of proteolysis of the P162, W243, and CMTΔS mutants, segment 6 also appears to facilitate insertion of segment 5. Although segment 5 inserts into the membrane in only 66% of P162 molecules, the topology of both segments 5 and 6 is normal in W243. In W243, the C2 and C3 loops flanking segments 5 and 6 were susceptible to trypsin digestion, and CpY digestion of the protein did not proceed upstream of loop C3. Thus, insertion of segments 5 and 6 occurs despite the fact that segment 7 is not inserted in 54% of W243 molecules. In further support of the role of segment 6 in segment 5 insertion, it was observed that both segments are membrane embedded in the C3 loop truncation mutant, CMTΔS. Only the short, cytoplasmic C3 tail of CMTΔS was removed by CpA and CpB digestion. Similar conclusions regarding the effects of segment 8 on segment 7 insertion and segment 10 on segment 9 insertion are drawn based on proteolysis of Tet domain 2 truncation mutants. Although segment 7 inserts into the membrane in only 46% of W243 molecules, insertion of both segments 7 and 8 occurs in the nine-segment W301 and eight-segment Q278 mutants. These conclusions are based on observations that endoproteinase LysC cut W301 in its C3 and C4 loops, CpY stopped digesting W301 in loop C4, and CpW removed only the C4 tail sequence from Q278. Similarly, although segment 9 inserts in only 63% of W301 molecules, the segment is inserted in the eleven-segment W366 and ten-segment G338 mutants. In this regard, CpY could not digest W366 upstream of loop C5, and only the C5 tail sequence of G338 could be removed by CpA and CpB. That segment 11 is able to insert into the membrane in the presence of segment 12 is inferred from observations that the CMT10 fusion confers tetracycline resistance to host cells (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and only the C-terminal tail of CMT10 can be trimmed by CpY in IMVs. 3D. Guo, and K. W. Miller, unpublished data. Taken together, the data suggest that the most efficient membrane insertion elements in the pBR322 Tet protein are helical hairpins formed from consecutive pairs of odd- and even-numbered segments. The distribution of positive charges across segments and the lengths of periplasmic loops in the protein are compatible with the hairpin mechanism of insertion (11von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Clearly, hairpins are not absolutely required for segment insertion because substantial percentages of individual C-terminal odd-numbered segments and loops are able to integrate into the lipid bilayer, probably because of their hydrophobicity. The inability of deletions to disrupt insertion of internal hairpins indicates that hairpins can integrate into the membrane independently of one another. This may explain why perturbation of the orientation of N-terminal Tet segments does not affect insertion of segments downstream (6Miller K.W. Jewell J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Miller K.W. Konen P.L. Olson J. Ratanavanich K.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In some respects, results obtained here with Tet truncation mutants are similar to those obtained with M13 procoat and coat proteins. It has been shown recently that the two-segment M13 procoat protein adopts two topologies when incubated with preformed phospholipid vesicles in vitro (30Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). About 20% of procoat molecules integrate into the lipid bilayer as hairpins and assume a proteinase K-resistant, transmembrane orientation. The remaining molecules, although bound to lipid vesicles, probably insert only into the interfacial region of the bilayer since they are accessible to the protease. In contrast, coat protein, which contains just the second segment of the procoat hairpin, adopts only the protease-accessible, interfacial conformation when incubated with vesicles. Both procoat and Tet protein studies show that individual hydrophobic segments cannot efficiently establish a transmembrane topology. While some protease-resistant Tet hairpins may be located in the interfacial region of the bilayer, it is more likely that hairpins span the membrane because periplasmic loops, such as P2, P4, and P5, which contain arginines, cannot be cleaved by trypsin from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. It also is likely that the CpY-resistant fraction of C-terminal odd-numbered segments and loops of periplasmic loop truncation mutants span the bilayer. In this regard, noncleavable odd-numbered segments did not convert to accessible forms even during prolonged CpY digestion, and levels of digestion of the segments were not increased by raising the concentration of CpY by 3-fold.3 Inserted transmembrane segments should not oscillate readily back and forth across the membrane due to the large amount of free energy required to transfer inserted hydrophobic sequences out of, and polar loop sequences back through the bilayer (15Engelman D.M.

To gain insight into why individual odd-numbered segments and periplasmic loops fail to insert into the membrane, we have calculated standard free energy changes for bilayer insertion of these sequences (Table III). Free energy changes were calculated using the Engelman free energy scale for partitioning of amino acids into membranes in α-helical conformation (29Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). For simplicity, periplasmic loop residues were treated as though they are α-helical during translocation, and this assumption leads to a slight overestimation of the magnitude of the free energy changes for membrane insertion of the hairpins (29Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with M13 procoat protein indicate the Engelman scale is a good predictor of free energy changes for membrane integration of hydrophobic segments (30Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M.

Calculations are explained under footnote e and in the text. Open table in a new tab Standard free energy changes for membrane insertion of odd-numbered segments and loops range from −6.1 kcal/mol for segment 7 and loop P4 of W243 to −51.3 kcal/mol for segment 5 and loop P3 of P162 (Table III). Because calculated ΔGs for insertion of these sequences are highly favorable, we conclude that insertion of individual segments is not at equilibrium. Possibly, unpaired segments are not long enough to adopt the α-helical conformation required for insertion of polypeptides into phospholipid bilayers (15Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In this regard, short peptides often cannot form stable α-helices (31Scholtz J.M. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the kinetic energy barrier for insertion may be higher for individual segments than for helical hairpins. In either case, even-numbered segments may serve as chaperones for the folding and/or insertion of odd-numbered segments. Experiments currently are being performed to determine if specific sequence requirements for formation and insertion of hairpins can be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1525677629,"The vacuolar-type proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of two general domains, a peripheral, catalytic sector (VC) and a transmembranous proton channel (VB). In its native form, the enzyme can hydrolyze both MgATP and CaATP, whereas VC, when separated from VB, loses its MgATPase activity and switches to a state that can hydrolyze only CaATP. Further dissociation of VC results in subcomplexes that are depleted of one or more subunits and lack ATPase activity altogether. Reconstitution of recombinant subunits to these biochemically prepared subcomplexes has demonstrated the necessity of polypeptides of 70, 58, 40, and 33 kDa (subunits A, B, C, and E, respectively) for CaATPase activity of the VC complex. The current studies demonstrate that mixtures of these four recombinant subunits cannot support CaATPase activity in the absence of a biochemically prepared subcomplex. Investigation of the other components required for ATPase activity has led to the identification of three additional polypeptides present in preparations of VC, with apparent molecular masses of 15, 14, and 10 kDa. Each of these proteins was found to activate ATPase activity of mixtures of subunits A, B, C, and E. In addition, ATPase reconstituted from these individual subunits hydrolyses ATP, not only in the presence of Ca2+ but also in the presence of Mg2+. Investigation of the individual properties of these three subunits revealed that the 10-kDa polypeptide is subunit F, as determined by immunoblot analysis. This subunit had no effect on MgATPase activity of VC but stimulated CaATPase activity 6-fold in the presence of subunit D. Under optimal conditions the 14-kDa component resulted in a 10-fold stimulation and the 15-kDa component a 20-fold stimulation of MgATPase activity; based on this observation, the 14- and 15-kDa polypeptides were named subunits G and H, respectively. In addition, proton pumping activity was reconstituted through the reassembly of subunits A-H with VB and SFD, a previously described pump component composed of polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa (Xie, X.-S, Crider, B.P., Ma, Y. M., and Stone, D. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25809-25815). Together, these experiments completely define the catalytic center of the vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles."
