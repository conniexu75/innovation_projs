https://openalex.org/W2100070586,"The vertebrate transcription factors TCF (T cell factor) and LEF (lymphocyte enhancer binding factor) interact with beta-catenin and are hypothesized to mediate Wingless/Wnt signaling. We have cloned a maternally expressed Drosophila TCF family member, dTCF. dTCF binds a canonical TCF DNA motif and interacts with the beta-catenin homolog Armadillo. Previous studies have identified two regions in Armadillo required for Wingless signaling. One of these interacts with dTCF, while the other constitutes a transactivation domain. Mutations in dTCF and expression of a dominant-negative dTCF transgene cause a segment polarity phenotype and affect expression of the Wingless target genes engrailed and Ultrabithorax. Epistasis analysis positions dTCF downstream of armadillo. The Armadillo-dTCF complex mediates Wingless signaling as a bipartite transcription factor."

IGFBP-3 is thought to act by sequestering free IGFs or, possibly, act via a novel IGF-independent mechanism. Supporting its role as a primary growth inhibitor, IGFBP-3 production has been shown to be increased by cell growth-inhibitory agents, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and the tumor suppressor gene p53. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, a novel function of IGFBP-3 as an apoptosis-inducing agent and show that this action is mediated through an IGF·IGF receptor-independent pathway.

Furthermore, treatment with TGF-β1, a known apoptosis-inducing agent, resulted in the induction of IGFBP-3 expression 6–12 h before the onset of apoptosis. This effect of TGF-β1 was prevented by co-treatment with IGFBP-3-neutralizing antibodies or IGFBP-3-specific antisense thiolated oligonucleotides. These findings suggest that IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis through a novel pathway independent of either p53 or the IGF·IGF receptor-mediated cell survival pathway and that IGFBP-3 mediates TGF-β1 induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells.

In addition to regulating the availability of free IGFs and, therefore, their mitogenic activity (1Cohen, P., Fielder, P. J., Hasegawa, Y., Frisch, H., Giudice, L. C. & Rosenfeld, R. G.

These independent cell growth-regulatory effects of IGFBPs have been shown to be either growth-inducing (5Figueroa J.A. Lee A.V. Jackson J.G. Yee D. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We and others have previously demonstrated the effects of IGFBP-3 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in prostatic and other tissues (8Angelloz-Nicoud P. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5485-5492Google Scholar, 9Cohen P. Peehl D.M. Graves H, C. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 142: 407-415Google Scholar, 10Kaicer E. Blat C. Imbenotte J. Troalen F.

Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Google Scholar). This negative growth regulation by IGFBP-3 has been proposed to involve a separate cellular signaling pathway (18Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 14964-14971Google Scholar, 19Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Google Scholar). Further, in support of its role as a negative regulator of cell growth and proliferation, IGFBP-3 gene expression has also been shown to be induced by other growth-inhibitory (and apoptosis-inducing) agents such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (20Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar, 21Gucev Z.S. Oh Y. Kelley K.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550Google Scholar, 22Martin J.L.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (23Yateman M.E. Claffey D.C. Cwyfan Hughes S.C. Frost V.J. Wass J.A. Holly J.M. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 137: 151-159Google Scholar), and the tumor suppressor gene, p53 (24Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Google Scholar). However, the direct apoptosis-inducing ability of IGFBP-3 has not previously been demonstrated. In this study, we have investigated a novel role of IGFBP-3 as an apoptosis-inducing agent. We hypothesized that the growth-inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 is mediated not only by regulating the availability of free IGFs and by inducing growth arrest, but also by inducing apoptosis. We further considered that this process may involve an IGF-independent mechanism. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the ability of IGFBP-3 to induce apoptosis in a prostate carcinoma cell line (PC-3) and in an IGF receptor-negative (R(−)) mouse fibroblast cell line (13Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Google Scholar, 19Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol.

Furthermore, to determine the importance of IGFBP-3 as a critical cell growth-regulatory factor, we also investigated its role as a mediator of the apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Tissue culture supplies were purchased from Flow Laboratories (McLean, VA), Corning (Corning, NY), and Hyclone (Logan, UT). Recombinant human IGF-I was the kind gift of Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant human IGF-II was generously provided by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Recombinant DNA-derived, glycosylated (Chinese hamster ovary) and nonglycosylated (Escherichia coli) human IGFBP-3 were the generous gifts of A. Sommer (Celtrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The IGFBP-3 phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in these experiments (originally published by Oh et al.; Ref. 20Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar) were prepared by OLIGOS Etc., Inc. (Guilford, CT). The IGFBP-3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were complementary to the 20 nucleotides that encode the N terminus of human IGFBP-3 as described previously (24Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Google Scholar) and had the sequence 5′-CAT GAC GCC TGC AAC CGG GG-3′ (positions 2021–2040); the sequence of the IGFBP-3 sense oligodeoxynucleotides was 5′-CCC CGG TTG CAG GCG TCA TG-3′. IGFBP-3 antibodies were purchased from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX) and were prepared by affinity purification on an IGFBP-3 column. Control IgG (affinity-purified anti-goat IgG) was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Valinomycin was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin, propidium iodide (PI), and binding buffer were purchased from R & D systems (Oxon, United Kingdom). The interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor (ICE-I) (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). The human PC-3 cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were originally initiated from a grade IV prostatic adenocarcinoma from a 62-year-old male Caucasian. The PC-3 cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks according to the recommended protocol (FK-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For each experiment, cells were dissociated, centrifuged, and resuspended in serum containing FK-12 media with antibiotics and inoculated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24-well or 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown to confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C before treatment. After a quick wash with serum-free FK-12 media (SFM), the confluent cells were treated with various concentrations of IGFBP-3, TGF-β1, and/or other specified reagents. SFM with antibiotics was used as the control treatment. Fibroblasts from an IGF-I receptor knockout mouse were generated from 18-day embryos as described previously (25Sell C. Rubini M. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baarga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar) and were designated R(−) cells. The R(−) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and Geneticin (G418). For the generation of cell lines stably expressing the human IGFBP-3 gene, R(−) cells were co-transfected with the pKGhBP-3 (19Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Google Scholar) and pLHL4 vectors. Transfections were done in suspension with 5 μg of plasmid DNA for 1 × 106 cells using the calcium phosphate suspension method (13Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Google Scholar, 25Sell C. Rubini M. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baarga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar). The cells were then plated at a concentration of 8 × 103cells/cm2. Cells selected in hygromycin were designated R(−)/BP-3 and were continuously grown in media supplemented with hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Several clones were confirmed for IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression and were used for further biological experiments (19Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation analyses were performed using cells (1 × 106/ml), which were washed with Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.15 msodium chloride and 0.015 m sodium citrate (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium laurylsarkosinate, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. Following digestion with proteinase K, the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of cold absolute ethanol, pelleted, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, heated to 70 °C, and loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was carried out in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, until the marker dye had migrated approximately 5 cm. DNA was visualized under UV light and photographed. In situ detection of apoptosis in cultured cells was performed with the use of direct immunoperoxidase detection of biotin-labeled genomic DNA in monolayer cells. In brief, following treatment with different conditions, the monolayer cultures were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature followed by dehydration in 70% ethanol for 5 min at room temperature. Following this step, the endogenous peroxidase was quenched by treatment with 2% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 min. The cells were incubated in the labeling mixture (Biotin dNTP mix; 50 × MgCl2, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and labeling buffer) for 60 min at 37 °C. The free 3′-OH DNA in the apoptotic cells was visualized using the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-diaminobenzidine detection system. These apoptotic cells appeared as dark brown cells. Cells were harvested from confluent monolayer cultures including the floating cells in the conditioned media and were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde on ice and treated with 70% ethanol for 10 min before use. Apoptotic cells were detected using the Apoptag system, which utilizes terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and digoxigenin-labeled d-UTP (Oncore, Gaithersburg, MD). Following incubation in 70% ethanol, the cells were washed in cold PBS and incubated with fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin. After a 30-min incubation, the cells were rinsed in PBS with 0.05 Triton X-100 and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing PI (5 μg/ml) and RNase (1 mg/ml). The cells were incubated in the dark on ice for 30 min prior to flow cytometric analysis. Stained cells were evaluated for fluorescence, employing a Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer operated at 488 nm and 300 milliwatts output. Individual cells were electronically gated to exclude aggregates from evaluation. Single parameter fluorescence histogram data were generated for both isotypic control antibody-treated cells and apoptosis-specific antibody-treated cells. Saved fluorescence histograms were evaluated by Overton's histogram subtraction statistical model (Immuno 4 software, Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL) to determine both the percentage of positive cells and relative fluorescence intensity in mean channel fluorescence units. The K+-selective ionophore valinomycin (1 × 105m) was used as a positive control (27Deckers C.L.P. Lyons A.B. Smuel K. Sanderson A. Maddy A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 362-370Google Scholar). SFM-treated conditions were used as negative controls. The percentage of apoptotic cells in both control and experimental conditions were compared. To confirm that the population of apoptotic cells observed in the IGFBP-3-treated conditions are truly undergoing programmed cell death and not necrosis, we utilized the previously published novel method and detected both apoptosis and necrosis from the same samples using quantitative FACS analysis. This method utilizes the binding of FITC-labeled annexin V to phosphatidylserine in the cell membrane that surfaces only during the early phase of apoptosis, indicating the loss of cell membrane phospholipid asymmetry (28Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Google Scholar, 29Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Google Scholar, 30Homburg C.H. de Haas M. von dem Borne A.E. Verhoeven A.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. Roos D. Blood. 1995; 85: 532-540Google Scholar). However, these apoptotic cells with intact cell membranes do not stain with the PI. Utilizing the morphological changes that occur in both apoptotic and necrotic cells, we simultaneously stained the samples with annexin-FITC and PI and subjected the samples to flow cytometric analyses to detect the percentage of apoptotic (FITC-stained cells) and necrotic cells (PI-stained cells) in a given population. A minimum of 6,000 cells was maintained for all samples. Photometric cell death detection ELISA (Boehringer Mannheim) was performed to quantitate the apoptotic index by detecting the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells. The assay is based on the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones, respectively, for the specific determination of these nucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates. In brief, equal numbers of cells were plated in 24-well culture plates (1 × 104/cm2) in serum-supplemented FK-12 medium and grown to confluency for 72 h. At the time of sample collection, the confluent cells were washed with PBS and treated with various concentrations of IGFBP-3, TGF-β1, or other required agents for the designated time period. The cells were dissociated gently (PBS with 0.1 m EDTA) and pelleted along with the floating cells (mostly apoptotic cells) collected from the conditioned media. The cell pellets were used to prepare the cytosol fractions that contained the smaller fragments of DNA. Equal volumes of these cytosolic fractions were incubated in anti-histone antibody-coated wells (96-well plates), and the histones of the DNA fragments were allowed to bind to the anti-histone antibodies. The peroxidase-labeled mouse monoclonal DNA antibodies were used to localize and detect the bound fragmented DNA using photometric detection with 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzathiazoline sulfonate) as the substrate. Valinomycin (1 × 105m) was used as a positive control (27Deckers C.L.P. Lyons A.B. Smuel K. Sanderson A. Maddy A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 362-370Google Scholar). SFM-treated conditions were used as negative controls. Each experimental condition was carried out with at least three samples and was repeated at least three times. The reaction products in each 96-well plate were read using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 3550-UV). Averages of the values ± S.E. from double absorbance measurements of the samples were plotted. Confluent PC-3 cells were briefly washed with cold PBS and allowed to dissociate in dispersion buffer (1 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4). Free floating cells were collected and centrifuged (2000 rpm for 5 min), resuspended in cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm pepstatin in PBS (pH 7.4), vortexed, and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Aliquots were stored at −70 °C until further use. Samples were collected using the method described above for the preparation of cell lysates. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, maintaining the uniformity of the homogenization process. Homogenized cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the nuclear pellet was discarded. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet containing the debris was discarded. The supernatant containing the plasma membrane was then resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl2, 2 mm MgSo4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and further homogenized using the same technique as mentioned above. Following centrifugation at 33,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h using a Sorvall ultracentrifuge (DuPont, OTD B60), the resulting pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and used for separation on SDS-PAGE. The Western immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (31Rajah R. Bhala A. Nunn Pheel D.M. Cohen P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2676-2682Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned media from PC-3 cultures treated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 for different time periods were used. SFM incubated with similar culture conditions were used as controls. Samples of 100 μl (from 1 × 106 cells) were electrophoresed through 12.5% nonreducing SDS-PAGE overnight at constant voltage, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, probed with specific IGFBP-3 antibodies, and detected using a peroxidase-linked enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). PC-3 cell lysates and plasma membrane fractions were electrophoresed through 12.5% nonreducing SDS-PAGE overnight at constant voltage and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with 5 × 104 cpm of125I-IGFBP-3 (DSL Webster, TX) for 12 h. The membranes were exposed to film for 3 days and visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric measurement of immunoblots were performed using a Bio-Rad GS-670 Imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY). Protein levels were estimated by comparing the optical density of each specific protein band from control (SFM) conditions with that from the TGF-β1-treated conditions. All experiments were repeated at least three times. When applicable, means ± S.E. are shown. Student's t tests were used for statistical analysis. We detected IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells using both qualitative (DNA laddering and TUNEL) and quantitative (FACS and ELISA) methods. The apoptotic DNA cleavage in cells treated with IGFBP-3 (500 ng/ml for 72 h) was visualized as DNA laddering (Fig.1 A). The DNA extracted from cells treated with SFM showed limited fragmentation (lane 4). However, DNA extracted from IGFBP-3-treated cells demonstrated significant fragmentation, with bands varying in size primarily from 100 to 300 base pairs (lane 3). Cells treated with 10% fetal bovine serum were used as a negative control to demonstrate the absence of any fragmented DNA (lane 2). As an alternative method of detection, and to localize the apoptotic cells in situ, we detected the fragmented DNA in monolayer cell cultures treated with SFM or IGFBP-3 using TUNEL (Fig.1 B). The DNA fragments bound to the peroxidase-diaminobenzidine reaction product in apoptotic cells were visualized as dark brown cells. Cells in SFM displayed an insignificant number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 B, i); however, IGFBP-3 treatment revealed numerous apoptotic cells (Fig.1 B, ii). This method was not used to quantitate the number of apoptotic cells in the SFM- and IGFBP-3-treated conditions, since many of the apoptotic cells, after 72 h of incubation, were found floating in the conditioned media. Loss of cells from the culture plate due to the increased apoptotic index was seen as empty spaces in the IGFBP-3-treated condition. However, the control condition showed confluent cells. FACS analysis of fragmented DNA antibody staining (Fig. 1 C) further demonstrated and quantitated the apoptotic index in SFM- and IGFBP-3-treated conditions. The basal apoptotic index due to serum withdrawal was 1.4% of the total number of cells analyzed. The addition of IGFBP-3 to SFM resulted in the significant increase in the apoptotic index (94.7% of the total) as measured by fragmented DNA antibody staining. Using related FACS approaches (Fig. 1 D) but labeling the unpermeablized samples with both FITC-conjugated annexin (which stains only apoptotic cells) and PI (which stains necrotic cells with disrupted membranes), the number of apoptotic cells under the treated condition and the ratio of apoptotic cells to necrotic cells were calculated. Treatment with IGFBP-3 resulted in a 3-fold increase in apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 E) when compared with SFM treatment. The percentage of necrotic cells was low in both treatment conditions and was not increased by IGFBP-3. Similar to the observations obtained using FACS, quantitative analysis with photometric ELISA (Fig. 2) revealed a basal level of apoptosis in SFM-treated cells. In contrast, the serum-treated cultures were completely devoid of apoptotic cells (Fig.2 A). In addition, the addition of IGF-I (200 ng/ml) also prevented the effect of serum starvation on apoptosis. On the other hand, the addition of IGFBP-3 to the SFM induced a further significant increase (p < 0.001 compared with SFM) in the apoptotic index above the basal level caused by serum deprivation (Fig.2 A). This induction of apoptosis by IGFBP-3 was as potent as the apoptosis induced by the ionophore valinomycin, which has previously been demonstrated to be a potent apoptosis-inducing agent (27Deckers C.L.P. Lyons A.B. Smuel K. Sanderson A. Maddy A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 362-370Google Scholar). A dose response study revealed that IGFBP-3 induced apoptosis at concentrations as low as 50 ng/ml and demonstrated a dose response up to 500 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). This effect was only partially inhibited by exogenous IGF (Fig. 2 C) (p < 0.05 compared with IGFBP-3 treatment) and was not inhibited by the IGF analogue (long R3-IGF-I) that does not bind to IGFBPs (Fig.2 C), suggestive of an IGF-independent mechanism for this IGFBP-3 effect. All of these methods confirmed that treatment with IGFBP-3 for 72 h resulted in a significant increase in the apoptotic index in PC-3 cells. Analyses using the apoptosis ELISA demonstrated that IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the reversible ICE-I (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde) (Fig.3 A). The ICE-I completely suppressed IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 5 μmol/liter (Fig. 3 B). These concentrations are known to inhibit ICE and ICE-like proteases and to block apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli in other cell types (32Estrov Z. Black R.A. Sleath P.R. Harris D. Van Q. LaPushin R. Estey E.H. Talpaz M. Blood. 1995; 86: 4594-4602Google Scholar, 33Na S. Chuang T.-H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol.

These data demonstrate the involvement of ICE or ICE-like proteases in the IGFBP-3-induced pathway. Detection of IGFBP-3-binding molecules using reverse Western ligand blots revealed a number of bands varying in size from 18 to 150 kDa that represent proteins with high affinity to125I-IGFBP-3 (Fig. 4). These molecules were detected both in whole cell lysates (lane 1) and in the purified plasma membrane fraction (lane 2). However, the 150-, 68-, and 18-kDa bands were strongly enriched in the membrane fraction, while some bands (44 and 35 kDa) were seen more prominently in the cell lysates, suggesting a cytoplasmic or nuclear origin. The selective localization of some of these molecules in the membrane fraction suggests the possibility of these proteins serving as IGFBP-3 cell surface receptors that may mediate IGFBP-3 action. The possibility that IGFBP-3 acts to induce apoptosis independently of IGFs and IGF receptors was investigated by testing the ability of IGFBP-3 to induce apoptosis in the IGF receptor-negative (R(−)) fibroblast cells derived from an IGF-1R knockout mouse (25Sell C. Rubini M. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baarga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar). These cells have been shown previously to neither bind nor respond to IGFs. To test the effect of IGFBP-3 on these cells, we used both treatment with exogenous IGFBP-3 protein and transfection with the IGFBP-3 gene (Fig. 5). The R(−) cell line demonstrated a basal level of apoptosis when cultured in 30% serum. The DNA extracted from R(−) cells and R(−) cells transfected with IGFBP-3 (R(−)/BP-3) grown in 30% serum for 72 h (Fig. 5 A) reveals that the DNA fragmentation was far more prevalent in R(−)/BP-3 (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). This observation was also quantitated using photometric ELISA (Fig. 5 B). The transfection of the IGFBP-3 gene resulted in a substantial increase in the degree of apoptosis (p < 0.001)"
https://openalex.org/W1969910714,"Frzb-1 is a secreted protein containing a domain similar to the putative Wnt-binding region of the frizzled family of transmembrane receptors. Frzb-1 is widely expressed in adult mammalian tissues. In the Xenopus gastrula, it is expressed and regulated as a typical Spemann organizer component. Injection of frzb-1 mRNA blocks expression of XMyoD mRNA and leads to embryos with enlarged heads and shortened trunks. Frzb-1 antagonizes the effects of Xwnt-8 ectopic expression in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Cultured cells transfected with a membrane-tethered form of Wnt-1 bind epitope-tagged Frzb-1 in the 10(-10) M range. The results strengthen the view that the Spemann organizer is a source of secreted inhibitory factors."
https://openalex.org/W2124962639,"The site of action of a series of pyridinyl imidazole compounds that are selective inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro and block proinflammatory cytokine production in vivo has been determined. Using Edman sequencing, 125I-SB206718 was shown to cross-link to the nonphosphorylated Escherichia coli-expressed p38 kinase at Thr175, which is proximal to the ATP binding site. Titration calorimetric studies withE. coli-expressed p38 kinase showed that SB203580 bound with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and that binding was blocked by preincubation of p38 kinase with the ATP analogue, FSBA (5′-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine), which covalently modifies the ATP binding site. The intrinsic ATPase activity of the nonphosphorylated enzyme was inhibited by SB203580 with aK m of 9.6 mm. Kinetic studies of active, phosphorylated yeast-expressed p38 kinase using a peptide substrate showed that SB203580 was competitive with ATP with aK i of 21 nm and that kinase inhibition correlated with binding and biological activity. Mutagenesis indicated that binding of 125I-SB206718 was dependent on the catalytic residues K53 and D168 in the ATP pocket. These findings indicate that the pyridinyl imidazoles act in vivo by inhibiting p38 kinase activity through competition with ATP and that their selectivity is probably determined by differences in nonconserved regions within or near the ATP binding pocket.

Several novel intracellular signaling pathways associated with heat; chemical, osmotic, and oxidative stress; UV; and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor have recently been discovered in mammalian cells (1Brewster J.L. de, Valoir T.

Because these signals are commonly associated with the early stages of host responses to injury and infection, they have generated significant interest for their possible role in various pathological conditions and consequent potential as targets for novel therapeutics. The key components of these pathways are members of the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPKAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; CSBP, CSAID binding protein; FSBA, (5′-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine); MS, mass spectrometry. kinase family of serine-threonine protein kinases (8Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are proline-directed serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by phosphorylation on both a threonine and tyrosine in a Thr-X-Tyr motif found in an activation loop proximal to the ATP and substrate binding sites (9Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). This is accomplished in vivo by a dual specificity MAP kinase kinase, which in turn is activated by phosphorylation in response to an appropriate extracellular or intracellular signal. There are three main classes of MAP kinase, the ERKs, the c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases, and the p38 kinases (also known as CSBP, RK, MPK2, and HOG1 (1Brewster J.L. de, Valoir T.

This is Glu in the ERKs, Pro in the c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases, and Gly in the p38 kinases. As a result of this and additional proximal differences, each MAP kinase is recognized and activated by a different set of MAP kinase kinases and in turn has different in vivo substrates (7Rouse J.

These differences are also reflected in the different activation stimuli for each MAP kinase, with the c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases and p38 kinases and their homologues (6Lee J.C.

We recently discovered that a series of pyridinyl imidazoles that inhibited the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor from lipopolysaccharide-activated human monocytes bound to and inhibited p38 kinase, which we originally called CSBP (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). These compounds inhibit two splice forms of p38, and a newly discovered homologue of p38 kinase, p38β (16Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Google Scholar), but they do not inhibit the closely related ERK or c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases or other serine-threonine protein kinases (20Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar). The pyridinyl imidazoles, typified by SB203580, have proven useful in investigating the role of p38 kinase in regulating transcription, translation, and cytoskeletal elements in response to various stress and cytokine stimuli, as well as its potential role in animal models of inflammatory disease (21Badger A.M.

However, there has not been to date a detailed understanding of how SB203580 binds and subsequently inhibits p38 kinase catalytic activity. In the present study we show that the pyridinyl imidazoles inhibit p38 kinase activity by binding to the ATP binding site, a region that until recently was not thought to provide enough specificity for the design of protein kinase inhibitors. The synthesis of SB203580,3H-SB202190, and 125I-SB206718 has been described previously (27Gallagher T. Seibel G.L. Kassis S. Laydon J.T. Blumenthal M.J. Lee J.C. Lee D. Boehm J.C. Fier-Thompson S.M.

Multiple preparations of the latter consistently afforded material with radiochemical purities of > 98% and specific activities ranging from 1670 to 1736 Ci/mmol. The radiophotoaffinity label 125I-SB227931 was prepared by reacting 3-nitrophenyl-tolylmethylisocyanide with pyridine-4-carboxaldehyde[(1-(4-iodobenzolyl)aminopropyl-3-yl]imine, using a modification of the van Leusen reaction (29Boehm J.C. Smietana J.M. Sorenson M.E. Garigipati R.S. Gallagher T.F. Sheldrake P.L. Bradbeer J. Badger A.M. Laydon J.T. Lee J.C. Hillegass L.M. Griswold D.E. Breton J.J. Chabot-Fletcher M.C. Adams J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3929-3937Google Scholar), which afforded 1-[1-(4-iodobenzolyl)aminopropyl-3-yl-5-(4-pyridyl)-4-(3-nitrophenyl)imidazole. Conversion of the nitro group to an azide was accomplished in the same manner as with SB206718. Incorporation of radiolabeled iodine was accomplish by first converting the iodide to the corresponding tributylstannane derivative followed by radioiododestannylation using Na125I in the presence of chloramine T, yielding a product with a radiochemical purity of 96.5% and a specific activity of 1670 Ci/mmol. An expression vector encoding Met-Ala-His6p38 was constructed as follows. A 1.4-kilobaseBamHI (Klenow filled)-Asp718Ile fragment encoding Met-Ala-His6p38 (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29043-29046Google Scholar) that had been digested with XhoI (Klenow filled) and Asp718Ile, creating p138NBU-Ala-His6p38. Briefly, the plasmid contains the URA3-selectable marker, partial 2μ sequences for maintenance at high copy number, with Met-Ala-His6p38 expression driven by the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter and terminated by the CYC1 transcriptional terminator. p138NBU-Ala-His6p38 was introduced into JBY10 (1Brewster J.L. de, Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Google Scholar), a hog1Δ strain of S. cerevisiae, by the lithium acetate method (31Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium minus uracil (32Hicks J.B. Herskowitz I. Genetics. 1976; 83: 245-258Google Scholar) at 30 °C and 225 rpm to A 540 = 1 and induced for expression with 150 μm CuSO4 for 4 h. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a FLAG-p38 construct (12McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Van Horn S. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8488-8492Google Scholar). The mutants were subcloned into p138NBU and propagated in JBY10, and extracts were prepared as described previously (30Kumar S. McLaughlin M.M. McDonnell P.C. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29043-29046Google Scholar). Met-Ala-His6 p38 kinase was purified from clarified E. coli lysates by chromatography on a Qiagen Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C and eluted with a 10–250 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer. The p38 kinase was further purified by sequential passage over a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and a Mono Q column equilibrated in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmdithiothreitol and eluted by a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. The purity was greater than 95% and yield was 5 mg/g of E. coli. Yeast cells were thawed and lysed with glass beads in 100 mm Tris buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepsatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm phenyl phosphate, pH 7.4, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. After addition of an equal volume of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4), the supernatant was purified by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and Ni2+-NTA columns (Qiagen) and elution in both cases with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. Purified p38 kinase was exhaustively dialyzed against 20 mmHEPES, 2 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, pH 7.4, and stored frozen at −70 °C. The purity was greater than 95% and yield was 20 μg/g of yeast. 50 pmrecombinant E. coli-expressed Met-Ala-His8p38 was reduced, pyridylethylated, digested with trypsin (6 h at 37 °C), and analyzed using negative ion liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry and stepped collision energy scanning for selective identification of phosphorylated peptides (33Huddleston M.J. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Google Scholar). No phosphorylated peptides were detected using the phosphate-selective scan, and the putative phosphorylation-site peptide (His182-Thr-Asp-Asp-Glu-Met-Thr-Gly-Tyr-Val-Ala-Thr-Arg) was observed in its nonphosphorylated state. Approximately 300 pm Met-Ala-His8p38 expressed in yeast was reduced, pyridylethylated, and desalted on a C18 guard column. The sample was then dried, reconstituted in 25 mmNH4HCO3, and cleaved with trypsin for 6 h at 37 °C. A 1-μl aliquot of the digest containing approximately 30 pm Met-Ala-His6-p38 was mixed with either 2 μl of 4% NH4OH or 10% formic acid. 1 μl of each of these solutions was loaded in separate experiments into a nanospray tip, and the sample was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry at a flow rate of approximately 30 nanoliters/min (34Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Google Scholar). A number of experiments were carried out on this single loading of approximately 10 pm sample, including a full scan negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry, precursor scan of m/z 79 (phosphate-selective scan), full scan positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry to locate parents of phosphopeptides for sequencing by tandem MS (MS/MS), and MS/MS of the phosphorylated forms of the peptide HTDDEMTGYVATR from the digest. Signals were observed for this peptide with zero, one, and two phosphates bound. MS/MS of the nonphosphorylated form corroborated the presumed sequence. MS/MS of the monophosphorylated parent indicated that this species was primarily the peptide phosphorylated on Thr188. We were not able to obtain useful MS/MS data on the putative di-phosphorylated species. Purified E. coli-expressed p38 kinase was UV cross-linked with 125I-SB206718 as described previously (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar) and was fragmented using cyanogen bromide (Pierce) and lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Biochemicals). Cyanogen bromide digests were performed in 70% formic acid using 10 μl of a fresh 70 mg/ml cyanogen bromide solution added per 10 μg of protein digested. Digests with lysyl endopeptidase were performed in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, at 1:20 (w/w) enzyme:substrate. Digest fragments were separated by 15% reducing Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and electroblotted onto Problott membrane (Applied Biosystems) for sequencing. Protein sequence analysis was performed on a Beckman LF 3400 TC gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with a Beckman 126/166 system for on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis. For determining the site of radiophotoaffinity cross-linking, a modified sequencing cycle was used in which the anilinothiazolinone derivatives were collected in S1 (ethyl acetate) directly for 125I determination on a Beckman Gamma 8500 scintillation counter. The cross-linking site of the related compound, 125I-SB227931, could not be determined but was clearly distinct from that of 125I-SB206718. Kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P from γ-[32P]ATP into an epidermal growth factor receptor-derived peptide (T699) having the following sequence: KRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR. 30-μl reactions contained 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 ng of purified p38 kinase and 0.4 mm peptide. Compounds were preincubated for 20 min at 4 °C with enzyme and peptide. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 0.8 μCi and 170 μm (unless indicated otherwise) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C before being stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.3 m phosphoric acid. The phosphorylated peptide was captured on phosphocellulose filter paper (P81), washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For the immune-complex kinase assay, cells were treated with SB203580 or SB202474 for 30 min prior to activation with 0.4 msorbitol for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and solubilized on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 units/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Endogenous kinases were precipitated from cell lysates using anti-p38 kinase (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar) or anti-MAPKAP kinase-2 antibodies (kindly supplied by Dr. Nick Morrice, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom). The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The immune-complex kinase assays were performed as described (12McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Van Horn S. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30864-30869Google Scholar) The amount of radioactivity was quantitated in a B603 Betascope blot analyzer (Betagen). The amount of p38 kinase present in the immunoprecipitates and its extent of activation was determined by immunoblot using anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant p38 kinase (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed with a Microcal, Inc. MCS microcalorimeter (36Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with an equilibrium binding model having a single equilibrium constant and enthalpy change. p38 kinase was dialyzed against the experimental buffer just prior to the titration with SB203580, and its concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.12 (mg/mL)−1cm−1 and a molecular mass of 42 kDa. The concentration of SB203580 was established gravimetrically. SB203580 was dissolved to 5 mm in 100% DMSO and then diluted into experimental buffer to 100 μm (2% DMSO final). Reaction of p38 kinase with FSBA was carried out under conditions similar to those reported for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (37Bhatnagar D. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Lessor R.A. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4350-4357Google Scholar, 38Hagiwara M. Inagaki M. Hidaka H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 523-528Google Scholar). p38 kinase was incubated overnight at room temperature with 1 mm FSBA, 0.1 m Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m MgCl2, at pH 7.4, and was dialyzed against experimental buffer prior to titration calorimetry. Confirmation that p38 kinase reacted with FSBA was done by evaluating its conformational stability. The thermal stability of p38 kinase was evaluated by monitoring the circular dichroism spectral signal at 220 nm as a function of temperature. p38 kinase was unfolded as a sharp, homogeneous transition before and after reaction with FSBA, but the FSBA-reacted p38 kinase showed enhanced thermal stability (T m = 51 °C) over the unreacted (T m = 46 °C). To determine where the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors bind to p38 kinase, we determined the cross-linking site of the radiophotoaffinity compound,125I-SB206718 (Fig. 1), previously used to identify and purify p38 kinase. Sequencing of peptide fragments from cross-linked, E. coli-expressed p38 kinase showed that radioactivity was associated predominantly with Thr175 and at much lower levels with Leu171 and Asp177(Fig. 2), all residues in the activation loop of p38 kinase. This suggested that the compounds may be inhibitors of ATP or substrate binding.Figure 2Cross-linking of 125I-SB206718 to p38 kinase. The radioactivity associated with each amino acid residue in the isolated cyanogen bromide fragment prepared from p38 radioactively cross-linked with 125I-SB206718 as described under “Experimental Procedures” is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In support of this, the previously demonstrated binding of3H SB202190 to p38 kinase in the lysates from unstimulated THP.1 cells (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar) was competed by ATP with an IC50 of approximately 4 mm (data not shown). To obtain more quantitative data, we examined compound binding and ATP competition to purified p38 kinase via microcalorimetry. SB203580 bound to E. coli-expressed p38 kinase at 30 °C with a K d = 15 nm and a ΔH = −12 kcal (Fig. 3,left panel). The molar binding ratio was equal to 0.75 ± 0.1 SB203580/p38 kinase, which is within experimental error of a 1:1 molar binding stoichiometry. When p38 kinase was preincubated with FSBA (5′-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine), an ATP analogue that covalently modifies cAMP-dependent protein kinase at lysine 72 and precludes ATP binding (37Bhatnagar D. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Lessor R.A. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4350-4357Google Scholar, 38Hagiwara M. Inagaki M. Hidaka H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 523-528Google Scholar), no binding of SB203580 was observed (Fig. 3, right panel). Despite a lack of phosphorylation as detected by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptide fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”; data not shown), E. coli-expressed p38 kinase nevertheless had an intrinsic ATPase activity in the absence of substrate. Using a spectrophotometric coupled-enzyme assay (39Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Google Scholar), the Michaelis-Mentenk cat and K m for this ATPase activity were determined to be 0.006 s−1 and 9.6 mm ATP. The ATPase activity was also observed in the microcalorimeter as a steady-state production of heat that was inhibited by SB203580 (Fig. 4). The catalytic activity was eliminated when a molar ratio of about 1 SB203580/p38 kinase or more was added to the calorimeter. Because the above experiments dealt with the the binding of the pyridinyl imidazoles to the unactivated form of p38 kinase, it became important to determine whether the same features applied to the activated form of the enzyme. We have previously shown that p38 kinase expressed in yeast is constitutively active due to its phosphorylation by the yeast MAP kinase kinase, Pbs2p (30Kumar S. McLaughlin M.M. McDonnell P.C. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29043-29046Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of p38 expressed in yeast using phosphopeptide-selective scanning and detection methods (33Huddleston M.J. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Google Scholar, 34Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Google Scholar) showed that approximately 20% of the purified protein was phosphorylated on both Thr and Tyr in the activation loop, 40% was phosphorylated on Thr, and the rest was unphosphorylated (see “Experimental Procedures”). All of the kinase activity is assumed to be attributable to the doubly phosphorylated form as evidenced by mutagenesis of either or both of these residues (30Kumar S. McLaughlin M.M. McDonnell P.C. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29043-29046Google Scholar). A p38 kinase assay was developed using a peptide substrate with a sequence derived from the intracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. This peptide has been previously used to assay ERK activity (40Bird T.A. Sleath P.R. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22661-22670Google Scholar). This peptide phosphorylation assay was used to compare the potency of pyridinyl imidazoles in inhibition of the yeast-expressed activated form of p38 kinase with their binding affinity to the unactivated form of the enzyme as measured in the cytosol of the THP.1 monocytic cell line. As shown in Fig.5, the IC50 values for binding to inactive p38 kinase correlated with those for kinase inhibition of the activated form of the enzyme. The correlation coefficient for a large number of pyridinyl imidazoles, ranging in potency over 3 orders of magnitude, was calculated from the data in Fig. 5 and found to be 0.911. Combined with the previously noted correlation of compound binding affinity with inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production from lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes (6Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar), this indicates that one mechanism by which these pyridinyl imidazoles act is through inhibition of the catalytic activity of the activated form of p38 kinase. To evaluate further the competition between pyridinyl imidazole binding and ATP observed for the unactivated p38 kinase above, the mode of inhibition of p38 kinase by SB203580 with respect to ATP was determined. The resulting Lineweaver-Burke plot (Fig. 6) shows that SB203580 inhibits p38 kinase in a manner competitive with ATP with a K i of 21 nm. TheK m [ATP] was increased from 200 to 1392 μm in the presence of 100 nm SB203580 (Fig.6). To determine potential sites important for compound binding, we examined the effect of selective mutations of p38 kinase expressed in yeast on the binding of two radiophotoaffinity cross-linkers,125I-SB206718 and a related cross-linker125I-SB227931, which has the azid"

The tumors were infiltrated by macrophages and expressed high levels of steady-state mRNA for metalloelastase (MME). Successive passages (more than three) of cultures established from the tumors resulted in complete depletion of macrophages; steady-state MME mRNA, elastinolytic activity, and production of angiostatin (in the presence of plasminogen) were correspondingly reduced. Coculture of macrophages with either 3LL cells or their conditioned media containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in secretion of MME and production of angiostatin by the macrophages, suggesting that angiostatin is produced by tumor-infiltrating macrophages whose MME expression is stimulated by tumor cell–derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor."

It dorsalized Xenopus embryos and was expressed in the Spemann organizer during early gastrulation. Unlike Frizzled proteins, endogenous Frzb was soluble. Frzb was secretable and could act across cell boundaries. In several functional assays, Frzb antagonized Xwnt-8, a proposed ventralizing factor with an expression pattern complementary to that of Frzb. Furthermore, Frzb blocked induction of MyoD, an action reported recently for a dominant-negative Xwnt-8. Frzb coimmunoprecipitated with Wnt proteins, providing direct biochemical evidence for Frzb-Wnt interactions. These observations implicate Frzb in axial patterning and support the concept that Frzb binds and inactivates Xwnt-8 during gastrulation, preventing inappropriate ventral signaling in developing dorsal tissues."

We show that two Eph family transmembrane ligands, Lerk2 and HtkL, are expressed in caudal somite halves, and that crest cells and motor axons express receptors for these ligands. In several independent in vitro assays, preclustered ligand-Fc fusion proteins can repulsively guide both crest migration and motor axon outgrowth. These repulsive activities depend on a graded or discontinuous presentation of the ligands when tested in the context of permissive substrates, such as laminin or fibronectin. These results identify Lerk2 and HtkL as potential determinants of segmental pattern in the peripheral nervous system."

Here, we define a minimal wingless response sequence in the midgut enhancer of Ultrabithorax. We show that this sequence is recognized by the murine transcription factor LEF-1 (lymphocyte enhancer binding factor 1) in a ternary complex with armadillo protein, the cytoplasmic target of the wingless signaling pathway. In stable transformants, transcriptional stimulation of the Ultrabithorax enhancer by LEF-1 depends on armadillo. Furthermore, overexpression of LEF-1 bypasses the need for wingless signaling and causes phenotypes in the midgut, notum, and wing that mimic wingless hyperstimulation. Finally, efficient transcriptional stimulation by LEF-1 in the midgut depends also on the decapentaplegic response sequence and is limited spatially by decapentaplegic signaling. Thus, LEF-1 coordinates inputs from multiple positional signals, consistent with its architectural role in regulating the assembly of multiprotein enhancer complexes."

A constitutively activated form of Notch produces a reciprocal phenotype and induces thymocytes that have functional γδTCR gene rearrangements to adopt the αβ T cell fate. Our data indicate that Notch acts together with the newly formed T cell antigen receptor to direct the αβ versus γδ T cell lineage decision."

Moreover, p240 and p230 were copurified with telomerase activity in a series of extensive purification experiments. These results strongly suggest that the TLP1 proteins are components of, or are closely associated with, the rat telomerase. A pulse-chase experiment showed that p240 is modified to p230 in vivo. p230 was the dominant form in telomerase-positive cells, suggesting that modification of the TLP1 protein may regulate telomerase activity in vivo."

First, the transient expression of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in neuroblasts is abolished, providing evidence that Phox2a controls noradrenergic traits in vivo. Second, the expression of the GDNF receptor subunit Ret is dramatically reduced, and there is a massive increase in apoptosis of ganglion cells, which are known to depend on GDNF in vivo. Therefore, Phox2a appears to regulate conventional differentiation traits and the ability of neurons to respond to essential survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W2056538346,"β-lactam induction of chromosomal β-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria requires the transcriptional regulator AmpR and the transport of murein breakdown products (muropeptides) into the cytoplasm. In vitro transcription shows that purified AmpR acts as an activator for ampCβ-lactamase synthesis. The murein precursor, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, decreases AmpR-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro, but has no effect on an AmpR(G102E) mutant that mediates constitutive activation of ampC in vivo. Addition of the muropeptide, anhMurNAc-tripeptide, which accumulates in β-lactamase-overproducing mutants, counteracts the negative effect of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, restoring the innate ability of AmpR to induce ampC expression in vitro. Cytosolic intermediates of murein biosynthesis and degradation thus act antagonistically to control β-lactamase expression, thereby operating as a cell–wall sensing device."

The termini of this RNA fragment are located in a region of complementarity between the chsA 3' coding region and its 3' untranslated region. Equivalent chsA RNA fragments remain in the white flower tissue of a nontransgenic Petunia variety.

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family are also essential for various forms of synaptic plasticity and regulate the activity of different ion channels including NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. We now demonstrate that PKA and various PKC isoforms phosphorylate the NMDA receptor in vitro. The stoichiometry of [32P]phosphate incorporation per [3H]MK-801 binding site is greater than 1 for both PKA and PKC. Double immunoprecipitation experiments show that all three NMDA receptor subunits that are prevalent in the cortical structures, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, are substrates for PKA as well as PKC. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping reveals that the major phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKC differ for all three subunits. We provide evidence that some if not most of these sites are phosphorylated in the central nervous system of rats in vivo. The results presented in this article together with earlier electrophysiological experiments demonstrating that PKA and PKC activation increases the activity of NMDA receptors indicate that NMDA receptor potentiation can be mediated by direct phosphorylation by PKA and PKC.

By comparison with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, these regions were originally thought to form four transmembrane segments so that the NH3+- and COO−-terminal ends would both be located extracellularly. Recent studies on non-NMDA receptor subunits, however, demonstrated that only the NH3+-terminal end is extracellular, followed by the transmembrane region M1; the M2 region, which loops only partially into the plasma membrane and back into the cytosol; the transmembrane regions M3 and M4; and finally the cytosolic COO− terminus (26Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Google Scholar, 27Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Google Scholar, 28Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar). NMDA receptor subunits probably adopt a similar membrane topology (16Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). NMDA receptor-mediated currents were potentiated by protein kinase C (PKC) activators (phorbol esters or oleoyl-acetylglycerol), and this potentiation was prevented by PKC inhibitors (H7, staurosporin, or sphingosine) in trigeminal (29Chen L. Huang L.-Y.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 319-326Google Scholar, 30Chen L. Huang L.-Y.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 521-523Google Scholar), spinal cord dorsal horn (31Gerber G. Kangrga I. Ryu P.D. Larew J.S.A.

Bennet M.V.L. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6731-6735Google Scholar), or with RNA encoding NR1 and NR2A or 2B (11Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E.

Cyclic AMP analogs and forskolin were employed to show that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enhances the NMDA response in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons (38Cerne R. Rusin K.I. Randic M. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 161: 124-128Google Scholar) and in hippocampal microcultures (39Raman I.M Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 415-421Google Scholar). Finally, the effects of phosphatase inhibitors and direct application of phosphatase 1 and 2A suggest that phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B are involved in the down-regulation of NMDA receptor activity under various conditions (40Lieberman D.N. Mody I. Nature. 1994; 369: 235-239Google Scholar, 41Tong G. Shepherd D. Jahr C.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1510-1512Google Scholar, 42Wang L.-Y. Orser B.A. Brautigan D.L. MacDonald J.F. Nature. 1994; 369: 230-232Google Scholar). Most of these studies are based on electrophysiological methods that do not reveal whether the NMDA receptor itself or another protein or enzyme modifying NMDA receptor activity has been phosphorylated. The work presented in this study addresses the question of whether the NMDA receptor itself is a substrate for PKA and PKC and whether the corresponding phosphorylation sites are targeted in vivo. No previous evidence has demonstrated that NMDA receptors are directly phosphorylated by PKA, although it has been shown earlier by Tingleyet al. (16Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar) that NR1 is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in cell culture upon stimulation with phorbol ester. However, it has been unknown whether PKC also phosphorylates NR2 subunits. We now demonstrate that PKA as well as PKC phosphorylate NR1, NR2A, and NR2B. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping reveals, however, different patterns for PKA and PKC phosphorylation, suggesting differential regulation of NMDA receptors by PKA and PKC. Back-phosphorylation of NMDA receptors immunoisolated from rapidly collected and homogenized rat brain in the absence and presence of phosphatase inhibitors shows that NR1 and NR2 subunits are phosphorylated in vivo at those sites recognized by PKA and PKC in vitro. MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate) was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA), and [3H]MK-801 (884 GBq/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. The ECL detection kit was purchased from Amersham Corp., protein A-Sepharose (PAS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA; IgG-free) from Sigma, microcystin LR from Calbiochem, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc) from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany), sequencing grade trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI), and control antibodies from Zymed (South San Francisco, CA). PKA and PKC isoforms were isolated, and the absence of activity of other, contaminating, protein kinases was confirmed by established procedures (43Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F.

Huang and Dr. P. J. Bertics, Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI), respectively. All other reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were of standard biochemical quality. The monoclonal antibody 54.2 (αR1) recognizes specifically NR1 (15Brose N. Huntley G.W. Stern-Bach Y. Sharma G. Morrison J.H. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16780-16784Google Scholar) and was generously supplied by Dr. R. Jahn, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University (New Haven, CT). Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies produced against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the COO−-terminal 20 amino acid residues of NR2A recognize NR2A and NR2B (α2A/B) (18Petralia R.S. Wang Y.-X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6102-6120Google Scholar, 20Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1408–1429 of NR2A interact specifically with NR2A (α2Ap) (20Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Google Scholar). For the production of antibodies against polyhistidine fusion proteins containing the NR2A region spanning amino acids 934–1203 (α2A) or the NR2B region encompassing amino acids 935–1856 (α2B), oligonucleotides flanking the respective region and containing appropriate restriction sites were used to amplify corresponding sequences from cDNA clones of NR2A and NR2B by PCR. The DNA products were ligated into pQE30 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), allowing the expression of respective polyhistidine fusion proteins that were subsequently purified on Ni2+ chelate resin nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid and injected into rabbits. All antibodies against NR2 subunits including those produced against fusion proteins (α2A, α2B) were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Wenthold, NIDCD, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Forebrains (without the cerebellum) from adult Sprague Dawley rats were prepared as a 10% homogenate in ice-cold 320 mm sucrose, 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, with a glass/Teflon homogenizer (12 strokes at approximately 800 rpm). Pepstatin A (1 μm), leupeptin and aprotinin (10 μg/ml), Pefabloc (0.2 mm), benzamidine (0.1 mg/ml), and calpain inhibitors I and II (8 μg/ml each) were present in all buffers. After a short centrifugation (5000 rpm, 2 min, SS 34-rotor, 4 °C) to remove larger cell fragments, membranes were sedimented (50,000 rpm, 30 min, 70.1 Ti rotor, 4 °C) and solubilized in 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, for 20 min on ice (usually 10 ml per rat brain) (20Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Google Scholar). Unsolubilized material was sedimented by ultracentrifugation as before, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. To determine the phosphorylation status of NMDA receptor subunitsin vivo, rats were decapitated without anesthesia, and the heads were put into liquid nitrogen for 8–10 s. Using this procedure, brains were immediately cooled down to 0–5 °C without freezing. The brains were then dissected, and cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were processed separately. To reduce dephosphorylation, ultracentrifuge rotors were precooled on ice, and all procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Half of each tissue was processed in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, allowing dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins by endogenous phosphatases. For the processing of the other half of the tissue, the following phosphatase inhibitors were present in the homogenization and solubilization buffer: 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm2-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 2 μm microcystin LR. 0.5 ml of deoxycholate extract containing at least 20 fmol of NMDA receptor was preadsorbed with 150 μl of Sepharose CL-4B and 5 mg of PAS for 30 min. After centrifugation for 1 min in a table top centrifuge, the supernatant was collected and incubated on a tilting mixer for 1.5 h with 0.5 μl of αR1 or control ascites or with 0.5 μl of α2A/B, α2A, α2B, or control antiserum at 4 °C or on ice when phosphatase inhibitors were present. Then 3–5 mg of PAS, preswollen and washed three times with TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, were added, and the samples were mixed for 2.5 h as before. The immunocomplexes were sedimented by centrifugation and washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and once with 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, before being extracted with 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, and 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) for 20 min at 60 °C. In some cases, brain homogenates were directly solubilized in SDS-sample buffer. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; the gels were polymerized using 6% acrylamide), the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, which was blocked by incubation for 2 h with 10% skim milk powder in TBS (TBS-milk). Blots were incubated with αR1 or control ascites (1:1000 in TBS-milk) or with α2A, α2B, α2A/B, or control antiserum (1:100 in TBS-milk) for 1–2 h, washed five times with TBS-milk, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (ascites) or protein A (sera) (both diluted 1:1000 in TBS-milk), washed for 5–6 h with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (8–10 changes), and developed with the ECL reagent. For double immunoprecipitations, the resins with antibody-NMDA receptor complexes attached were treated with 20 μl of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, 1.5% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm Pefabloc, 1 μm pepstatin A, 20 μg of leupeptin, and 40 μg aprotinin for 20 min at 60 °C in a thermomixer, diluted with 300 μl of 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 200 μm Pefabloc, 1 μmpepstatin A, 2 μg of leupeptin, and 4 μg of aprotinin in TBS and centrifuged. Supernatants were incubated with various antibodies and PAS as described above. PAS immunocomplexes were washed, extracted with SDS sample buffer, and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels as detailed above. NMDA receptors were solubilized and immunoprecipitated as described above. The resins with the receptor were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and once with basic phosphorylation buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). Samples were phosphorylated with 0.5–1 μg of PKA or PKC in 50 μl of basic phosphorylation buffer containing 0.4 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg of leupeptin, 4 μg of aprotinin, and 0.2 μm [γ-32P]ATP. This buffer was supplemented with 1.5 mm CaCl2, 50 μg of diolein, and 2.5 mg of phosphatidylserine for PKC. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C in a thermomixer, washed four times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in radioimmune assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm2-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate) and once in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. For quantitative phosphorylation as required for the measurement of the stoichiometry of [32P]phosphate incorporation by PKA or PKC, 10 μm unlabeled ATP was added to the phosphorylation reaction. At this ATP concentration, phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits by PKA or PKC was saturated. Extending the incubation time to 1 h also did not result in an increase in [32P]phosphate incorporation by PKA or PKC. The pellets were extracted with SDS sample buffer (see above) and used directly for SDS-PAGE. For double immunoprecipitations, pellets were treated as described in the previous paragraph except that radioimmune assay buffer was used rather than TBS for the dilution of the SDS extracts and the washes. Phosphorylated protein bands were visualized by autoradiography, and incorporated 32P was quantified by Cerenkov counting or scintillation counting. The method for the generation of phosphopeptide maps (47Huttner W.B. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5402-5406Google Scholar) was modified as follows: NMDA receptors were solubilized from rat brain membranes with deoxycholate, immunoprecipitated with αR1, phosphorylated with PKA or PKC, and dissociated with SDS, and NR1, NR2A, or NR2B was reprecipitated with αR1, α2A, or α2B, respectively, as described above. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, gel pieces containing32P-labeled NMDA receptor subunits were excised from the gels, washed three times for 2–5 h with acetic acid/2-propanol/H2O (1:1:8) and twice for 2 h with 50% methanol, dried in a vacuum concentrator, rehydrated with 800 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.5 μg trypsin (which is modified by reductive methylation to make it resistant to autoproteolyis) and a trace amount of phenol red, and digested overnight at 37 °C. After sedimentation for 1 min in a table top centrifuge, supernatants were removed, and gel slices were treated a second time with 0.5 μg of trypsin in 800 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 omitting phenol red in the digestion buffer, permitting a control for the extraction efficiency of the gel slices during the second cycle. In addition,32P was quantified by Cerenkov counting of the gel pieces before and after the digests. Only samples with an extraction efficacy of at least 80% of 32P were further processed. Supernatants from both digests were combined, dried in a vacuum concentrator, resuspended in 200–300 μl of H2O, and dried again. Resuspension and evaporation was repeated until phenol red changed its color from red to yellow, reflecting a nearly complete removal of the basic NH4HCO3 salt. Tryptic phosphopeptides were solubilized in 5 μl of 1% pyridine, 10% acetic acid, pH 3.5, spotted onto thin layer chromatography cellulose plates, and subjected to electrophoresis until phenol red had migrated 5 cm toward the cathode (usually 2 h at 400 V). Plates were dried, developed in the second dimension by ascending chromatography in pyridine/1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O (10:15:3:12), and dried, and the pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was visualized by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis. To ensure that tryptic digest was complete, in 2–4 independent experiments tryptic digests were performed for 3 full days rather than overnight, and each day 0.5 μg of trypsin was added to the reaction mixture. Phosphopeptide maps obtained from NR1, 2A, and 2B subunits phosphorylated with PKA or PKC were virtually identical after short and extended digests. [3H]MK-801 binding was performed with membrane fractions as described (48Wong E.H.F. Knight A.R Woodruff G.N. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 274-281Google Scholar, 49McKernan R.M. Castro S. Poat J.A. Wong E.H.F. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 777-785Google Scholar). In brief, 500 μg of membrane protein in 0.1 ml of 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EGTA were incubated with 100 nm[3H]MK-801 to equilibrium (24 h, 4 °C). TheK D for [3H]MK-801-binding to NMDA receptors in membrane fractions is 2.6 nm (49McKernan R.M. Castro S. Poat J.A. Wong E.H.F. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 777-785Google Scholar). A concentration of 100 nm [3H]MK-801 will, therefore, saturate [3H]MK-801 binding to NMDA receptors. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are blocked by MK-801 with a low affinity. Therefore, at a concentration of 100 nm, MK-801 binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is negligible, since theK D value of this receptor for MK-801 is 70-fold higher than this concentration (50Amador M. Dani J.A. Synapse. 1991; 7: 207-215Google Scholar). Membranes were filtered through Whatman GF/C membranes and washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined by incubations in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled MK-801 and subtracted from total [3H]MK-801 binding to obtain specific binding. To determine the amount of NMDA receptor immunoprecipitated by αR1 for quantitative phosphorylation experiments, 33% of the precipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with αR1 as probing antibody. For comparison, various amounts of membrane fractions (e.g. 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg of protein) containing defined amounts of NMDA receptors as determined by [3H]MK-801 binding were loaded in parallel lanes. αR1 binding to the NMDA receptors on the membrane was detected with the ECL method and quantified by densitometry. ECL signals resulting from various exposure times were compared with each other to ensure that they were within the linear range of the film. As described earlier (15Brose N. Huntley G.W. Stern-Bach Y. Sharma G. Morrison J.H. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16780-16784Google Scholar), αR1 recognized a single band of about 110 kDa by immunoblotting of total brain homogenate (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This band appears elongated, probably reflecting the existence of closely comigrating NR1 isoforms as they are generated by differential splicing (19Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Google Scholar). The same band was detected when solubilized NMDA receptors were immunoprecipitated with αR1 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and absent after immunoprecipitation with control antibody (Fig.1 A, lane 3), excluding a nonspecific precipitation of NMDA receptors under the experimental conditions. Double immunoprecipitation utilizing αR1 for both precipitation steps also yielded the immunoreactive 110-kDa band (Fig. 1 A,lane 4), demonstrating that NR1 can be dissociated from the NMDA receptor complex with SDS and subsequently reprecipitated with αR1. The specificity of antibodies directed against NR2 subunits was also demonstrated by immunoblotting. Similar to earlier observations (20Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Google Scholar), α2A/B labeled a band of about 190 kDa when either total brain homogenate (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) or NMDA receptors immunoprecipitated with αR1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) had been blotted. Similar results were obtained with the novel antibodies α2A and α2B. Both antibodies recognized a single band of about 190 kDa in total brain homogenate (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 5). The same bands were present after immunoprecipitation with αR1 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4and 6), corroborating the finding that both antibodies specifically react with NR2 subunits. Expression of NR2C and NR2D is very low in the cortex and the other brain areas used for the experiments described here in mature rat brains (11Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Google Scholar, 12Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N.

Therefore, they were not included in our studies. To test, however, the possibility that α2A cross-reacts with NR2B andvice versa, NMDA receptors were immunoprecipitated with αR1, dissociated with SDS, and reprecipitated with α2A or α2B. Probing the immunoblots with α2A showed that this antibody bound to the 190-kDa protein reprecipitated with α2A, but not the α2B precipitate (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3). The opposite was true for α2B (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5and 6). These results indicate th"

https://openalex.org/W2079977851,"We have isolated the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate islet-1 and islet-2 genes, two members of the LIM homeodomain family implicated in the transcriptional control of motor neuronal differentiation. Similar to vertebrates, Drosophila islet is expressed in a discrete subset of embryonic motor neurons and interneurons that includes the dopaminergic and serotonergic cells of the ventral nerve cord. In contrast to mouse where mutation of islet-1 leads to loss of neurons due to programmed cell death, Drosophila islet is not required for neuron survival. Instead, loss of islet function causes defects in axon pathfinding and targeting plus loss of dopamine and serotonin synthesis. Ectopic expression of islet induces both specific alterations in pathfinding and changes in neurotransmitter identity. These findings indicate that islet coordinately controls two distinct aspects of neuronal identity."
https://openalex.org/W2108836535,"Rapid flow of information in the nervous system involves presynaptic vesicle recycling by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, an event triggered by the α-adaptin-containing AP2 complex. We identified a Drosophila α-adaptin expressed in the garland cells, imaginal discs, and the CNS. Here we show its role in presynaptic vesicle recycling. In presynaptic terminals, α-adaptin defines a network-like membrane structure to which the GTPase dynamin is recruited. α-adaptin is necessary for the formation of clathrin-coated pits and participates in the dynamin-dependent release of coated vesicles from the membrane surface. Our results suggest an α-adaptin-dependent control of the vesicle cycle that maintains the balance between the amount of vesicle- and surface-associated membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2011537701,"We have previously reported that a 19-base pair element of the 5'-flanking region of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene containing a sequence homology to a hypoxia-responsive enhancer (iNOS-HRE) mediates picolinic acid (PA)- or hypoxia-induced activation of the iNOS promoter in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-treated murine macrophages. The iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFX) induces the activity of the human erythropoietin enhancer in Hep3B cells. We have investigated the influence of DFX on the activation of the iNOS promoter and iNOS gene expression in ANA-1 macrophages. We have found that DFX induced DNA-binding activity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) consensus sequence of the iNOS promoter and activated the iNOS-HRE in murine macrophages. These activities of DFX were associated with a synergistic induction of iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS transcription in IFN-gamma-treated ANA-1 macrophages. Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the iNOS gene demonstrated that IFN-gamma plus DFX activated the full-length iNOS promoter and that the iNOS-HRE was required for DFX-induced iNOS transcriptional activity. We also investigated the role of iron metabolism in the DFX- or PA-dependent induction of HIF-1 activity and iNOS expression. We demonstrate that addition of iron sulfate completely abolished DFX or PA induction of HIF-1 binding and iNOS-HRE activation and abrogated IFN-gamma plus either DFX- or PA-induced iNOS expression. These data establish that DFX is a co-stimulus for the transcriptional activation of the iNOS gene in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages, and they provide evidence that the iNOS-HRE is required for the DFX-dependent activation of the iNOS promoter. Furthermore, our results indicate that the iNOS-HRE is a regulatory element of the iNOS promoter responsive to iron chelation."
https://openalex.org/W2086682233,"We report that the molecular basis of the neural tropism of Mycobacterium leprae is attributable to the specific binding of M. leprae to the laminin-α2 (LN-α2) chain on Schwann cell–axon units. Using recombinant fragments of LN-α2 (rLN-α2), the M. leprae-binding site was localized to the G domain. rLN-α2G mediated M. leprae binding to cell lines and to sciatic nerves of dystrophic dy/dy mice lacking LN-α2, but expressing laminin receptors. Anti-β4 integrin antibody attenuated rLN-α2G-mediated M. leprae adherence, suggesting that M. leprae interacts with cells by binding to β4 integrin via an LN-α2G bridge. Our results indicate a novel role for the G domain of LN-2 in infection and reveal a model in which a host-derived bridging molecule determines nerve tropism of a pathogen."

MADD interacts with TNFR1 residues that are critical for signal generation and coimmunoprecipitates with TNFR1, implicating MADD as a component of the TNFR1 signaling complex. Importantly, we have found that overexpression of MADD activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and expression of the MADD death domain stimulates both the ERK and c-JUN N-terminal kinase MAP kinases and induces the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2. These data indicate that MADD links TNFR1 with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release and provide further insight into the mechanisms by which TNF exerts its pleiotropic effects.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-JUN N-terminal kinase. is a central player in the regulation of immune responses. Produced mainly by activated macrophages, TNF promotes a wide variety of cellular activities, including the initiation of inflammation, the induction of antiviral responses, and apoptosis. Two receptors for TNF have been cloned, both of which belong to a superfamily of cell surface receptors that includes the Fas antigen and CD40 (1Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Google Scholar). The TNF receptors share 30% homology in their extracellular domains but are unrelated in their intracellular domains. The intracellular domains of the Fas antigen and the 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR1), both of which can trigger apoptosis, share approximately 28% identity in a region known as the death domain (2Itoh N.

Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar). This region of TNFR1 has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for signaling cytotoxicity (3Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar, 4Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Google Scholar). TNFR1 mediates most of the biological effects of TNF (3Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar, 5Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U.

Engagement of this receptor activates a diverse group of intracellular signaling pathways. Among the early downstream effects of TNF are the activation of kinases, including members of the MAP kinase family (9Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Google Scholar, 10Vietor I. Schwenger P. Li W. Schlessinger J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18994-18999Google Scholar, 11Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E.

Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Google Scholar). The activation of cPLA2 results in the release of arachidonic acid, which is metabolized into the potent proinflammatory mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes. TNF also activates several transcription factors, including NF-κB and c-JUN/AP-1, leading to the up-regulation of a large number of genes involved in the inflammatory response (16Kronke M. Schutze S. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Aggarwal B.B. Vilcek J. Tumor Necrosis Factors: Structure, Function, and Mechanism of Action. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 189Google Scholar). The signaling elements involved in initiating these pathways were not discovered until recently, when the yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that associate directly with TNFR1. Briefly, TRADD (17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar) is a death domain-containing protein that interacts directly with the death domain of TNFR1. TRADD is believed to act as an adaptor protein that recruits two other proteins, TRAF2 and RIP, to the receptor (18Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar, 19Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar). TRAF2 has been implicated in the pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB (18Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar, 20Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar), while RIP seems to mediate both apoptosis and NK-κB activation (19Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar, 21Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Google Scholar). TRADD also interacts with MORT1/FADD (22Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Google Scholar, 23Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar), which in turn associates with the ICE-like protease MACH/FLICE (24Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 25Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar), providing a mechanism by which TNFR1 activates key downstream mediators of the apoptotic response. The death domain motif plays a central role in these interactions, mediating associations between TNFR1, TRADD, MORT1/FADD, and RIP. We have performed a yeast interaction trap screen and isolated a 176-kDa protein called MADD, for MAP kinase-Activating Death Domain protein, which also interacts with TNFR1. Here we show that MADD associates with TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction and that overexpression of MADD activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Interestingly, expression of a truncated form of MADD, containing the C-terminal death domain, activates both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases and induces the phosphorylation of cPLA2. These data suggest that MADD provides a physical link between TNFR1 and the induction of MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release. Screening was based on the methods of Gyuris et al. (31Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). Briefly, the death domain of TNFR1 (amino acids 326–413; TNFR1-DD) was subcloned into pEG202, resulting in a DNA-binding fusion between the bacterial repressor LexA and the TNFR1 death domain. One million transformants from U937 or WI38 cDNA libraries in pJG4–5 (encoding proteins fused to the B42 transcriptional activation domain; see Ref. 26Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Google Scholar) were screened for TNFR1-DD binding proteins, using an EGY48 yeast reporter strain containing chromosomal lexAop-leu2 and carryinglexAop-lacZ on the plasmid pSH18-34. TNFR1-DD was obtained by PCR using four oligonucleotides encoding overlapping TNFR1-DD sequences. TNFR1-DD was subcloned into pEG202 for screening and M13mp18 (27Messing J. Gronenborn B. Muller-Hill B. Hofschneider P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3642-3646Google Scholar) for mutagenesis. For mutagenesis, each of five death domain residues was mutated individually to alanine using the Muta-Gene M13 mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The mutated fragments were subcloned into the pEG202 vector for testing in the yeast interaction trap. The death domains of Fas (amino acids 213–299), MADD (amino acids 1281–1356), TRADD (amino acids 222–289), and the intracellular domains of TNFR1 (amino acids 204–426) and TNFR2 (amino acids 288–461) were obtained by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. 15ΔDD (amino acids 1396–1588) was constructed by digesting 15TU with EcoRV andXhoI, converting the EcoRV site toEcoRI with a linker and subcloning into pJG4-5 as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment. Vectors FLAG-15TU and FLAG-MADD were constructed by cloning NotI/SalI fragments of the respective cDNAs into the mammalian expression vector pED-FLAG, a variant of pED (28Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Google Scholar) containing the FLAG peptide DYKDDDDK. A NotI fragment of MADD was subcloned into pED to generate pED-MADD. Human tissue and cell line blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing 2 μg/lane of poly(A)+ mRNA were probed with the partial MADD cDNA 27TU. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml tRNA from yeast. Washing was at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. To obtain the gene encoding full-length MADD, a poly(dT)-primed U937 cDNA library was probed with the partial clone 27TU, yielding a clone of 4.2 kilobase pairs (clone 4a). A 1.5-kilobase fragment corresponding to the 5′ region of clone 4a was used to screen a U937 random-primed cDNA library, yielding a cDNA (clone 15) that overlapped clone 4a by 400 base pairs. A PCR fragment encoding the 5′ end of MADD was isolated using a method for the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Marathon kit, CLONTECH), with an oligonucleotide corresponding to sequence from the 5′ end of clone 4a. This PCR fragment was used to screen a MADD-specific primer-extended U937 library to obtain a cDNA corresponding to the PCR fragment. Ligation of this 5′ cDNA to clones 15 and 4a yielded a gene encoding full-length MADD. MADD polyclonal antibodies 6007 and 6008 were raised in rabbits by immunization using the partial MADD clone 27TU to express a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (vector pMAL, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) (MBP-27TU). TNFR1 antibody 4013 was produced by immunizing rabbits with the death domain of human TNFR1 expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (vector pGEX, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (GST-DD). cPLA2polyclonal antibody 7905 was generated against cPLA2produced in Escherichia coli, as described previously (29Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar). MBP antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, HA antibody 12CA5 from Boehringer Mannheim, and FLAG antibody M2 from Kodak. GST-DD and MBP-27TU were expressed in bacteria and purified as described by the manufacturer. 3 μg of MBP-27TU (or MBP alone) was mixed with 3 μg of GST-DD (or GST alone) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated for 2 h in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol). The beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and bound and unbound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-MBP antibody. Filters were developed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To immunoprecipitate endogenous MADD, cells were lysed by a 10-min incubation in lysis buffer T (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mmNaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. MADD was precipitated with 20 μl of anti-MADD antibody 6008 and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer T and the proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed as above, using anti-MADD antibody 6007. To monitor coimmunoprecipitation between TNFR1 and MADD, FLAG-MADD was transfected into COS cells using the DEAE-dextran method (30Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and treated for 15 min with 50 ng/ml human recombinant TNF (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described above, using 20 μl of anti-TNFR1 antibody 4013 for immunoprecipitation and 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody for immunoblotting. Anti-mouse HRP was used as second antibody (Amersham Corp.). COS cells were cotransfected using the DEAE-dextran method with 2–3 μg of HA epitope-tagged kinase and 10–15 μg of either pED-FLAG, FLAG-15TU, or pED-MADD. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with varying concentrations of TNF and lysed as described above. HA-tagged kinase was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using anti-HA antibody. Kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) and 1–2 μg of either myelin basic protein (Sigma) (for ERK assays) or a GST fusion with the N terminus of c-JUN (amino acids 1–79) (for JNK assays) as substrate. Samples were analyzed by autoradiography following electrophoresis. COS cells were cotransfected by DEAE-dextran with 2 μg of pmt-2EMC-cPLA2(29Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar) and 10 μg of pED-FLAG or FLAG-15TU. Two days after transfection, cells were starved and TNF-treated as above and collected directly into 2 × sample buffer (126 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1.4m β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting for cPLA2 was performed as described above, using polyclonal antibody 7905. The yeast interaction trap system (31Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar) was used to identify proteins that interact with the death domain of the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor. The TNFR1 death domain (amino acids 326–413; TNFR1-DD) was fused to the C-terminal end of the LexA DNA binding domain as a “bait” in the interaction trap screen. This construct was cotransformed into yeast along with a U937 cDNA library in which each cDNA was expressed as a fusion with the B42 transcriptional activation domain under the control of the GAL4 promoter. Approximately one million transformants were screened for their ability to express β-galactosidase and grow in the absence of leucine. 63 of the 340 LEU+/LacZ+ colonies isolated in the screen demonstrated a galactose-dependent phenotype. Fourteen of these, representing nine independent cDNAs, bound TNFR1-DD selectively, as assessed by comparing the interaction with TNFR1-DD to an unrelated bait, Bicoid. Two of these clones were partial cDNAs encoding portions of a protein we have termed MADD. These partial clones, called 27TU and 15TU, encoded polypeptides of 607 and 320 amino acids, respectively. A partial MADD cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 410 amino acids was also isolated from a similar screen performed with a WI38 library (not shown). The yeast interaction trap was used to investigate the specificity of the interaction between TNFR1-DD and 27TU/15TU. As shown in Table I, both 27TU and 15TU interacted strongly with the death domain of TNFR1, although neither interacted with the death domain of the Fas antigen. Both clones bound the intracellular domain of TNFR1 but not the type 2 TNF receptor.Table ISpecificity and mutational analyses of MADD partial clones 27TU and 15TU15TU27TUSpecificity analysisTNFR1-DD++++++Fas-DD−−TNFR1-IC++++TNFR2-IC−−Bicoid−−Mutational analysisTNFR1-DD++++++F345A++L351A++E369A++++++W378A+++I408A++++The yeast interaction trap was used to compare the ability of 27TU and 15TU (in pJG4–5) to interact with a variety of “baits” (in pEG202), including the TNFR1 death domain (TNFR-DD), the death domain of the Fas antigen (Fas-DD), the intracellular domain of TNFR1 (TNFR1-IC), the intracellular domain of TNFR2 (TNFR2-IC), and the Bicoid protein. 27TU and 15TU were also tested for their ability to bind TNFR1-DD containing mutations at critical signaling residues. Phe-345, Leu-351, Gly-369, Trp-378, and Ile-408 were individually mutated to alanine and subcloned into pEG202 for testing in the interaction trap.

Open table in a new tab The yeast interaction trap was used to compare the ability of 27TU and 15TU (in pJG4–5) to interact with a variety of “baits” (in pEG202), including the TNFR1 death domain (TNFR-DD), the death domain of the Fas antigen (Fas-DD), the intracellular domain of TNFR1 (TNFR1-IC), the intracellular domain of TNFR2 (TNFR2-IC), and the Bicoid protein. 27TU and 15TU were also tested for their ability to bind TNFR1-DD containing mutations at critical signaling residues.

Pluses represent relative β-galactosidase expression, as judged by the color intensity in plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. In an effort to determine the amino acids within TNFR1-DD involved in this interaction, five of the six death domain residues previously shown to be critical for signaling TNF-induced cytotoxicity (3Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar) were mutated individually to alanine. When assayed in the interaction trap, both N- and C-terminal mutations were found to affect MADD binding (Table I). Several other unrelated clones isolated in the screen did not show differential interaction (data not shown). The interaction of MADD with the death domain of TNFR1, and specifically with several critical signaling residues, supports the relevance of MADD in TNF signaling. Northern analysis revealed MADD mRNA to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines as a 7-kilobase transcript (Fig. 1). A full-length MADD cDNA was assembled from partial clones isolated in three library screens. The open reading frame of MADD encodes a novel protein containing 1588 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 176.4 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Examination of the MADD sequence revealed several interesting features (Fig. 2 B). The most striking is a C-terminal region that bears significant homology to the death domain of TNFR1. In addition, like other death domain-containing proteins (32Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Google Scholar), MADD contains regions rich in serine and threonine residues. Approximately 25% of the residues in these clusters are serine or threonine. The N terminus of MADD contains a consensus leucine zipper sequence (33Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism by which MADD might dimerize or interact with other proteins.Figure 2Structure of full-length MADD. A, the predicted amino acid sequence of MADD. The C-terminal death domain and N-terminal leucine zipper are underlined, with consensus leucine zipper residues shown in bold. The clones isolated from the interaction trap screen, 27TU and 15TU, begin at residues Glu-982 (E982) and Phe-1269 (F1269), respectively, as indicated by arrows.

Black boxesrepresent regions rich in serine and threonine residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Death domains mediate interactions between several proteins involved in TNF signaling. To examine the homology between the death domains of MADD and TNFR1, these sequences were aligned with each other and with Fas and TRADD (Fig. 3). The death domain of MADD is 17% identical to that of TNFR1, 12% identical to Fas, and 14% to TRADD. If conservative amino acid changes are considered, the degree of similarity between MADD and TNFR1, Fas, and TRADD increases to 30, 29, and 22%, respectively. For comparison, TNFR1 and Fas are 21% identical and 35% similar by this alignment. The six residues previously reported to be critical for TNFR1 signaling are indicated with asterisks. MADD is identical to TNFR1 at three of these positions. To detect endogenous MADD, a fusion protein between partial clone 27TU and maltose binding protein (MBP-27TU) was used as antigen to generate polyclonal antibodies 6007 and 6008. MADD was immunoprecipitated from various cell lines with antibody 6008 and detected by immunoblotting with antibody 6007. As shown in Fig. 4, MADD is widely expressed and migrates as a protein of approximately 200 kDa, similar to overexpressed MADD (see Fig. 5 C). The 100-kDa band is nonspecific and the additional bands (at 170 and 85 kDa) immunoprecipitated from U937 cells represent degradation products of MADD (as judged by immunoprecipitation with preimmune antiserum, data not shown).Figure 5Association of TNFR1 and MADD. GST-DD, a fusion protein between GST and TNFR1-DD, was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with purified MBP-27TU fusion protein. MBP fusion protein bound to the beads after extensive washing (A) as well as unbound protein (B) were detected by immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody. MBP and GST proteins were tested as negative controls. C, association of MADD and TNFR1 in COS. COS cells were transfected with pED-FLAG (V) or FLAG-MADD (M). Two days after transfection, TNFR1 was immunoprecipitated with preimmune or immune polyclonal antibody 4013. Immunoprecipitates (IP) were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As discussed above, the death domain is a protein-protein interaction motif found in several proteins implicated in TNFR1 signaling. Both 27TU and 15TU contain this motif, suggesting a mechanism by which they bind the death domain of TNFR1. To investigate whether the death domain of MADD was indeed sufficient for interaction with the death domain of TNFR1, a fragment encoding the 76-amino acid region of death domain homology, residues 1281–1356, was tested in the interaction trap for binding to TNFR1-DD. A death domain deletion mutant of clone 15TU (15ΔDD) was used as a control. As shown in Table II, the MADD death domain is sufficient for interaction with the death domain of TNFR1. Conversely, deletion of the death domain abolishes the ability of 15TU to interact. These data establish that the MADD death domain mediates association with TNFR1. Interestingly, the MADD death domain also mediated interaction with itself, as well as with the death domain of TRADD (Table II). In contrast, no interaction was detected with the death domain of Fas. The observation that MADD can associate with TNFR1 and TRADD, but not with Fas, is consistent with the possibility that MADD is a component of the TNFR1 signaling complex.Table IIRole of the MADD death domain in mediating protein-protein interactionsTNFR1-DDFas-DDTRADD-DDMADD-DDMADD-DD+++−+++++15ΔDD−−−−MADD, TNFR1, Fas, and TRADD death domains were cloned into pEG202 and cotransformed into yeast with the MADD death domain in pJG4–5.

The death domain of TNFR1 was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST-DD) and tested for interaction with MBP-27TU. GST or GST-DD immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with purified MBP-27TU or MBP alone. Immunoblotting with α-MBP antibody revealed that MBP-27TU bound to GST-DD (Fig. 5 A) but not GST, nor did MBP associate with GST-DD. To test whether MADD associated with TNFR1 in mammalian cells, COS cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length MADD fused at its N terminus to the FLAG epitope (FLAG-MADD). Endogenous TNFR1 was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody to TNFR1, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 C, MADD coimmunoprecipitated with TNFR1 immune, but not preimmune, serum. Proteins immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with the pED-FLAG vector (V) showed no immunoreactivity to the FLAG epitope. The coimmunoprecipitation of MADD and TNFR1 was observed in both untreated and TNF-treated cells, suggesting that MADD is constitutively associated with TNFR1. An important signaling pathway in the cellular response to TNF is the activation of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK. These enzymes phosphorylate and activate several transcription factors, including AP-1 (34Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar), ATF2 (35Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar), and ELK-1 (36Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Google Scholar), leading to the increased transcription of a number of genes involved in inflammation (37Kaszubska W. van Huijsduijnen R.H. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.-M.

ERK has also been shown to activate cPLA2 by phosphorylation, leading to the release of arachidonic acid (40Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar). To explore whether MADD might be involved in these signaling pathways, we tested whether overexpression of this protein stimulated MAP kinase activity. COS cells were cotransfected with HA-epitope tagged ERK2 or JNK1 and cDNAs encoding either intact MADD or partial clone 15TU. After transfection, MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and its activity was assessed using myelin basic protein or GST-c-JUN (amino acids 1–79) as substrates for ERK and JNK, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 A, MADD expression stimulated both basal and TNF-induced ERK activity. Immunoblotting of lysates from vector- and MADD-transfected cells with anti-HA antibody confirmed equivalent HA-ERK expression (not shown). Expression of 15TU caused an even greater activation of ERK (Fig.6 B). In addition, 15TU induced a significant activation of JNK even in the absence of TNF, although the stimulation was less robust than that seen with ERK.

https://openalex.org/W1997105777,"Cellular Ca2+ buffers determine amplitude and diffusional spread of neuronal Ca2+ signals. Fixed Ca2+ buffers tend to retard the signal and to lower the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of Ca2+, whereas mobile buffers contribute to Ca2+ redistribution. To estimate the impact of the expression of specific Ca2+-binding proteins or the errors in Ca2+ measurement introduced by indicator dyes, the diffusion coefficient De and the Ca2+-binding ratio κe of endogenous Ca2+ buffers must be known. In this study, we obtain upper bounds to these quantities (De < 16 μm2/s; κe < 60) for axoplasm of metacerebral cells of Aplysia california. Due to these very low values, even minute concentrations of indicator dyes will interfere with the spatiotemporal pattern of Ca2+ signals and will conceal changes in the expression of specific Ca2+-binding proteins, which in the native neuron are expected to have significant effects on Ca2+ signals."
https://openalex.org/W1988798978,"The marginal zone (MZ) of embryonic neocortex is crucial to its normal development. We report that neurotrophin-4 (but not NT3 or NGF), applied to embryonic rodent cortex in vitro or in vivo, produces heterotopic accumulations of neurons in the MZ. Although heterotopia production is TrkB mediated, BDNF is >10-fold less effective than NT4. Heterotopic neurons have the same birth date and phenotype as normal MZ neurons; they are not the result of NT4-induced proliferation or rescue from apoptosis. We suggest that NT4 causes excess neurons to migrate into the MZ and thus may play a role in normal MZ formation as well as in the pathogenesis of certain human cortical dysplasias."
https://openalex.org/W2033270508,"The product topology of Xer-mediated site-specific recombination at plasmid sites has been determined. The product of deletion at pSC101 psi is a right-handed antiparallel 4-noded catenane. The ColE1 cer deletion product has an identical topology, except that only one pair of strands is exchanged. These specific product topologies imply that the productive synaptic complex and the strand exchange mechanism have fixed topologies. Further analysis suggests that synapsis traps exactly three negative supercoils between recombining sites, and that strand exchange introduces a further negative topological node in the deletion reaction. We present a model in which the requirement for a specific synaptic stucture, with two recombination sites interwrapped around the accessory proteins ArgR and PepA, ensures that recombination only occurs efficiently between directly repeated sites on the same DNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2006183148,"The mobile group II introns aI1 and aI2 of yeast mtDNA encode endonuclease activities that cleave intronless DNA target sites to initiate mobility by target DNA-primed reverse transcription. For aI2, sense-strand cleavage occurs mainly by a partial reverse splicing reaction, whereas for aI1, complete reverse splicing occurs, leading to insertion of the linear intron RNA into double-stranded DNA. Here, we show that aI1 homing and reverse splicing depend on the EBS1 (RNA)/IBS1(DNA) pairing and that target specificity can be changed by compensatory changes in the target site and the donor intron. Using well-marked strains to follow coconversion of flanking DNA, we show that homing occurs by both RT-dependent and -independent pathways. Remarkably, in most RT-dependent events, the reverse spliced intron is the initial template for first-strand cDNA synthesis."

Less than 1 ng of purified Thy-1 could be detected by probing Western blots with the toxin. Mutant T-cell lines that lack the ability to add GPI anchors to Thy-1 and other surface proteins were much less sensitive to aerolysin, as were wild-type cells that were pretreated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to remove GPI-anchored proteins.

Phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes containing purified Thy-1 in their membranes were much more sensitive to aerolysin than protein-free liposomes. Aerolysin is one of the best studied of all of the bacterial cytolytic toxins. The protein is secreted as a 52-kDa inactive precursor called proaerolysin by a number of Aeromonas spp., and it is known to be required for the virulence of Aeromonas hydrophila in mice (see Ref. 1Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Google Scholar for a recent review). Proaerolysin exists as a freely soluble dimer in solution. It is converted to the active form of the protein by proteolytic processing near the C terminus. Aerolysin is also a soluble dimer; however, in contrast to the protoxin form, it is capable of oligomerization, producing heptameric structures that transform the protein into an insertion-competent state. Cells that contain a receptor for aerolysin are much more sensitive to the toxin than other cells. Among erythrocytes that have been compared, those of the rat are most sensitive (2Bernheimer A.W. Avigad L.S. Avigad G. Infect. Immun. 1975; 11: 1312-1319Google Scholar, 3Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Google Scholar), and we have shown that this is because they contain a 47-kDa glycoprotein that binds both proaerolysin and aerolysin with considerable affinity (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar). Presumably the primary function of the receptor is to concentrate the toxin on the cell surface, thereby indirectly promoting oligomerization. However, it is also possible that receptor binding has a more direct role in oligomerization. For example, it could facilitate dissociation of the aerolysin dimer, which is presumably an essential step in formation of the heptamer. Most studies with cytolytic toxins have been carried out with erythrocytes because of their uncomplicated structure and metabolism, the ease with which they can be obtained free of other cells, and the simplicity of hemolytic assays. However, there is no reason to believe that these cells would be the primary targets of the bacterial pathogens that secrete cytolysins. Components of the immune system are more obvious candidates for toxin targeting. In this report, we show that Thy-1, a major surface glycoprotein of rodent T-lymphocytes, is a high affinity receptor for aerolysin. The murine lymphoma cell lines BW5147.3 and BW5147.3(Thy-1− e).10 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cell lines EL4 and EL4(Thy-1− f) were generously supplied by R. Hyman (Salk Institute). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal clone I serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells (5 × 105/ml) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were incubated with 7 × 10−10m aerolysin for 1 h at 37 °C. Live/dead counts were made using a hemocytometer after adding an equal volume of 0.1% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. Killing of EL4 cells by aerolysin was also measured using the membrane-impermeant probe Po-Pro 1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), which fluoresces when bound to nucleic acids made available by the action of aerolysin on the cells. The time dependence of cell death was measured at various aerolysin concentrations with a Photon Technology QM-1 spectrofluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 435 and 455 nm, respectively, and slit widths were 4 nm. SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Neville (5Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Google Scholar). Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose and developed by sandwich Western blotting as described by Gruber et al. (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar), which involves probing blots with 2 × 10−8m proaerolysin, followed by polyclonal anti-aerolysin antibody and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. Blots were then developed by enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Corp.). Tissues were quickly excised and homogenized in 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.16m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 8, using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) at 4 °C. Protein was determined as described by Markwell et al.(6Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.M. Biaber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Google Scholar). An equal volume of 40 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, was added to 5 μl of 4.5 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, and the mixture was boiled for 2 min. After cooling to room temperature, 3.3 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, 120 μm leupeptin, and 12 μm pepstatin A were added, followed by 2.5 μl of 10% octyl glucopyranoside and 7.5 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (Oxford Glycosystems) containing 1.5 units of the enzyme. A control incubation was also carried out in which 7.5 μl of buffer were added in place of the enzyme. After 18 h at 37 °C, sample buffer was added, and aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE and sandwich Western-blotted. Affinity-purified Thy-1 from rat thymus (7Morris R.J. Letarte-Muirhead M. Williams A.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1975; 5: 274-281Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. R. McMaster (University of British Columbia). The only band visible on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel corresponded to the monomeric protein. In addition to the monomer, a small band corresponding to the dimer was detected by sandwich Western blotting. Dried lipid films were prepared from a mixture of egg yolkl-α-phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) and cholesterol (mole ratio of 7:1) and rehydrated in 2 ml of 100 mm carboxyfluorescein in 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Large unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) were prepared by extrusion through 25-mm polycarbonate filters using an Extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) as described by Hope et al. (8Hope M. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Google Scholar). The liposome concentration was determined by measuring the phosphate content using a standard assay (9Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). Thy-1 was incorporated into the liposomes following the procedure of Rigaud et al. (10Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μl of Thy-1 (42.5 μg) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1% octyl glucoside were added to 500 μl of carboxyfluorescein-entrapped liposomes (1.3 μmol of lipid). As a negative control, 250 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1% octyl glucoside were added to 500 μl of carboxyfluorescein-entrapped liposomes. To both samples were added 250 μl of a 2.2% stock of octyl glucoside in 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, so that the final octyl glucoside concentration was 0.8%. After overnight dialysis against 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, the liposomes were passed over a Sephacryl S-300 column (18 ml) to remove unincorporated Thy-1. Carboxyfluorescein release was monitored spectrofluorometrically. The excitation wavelength was set at 490 nm, and the emission wavelength at 520 nm. A 4-nm slit width was used for both monochromators. Small aliquots of the liposome preparations (21.5 nmol of lipid) were added to 3 ml of 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and carboxyfluorescein release was followed with time. Activated aerolysin was added to a concentration of 4 × 10−8m at 2 min. Total entrapped carboxyfluorescein in the liposomes was measured by adding Triton X-100 to a 0.1% (w/v) final concentration at the end of each run. All of the experiments were carried out at room temperature. Five-hundred μl of 9 × 107 EL4 cells/ml were incubated with 200 milliunits of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. A control sample was incubated without the enzyme. The cells were subsequently pelleted at 80,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. Aliquots of the supernatants and pellets were used for the sandwich Western blotting procedure. Liposomes (86 nmol of phosphatidylcholine) containing reconstituted Thy-1 (0.85 μg) and control liposomes containing no protein were treated with 600 milliunits of PI-PLC for 60 min at room temperature. Liposomes containing Thy-1 incubated under the same conditions without PI-PLC also served as controls. We have shown that there is a 47-kDa glycoprotein in rat erythrocyte membranes that binds aerolysin with high affinity (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar). The protein can be detected by exposing Western blots of membrane proteins to low concentrations of proaerolysin (10−9m) and probing with an anti-aerolysin antibody after washing to remove unbound protein (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar). We decided to screen a number of mouse tissues in a similar way for proteins that might bind proaerolysin. The tissues were homogenized and dissolved directly in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Bands indicating aerolysin binding were observed in all of the tissues, but by far the most intense were those observed in the region of 30 kDa in the lanes containing thymus and brain (Fig. 1). The appearance of an aerolysin-binding protein on blots of homogenized thymus prompted us to examine several T-cell lymphomas in the same way as we screened the tissues. The results for two cell lines, EL4 and BW5147.3, are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that a protein corresponding to those observed in the brain and thymus is also found in these T-cells. We have obtained evidence that the rat erythrocyte receptor is anchored to the cell surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol attached to its C terminus (1Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Google Scholar). To determine if the 30-kDa protein in the T-cells might be anchored in a similar way, we took advantage of the fact that there are EL4 and BW5147.3 cell lines that lack the ability to attach these anchors to any of their surface proteins (11Stevens V.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10039-10042Google Scholar). When proteins from these cells were studied by the Western blotting technique, it was clear that they contained far lower quantities of the 30-kDa species (Fig.2). GPI anchoring of the 30-kDa protein found on normal EL4 cells, suggested by the experiment with the mutant cells, was confirmed by treating the wild-type cells with PI-PLC. This enzyme is known to release many proteins anchored to cell membranes in this way (12Low M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 1-13Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3 show that reaction with the enzyme led to a pronounced decrease in the amount of cell-associated aerolysin-binding protein, which appeared in the soluble fraction after cell pelleting. This allows us to conclude that this proaerolysin-binding protein is GPI-anchored and also that the lipid portion of the anchor for this protein is a single molecule of diacylglycerol. Several mammalian GPI-anchored proteins, such as human acetylcholinesterase (13Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Google Scholar) and Trypanosoma brucei procyclic acid repeat protein (14Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Google Scholar), are known to contain an additional acyl chain esterified to the inositol moiety. These proteins are not released by phospholipase C treatment (13Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Google Scholar). More than 100 different proteins are known to be attached to the plasma membrane by GPI anchors, and several have been reported to be present on T-lymphocytes (15Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 243-256Google Scholar). Of those for which information is available, we could find only two that have molecular masses in the region of 30 kDa. One of these is RT6, which is not expressed by EL4 cells. The other is Thy-1, a glycoprotein that migrates as two or more bands in the region of 30 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It is the smallest known member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (16Williams A.F. Gagnon J. Science. 1982; 216: 696-703Google Scholar), and in mice and rats, it is a major cell-surface component of thymocytes and brain (17Campbell D.G. Gagnon J. Reid K.B.M. Williams A.F. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 15-30Google Scholar). Thy-1 is known to be N-glycosylated at three positions, and it is not O-glycosylated (18Parketh R.B. Tse A.G. Dwek R.A. Williams A.F. Rademacher T.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1233-1244Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the protein after peptide N-glycosidase F treatment should be ∼14.5 kDa. The results in Fig. 4 show that when EL4 cell samples were treated with peptideN-glycosidase F, the aerolysin-binding component was reduced to a single band migrating with an apparent mass in this range. This result supports the view that the aerolysin receptor is Thy-1. In addition, it eliminates the possibility that it is RT6 since the molecular mass of the amino acid chain of this protein is much higher (19Waite D.J. Handler E.S. Mordes J.P. Rossini A.A. Greiner D.L. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 82-95Google Scholar). The possibility that the 47-kDa rat erythrocyte receptor we have described (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar) is simply a more heavily glycosylated derivative of the 30-kDa glycoprotein in the T-cell and brain is also excluded by this result. The molecular mass of the erythrocyte proaerolysin-binding protein is reduced only to 32 kDa by peptide N-glycosidase F treatment (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar). We have recently obtained the N-terminal sequence of the erythrocyte receptor, which indicates that the protein is related to a small family of GPI-anchored proteins that are involved in ADP-ribosylation reactions. 2K. L. Nelson, S. M. Raja, and J. T. Buckley, submitted for publication. Interestingly, there are no apparent sequence similarities between these proteins and Thy-1. To confirm that aerolysin binds Thy-1, a blot containing varying amounts of the purified rat thymus protein in the nanogram and picogram range was probed with proaerolysin (Fig.5). It may be seen that proaerolysin binding provides a very sensitive method to detect Thy-1 after Western blotting. Less than 1 ng of the GPI-anchored protein could be detected in this way. The results in Fig. 6 show that Thy-1 in the brains of a number of species may bind proaerolysin. Thus, rabbit, human, and pig brains contain proteins of corresponding size and in similar amounts to the mouse. Comparable binding intensity was not observed in cow and sheep brains. However, we did not determine whether this is because Thy-1 levels are low in the brains of these species (none of the commercially available anti-Thy-1 antibodies we could find will detect Thy-1 on Western blots) or whether it is because the cow and sheep Thy-1 proteins differ from the protein from the other species in some way that affects proaerolysin binding. We used a simple assay to determine if EL4 cells containing surface GPI-anchored proteins are more sensitive to aerolysin than cells without these determinants. EL4 cells were incubated with 1 μm Po-Pro 1, a membrane-impermeant probe that fluoresces when it intercalates with double-stranded nucleic acid. When aerolysin is added to wild-type cells, there is an increase in fluorescence after a delay that we have found depends on the concentration of the toxin (data not shown). Live/dead cell counts carried out in parallel showed that all of the cells are dead by the time the fluorescence curve plateaus. As little as 10−10m aerolysin leads to 100% killing of wild-type cells in <1 h at 37 °C (data not shown). The results of an experiment comparing the effect of a much higher concentration of aerolysin (1.8 × 10−8m) on wild-type and EL4(Thy-1− f) cells are shown in Fig. 7. It is clear that this toxin concentration, nearly 100-fold higher than that needed to kill wild-type cells, had no measured effect on the mutant cells. The survival of the mutant cells was confirmed independently by live/dead cell counts. Comparable experiments showed that BW5147.3(Thy-1− e).10 cells, which also lack GPI-anchored proteins, were much less sensitive than the corresponding wild-type cells. Results similar to those in Fig. 7 were obtained when we compared EL4 cells with cells that had been pretreated with PI-PLC. The enzyme-treated cells had greatly reduced sensitivity to the toxin. 3K. L. Nelson, S. M. Raja, and J. T. Buckley, unpublished observations. The results of the experiments comparing wild-type and mutant cell lines were convincing evidence that GPI-anchored proteins confer aerolysin sensitivity to T-lymphocytes. However, since these cells may contain several different proteins anchored in this way, we could not conclude that Thy-1 itself was acting as an aerolysin receptor. We have shown previously that incorporation of the rat erythrocyte receptor into planar bilayers increases their sensitivity to aerolysin (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar). Since GPI-anchored proteins are easily incorporated into liposome membranes, we used entrapped dye release from large unilamellar vesicles as an assay instead of the more cumbersome planar bilayer assay to determine the effect of purified Thy-1 on the ability of aerolysin to form channels. The results in Fig.8 A show that nanomolar concentrations of aerolysin cause the release of carboxyfluorescein from liposomes containing incorporated Thy-1, but not from control liposomes containing only lipid. As expected, when Thy-1 was removed from the membranes by treating the liposomes with PI-PLC, their sensitivity to aerolysin was abolished (Fig. 8 B). Thy-1 is the major protein on the surface of rodent T-cells, and for this reason alone, it is an ideal target for a bacterial toxin like aerolysin. The T-cells of other species contain variable amounts of the protein. For example, in the human, progenitor cells are the richest lymphocyte source (20Craig W. Kay R. Cutler R.L. Lansdorp P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1331-1342Google Scholar). The brains of many species are also rich in Thy-1, but it is unlikely that this could be significant inAeromonas infections. Interestingly, despite the fact that bovine thymocytes (21Xu C.S. Wang I.Y. Wang A.C. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 791-796Google Scholar) are known to contain a homologue of the rat and human Thy-1 proteins, we found little or no aerolysin binding after blotting cow (or sheep) brain samples when compared with the other species we tested. Presumably, this means that the glycoprotein in these two species differs from Thy-1 of the others in some region of the structure that is crucial for proaerolysin binding. Our results tell us several things about the interaction of aerolysin with Thy-1. The fact that the receptor could easily be detected in cell-free supernatants following treatment with PI-PLC by probing blots with proaerolysin (Fig. 3) is evidence that the diglyceride portion of the anchor is not required for binding. Similarly, since binding was not reduced when the N-linked sugars were removed (Fig. 4), it is clear that this portion of Thy-1 is also not involved in the interaction with the protoxin. GPI-anchored glycoproteins are thought to be capable of much higher lateral mobility in the plasma membrane than proteins with conventional peptide transmembrane regions (22Zang F. Schmidt W.G. Hou Y. Williams A.F. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5231-5235Google Scholar), and this may be an advantage in promoting channel formation by aerolysin. Before binding, the toxin is a water-soluble dimer, and to form membrane channels, it must oligomerize and form insertion-competent heptamers (1Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Google Scholar). Presumably, the toxin, once bound to the receptor, moves laterally in the membrane to form the oligomer. Clearly, the abundance of Thy-1 on murine T-cells should facilitate binding, and the lateral mobility of the receptor should facilitate oligomerization. It is also easy to speculate that binding to a small protein molecule like Thy-1, close to the cell surface and lipid-anchored, may make it easier for the aerolysin oligomer to insert into the bilayer. Interestingly, such a function has already been proposed for CAMPATH-1, a small GPI-anchored polypeptide on human lymphocytes (23Xia M. Hale G. Lifely M.R. Ferguson M.A.J. Campbell D. Packmans L. Waldman H. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 633-640Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against this molecule are very effective for complement-mediated cell lysis (24Bindon C.I. Hale G. Waldman H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1507-1514Google Scholar). Thy-1 is not the only membrane protein that can act as a receptor for aerolysin. We have previously characterized such a protein in the rat erythrocyte (4Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Google Scholar), and the comparison of mouse tissues by sandwich Western blotting in Fig. 1 identifies a few other bands that may represent proteins with affinity for the toxin. Our recent evidence indicates that the rat erythrocyte protein is a member of another family of proteins that are unrelated to Thy-1, except that they all also contain GPI anchors.2 It is worth noting thatBacillus thuringiensis δ-toxin has recently been shown to bind to a GPI-anchored aminopeptidase in the midgut of the insectManduca sexta (25Knight P.J.K. Knowles B.H. Ellar D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17765-17770Google Scholar). Like many other toxins, aerolysin has long been classified as a channel-forming hemolysin, and it is clear that it destroys erythrocytes by breaching the permeability barrier. The mechanism by which it causes death in other cells, such as T-lymphocytes, is worth further study. It seems likely that at high concentrations, where channels would be formed at a rate that would overwhelm the cell, the cause of death may be comparable to that in the erythrocyte. However, at low toxin concentrations, other causes of death may be more important, and they may result from the binding of the toxin to receptors like Thy-1. Although the functions of many GPI-anchored proteins are unknown, there is evidence for some that clustering results in the generation of an intracellular signal. For example, clustering of Thy-1 molecules as a result of binding by an anti-Thy-1 antibody has been shown to cause lymphocyte apoptosis (26Hueber A.-O. Raposo G. Pierres M. He H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 785-796Google Scholar). Since oligomerization of aerolysin should promote clustering of Thy-1 in the same way as the antibody, we should expect to see aerolysin apoptosis under some conditions. Aerolysin should prove to be a useful tool in the study of apoptosis and in related studies of the function of Thy-1 and other GPI-anchored proteins. We are grateful to R. Hyman for generously providing some of the strains. We thank Dr. R. McMaster for providing purified rat thymus Thy-1."
https://openalex.org/W2137798697,"We reported previously the cloning of a novel human serine protease inhibitor containing two Kunitz-like domains, designated as placental bikunin, and the subsequent purification of a natural counterpart from human placental tissue (Marlor, C. W., Delaria, K. A., Davis, G., Muller, D. K., Greve, J. M., and Tamburini, P. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12202–12208). In this report, the 170 residue extracellular domain of placental bikunin (placental bikunin(1–170)) was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using its putative signal peptide. The resulting 21.3-kDa protein accumulated in the medium with the signal peptide removed and could be highly purified by sequential kallikrein-Sepharose and C18 reverse-phase chromatography. To provide insights as to the potential in vivo functions of this protein, we performed an extensive investigation of the inhibitory properties of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170) and both of its synthetically prepared Kunitz domains. All three proteins inhibited a number of serine proteases involved in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Placental bikunin(1–170) formed inhibitor-protease complexes with a 1:2 stoichiometry and strongly inhibited human plasmin (K i = 0.1 nm), human tissue kallikrein (K i = 0.1 nm), human plasma kallikrein (K i = 0.3 nm) and human factor XIa (K i = 6 nm). Conversely, this protein was a weaker inhibitor of factor VIIa-tissue factor (K i = 1.6 μm), factor IXa (K i = 206 nm), factor Xa (K i = 364 nm), and factor XIIa (K i = 430 nm). This specificity profile was to a large extent mimicked, albeit with reduced potency, by the individual Kunitz domains. As predicted from this in vitrospecificity profile, recombinant placental bikunin(1–170)prolonged the clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time assay. We reported previously the cloning of a novel human serine protease inhibitor containing two Kunitz-like domains, designated as placental bikunin, and the subsequent purification of a natural counterpart from human placental tissue (Marlor, C. W., Delaria, K. A., Davis, G., Muller, D. K., Greve, J. M., and Tamburini, P. P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12202–12208).

This specificity profile was to a large extent mimicked, albeit with reduced potency, by the individual Kunitz domains. As predicted from this in vitrospecificity profile, recombinant placental bikunin(1–170)prolonged the clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time assay. Blood clotting, resulting either from the extrinsic pathway following tissue injury or the intrinsic pathway following contact activation, involves tightly regulated proteolytic cascades (1Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is initiated by activation of factor XII either through proteolysis or contact with negatively charged surfaces. Activated factor XIIa, in turn, converts plasma prekallikrein to kallikrein, which can then activate additional factor XII. Factor XIIa activates factor XI, which, in turn, activates factor IX. Activated factor IX forms a complex with factor VIIIa, phospholipid, and calcium, which converts factor X to factor Xa. Factor X is also activated by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex operating within the extrinsic pathway. Thrombin generation by factor Xa in complex with factor Va leads ultimately to the formation of the fibrin clot. Thrombus formation is also regulated by the fibrinolytic system whereby plasmin, formed from plasminogen by the action of kallikrein, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; Suc, succinyl; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; Boc,t-butoxycarbonyl; Bz, benzoyl; pNa,p-nitroanilide; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time. or urokinase, breaks down both fibrinogen and fibrin (2Marder V.J. Frances C.W. Doolittle R.F. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott, Philadelphia1982: 145-163Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors play critical roles in the regulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a multivalent Kunitz-type inhibitor, is a major regulator of the extrinsic pathway through factor Xa-dependent inhibition of factor VIIa-tissue factor (3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar). C1 inhibitor is thought to be the major physiological inhibitor of the intrinsic pathway enzymes plasma kallikrein and factor XII (4Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Google Scholar). More recently, TFPI-2, a serine protease inhibitor structurally related to TFPI, has been proposed to be an important physiological inhibitor of enzymes involved in both coagulation and fibrinolysis (5Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified and cloned a human cDNA encoding a novel protein containing two Kunitz-like domains which we termed placental bikunin (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar). In this study a soluble recombinant fragment of this protein, placental bikunin(1–170), 2Residues of the placental bikunin sequence and fragments thereof are numbered as defined in Ref. 6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar according to their position within the open reading frame for full-length mature placental bikunin. In this scheme, placental bikunin(1–170) refers to a protein containing the NH2-terminal 170 amino acids of the mature protein produced by removal of the signal peptide. The NH2-terminal(7–64) domain and COOH-terminal(102–159) domain refer to individual functional Kunitz domains normally present within residues 7–64 and 102–159, respectively, of mature placental bikunin. was expressed and found to be a potent serine protease inhibitor. Using the recombinant protein and both of its synthetic NH2- and COOH-terminal Kunitz domains, we dissect the specificity of the protein more comprehensively. In doing so, we demonstrate that placental bikunin is a potent inhibitor of plasma and tissue kallikreins, plasmin and factor XIa. Bovine chymotrypsin, bovine trypsin, and tPA (single chain form from human melanoma cell culture), urokinase, Suc-A-A-P-F-AMC, Boc-L-G-R-AMC, Suc-A-A-A-AMC, Boc-Q-G-R-AMC, Bz-P-F-R-pNa, and P-F-R-AMC were from Sigma. Neutrophil elastase was from Athens Research and Technology, Inc. (Athens, GA). Human plasmin, factor VIIa, tissue factor (lipidated), and (CH3SO2-D-cyclohexylpyrosyl)-G-R-pNa (Spectrozyme tPA substrate) were from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Human plasma kallikrein and human factors IXa, X, Xa, XIa, and XIIa were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Lafayette, IN). Tos-G-P-K-AMC, Suc-A-A-P-R-pNa, and Boc-E(OBzl)-A-R-AMC, were from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA). H-D-I-P-R-pNa was from Chromogenix AB. Bovine pancreatic kallikrein, human tissue kallikrein, and recombinant aprotinin were kindly provided by Bayer AG (Wuppertal, Germany). A cDNA fragment encoding an NH2-terminal 170-amino acid fragment of placental bikunin was expressed in Sf9 cells (7Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Google Scholar) as follows. Placental bikunin cDNA obtained by polymerase chain reaction and contained within the pCRII vector as described previously (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar) was liberated by digestion with HindIII and XbaI. This fragment was gel purified and then cloned into the M13mp19 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).In vitro mutagenesis (8Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) was used to generate aPstI site between the upstream XbaI site and the sequence encoding the ATG start site at the 5′ end of the cDNA insert. The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis had the sequence CGC GTC TCG GCT GAC CTG GCC CTG CAG ATG GCG CAC GTG TGC GGG. A stop codon (TAG) and BglII/XmaI site was similarly engineered at the 3′ end of the cDNA using the oligonucleotide CTG CCC CTT GGC TCA AAG TAG GAA GAT CTT CCC CCC GGG GGG GTG GTT CTG GCG GGG CTG. The stop codon was in-frame with the sequence encoding placental bikunin and caused termination immediately following the lysine at amino acid residue 170 of the mature protein sequence. The mutated cDNA thus encoded a truncated placental bikunin protein containing both Kunitz domains but which was devoid of the putative transmembrane domain. The product from digestion with PstI andBglII was isolated and cloned into the BacPac8 vector (CLONTECH) for expression of placental bikunin(1–170). The expression of placental bikunin(1–170) by Sf9 insect cells was optimal at a multiplicity of infection of 1 when the medium was harvested at 72 h post-infection. Sf9 cell culture supernatant (2–3 liters) was harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 30 min), adjusted to pH 8.0 by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm, then applied at 2.0-ml min−1 to a 5-ml column comprised of bovine pancreatic kallikrein (70 mg) which had been immobilized onto CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After loading, the column was washed with 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl until the A 280 nm of the wash could no longer be detected. The column was washed further with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl and then eluted with 0.2m acetic acid (pH 2.0). Fractions (2.0 ml) were collected in tubes containing 0.25 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and assayed for the ability to inhibit bovine trypsin as described (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, adjusted to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to chromatography on a C18 reverse-phase column (1.0 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 22.5% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The placental bikunin(1–170) was eluted with a linear gradient of 22.5–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 50 min. Fractions containing trypsin inhibitory activity were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and stored at −20 °C until needed. The highly purified protein exhibited an ε280 nm of 4.52 × 104 liters m−1cm−1 based upon composition analysis. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 7–64 and 102–159 of mature placental bikunin (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer using NMP-HBTU Fmoc chemistry. Synthesis was on a preloaded Gln resin (Nova Biochem, La Jolla, CA) with an 8-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acid/coupling. The side chain protecting groups used were as follows: for cysteine, histidine, tryptophan, and asparagine, trityl; for glutamic acid, serine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, and threonine, t-butyl; for lysine,t-Boc; and for arginine, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl. In addition, glycine was protected withN-α-Fmoc-N-α-(2-Fmoc-oxy-4-methoxybenzyl) when it occurred after aspartic acid. Cleavage and deprotection were performed in 84.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 4.4% thioanisole, 2.2% ethanedithiol, 4.4% liquefied phenol, and 4.4% H2O for 2 h at room temperature. The crude peptide was precipitated witht-butyl methyl ether, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm in a Sorval RT 6000D model table top centrifuge for 5 min, and washed twice int-butyl methyl ether. Reduced peptides were purified by HPLC (10 ml/min) on a Dynamax 60A C18 column (2.1 × 30 cm) using a 30-min linear gradient of either 23–34% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (placental bikunin(7–64)) or a 30-min linear gradient of 20–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (placental bikunin(102–159)). The purified synthetic peptides corresponding to placental bikunin(7–64) and placental bikunin(102–159) were refolded to yield the respective functional NH2-terminal(7–64) and COOH-terminal(102–159) Kunitz domains using an adaptation of the method of Tam et al. (9Tam J.P. Wu C.-R. Liu W. Zhang J.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-6662Google Scholar) as follows. A solution containing 23% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.0) was added dropwise to a solution of reduced peptide (2.1 and 2.9 mg/ml for the NH2-terminal(7–64) and COOH-terminal(102–159) domain, respectively) in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 6.0), containing 8 m urea to obtain a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml peptide in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.0), and 1 murea. The solutions containing either domain were each stirred at 25 °C for 24 h and then diluted 1:10 with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Refolded material was isolated by affinity chromatography over immobilized bovine pancreatic kallikrein under conditions described above for the purification of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170). Fractions containing trypsin inhibitory activity were pooled, adjusted to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid, then applied directly to a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column (5 μm, 0.46 × 25 cm). The NH2-terminal(7–64) Kunitz domain was purified using a 40-min linear gradient of 22.5–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The COOH-terminal(102–159) Kunitz domain was purified using a 40-min linear gradient of 20–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Active fractions were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and stored at −20 °C until needed. To determine the stoichiometry with trypsin, the protease (2.2 nm) was incubated with recombinant placental bikunin (0–2 nm) or aprotinin (0–4 nm) in 1.0 ml of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100 (buffer A) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of Suc-A-A-P-R-pNa (90 μm, final concentration), after which residual enzymatic formation of pNa was monitored at 410 nm. To determine the stoichiometry with plasma kallikrein, 40 nm protease was incubated with recombinant placental bikunin (0–40 nm) in 1.0 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100 (buffer B). After 30 min at room temperature, Bz-P-F-R-pNa was added (300 μm, final concentration) and residual enzymatic activity monitored at 410 nm. Fractional protease activity was calculated asV (+I)/V (−I) and stoichiometries obtained from plots ofV (+I)/V (−I) versus ratio of inhibitor to enzyme concentrations. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K i*), were determined as described previously (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar) using methods for tight binding inhibitors (10Boudier C. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 36-41Google Scholar) assuming enzyme:inhibitor stoichiometries of 1:1 and 2:1 for binding to single Kunitz domains and placental bikunin(1–170), (1Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Google Scholar) respectively. Active site concentrations of trypsin, plasma and tissue kallikreins, and plasmin were determined by titration withp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate as described (11Chase T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Google Scholar). The concentration of bovine chymotrypsin was determined by titration with N-trans-cinnamoylimidazole as described (12Schonbaum G.R. Zerner B. Bender M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2930-2935Google Scholar). The amount of the NH2-terminal(7–64) and COOH-terminal (102–159) Kunitz domain, and aprotinin were determined by titration with active site-titrated trypsin and by amino acid analysis. The concentration of placental bikunin(1–170) was quantified by amino acid analysis. The concentrations of factors VIIa, IXa, X, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, tissue factor, elastase, urokinase, and tPA were based on the manufacturer's specifications. Following preincubation of protease with inhibitor for 5 min at 37 °C in 990 μl of the appropriate buffer (see below), reactions were initiated with substrate to achieve the following initial component concentrations: bovine pancreatic kallikrein (buffer B) with [E 0] = 92 pm and 100 μm P-F-R-AMC (K m = 82 ± 8.8 μm); human tissue kallikrein, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100 with [E 0] = 0.35 nm and 10 μm P-F-R-AMC (K m = 5.7 ± 0.4 μm); human neutrophil elastase, 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.05% Triton X-100 with [E 0] = 19 nm and 0.6 mm Suc-A-A-A-AMC (K m = 1,300 μm); human factor Xa, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin with [E 0] = 0.87 μm and 0.6 mm Boc-L-G-R-AMC (K m = 750 ± 98 μm); and human factor XIa (buffer A with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with [E 0] = 0.1 nmand 400 μm Boc-E(OBzl)-A-R-AMC (K m = 450 ± 50 μm). The following assays were performed following preincubation of protease with inhibitor for 30 min at 37 °C: trypsin (buffer A) with [E 0] = 50 pm and 30 μm Tos-G-P-K-AMC (K m = 22 ± 2 μm); chymotrypsin (buffer A) with [E 0] = 50 pm and 80 μm Suc-A-A-P-F-AMC (K m = 70 ± 12 μm); human plasmin, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.02% Triton X-100 with [E 0] = 50 pm and 500 μm Tos-G-P-K-AMC (K m = 726 ± 70 μm); human plasma kallikrein (buffer B) with [E 0] = 0.2 nm and 100 μm P-F-R-AMC (K m = 457 ± 28 μm); and factor XIIa (buffer B) with [E 0] = 4.0 nm, and 200 μm Boc-Q-G-R-AMC (K m = 200 ± 37 μm). Factor VIIa-tissue factor inhibition was measured by incubating enzyme (2.8 nm factor VIIa, 2.8 nmtissue factor) with inhibitor in 100 μl of buffer A for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated with 1 mm final (CH3SO2-D-cyclohexylpyrosyl)-G-R-pNa, and the A 405 nm was monitored. Factor IXa inhibition was measured as described (5Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Google Scholar). Briefly, factor IXa (10 nm) was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with inhibitor in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mNaCl, 250 μm CaCl2, 60 nmpoly-d-lysine (M r = 209,200) and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000. Factor X (200 nm) was then added and the incubation continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Substrate (600 μm Boc-L-G-R-AMC) was then added and factor Xa activity measured. To determine the inhibition of tPA, tPA was preincubated with inhibitor for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.02% sodium azide. Reactions were initiated with substrate to achieve initial component concentrations of: tPA (16.7 nm), inhibitor (0–6.6 μm), I-P-R-pNa (1 mm) in 28 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.004% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.005% (v/v) sodium azide. The amount of pNa formed after incubation for 2 h at 37 °C was determined from the increase in the A 405 nm. Hydrolysis of AMC-conjugated peptides was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B fluorometer (excitation = 370 nm, emission = 432 nm) over the first 2 min of the reaction, while hydrolysis ofpNa conjugates was monitored at 405 nm on a Hewlett-Packard model HP8452 spectrophotometer. K i* values were determined from plots of fractional rate versus inhibitor concentration, which were fit by nonlinear regression analysis (Enzfitter by Biosoft, Cambridge, U. K.) using the following equation Vi/V0=1−([E]0+[I]0+Ki*)−[([E]0+[I]0Equation 1 +Ki*)2−4[E]0[I]0]1/2/2[E]0where V i and V 0 are the enzyme activities in the presence or absence of a total inhibitor concentration of [I]0, and [E]0is the total concentration of enzyme. K i values were obtained by correction for the effect of substrate using the following equation: K i = K i*/(1 + [S]0/K m). K i values for inhibition by placental bikunin(1–170) were determined assuming an inhibitor:protease stoichiometry of 1:2 and that the two Kunitz inhibitory domains are equivalent and act independently. The effect of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170) and aprotinin on the APTT was determined as follows. Inhibitor in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.02% sodium azide was added (0.1 ml) to a cuvette within a MLA ElectraR 800 Automatic Coagulation Timer coagulometer (Medical Laboratory Automation, Inc., Pleasantville, NY). The instrument was set to APTT mode with a 300-s activation time, and samples were run in duplicate. Following the addition of 0.1 ml of plasma (Specialty Assayed Reference Plasma 1-6-5185, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX), the APTT reagent (Automated APTT-lot 102345, Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) and CaCl2 (final concentration of 25 mm) were automatically added to initiate clotting, which was monitored automatically. CNBr digestion was performed as follows. Purified placental bikunin(1–170) in water (165 pmol) was taken to dryness on a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY), resuspended in 0.05 ml of 250 mm Tris-HCl containing 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA, and incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature before the addition of 4% (v/v) final 4-vinylpyridine. Following an additional 2-h incubation, the sample was applied to a biphasic reaction cartridge containing C18 (Hewlett-Packard), eluted in methanol, then taken to dryness by Speed-Vac concentration. The sample was incubated with 0.05 ml of 70% (v/v) formic acid saturated with CNBr for 12 h, taken to dryness, reconstituted in 0.1 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, then subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. NH2-terminal sequence analysis was performed essentially as described (13Miller C.G. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 315-333Google Scholar), but with minor modification (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was performed as described previously (14Tamburini P.P. Dreyer R.N. Hansen J. Letsinger J. Elting J. Gore-Willse A. Dally R. Hanko R. Osterman D. Kamarck M.E. Yoo-Warren H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 363-368Google Scholar). Reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 10–20% Tricine-buffered polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and protein was visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 using standard protocols. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan TSQ7000 mass spectrophotometer capable of unit resolution, with the following operational parameters: scan rate, 200–2,000 over 3 s; spray voltage, 5 kV; capillary temperature, 220 °C; nitrogen pressure, 50 p.s.i.; auxillary nitrogen, 30 ml/min. Samples were loaded on a PLRP cartridge (Microm Bioresources, Auburn, CA), washed with water, and eluted at 0.2 ml/min with 90% (v/v) acetonitrile, 2% (v/v) acetic acid. To explore the protease inhibitory capacity of placental bikunin, a cDNA encoding the entire extracellular domain of 170 amino acids of placental bikunin plus its natural signal peptide (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system. The protein was purified from the cell culture supernatant by sequential kallikrein-Sepharose affinity chromatography and C18 reverse-phase HPLC (Table I). An overall enrichment of 240-fold was achieved based on the increase in specific activity; however, the actual fold enrichment of the protein was likely to be much higher as only a fraction of the inhibitory activity of the culture supernatant was due to placental bikunin(1–170). This latter conclusion is based on the fact that the majority (>99%) of the trypsin inhibitory activity present in the starting supernatant did not bind to the kallikrein-Sepharose column, whereas all the placental bikunin(1–170) bound the column based on immunoblot analysis of the column starting material and flow-through (not shown). Fractionation of 2 liters of medium typically yielded between 0.7 and 1 mg of placental bikunin(1–170) based on amino acid analysis.Table IPurification of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170) from Sf9 cellsPurification stepVolumeA 280totalUnitsaA unit of activity is the amount of inhibitor needed to inhibit trypsin activity by 50% with the conditions specified under “Experimental Procedures.”Specific activitymlunits/ASupernatant2,300.020,7006,150,000297Kallikrein affinity23.02.7640,70014,746C180.41.5411,11172,150a A unit of activity is the amount of inhibitor needed to inhibit trypsin activity by 50% with the conditions specified under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The final preparation was highly pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and exhibited a molecular mass of 21.3 kDa, consistent with the expected size of placental bikunin(1–170). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the protein (26 cycles) yielded the same NH2 terminus for as obtained for the natural protein (6Marlor C.W. Delaria K.A. Davis G. Muller D.K. Greve J.M. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12202-12208Google Scholar). The sequence started at residue +1 and continued with the sequence ADRER-. Furthermore, the amino acid composition was > 95% accurate relative to the theoretical composition of placental bikunin(1–170). Purified placental bikunin(1–170) (100 pmol) was then pyridylethyl alkylated, CNBr digested, and then sequenced without purification of the resulting peptide fragments. Sequencing for 20 cycles yielded the sequence for each of the NH2 termini expected from the digestion of placental bikunin(1–170)(Table II).Table IINH2-terminal sequences of fragments resulting from the digestion of purified placental bikunin(1–170) with CNBrSequenceaLowercase letters denote tentative amino acid assignments.AmountPlacental bikunin residue no.pmolLRCFrQQENPP–PLG21154 –168ADRERSIHDFCLVSKVVGRC201 –20FNYeEYCTANAVTGPCRASF16100 –119Pr–Y–V–dGS–Q–F–Y–G625 –43Digestion was performed according to “Experimental Procedures.”a Lowercase letters denote tentative amino acid assignments. Open table in a new tab Digestion was performed according to “Experimental Procedures.” Titration of fixed concentrations of either bovine trypsin or human plasma kallikrein with purified placental bikunin(1–170)showed that each molecule of inhibitor can interact with two molecules of protease simultaneously (Fig. 2). On the other hand, titration of trypsin with aprotinin yielded a stoichiometry of 1:1 in the enzyme inhibitor complex (Fig. 2). To attempt to dissect the specificities of the individual domains within this bikunin, synthetic peptides were made corresponding to the NH2-terminal(7–64) and COOH-terminal(102–159 Kunitz domains of placental bikunin. Purified, reduced NH2-terminal(7–64)([M-H]+ = 6,567.5), and COOH-terminal(102–159) domain ([M-H]+ = 6,835.6) were prepared, each of which had the expected amino acid composition. Refolding of these peptides using dimethyl sulfoxide as the oxidizing agent, followed by purification on a C18column, yielded purified refolded NH2-terminal(7–64) (2% of the starting reduced peptide) and COOH-terminal(102–150) domains (1.4% of the starting reduced peptide) which exhibited [M-H]+values of 6,561.2 and 6,829.3, respectively. The mass reduction upon refolding of each peptide (6 ± 1 mass units) suggests that refolding had in each case resulted in the formation of three intrachain disulfide bonds from the six cysteines present within each of the reduced peptides. A panel of serine proteases was used to determine the relative specificity and potency of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170) and its individual Kunitz domains (Table III). Aprotinin, a Kunitz inhibitor of defined specificity, was included in these studies for comparison. Recombinant placental bikunin(1–170) was a potent inhibitor of several trypsin-like proteases and also of chymotrypsin. Of potential relevance to its putative physiological role, this protein was a potent inhibitor of human plasma and tissue kallikreins, human plasmin and factor XIa. The potency of recombinant placental bikunin(1–170)against plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and factor XIa were 2-, 45-, and 47-"

Intermediary factors interacting with their activation functions are required to mediate transcriptional stimulation. In search of such receptor interacting proteins, we have screened a human cDNA expression library and isolated a human protein that interacts in vitro with transcriptionally active estrogen receptors (ER). Sequence analysis reveals that this protein is the human homolog of mouse TIF1 (transcription intermediary factor 1) shown to enhance nuclear receptor ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF2) in yeast. We have characterized the nuclear receptor binding site on hTIF1 and shown that a region of 26 residues is sufficient for hormone-dependent binding to the estrogen receptor. As shown by point mutagenesis, the AF2 activation domain of ER is required for the binding of hTIF1 but not sufficient, since a short region encompassing the conserved amphipathic α-helix corresponding to this domain fails to precipitate hTIF1. We also demonstrate that hTIF1 association with DNA-bound ER requires the presence of estradiol. Finally, we show that the interaction of hTIF1 with receptors is selective since strong in vitrohormone-dependent binding is only observed with some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 499-504Google Scholar, 2Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Google Scholar). Transcription is mediated by means of two activation regions, AF1 located in the NH2-terminal domain and AF2 located in the hormone binding domain, whose activities vary depending on the responsive promoter and cell type (3Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5477-5488Google Scholar, 4Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

These two activation regions appear to function independently on certain promoters, but, in some cases, both are required for full transcriptional activity (4Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Google Scholar). Recently, a ligand-dependent functional interaction between the two AFs has been demonstrated using the two-hybrid system in mammalian cells (6Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Google Scholar). One essential element required for the activity of AF2 is a COOH-terminal region, which is highly conserved in the nuclear receptor family and has been shown to be essential for transcriptional activation by estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors (7Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Google Scholar), thyroid hormone receptors (8Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Google Scholar, 9Barettino D. Ruiz M.D.M.V. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Google Scholar), and retinoid receptors (10Durand B. Saunder M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Google Scholar). This sequence (ΦΦXEΦΦ) has the characteristics of an amphipathic α-helix (7Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Google Scholar). Determination of the crystal structure of RAR-γ, RXR-α, and TR-α ligand-binding domains has revealed that this helix is repositioned upon ligand-induced conformational transition and functions as a lid for the ligand pocket (11Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Google Scholar, 12Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

The mechanism whereby transcriptional stimulation is achieved remains unknown, but it is believed that direct or indirect interactions with target proteins within the transcriptional apparatus could be involved to allow the assembly of a preinitiation complex (14Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Google Scholar, 15Buratowski S. Science. 1995; 270: 1773-1774Google Scholar). A number of these receptors have been shown to bind directly to the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB in vitro (16Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Haussler M.R. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1535-1539Google Scholar). One of the TBP-associated factors, hTAFII30, also interacts selectively with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor and appears to contribute to transcriptional activity in vitro (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Google Scholar). However, the interaction was unaffected by the binding of either 17β-estradiol or antiestrogens such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen and was mapped to a region that is inactive in mammalian cells (22Pierrat P. Heery D.M. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 193-200Google Scholar). Other factors acting as bridging proteins are probably involved in transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors. Using in vitro protein interaction assays or yeast two-hybrid systems with different nuclear receptor hormone-binding domains as bait, several factors that associate with activated receptors have been characterized. These include hRIP140 (23Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Google Scholar, 24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G.

Two other factors, namely N-CoR and SMRT, that interact with unliganded thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors, have been isolated and shown to act as transcriptional corepressors, which are released upon ligand binding (38Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Google Scholar, 39Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Google Scholar). In fact, it seems likely that these intermediary factors (activators or repressors) form a large family of molecules with differential binding sites or affinities for various nuclear receptors. We report here the cloning of a human factor, which interacts in vitro with transcriptionally active estrogen receptors and appears to be the homolog of mouse TIF1 (27Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar). We have characterized the interaction of hTIF1 with nuclear receptors and shown that a short region is sufficient for hormone-dependent binding to various members of the superfamily. However, it appears that this interaction is selective, since in vitrohormone-dependent interaction with hTIF1 is not observed with receptors belonging to the glucocorticoid receptor subclass. A random-primed human fetal liver λgt11 expression library (CLONTECH) was screened using the in vitro 32P-labeled GST-AF2 probe, as described previously (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar). A single positive clone (clone 8) containing a 675-base pair insert was isolated, screened again and purified. This insert was then randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham) and used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed ZR75–1 human breast cancer cells cDNA library constructed in λZAPII (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar). Several positive clones were isolated and pBluescript phagemids containing the inserts of interest were excised in vivo by coinfection with the R408 helper phage. Inserts were then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 5′ end of the cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA from ZR75–1 cells and specific primers generated from the mTIF1 cDNA sequence (27Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar). The recombinant vectors allowing expression in Escherichia coli of GST-TFIIB, GST-AF2 (wild-type and mutants), or the plasmid used for in vitrolabeling of hRIP140 (pBRIP140) were described previously (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar). GST-AF2-AD was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated 96-nucleotide fragment encoding residues 525–556 of mouse ER into theEcoRI site of pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The nine GST-hTIF1 constructs (wild-type and mut1–mut8) encoding different domains of hTIF1 receptor binding site fused to glutathioneS-transferase were constructed by inserting the corresponding DNA fragments produced by PCR from the original clone 8 into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK. GST-hRIP140, which encoded a fusion between GST and residues 752–1158 of hRIP140, was generated by inserting a BamHI/BglII fragment from pBRIP3 (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pGEX2TK. Human receptor cDNAs and their cognate ligands used in this study correspond to ER (estradiol), RARα (retinoic acid; RA), RXRα (9-cis-RA), VDR (vitamin D3), TRα1 (T3), GR (dexamethasone), PR-A and B (R5020), AR (DHT), MR (aldosterone), COUP-TFI, COUP-TFII, and HNF4 (EMBL data bank). All of them were in pSG5 vector (except MR, which is in pGEM4) under the control of the bacterial T7 polymerase promoter. In vitro binding assays were performed essentially as described (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar). Briefly,35S-labeled proteins (receptors or interacting proteins) were cell-free-synthesized using the TNT lysate system (Promega) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with bacterially expressed and purified GST, GST-AF2, GST-AF2-AD, GST-hRIP140, or GST-hTIF1 fusion proteins in the presence of the cognate ligands at micromolar concentrations. Protein interactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (Amplify; Amersham) and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS1000). In some cases, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) prior to fluorography, to visualize the GST fusion proteins present in each track. The double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the vitellogenin A2 estrogen response element (ERE) (40Augereau P. Miralles F. Cavaillès V. Gaudelet C. Parker M. Rochefort H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 693-703Google Scholar) was 32P-labeled using Klenow enzyme. Binding reactions (20 μl) were performed in the presence or absence of ligands (1 μm) on ice for 1 h using 4 μl of ER-primed reticulocyte lysate and 30 μg of purified GST or GST fusion proteins in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), plus protease inhibitors. The labeled ERE (50 fmol) was then added, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. To isolate cDNAs encoding putative mediators of the ligand-dependent activation function of nuclear receptors, we have applied the strategy previously used to clone hRIP140 cDNA (24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar). We have screened a human fetal liver random-primed cDNA expression library with the 32P-labeled probe containing the mouse ER hormone binding domain fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST-AF2 probe). We have isolated a single positive clone (clone 8) encoding a 225-amino acid peptide, which interacted directly with the wild-type GST-AF2 probe in an estrogen-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The binding characteristics of the protein encoded by this clone were similar to those previously observed for hRIP140 and hRIP160 (23Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Google Scholar), i.e. lack of interaction (i) in the absence of ligand (ii) in the presence of the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (iii) with transcriptionally defective mutants in the conserved amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 1 A). The cDNA clone 8 contained a 675-base pair insert, which did not cross-hybridize with hRIP140. When used as a probe in Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from MCF7 breast cancer cells, this fragment detected a major band of about 4.5 kilobases (data not shown). Sequence analysis confirmed that this cDNA was different from hRIP140 and from sequences present in the data bases at the time of the cloning. We then isolated longer cDNA clones from an oligo(dT)-primed ZR75–1 human breast cancer cell cDNA library and sequenced the 5′ end of the longest clone (clone 16). This revealed strong homology with the sequence of mouse TIF1, which was present in the data base as the NH2-terminal moiety of the mouse T18 oncoprotein (41Miki T. Fleming T.P. Crescenzi M. Molloy C.J. Blam S.B. Reynolds S.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5167-5171Google Scholar), and indicated that we have isolated the human TIF1 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the overall conservation of TIF1 amino acid sequence between mouse (27Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar) and human species appears relatively high (more than 92%; see also Fig.2 B for sequence comparison of the nuclear receptor binding site). Two clusters of amino acids in the NH2 terminus of the molecule (residues 14–25 and 107–111 in hTIF1) are, however, highly divergent. By contrast, we found in the ZR75–1 cDNA library a clone coding for an hTIF1 isoform with the same insertion of 34 amino acids already described for the mouse protein (27Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar) suggesting that this variant form, perfectly conserved between the two species, could be of physiological importance. Using GST pull-down experiments with a 90-kDa peptide in vitro expressed from clone 16, we confirmed that hTIF1 interaction with wild-type GST-AF2 was strongly increased (∼14-fold) by estradiol (Fig. 1, panel B, lanes 3 and 4, andpanel C) but not by the antiestrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI164,384 (lanes 5 and 6). This association was also dramatically reduced by various mutations in the conserved amphipathic α-helix that abolish AF2 transcriptional activity (7Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Google Scholar). When either of two pairs of hydrophobic residues (547/548 or 543/544) or the negatively charged glutamic acid residue at position 546 were mutated, the effect of estradiol on hTIF1 binding was reduced to less than 2-fold (Fig. 1 C). In these GST pull-down assays, hTIF1 binding to wild-type GST-AF2 in the presence of estradiol (57% of input; 14-fold increase versus control; Fig. 1 C) was very similar to that of hRIP140 (56% of input; 12-fold increaseversus control; data not shown). The initial hTIF1 cDNA clone 8 isolated from the library encoded a 225-amino acid peptide (Fig. 2 B). This fragment overlapped the region between residues 539 and 750 in the mouse protein, which was shown to be the minimal domain sufficient to interact with RXRα in the yeast two-hybrid system (27Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Google Scholar). To define more accurately the border of the nuclear receptor binding site (NRBS) on the hTIF1 molecule, we generated by PCR a GST-hTIF1 vector and several deletion mutants (mut1–mut8; Fig. 2 C). We then tested their ability to interact with 35S-labeled in vitro translated ER in GST pull-down experiments. As shown in Fig. 2 C, strong estradiol-dependent interaction (19-fold increase over control) was observed with GST-hTIF1. Deletion of 102 residues from the COOH terminus (mut1) affected only moderately this interaction (10-fold induction in the presence of estradiol). By contrast, when the hTIF1 fragment was reduced to 96 (mut2) or 73 amino acids (mut3), hormone-dependent binding was totally abolished, indicating that an important motif was localized in the last 27 residues of mut1. Starting from mut1, we then generated five other mutants (mut4–mut8). In GST pull-down assays, hormone-inducible binding of ER was retained with mut4–mut7 but not with mut8. Together, these results indicate that the minimal NRBS on hTIF1 is localized between residues 716 and 741 and that the 11 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of mut7 are necessary for ER binding. As shown in Fig. 2 D, this sequence exhibits some homologies (conservation of Ser and Leu residues) with sequences in the two NRBS of RIP140 (25L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavaillès V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Google Scholar). Since the integrity of the AF2 activation domain core plays a crucial role in the binding of hTIF1 to ER (Fig. 1, A andC), we have examined whether the region of the receptor encompassing this domain was sufficient to support in vitrointeraction with hTIF1. The region from amino acid 525 to 556 was fused to GST and used to precipitate labeled hTIF1. As shown in Fig.3 (lane 5), no specific binding was obtained, even though the level of GST-AF2-AD was slightly higher than those of GST-AF2 wild-type or mut. This suggests that other regions of the ER ligand binding domain are probably required to generate the complete binding site. Since in vitro binding characteristics of hTIF1 (i.e. the requirement for hormone and for an intact AF2 activating domain) were similar to those obtained for hRIP140 (23Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Google Scholar, 24Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Google Scholar, 25L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavaillès V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Google Scholar), it was possible that these two potential transcriptional coactivators contact the same region of the hormone binding domain. To investigate this possibility, we performed pull-down experiments to test the ability of ER to contact simultaneously hTIF1 and hRIP140. We used GST-hTIF1 or GST-hRIP140 to precipitate, respectively, labeled hRIP140 or hTIF1 bound to ER. As shown in Fig. 4 A, labeled ER efficiently bound (almost 50% of input) to GST-hTIF1 in an hormone dependent manner (compare lanes 3 and 4). We then preincubated increasing amounts of labeled hRIP140 with ER before precipitation with GST-hTIF1 (lanes 5–9) and looked for the formation of a ternary complex GST-hTIF1·ER·hRIP140. Whereas binding of ER was still clearly observable, specific precipitation of hRIP140 in these conditions was almost undetectable since for the highest amount of hRIP140 used (lane 9), less than 2% of input material was bound. Moreover, most of this binding was not ER-mediated since a similar amount of hRIP140 was precipitated by GST-hTIF1 in the absence of ER (lane 10). Identical results were obtained in the converse experiment using GST-hRIP140 to pull-down hTIF1 (Fig. 4 B). Together these results indicated that, in our pull-down conditions, simultaneous binding of hTIF1 and hRIP140 on ER is not possible. The electromobility shift assay was used to examine the association of GST-hTIF1 with ER bound to DNA. In vitro expressed ER was incubated with purified GST or GST-hTIF1 before addition of 32P-labeled ERE. As shown in Fig. 5, the retardation profile obtained in the presence of GST was in agreement with previously published results (42Metzger D. Beery M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Google Scholar). Binding of ER to DNA was not dependent on the presence of hormone, but the mobility of the complexes varied according to the ligand. In the presence of estradiol, the ER·ERE complexes migrated faster than in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (lanes 1–3), probably reflecting a different conformation of the receptor. Addition of purified GST-hTIF1 did not modify the position or intensity of the retarded bands in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (comparelanes 1 and 3 to lanes 4 and6). By contrast, in the presence of estradiol, we observed a shift in the position of the ER·ERE complex and a slight decrease in the intensity of the band (compare lanes 2 and5). This shift was reproducibly obtained even when ER was produced in COS-1 cells or in baculovirus-infected insect cells (data not shown), and it probably corresponds to the formation of an heteromeric complex of GST-hTIF1 and ER on DNA. We have checked that this altered migration was not due to a modification in the estradiol binding capacity of ER or in the dissociation kinetics of hormone after binding of GST-hTIF1 (data not shown). Moreover, similar results were obtained when we used GST-hRIP140 fusion protein (Fig. 5, lane 8), thus confirming previous results showing that, in DNA-dependent assays for protein-protein interaction, the binding of hRIP140 to ER (25L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavaillès V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Google Scholar) or to RAR/RXR heterodimers (43Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Google Scholar) was also ligand-dependent. By contrast, no retardation was observed with GST-TFIIB (Fig. 5, lane 10), emphasizing the specificity of this effect. To study the specificity of hTIF1 interaction with nuclear receptors, we have tested whether other members of the superfamily were able to interact with GST-hTIF1 in the presence of their cognate ligands. As shown in Table I, vitamin D3 (VDR), thyroid hormone (TRα1), retinoid X (RXRα), and retinoic acid (RARα) receptors bound to GST-hTIF1 in the presence of their cognate ligand (more than 12% of input). Specific binding (which represents less than 2.5% of input in the absence of ligand) is increased by more than 8-fold in the presence of hormone. In addition, as observed for ER in the presence of antiestrogens, the interaction of RARα was not significantly increased in the presence of the antagonist Ro 41–5253 (44Apfel C. Bauer F. Cettaz M.

Moreover, we have checked that chimeric proteins found in acute promyelocytic leukemia and resulting from the fusion of RARα to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in t(15;17) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) in t(11;17) (45Dong S.

In vitro expressed 35S-labeled nuclear receptors were incubated in batch assays with GST-hTIF1 in the absence (Control) or in the presence of the cognate ligand (Hormone) or antihormone at 1 μm. By contrast, when we evaluated the interaction of the other steroid receptors, namely glucocorticoid (GR), progesterone (PR form A and B), androgen (AR), and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors, we observed a weak interaction (less than 5% of input) with GST-hTIF1 even in the presence of the cognate hormone. A slight increase in binding to GST-hTIF1 was, however, detectable with MR in the presence of aldosterone. In addition, we analyzed the association of GST-hTIF1 with two orphan receptors that bind DNA as homodimers and behave as transcriptional repressor (COUP-TFII) or activator (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; HNF4) and observed very low specific interaction representing less than 3% of input (data not shown). Other transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, CREB, E1A, or MyoD, shown to bind CBP (46Janknecht R. Hunter T.

https://openalex.org/W2075095119,"Members of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated proteins are involved in a variety of intracellular processes including cell division and organelle transport. In the case of axonal transport, all kinesin superfamily members reported thus far appear to play a role in anterograde transport, while a different type of microtubule motor, dynein, appears to function in retrograde transport. To better understand the role of kinesins in axonal transport, we cloned and characterized KIFC2, a novel kinesin superfamily member from mouse brain. KIFC2 encodes a 792 amino acid protein, which contains the conserved motor domain at the C-terminal end of the protein and is most similar to members of the KAR3 family involved in cell division. However, expression analysis localized KIFC2 mRNA to nonproliferative neuronal cells in the central nervous system, and immunolocalization studies demonstrated that KIFC2 is present in axons and dendrites of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immunolocalization and biochemical fractionation studies suggest that KIFC2 localizes with some, but not all, axonally transported organelles. Finally, ligation of mouse peripheral nerves showed that KIFC2 accumulates at the proximal and distal sides of an axonal ligature. Taken together, the data suggest that, unlike other C-terminal motor proteins that appear to be involved in cell division, KIFC2 may play a role in retrograde axonal transport."

We tested the effects of IL-6 and its soluble receptor on collagenase 3 expression in osteoblast-enriched cells from fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). IL-6 caused a small increase in collagenase mRNA levels, but in the presence of IL-6-soluble receptor (IL-6sR), IL-6 caused a marked increase in collagenase transcripts after 2–24 h. In addition, IL-6sR increased collagenase mRNA when tested alone. IL-6 and IL-6sR increased immunoreactive collagenase levels. Cycloheximide and indomethacin did not prevent the effect of IL-6 and IL-6sR on collagenase mRNA levels. IL-6 and IL-6sR did not alter the decay of collagenase mRNA in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells and increased the levels of collagenase heterogeneous nuclear RNA and the rate of collagenase gene transcription in Ob cells. IL-6 and IL-6sR increased collagenase 3 mRNA in MC3T3 cells but only modestly in skin fibroblasts. IL-6 and IL-6sR enhanced the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1. In conclusion, IL-6, in the presence of IL-6sR, increases collagenase 3 synthesis in osteoblasts by transcriptional mechanisms.

Although IL-6 appears to play a central role in bone resorption, its mechanism of action is poorly understood, and its effects on bone matrix degradation are not known. In co-culture systems of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells, IL-6 stimulates the formation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells in the presence of the IL-6-soluble receptor (IL-6sR) but not in its absence (9Tamura R.

Since the IL-6sR is present in the systemic circulation and allows for the effects of IL-6 on bone resorption, it may be relevant to the actions of IL-6 in normal and abnormal bone remodeling. Agents that modify bone resorption frequently alter bone collagen degradation by changing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors (14Partridge N.C. Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S.

Consequently, in addition to its stimulatory effects on bone resorption, IL-6 and its soluble receptor might alter bone collagen degradation and the expression of collagenase and its inhibitors by skeletal cells.

However, its effects on the expression of collagenase and TIMP 1 in skeletal cells or on the expression of TIMP 2 and 3 in skeletal or nonskeletal cells have not been reported. Despite a lack of an effect on matrix metalloproteinase expression in nonskeletal cells, we postulated that since IL-6 enhances bone resorption, it might regulate the expression of collagenase and of TIMPs in rat osteoblasts. In the present study, we examined the actions of IL-6 in the presence and absence of the IL-6sR, on collagenase 3 transcripts, and immunoreactive collagenase levels and on the expression of TIMPs 1, 2, and 3 in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from 22-day fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells) and determined possible mechanisms involved. Effects of IL-6 on collagenase mRNA levels also were examined in the murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 and in skin fibroblasts. The culture method used to obtain Ob cells was described in detail previously (28McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Google Scholar). Parietal bones were obtained from 22-day-old fetal rats immediately after the mothers were sacrificed by blunt trauma to the nuchal area. (This project was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center.) Cells were obtained by five sequential digestions of the parietal bone using bacterial collagenase (CLS II, Worthington). Cell populations harvested from the third to the fifth digestions were cultured as a pool. About 80% or more of these cells were previously shown to display osteoblastic characteristics (28McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Google Scholar, 29Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Google Scholar). Ob cells were plated at a density of 8,000–12,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in a humidified 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C until reaching confluence (about 50,000 cells/cm2). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO). MC3T3 cells are a mouse osteoblastic cell line derived from fetal mouse calvaria and were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under similar conditions (30Sudo H. Kodama H.-A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Google Scholar). Ob or MC3T3 cells were grown to confluence, transferred to serum-free medium for 20–24 h, and exposed to test or control medium in the absence of serum for 2–24 h as indicated in the text and legends. For the nuclear run-on experiment, Ob cells were grown to subconfluence, trypsinized, replated, and grown to confluence when they were serum-deprived and exposed to test or control solutions for 2–6 h. Skin fibroblasts, obtained from 22-day-old fetal rats by collagenase digestion, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, trypsinized, and passaged three to four times before testing (31Brinckerhoff C.E. Plucinska I.M. Sheldon L.A. O'Connor G.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6378-6384Google Scholar, 32Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were serum-deprived for 20–24 h prior to exposure to test or control medium in the absence of serum. Recombinant human IL-6 and IL-6sR (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and tested independently or added simultaneously to the culture. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added directly to the culture medium. 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) and indomethacin (both from Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:200 and 1:1000, respectively, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. An equal amount of solvent was added to control cultures. At the end of the incubation, the medium was harvested in the presence of 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Pierce) and stored at −80 °C prior to immunoblot analysis. The cell layer was extracted for RNA analysis and stored at −80 °C or nuclei were obtained by Dounce homogenization for the nuclear run-on assay. Total cellular RNA was isolated with guanidine isothiocyanate, at acid pH, followed by a phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol and ethanol precipitations (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) or by RNeasy kit per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The RNA recovered was quantitated by spectrophotometry, and equal amounts of RNA from control or test samples were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel following denaturation. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize RNA standards and ribosomal RNA, before and after transfer, documenting equal RNA loading of the samples. The RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen Plus charged nylon (DuPont NEN).

Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 16–72 h. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 1 × saline sodium citrate at 65 °C for collagenase 3, stromelysin 1 and 3, TIMP 1, 2, and 3 cDNAs, and in 0.1 × saline sodium citrate at 65 °C for 18 S ribosomal RNA. The bound radioactive materials were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 or Biomax film (Eastman Kodak) or DuPont reflection film employing intensifying screens. Relative hybridization levels were determined by densitometry. Northern analyses shown are representative of three or more cultures. Collagenase heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) was analyzed by RT-PCR using a sense primer 5′-CATTCAGCTATTCTGGCCAC-3′, spanning nucleotides 27–46 of exon 1 of the rat collagenase 3 gene and an antisense primer, 5′-AAAAGACCAGAACAACCAGC-3′, spanning nucleotides 61–80 of intron 1 to yield a 186-bp product (22Quinn C.O.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 867-878Google Scholar). RNA was extracted as described for Northern analysis, and samples were treated with amplification grade DNase I according to manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions to remove potentially contaminating DNA. RNA (1 μg) was copied into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the antisense primer according to manufacturer's instructions except thatTaq polymerase buffer was used instead of reverse transcriptase buffer (41Kawasaki E.S. PCR Protocols, A Guide to the Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc, New York1990Google Scholar). A DNA standard was synthesized by PCR amplification of plasmid DNA pGL2-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using the rat collagenase hnRNA primer set and low stringency annealing conditions, as described by Forstr (42Forstr E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 1006-1008Google Scholar). The cDNA and 0.05 attomol DNA standard were amplified by PCR using 24 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min in the presence ofTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.15 μmol of sense and antisense primers, and 5 μCi [α-32P]dCTP. PCR products were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (Gel-Mix 8, Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 100 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, and visualized by autoradiography. The amplification protocol yielded products that were within the linear range for both the collagenase hnRNA and the standard. Data on hnRNA are representative of three cultures. To examine changes in the rate of transcription, nuclei were isolated by Dounce homogenization in a Tris buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nascent transcripts were labeled by incubation of nuclei in a reaction buffer containing 500 μm each of ATP, CTP, and guanidine triphosphate, 150 units of RNasin (Promega), and 250 μCi of [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (3,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingsten R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene & Wiley Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). RNA was isolated by treatment with DNase I and proteinase K, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized plasmid DNA containing about 1 μg of cDNA was immobilized onto GeneScreen Plus by slot blotting according to manufacturer's directions (DuPont NEN). The plasmid vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization, and a 750-bp murine 18 S ribosomal RNA cDNA was used to estimate uniformity of radioactive counts applied to the membrane. Equal counts/min of [32P]RNA from each sample were hybridized to cDNAs using the same conditions as for Northern blot analysis and were visualized by autoradiography. Medium samples were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using denaturing and nonreducing conditions and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against rat collagenase 3 (kindly provided by J. Jeffrey, Albany, NY), previously characterized for specificity and immunoreactivity, followed by the addition of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (44Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.J. Ehlich L.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 396-403Google Scholar). The blots were washed and developed with a horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence detection reagent (DuPont NEN), visualized by autoradiography on DuPont Reflection film employing Reflection intensifying screens, and analyzed by densitometry. Data shown are representative of three cultures. To assess gelatinase activity, aliquots of conditioned medium were extracted with methanol and chloroform, dried, and resuspended in sample buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Samples were loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin and fractionated by electrophoresis as described (21Rifas L. Fausto A. Scott M.J. Avioli L.V. Welgus H.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 213-221Google Scholar). The gels were washed twice with a 2.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) solution, rinsed with water, and incubated overnight in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2 buffer at 37 °C. Proteolytic activity was visualized by staining the gels with 1% Coomassie Blue. Data on collagenase mRNA decay were analyzed by linear regression, and the slopes of the regression lines obtained for control and treated cells were compared for significant differences using the method of Sokal and Rohlf (45Sokal, R. R., and Rohlf, F. J. (1981) Biometry, 2nd Ed., San Francisco, CAGoogle Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from Ob cells revealed a rat collagenase 3 transcript of 2.9 kb (Fig. 1). Continuous treatment of Ob cells with IL-6 at 100 ng/ml caused a small increase in collagenase steady state transcripts. However, in the presence of IL-6sR a marked increase was observed. This increase initially occurred after 2 h of exposure to IL-6 and IL-6sR, and the absolute effect was virtually maximal after 6 h (Fig. 1). Confirming prior observations, a decrease in collagenase 3 mRNA was noted in control cultures after 24 h, but this did not preclude the stimulatory effect of IL-6 and its soluble receptor (46Canalis E. Rydziel S. Delany A. Varghese S. Jeffrey J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1348-1354Google Scholar). Since the effect of IL-6 and IL-6sR was sustained despite the decrease in control collagenase expression, the relative stimulation by IL-6 and IL-6sR after 24 h was greater than after 6 h. The effect of IL-6 alone was dose-dependent and of limited magnitude, and continued exposure of Ob cells to IL-6 at 100–300 ng/ml for 6 or 24 h increased collagenase transcripts by 1.5- or 3.0-fold, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). In the presence of IL-6sR, IL-6 increased collagenase mRNA levels at doses as low as 1 ng/ml, and the effect was maximal at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 3). IL-6sR alone increased collagenase 3 transcripts at concentrations of 125 and 250 ng/ml by 7- to 8-fold (Fig. 4). This effect was magnified in the presence of IL-6, and IL-6sR at 31–250 ng/ml in the presence of IL-6 at 100 ng/ml increased collagenase 3 mRNA levels in Ob cells by 50–100-fold. IL-6 at 100 ng/ml and IL-6sR at 50 ng/ml for 24 h increased the levels of immunoreactive interstitial collagenase 3 in the culture medium of Ob cells, and when tested together they caused a greater than 300-fold increase as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). Collagenase was identified by co-migration with a purified rat procollagenase 3 standard. Colloidal gold staining of the blot revealed equal amounts of protein in control and treated cultures (data not shown). The precise extent of the IL-6 and IL-6sR effect on collagenase mRNA and protein levels, was difficult to determine by densitometry due to the magnitude of the effect as compared with control cultures.Figure 2Effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 10–300 ng/ml on collagenase 3 mRNA levels in cultures of Ob cells treated for 6 h.

McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4490-4496Google Scholar). Cycloheximide at 3.6 μmdid not prevent the stimulatory effect of IL-6 and IL-6sR on collagenase 3 mRNA alone or in combination (Fig. 6). To determine whether the effects of IL-6 and IL-6sR were due to changes in prostaglandin synthesis, IL-6 and its soluble receptor were tested in the presence and absence of indomethacin at 10 μm. Indomethacin did not modify the expression of collagenase 3 in control Ob cell cultures and did not prevent the effect of IL-6 in the presence of IL-6sR on collagenase transcripts (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 100 ng/ml and its soluble receptor (IL-6sR) at 50 ng/ml, in the presence or absence of indomethacin at 10 μm, on collagenase 3 mRNA levels in cultures of Ob cells treated for 24 h.

H-NS has been shown to exhibit a binding preference for certain AT-rich curved DNA elementsin vitro. In this study we have addressed the factors that determine the specificity of H-NS action in vitro andin vivo. In bandshift studies, H-NS showed a slight binding preference for all curved sequences tested whether GC-based or AT-based; the specific architecture of the curve also influenced H-NS binding. In filter retention assays little difference in affinity could be detected for any sequence tested, including the downstream regulatory element (DRE) a downstream curved DNA element required for H-NS to repress transcription of the Salmonella typhimurium proU operon in vivo. A K d of 1–2 μm was estimated for binding of H-NS to each of these sequences. In vivo, the distance between theproU promoter and the DRE, their relative orientations on the face of the DNA helix, and translation of the DRE had no major effect on proU regulation. None of the synthetic curved sequences tested could functionally replace the DRE in vivo. These data show that differential binding to curved DNA cannot account for the specificity of H-NS action in vivo.Furthermore, binding of H-NS to DNA per se is insufficient to repress the proU promoter. Thus, the DRE does not simply act as an H-NS binding site but must have a more specific role in mediating H-NS regulation of proU transcription.

H-NS is a 15.6-kDa polypeptide, one of the two most abundant proteins associated with the bacterial nucleoid. H-NS has a role in chromosome organization (1Higgins C.F. Hinton J.C.D. Hulton C.S.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5321-5340Google Scholar, 4Spurio R. Dürrenberger M. Falconi M. La Teana A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. & Gen.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 258-268Google Scholar). Plasmids isolated from hns mutants have altered levels of supercoiling (6Higgins C.F. Dorman C.J. Stirling D.A. Waddell L. Booth I.R. May G. Bremer E.

In addition to its role in chromosome organization, H-NS influences the expression of several independently regulated genes, many of which are modulated in response to changing environmental conditions (2Ussery D.W. Hinton J.C.D. Jordi B.J.A.M. Granum P.E. Seirafi A. Stephen R.J. Tupper A.E. Berridge G. Sidebotham J.M. Higgins C.F. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 968-980Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which H-NS modulates transcription is unknown. The binding of H-NS to DNA is relatively nonspecific (3Spassky A. Rimsky S. Garreau H. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5321-5340Google Scholar, 5Tupper A.E. Owen-Hughes T.A. Ussery D.W. Santos D.S. Ferguson D.J. Sidebotham J.M. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F.

How does H-NS influence transcription at only a subset of promoters? Part of the explanation may come from the observation that H-NS exhibits a binding preference for certain intrinsically curved DNA sequences in vitro (11Bracco L. Kotlarz D. Kolb A. Diekmann S. Buc H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4289-4296Google Scholar, 12Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 420-425Google Scholar, 13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22243-22247Google Scholar) and that, at least at some promoters, curved DNA elements are required for H-NS action in vivo (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). Indeed, it may be that curved DNA sequence elements are required for the action of H-NS at all promoters (15Falconi M. Higgins N. Spurio R. Pon C. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 273-282Google Scholar, 16Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Bradaczek C. Wagner R. Mol.

However, for the limited number of DNA curves studied, the increased preference for curved DNA, compared with nonspecific binding to generic DNA, is only a few-fold (5Tupper A.E. Owen-Hughes T.A. Ussery D.W. Santos D.S. Ferguson D.J. Sidebotham J.M. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 258-268Google Scholar, 12Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem.

Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tanaka K.-I. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 149-162Google Scholar). Furthermore, as curved DNA sequences are found near most promoters, including many promoters that are not responsive to H-NS (for review see Ref. 19Pérez-Martı́n J. Rojo F. De Lorenzo V. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 268-290Google Scholar), it is not clear how specificity is achieved. Finally, the distance between the curve and the RNA polymerase binding site can be varied up to 200 bp. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); DRE, downstream regulatory element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. Thus, it is unclear whether DNA curvature per se is the principal factor that determines H-NS action or how the interaction of H-NS and curved sequences might influence promoter function. To address the mechanisms by which H-NS affects transcription we have used the proU promoter of Salmonella typhimuriumas a model. proU encodes a transport system for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine, and its expression is increased when cells are exposed to high extracellular osmolarity (20Cairney J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1224-1232Google Scholar, 21Dunlap V.J. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 296-304Google Scholar, 22Gowrishankar J. J.

Genet. 1986; 205: 225-233Google Scholar).proU appears to be one of the simplest H-NS-responsive promoters as no trans-acting factor, other than H-NS itself, appears to be required for its regulation. proU expression is derepressed in hns mutants (6Higgins C.F.

Genet. 1990; 224: 81-90Google Scholar), although residual osmoregulation is retained (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar, 25Lucht J.M. Dersch P. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6578-6586Google Scholar, 26Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4508-4513Google Scholar). Repression of proUby H-NS requires an intrinsically curved region of DNA located around 200 bp downstream of the transcription start site, within the first structural gene of the proU operon (the downstream regulatory element, DRE) (12Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 420-425Google Scholar, 26Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4508-4513Google Scholar, 27Dattananda C.S. Rajkumari K.

However, the binding preference of H-NS for the DRE in vitro is, at most, only a few-fold greater than for generic DNA, and the precise distance between the DRE and the proU promoter does not appear to be critical (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar,25Lucht J.M. Dersch P. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol.

It is not known how interaction of H-NS with the DRE might influence transcription. In this paper, we have addressed the factors that determine the specificity of H-NS action both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with previous reports, a binding preference for curved DNA was detected under certain conditions, although this preference was found to be limited and cannot account for the specificity of action of H-NS in vivo. Furthermore, the binding of H-NS to DNA per se is insufficient to account for the effects of H-NS on proU expression. Thus, the DRE cannot simply provide a site for H-NS binding but must serve a more specific role in H-NS-mediated gene regulation. Wild-type S. typhimurium LT2 and its congenic derivatives CH1838 (hns-1::Kanr) and CH1833 (zde-1710::mTn10) were used for expression studies (8Hinton J.C.D. Santos D.S. Seirafi A. Hulton C.S.J. Pavitt G.D. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2327-2337Google Scholar). Note thatzde-1710::mTn10 has no phenotype but was used solely for strain construction (8Hinton J.C.D. Santos D.S. Seirafi A. Hulton C.S.J. Pavitt G.D. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2327-2337Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed and maintained in Escherichia coli recA strains prior to electroporation into the appropriate S. typhimuriumstrain. Cells were grown with aeration at 37 °C in LB (29Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Google Scholar). To generate defined curved and noncurved DNA fragments, complementary oligonucleotides (Table I) were annealed, ligated together, and separated by electrophoresis in a 3% NuSieve agarose gel. Ligated fragments of an appropriate size (100–200 bp) were isolated from the gel using a QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The overhanging ends of the fragments were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript I SK(−) (Stratagene). Three plasmids were generated in this manner, containing the GC curve (pAF1), GC noncurve (pAF2), and AT planar curve (pAF3). Two closely related plasmids containing the AT curve (pTP4) and AT noncurve (pTP5) have been described previously (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). A sixth plasmid (pAF6) was constructed by ligating a 200-bp fragment encompassing theS. typhimurium proU DRE (base pair +99 through +299; Ref.30Stirling D.A. Hulton C.S.J. Waddell L. Park S.F. Stewart G.S. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1025-1038Google Scholar) between the NotI and SpeI sites of pBluescript II SK(−). The 200-bp fragment was generated by PCR using primers +99 (5′GGGCGGCCGCATATTTGGAGAGCATCCG-3′) and +299 (5′GGACTAGTTTCAATCAGGCGATTGAGAAGG-3′) which incorporate sites forNotI and SpeI to facilitate cloning.

Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). Plasmid pAV399 contains theproU promoter region (−217 through +100, where +1 is the start of the transcription) (30Stirling D.A. Hulton C.S.J. Waddell L. Park S.F. Stewart G.S. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1025-1038Google Scholar), directing transcription of thelacZ reporter gene. A 51-bp polylinker was inserted into theEcoRI site between the proU promoter andlacZ gene. The polylinker was constructed by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′AATTCATACGCGGCCGCAAGTCTAGACTTGACTAGTACTGGTACCTATGCG-3′ and 5′AATTCGCATAGGTACCAGTACTAGTCAAGTCTAGACTTGCGGCCGCGTAT-3′, containing NotI, SpeI, XbaI, andKpnI restriction sites and an EcoRI site overhang at each end. The resulting plasmid, pAF450, was used as a vector for the construction of a further six plasmids in which curved or noncurved fragments were inserted into the polylinker. Five of the inserts were the curved and noncurved fragments from pAF1, pAF2, pAF3 (excised withEcoRI and HindIII), pTP4 and pTP5 (excised withBamHI and EcoRI). The sixth was a 200-bp fragment, generated by the PCR, encompassing the S. typhimurium proU DRE (bp +99 through +299) and incorporating terminalNotI and SpeI sites. pSJ4 contains the same 317-bp proUpromoter fragment (bp −217 to +100) as pAV399, cloned into theEcoRI site upstream of the luciferase reporter genes in pSB71 (Table II). A SalI-SacI fragment from pSJ4, containing the proU promoter coupled to the luxABreporter genes, was cloned into the pALTER vector (Promega). Using the Altered Sites™ in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), unique sites for the restriction endonucleases NcoI andBglII were introduced at bp +17 and +31, respectively (Fig. 1). The mutated SalI-SacI fragment was recloned into pSJ4 generating plasmid pBJ1. Plasmids pBJ2, pBJ4, pBJ5, and pBJ6 were generated from pBJ1 by inserting appropriate DNA fragments between the NcoI andBglII sites (Fig. 1). Plasmid pBJ2 contains a 210-bp fragmentNcoI-BglII fragment obtained by PCR amplification of the trp-lacZ fusion from plasmid pCH133 (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M.

Plasmids pBJ4, pBJ5, and pBJ6 were generated by ligating the following oligonucleotides (and their complementary strands) between theNcoI and BglII sites, increasing the distance between the proU promoter and DRE by 5, 10, and 15 bp, respectively: pBJ4, 5′GAATTCCATGGCTATATCGCCGATAGATCTGAATTC 3′; for pBJ5, 5′GAATTCCATGGCTATATCGCCGATGAAAGAGATCTGAATTC 3′; for pBJ6, 5′GAATTCCATGGCTATATCGCCGATGAAAGCGGCGAGATCTGAATTC3′. Curved and noncurved DNA fragments were isolated by restriction enzyme digestion and gel purification. Fragments were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel at 5 °C in TBE buffer (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and relative mobility measured compared with standard markers. H-NS protein from S. typhimurium was purified as described (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar) and stored at 1–2 mg/ml at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. 1 μg of plasmid DNA digested with HaeIII was incubated in 9 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmspermidine, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA), together with 1 μl of H-NS diluted (in binding buffer) to the appropriate concentration, for 2 min at 20 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on a 3% Metaphor agarose gel at room temperature at 4 V/cm. The DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. For competition bandshift studies, appropriate curved or noncurved DNA fragments were isolated from plasmids by restriction enzyme digestion and gel purification. A typical bandshift reaction was carried out in a volume of 15 μl and contained 1 μg of H-NS protein, 10 ng of radiolabeled DNA, the indicated amount of competitor DNA, in buffer (10 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and 5 μl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 2.5% bromophenol blue) was added to the reaction. Samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel in TBE and electrophoresed at 8 V/cm at 5 °C for 2 h. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and radiolabeled DNA detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled DNA fragments, extending from 77 bp upstream to 51 bp downstream of the polylinker, were amplified from plasmids pAF451–456 using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as directed by the manufacturer, but using only 100 μm each dNTP and with [α-32P]dCTP included at 2 μCi/nmol. The amplified fragments were purified from 5% polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. DNA binding reactions (20 μl) were done in FR buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA) using 5–10 ng of radiolabeled DNA and amounts of H-NS ranging from 0.17 to 1.67 μg. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then filtered under vacuum on Biotrace NT filters (Gelman). The filters were washed with 5 volumes of FR buffer minus spermidine, dried, and the radioactivity retained on the filters determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Standard methods were used for gel electrophoresis and the construction of recombinant plasmids (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was electroporated into S. typhimurium using a Gene Pulser® (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One pulse was applied, at capacitance 25 microfarads, resistance 200 Ω, and voltage 2.45 kV. Electrocompetent S. typhimuriumwere prepared as described (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). Cells were grown in low osmolarity medium (see below) to an A 600 between 0.3 and 0.5. The culture was then split and NaCl added to one-half of the culture to a final concentration of 0.3 m to give an osmotic upshock. The other half of the culture provided a low osmolarity control. The cells were grown for a further 40 min and β-galactosidase or luciferase activities assayed as described previously (13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). Note that using transient osmotic shock, rather than growing cells to steady state at different osmolarities, circumvents possible effects of osmolarity on plasmid copy number and on mRNA stability. For luciferase assays, NB (Difco) was used as the low osmolarity medium; for β-galactosidase assays LB with NaCl omitted was used as the low osmolarity medium. All data are the result of multiple independent determinations. For β-galactosidase assays the data are presented after correction for background expression using data obtained from an identical plasmid lacking a promoter upstream of the reporter gene (pAV250). Previous studies have shown that H-NS exhibits a binding preference for curved DNA resulting from phased A tracts. To ascertain whether H-NS recognizes DNA curvature per se or the A tracts responsible for curvature, a series of plasmids was constructed containing curved and noncurved DNA fragments (Table I). The base composition of each curved and noncurved pair was similar, but the order of the bases resulted in distinct architectures. One pair of fragments was the AT curve and AT noncurve described previously; H-NS binds to the AT curve preferentially (12Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 420-425Google Scholar, 13Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Google Scholar). A second pair of curved and noncurved fragments (the GC curve and GC noncurve) were constructed which did not contain A tracts. The GC curve contains the motif “CCGG” in phase with the pitch of the DNA helix (an average of once every 10.5 bp) and has been shown previously to be curved by anomalous electrophoretic mobility and ligation assays (33McNamara P.T. Bolshoy A. Trifonov E.N. Harrington R.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1990; 8: 529-538Google Scholar, 34McNamara P.T. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12548-12554Google Scholar, 35Bolshoy A. McNamara P. Harrington R.E. Trifonov E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2312-2316Google Scholar). The GC noncurve has a similar base composition to the GC curve but is designed such that the DNA is much less curved. A fifth DNA fragment (AT planar curve) contained an AT-rich curve designed to be planar (36Ulanovsky L. Bodner M. Trifonov E.N. Choder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 862-866Google Scholar), in contrast to the nonplanar AT curve described above. The sixth fragment was the DRE from downstream of the S. typhimurium proUpromoter (bp +99 to +299). Five of the synthetic DNA fragments were generated from the appropriate oligonucleotides (Table I), whereas the sixth fragment, the DRE, was amplified by the PCR. All fragments were cloned into pBluescript. These plasmids, and the sizes of the inserted curved and noncurved DNA fragments, are described in TableII. Fig. 2 shows the predicted structures of 120-bp fragments formed by ligation of the five different oligonucleotides determined by the CURVATURE program (37Shpigelman E.S. Trifonov E.N. Bolshoy A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 435-440Google Scholar).Panel A shows the predicted helical path of the AT curve. Note that this curve is “out of plane” with the axis of the DNA helix with the end of the fragment pointing into the plane of the page.Panel B shows the AT noncurve in which the A tracts are out of phase. This sequence has several small “snake-like” curves although, on average, the helical path is straight. Panel Cshows the predicted path of the GC curve. The curvature is not predicted to be as great as for the AT curve, but it is “in plane” (i.e. the path of a longer piece of DNA would form a flat mini-circle as opposed to the superhelical path of the curve inpanel A). Panel D depicts the GC noncurve, of similar base composition to the GC curve (Table I). The fragment is slightly curved, although less so than the GC curve, and is probably closest to “generic” DNA of all the fragments depicted. The AT planar curve depicted in panel E is in plane, such that a 126-bp fragment will form a flat mini-circle (36Ulanovsky L. Bodner M. Trifonov E.N. Choder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 862-866Google Scholar). Panel Fshows the predicted curvature of the DRE. Note that the curvature of the DRE is less than that of the synthetic AT curves; the DNA is curved by roughly 60° over about 100–120 bp. Although the DNA fragments were predicted to be either curved or noncurved, it was necessary to demonstrate this experimentally. One commonly used method for assessing DNA curvature is anomalous mobility on polyacrylamide gels (38Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows the relative mobility of the five synthetic DNA fragments and the DRE. The apparent sizes of the fragments under these conditions were estimated from their mobilities with respect to molecular weight markers. The “R L values,” the ratios of the apparent sizes to the actual sizes of the fragments, were as follows: GC noncurve, 1.0; GC curve, 1.3; AT curve, 2.8; AT noncurve, 1.0; AT planar curve, 2.1, DRE, 1.2. The curvatures measured experimentally under these conditions were consistent with the computer predictions. The relative affinity of H-NS for curved and noncurved DNA fragments was initially assessed by bandshift assays. Plasmids containing the curved and noncurved DNA fragments (pAF1–3; pAF6; pTP4–5) were digested with HaeIII, incubated with different amounts of H-NS, and electrophoresed in agarose gels. Fig. 4 shows that, in general, the larger the DNA fragment, the lower the H-NS concentration required to initiate a bandshift. This is consistent with H-NS binding nonspecifically to generic DNA. However, the fragment containing the AT planar curve was “shifted” at an approximately 5-fold lower H-NS concentration than the other fragments of similar size, demonstrating a small binding preference for this curve. In contrast, no significant preference could be detected for the nonplanar AT curve (Fig. 4). As the AT curve and AT planar curve differ in the planarity of the curve, this observation demonstrates a role for the specific architecture of the curve in determining binding preference. Importantly, in the same assay, H-NS did not show a detec"

Here we report <i>SCT1</i>is allelic to <i>PDR1</i> and that a Thr-879 to Met substitution in the PDR1–101 transcription factor confers multiple drug resistance.

The <i>PDR1</i> T879M mutant increased <i>PDR5</i>transcription compared with wild-type <i>PDR1</i> strains. Deletion of <i>PDR1</i> or the downstream effector<i>SNQ2</i> increased cell sensitivity to camptothecin, whereas deletion of <i>YOR1</i> or <i>PDR5</i> had little effect on camptothecin sensitivity. However, the camptothecin resistance accompanying <i>GAL1</i>-promoted overexpression of<i>PDR5</i> suggests some substrate promiscuity among the ATP-binding cassette transporters.

Protein-protein interactions play an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The interactions between proteins generally involve large interfaces with many intermolecular contacts (1Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Google Scholar). As such, the rational design of small molecular inhibitors of these surfaces has long been considered a formidable challenge. Despite this commonly held view, recent studies indicate that proteins may actually interact through small surface binding epitopes, as in the human growth hormone-receptor complex (2Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Google Scholar) and the erythropoietin-receptor complex (3Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Google Scholar). These findings raise an intriguing possibility that mimics of such small binding epitopes may be sufficient for blockade of a large protein-protein interface. However, the general applicability of this hypothesis and its implications for rational drug design remain to be tested and demonstrated in different biological systems. Undoubtedly, the development of a general approach to inhibit protein-protein interactions will have a tremendous impact on understanding the structural basis of these interactions and in developing new therapeutic strategies for many human diseases.CD4 is a glycoprotein consisting of four Ig-like extracellular domains (D1–D4) 1The abbreviations used are: D1–D4, domains 1–4; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; GVHD, graftversus host disease; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; MLR, mixed-lymphocyte reaction; Gy, gray; EAE, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis; DOSPER, 1,3-dioleoyloxy-2-(6-carboxyspermyl)-propylamid. 1The abbreviations used are: D1–D4, domains 1–4; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; GVHD, graftversus host disease; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; MLR, mixed-lymphocyte reaction; Gy, gray; EAE, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis; DOSPER, 1,3-dioleoyloxy-2-(6-carboxyspermyl)-propylamid. and is expressed on the surface of helper T cells (4White R.A.H. Mason D.W. Williams A.F. Galfre G. Milstein C. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 664-673Google Scholar). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II is a heterodimeric glycoprotein expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and binds antigenic peptides for recognition by the T cell receptor. The interaction between CD4 and non-polymorphic regions of the MHC class II molecule is critical for optimal CD4+ T cell activation, with CD4 serving as a co-receptor for T cell receptor-antigen engagement (5Doyle C. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1987; 356: 626-629Google Scholar). Numerous mutation studies have been performed to determine the regions of CD4 involved in MHC class II binding, and like many protein-protein complexes, the interface is generally believed to involve a large surface area of both D1 and D2, with many contact sites (6Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Google Scholar, 7Lamarre D. Ashkenazi A. Fleury S. Smith D.H. Sekaly R.-P. Capon D.J. Science. 1989; 245: 743-746Google Scholar, 8Fleury S.

Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Google Scholar).CD4+ T cells participate in the pathogenesis of a number of immune-based human conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allogenic organ transplant rejection, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) following allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Small molecular inhibitors of the CD4-MHC class II interaction could potentially block the undesirable activation of CD4+ T cells and could thus serve as effective immunosuppressive agents.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo search for potential CD4 functional epitopes that could be targeted for the design of new inhibitors, a computer analysis was conducted for CD4 D1 in conjunction with synthetic peptide mapping using a procedure published previously (10Satoh T. Li S. Friedman T.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Korngold R. Huang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 438-443Google Scholar). This led to the identification of a surface pocket potentially involved in the CD4-MHC class II interaction (Fig. 1) (18Li S. Gao J. Satoh T. Friedman T. Edling A. Koch U. Choksi S. Han X. Korngold R. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 73-78Google Scholar). This CD4 surface pocket is formed by the FG loop (also known as the third complementarity-determining region or CDR3) and the CC′ loop. While CDR3 has long been proposed to be involved in MHC class II interaction (6Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Google Scholar) and recent studies with peptide mimics have confirmed their involvement (17Friedman T.M. Reddy A.P. Wassell R. Jameson B.A. Korngold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22635-22640Google Scholar, 19Jameson B.A. McDonnell J.M. Marini J.C. Korngold R. Nature. 1994; 368: 744-746Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Zhang F. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Google Scholar), our analysis suggested that the highly protruded CC′ loop may also serve as a surface epitope critical for CD4 function.A series of linear peptides based upon the CC′ loop region were synthesized to test whether this site was involved in CD4-MHC class II interaction. Peptide I (KNSNQIK) was derived from the entire CC′ loop (amino acids 29–35) of human CD4 D1. Peptides II (KNSNQ) and III (SNQIK) were truncated analogs of peptide I corresponding to the C and N termini, respectively. In assays for T cell proliferation as measured by MLRs, peptide I exhibited an inhibitory effect of 21% at 100 μm, and the N- and C-terminal truncated analogs II and III exhibited reduced activities of 11 and 15%, respectively, at the same concentration. This finding indicates that the bioactive region of the CD4 D1 CC′ loop lies on the sequence of NSNQI, which adopts a type I β-turn, as observed in the crystal structure of CD4 D1 and D2 (9Wang J. Yan Y. Garrett T.P.J. Liu J. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E. Husain Y. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Google Scholar). These results led to the design of the cyclic peptide IV (cyclo(CNSNQIC)), incorporating a disulfide bridge to enhance the structural stability of the β-turn around NSNQ. Molecular modeling studies predicted that the cyclic heptapeptide IV closely mimics the conformational feature of the β-turn of the native CC′ loop (data not shown).To confirm our design principle, the structure of the cyclic peptide IV was determined by high resolution two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Table I summarizes the data from NMR experiments. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the existence of a type I β-turn spanning NSNQ and closely resembling the native CC′ loop. (i) There are a number of weak NOE contacts between Asn-2 and Gln-5 (the residue numbering follows the sequence of the peptide) as well as between Ser-3 and Gln-5. (ii) There is a strong dNNinteraction between Asn-4 and Gln-5. (iii) The coupling constant data conform closest to those expected for a type I β-turn (i.e. 3JNH-αH values of 4 and 9 Hz are expected for the i+1 and i+2 turn residues, respectively (21Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 117-175Google Scholar)). (iv) The low amide temperature coefficients for Gln-5 and, to a lesser extent, Asn-4 are highly diagnostic of their participation in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, whereas the remaining amides are largely solvent-exposed. This finding is consistent with the expected hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of residue i and the NH of residue i+3 in the β-turn (22Rose G.D. Gierasch L.M. Smith J.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 1-109Google Scholar).Structure determination based on the obtained NMR data was carried out for the cyclic peptide IV. Ten structures of the peptide that best fit the NOE and dihedral angle data were selected from the extensive conformational search (Fig. 2). The conformational search of the peptide was performed without restricting its structure to a specific type of turn (i.e. type I) a priori. As shown in Fig. 2, the cyclic peptide IV adopted well defined conformation around the sequence NSNQ, which approximately resembled the type I β-turn structure of the CC′ loop in the native CD4 protein. The ψ (i+1) and φ (i+2) angles deviate from ideality and push the backbone amide of Asn-4 in toward the carbonyl of Asn-2. This results in an appreciably shorter interatomic distance than that observed for thei,i+3 putative hydrogen bond (≈2.1versus 2.5 Å) in these structures. As such, the structure of the peptide deviated slightly from the ideal type I β-turn; nevertheless, the overall backbone and side chain topologies of the functionally important region of the peptide closely mimic those of the native CD4 CC′ loop. In contrast to the bioactive region, the disulfide bridge region was somewhat ill defined, probably due to the low number of observed NOE restraints in this region.Figure 2Superposition of 10 NMR-derived structures for the cyclic heptapeptide IV. Only the backbone atom-spanning residues are shown. The N, C-α, and C′ atoms of these residues were used in the least-squares fit. The pairwise root mean square deviations based on the backbone N, C-α, and C′ atoms of the sequence NSNQI for these structures range from 0.06 to 0.79 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)If the CC′ loop of CD4 D1 is a critical epitope for MHC class II binding, as predicted by theoretical analysis, the structural mimicry of the native CD4 D1 CC′ loop region by peptide IV suggests that the peptide might block CD4-MHC class II interaction. CD4-MHC class II binding studies, using a cell rosetting assay (5Doyle C. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1987; 356: 626-629Google Scholar, 16Moebius U. Clayton L.K. Abraham S. Diener A. Yunis J.J. Harrison S.C. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12008-12012Google Scholar), were performed to test this hypothesis. Peptide IV inhibited rosette formation by as much as 50% in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). The linear peptide I exhibited flexible conformations as suggested by modeling studies and consequently displayed decreased potency in comparison with the constrained cyclic peptide IV. This result strongly suggests that the stable β-turn conformation mimicking the native protein surface region is important for inhibitory activity of the peptide. The inhibitory effect of peptide IV was sequence-specific, as demonstrated by the lack of activity of a scrambled peptide (peptide IV-scr; identical amino acid composition, but a fixed randomized sequence). The selective effect of peptide IV on CD4-MHC class II interaction was also indicated by its inability to inhibit cell rosetting mediated by CD8-MHC class I interaction (data not shown). These results strongly support the notion that the CC′ loop of CD4 D1 is a critical functional epitope for MHC class II binding and that small peptide mimics such as peptide IV are sufficient to block this interaction.Figure 3A, inhibition of the synthetic peptides derived from the CD4 CC′ loop on CD4-MHC class II interaction as measured by rosette formation.

Thebars represent the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments.

In this regard, the peptide was tested in MLRs and found to inhibit proliferation by at least 40% of the control response at 100 μm (Fig. 3 B). In addition, peptide IV exhibited significantly higher activity than the other linear peptides derived from the same region, again supporting the conformational dependence of the peptide inhibition.Since a major limitation of peptide-based therapeutics is their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, the synthetic CD4 peptides were tested for their proteolytic stability by incubation in 90% human serum. 2T. Satoh, S. Li, J. Gao, R. Korngold, and Z. Huang, manuscript in preparation. The linear peptide I was highly susceptible to serum proteases and was completely degraded after 24 h, whereas peptide IV exhibited significant proteolytic resistance, with nearly 75% of the peptide remaining intact after 72 h. This resistance is likely due to the small size and cyclic nature of peptide IV, so the molecule is constrained into conformations that are not favorable for proteolytic recognition.The in vivo immunosuppressive activity of peptide IV was tested in three different CD4+ T cell-dependent murine models: EAE, skin allograft rejection across a MHC class II antigen difference, and GVHD across a haplomismatch MHC difference. Following induction of EAE in SJL mice, the maximum mean disease severity level reached by the untreated control group was 1.8 (Fig.4 A), whereas mice treated with a single dose of peptide IV on day 12 (0.5 mg intravenously) attained a significantly lower maximum of 0.4 (p < 0.01 on days 18–22). In the skin allograft model, a single dose of peptide IV (0.5 mg; intravenous) 3 h before transplantation significantly (p < 0.01) prolonged the median survival time to 20 days, compared with 15 days for the untreated control (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, in the murine GVHD model, when donor CD4+ T cells were transplanted into irradiated recipient mice of the untreated control group, 50% succumbed to GVHD with a median survival time of 36 days (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, mice treated with peptide IV exhibited 90% survival (median survival time > 60 days,p < 0.04), not significantly different from those transplanted with only anti-T cell antibody-treated bone marrow cells (p > 0.60). The effectiveness of the peptide in these different animal models for autoimmune disease and transplantation reactions demonstrated the in vivo immunosuppressive activity of this small constrained peptide and its potential as a novel therapeutic agent.Figure 4Inhibitory effect of the cyclic heptapeptide IV (CNSNQIC) on the clinical severity of EAE (A), skin allograft rejection (B), and GVHD (C).

Immunogenetics. 1986; 24: 309-315Google Scholar). Peptide (0.5 mg in 0.25 ml of buffered saline solution) was injected intravenously on day 12 post-immunization. Five mice were evaluated in each group, and the mean severity was calculated. Statistical significance was determined by Tukey multiple analysis of variance.

Ritz J. Schlossman S.F. Weiner H.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 131-138Google Scholar). However, these broad-based monoclonal antibody approaches can result in pan-T cell depletion, and in addition, their value as an effective treatment have been reduced by their inherent immunogenicity. In comparison, small peptide-based therapeutics are less immunogenic and can therefore be used over longer periods of time. In regard to pan-T cell depletion, spleen and lymph nodes from mice treated 48 h earlier with peptide IV have normal cellularity and T and B cell subset composition (data not shown). The combined results of the above studies clearly indicate the potential of synthetic chemically modified peptides as an alternative therapeutic approach.The present study of small peptide mimics of the CD4 surface may suggest a starting point for developing a general approach to inhibit other Ig-related protein structures and interactions. As members of the Ig superfamily have a conserved backbone-folding pattern, it is likely that this generic structure provides some common scaffolds for efficient protein-protein interactions. For example, a surface pocket consisting of the FG and CC′ loops, analogous to that seen here in CD4, is found in the following: CD8, which mediates dimerization (24Leahy D.J. Axel R. Hendrichson W.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1145-1162Google Scholar); the IgE high affinity receptor, which binds IgE (25Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Google Scholar); CD2, which binds LFA-3 (26Jones E.Y. Davis S.J. Williams A.F. Harlos K. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 232-239Google Scholar); and CD28, which binds CD80/86 (27Linsley P.S. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5031-5035Google Scholar).In summary, we have proposed that the CC′ loop is an important functional epitope on the CD4 surface for intermolecular binding and found that small peptide mimics of this epitope are sufficient to interrupt a larger protein-protein interface. In particular, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide (peptide IV) has been shown to closely mimic the CC′ surface epitope, to effectively block CD4-MHC class II-dependent cell rosetting, to possess significant immunosuppressive activity in vitro and in vivo, and to strongly resist proteolytic degradation. These findings have demonstrated a general approach of bioactive peptide design by the functional mimicry of protein surface epitopes to generate potential novel therapeutic agents. Protein-protein interactions play an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The interactions between proteins generally involve large interfaces with many intermolecular contacts (1Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Google Scholar). As such, the rational design of small molecular inhibitors of these surfaces has long been considered a formidable challenge. Despite this commonly held view, recent studies indicate that proteins may actually interact through small surface binding epitopes, as in the human growth hormone-receptor complex (2Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Google Scholar) and the erythropoietin-receptor complex (3Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Google Scholar). These findings raise an intriguing possibility that mimics of such small binding epitopes may be sufficient for blockade of a large protein-protein interface. However, the general applicability of this hypothesis and its implications for rational drug design remain to be tested and demonstrated in different biological systems. Undoubtedly, the development of a general approach to inhibit protein-protein interactions will have a tremendous impact on understanding the structural basis of these interactions and in developing new therapeutic strategies for many human diseases.

Mason D.W. Williams A.F. Galfre G. Milstein C. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 664-673Google Scholar). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II is a heterodimeric glycoprotein expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and binds antigenic peptides for recognition by the T cell receptor. The interaction between CD4 and non-polymorphic regions of the MHC class II molecule is critical for optimal CD4+ T cell activation, with CD4 serving as a co-receptor for T cell receptor-antigen engagement (5Doyle C. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1987; 356: 626-629Google Scholar). Numerous mutation studies have been performed to determine the regions of CD4 involved in MHC class II binding, and like many protein-protein complexes, the interface is generally believed to involve a large surface area of both D1 and D2, with many contact sites (6Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Google Scholar, 7Lamarre D. Ashkenazi A. Fleury S. Smith D.H. Sekaly R.-P. Capon D.J. Science. 1989; 245: 743-746Google Scholar, 8Fleury S.

CD4+ T cells participate in the pathogenesis of a number of immune-based human conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allogenic organ transplant rejection, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) following allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Small molecular inhibitors of the CD4-MHC class II interaction could potentially block the undesirable activation of CD4+ T cells and could thus serve as effective immunosuppressive agents. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo search for potential CD4 functional epitopes that could be targeted for the design of new inhibitors, a computer analysis was conducted for CD4 D1 in conjunction with synthetic peptide mapping using a procedure published previously (10Satoh T. Li S. Friedman T.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Korngold R. Huang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 438-443Google Scholar). This led to the identification of a surface pocket potentially involved in the CD4-MHC class II interaction (Fig. 1) (18Li S. Gao J. Satoh T. Friedman T. Edling A. Koch U. Choksi S. Han X. Korngold R. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 73-78Google Scholar). This CD4 surface pocket is formed by the FG loop (also known as the third complementarity-determining region or CDR3) and the CC′ loop. While CDR3 has long been proposed to be involved in MHC class II interaction (6Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Google Scholar) and recent studies with peptide mimics have confirmed their involvement (17Friedman T.M. Reddy A.P. Wassell R. Jameson B.A. Korngold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22635-22640Google Scholar, 19Jameson B.A. McDonnell J.M. Marini J.C. Korngold R. Nature. 1994; 368: 744-746Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Murali R. Mahapatra A. Zhang F. Maier C.C. Saragovi H. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 472-475Google Scholar), our analysis suggested that the highly protruded CC′ loop may also serve as a surface epitope critical for CD4 function.A series of linear peptides based upon the CC′ loop region were synthesized to test whether this site was involved in CD4-MHC class II interaction. Peptide I (KNSNQIK) was derived from the entire CC′ loop (amino acids 29–35) of human CD4 D1. Peptides II (KNSNQ) and III (SNQIK) were truncated analogs of peptide I corresponding to the C and N termini, respectively. In assays for T cell proliferation as measured by MLRs, peptide I exhibited an inhibitory effect of 21% at 100 μm, and the N- and C-terminal truncated analogs II and III exhibited reduced activities of 11 and 15%, respectively, at the same concentration. This finding indicates that the bioactive region of the CD4 D1 CC′ loop lies on the sequence of NSNQI, which adopts a type I β-turn, as observed in the crystal structure of CD4 D1 and D2 (9Wang J. Yan Y. Garrett T.P.J. Liu J. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E. Husain Y. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Google Scholar). These results led to the design of the cyclic peptide IV (cyclo(CNSNQIC)), incorporating a disulfide bridge to enhance the structural stability of the β-turn around NSNQ. Molecular modeling studies predicted that the cyclic heptapeptide IV closely mimics the conformational feature of the β-turn of the native CC′ loop (data not shown).To confirm our design principle, the structure of the cyclic peptide IV was determined by high resolution two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Table I summarizes the data from NMR experiments. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the existence of a type I β-turn spanning NSNQ and closely resembling the native CC′ loop. (i) There are a number of weak NOE contacts between Asn-2 and Gln-5 (the residue numbering follows the sequence of the peptide) as well as between Ser-3 and Gln-5. (ii) There is a strong dNNinteraction between Asn-4 and Gln-5. (iii) The coupling constant data conform closest to those expected for a type I β-turn (i.e. 3JNH-αH values of 4 and 9 Hz are expected for the i+1 and i+2 turn residues, respectively (21Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 117-175Google Scholar)). (iv) The low amide temperature coefficients for Gln-5 and, to a lesser extent, Asn-4 are highly diagnostic of their participation in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, whereas the remaining amides are largely solvent-exposed. This finding is consistent with the expected hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of residue i and the NH of residue i+3 in the β-turn (22Rose G.D. Gierasch L.M. Smith J.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 1-109Google Scholar).Structure determination based on the obtained NMR data was carried out for the cyclic peptide IV. Ten structures of the peptide that best fit the NOE and dihedral angle data were selected from the extensive conformational search (Fig. 2). The conformational search of the peptide was performed without restricting its structure to a specific type of turn (i.e. type I) a priori. As shown in Fig. 2, the cyclic peptide IV adopted well defined conformation around the sequence NSNQ, which approximately resembled the type I β-turn structure of the CC′ loop in the native CD4 protein. The ψ (i+1) and φ (i+2) angles deviate from ideality and push the backbone amide of Asn-4 in toward the carbonyl of Asn-2. This results in an appreciably shorter interatomic distance than that"

Sequence analysis indicates that 7G1 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans geneunc-33. A 5.5-kilobase pair full-length cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library contains an 1710-base pair open reading frame. Because the predicted 570 amino acid sequence of 7G1 shares 98% identity with the murine Ulip gene product, anunc-33-like-phosphoprotein, we refer to 7G1 as the human Ulip (hUlip). hUlip is also similar to the bacterial enzymed-hydantoinase and the recently described vertebrate gene products CRMP62, TOAD-64, CRMP1, CRMP2, and mUNC. RA stimulates an increase in hUlip mRNA that is transcriptionally regulated. RA stimulates an increase in polypeptides of 58, 60, 65, and 70 kDa with the 58- and 65-kDa species being dephosphorylated forms of the 60- and 70-kDa species.

Because the predicted 570 amino acid sequence of 7G1 shares 98% identity with the murine Ulip gene product, anunc-33-like-phosphoprotein, we refer to 7G1 as the human Ulip (hUlip). hUlip is also similar to the bacterial enzymed-hydantoinase and the recently described vertebrate gene products CRMP62, TOAD-64, CRMP1, CRMP2, and mUNC. RA stimulates an increase in hUlip mRNA that is transcriptionally regulated. RA stimulates an increase in polypeptides of 58, 60, 65, and 70 kDa with the 58- and 65-kDa species being dephosphorylated forms of the 60- and 70-kDa species. This study presents a model in which to study the regulation and expression of the hUlip gene, a member of an emerging family of molecules that potentially mediates signals involved in axonal outgrowth.Y07818 Human neuroblastomas (NB) 1The abbreviations used are: NB, neuroblastoma; RA, retinoic acid; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor. constitute a unique in vitro model in which to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the growth and differentiation of human peripheral nervous system tissue (1Triche T.J. Askin F.B. Kissane J.M. Finegold M. Pathology of Neoplasia in Children and Adolescents. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 145-195Google Scholar, 2Fox F. Davidson J. Thomas L. Cancer ( Phila .). 1959; 12: 108-116Google Scholar). In the presence of biological response modifiers such as retinoic acid (RA) (3Sidell N.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 589-593Google Scholar), increases in cAMP (4Prasad K.N. Biol. Rev. 1975; 50: 129-265Google Scholar), phorbol esters (5Weiler R. Meyerson G. Fischer C.R. Laslop A. Pahlman S. Floor E. Winkler H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 27-29Google Scholar), and interferons (6Cornaglia, F. P., Mariottini, G. L., and Ponzoni, M. (1992)Cancer Lett. 215–220.Google Scholar), the proliferation of these tumor cells is decreased, and there is an increase in neurite extension and neurotransmitter expression, and cells acquire some electrophysiologic properties similar to normal neurons. Several NB cell lines treated in vitro with RA increase Trk gene expression are induced to change the expression of several molecular markers, thus recapitulating steps of the normal embryonic development (7Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawara M.N. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Google Scholar, 8Rodriguez-Tebar A Rohrer H. Development. 1991; 112: 813-820Google Scholar, 9Scheibe R.J. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17611-17616Google Scholar, 10Haskell B.E. Stach R.W. Werrbach-Perez K. Perez-Polo J.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 247: 67-73Google Scholar). Our studies on the mechanisms of RA-induced differentiation of NB cells show that RA induces an increase in TrkB mRNA transcription as well as protein production. Furthermore, in neuroblastoma cell lines constitutively producing BDNF, RA-induced TrkB expression leads to an activation of the TrkB signal transduction pathway that stimulates neurite extension and differentiation (11Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Google Scholar). These data suggest that RA may stimulate gene expression and lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways usually suppressed in the transformed NB cell. To isolate molecular effectors important during activation of thein vitro differentiation of human NB cells, we screened a cDNA library made from NB cells treated for 14 days with RA and identified several genes whose expression changed during RA treatment. One such gene named 7G1 was isolated and found to detect a 5.5-kb mRNA species that was markedly increased after RA treatment of NB cells (12Thiele C.J. Cazenave L. Bolen J.B. Israel M.A. Evans A.E. D'Angio G. Seeger R. Advances in Neuroblastoma Research 2. Wiley-Liss, New York1988: 185-194Google Scholar, 13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis indicates that 7G1 shares a striking homology with the mouse unc-33-like-phosphoprotein, Ulip(unc-33-like phosphoprotein) gene (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar) and the recently described rat CRMP-4 (collapsin response-mediated protein) (15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar). We therefore renamed our gene hUlip as a human homologue of theCaenorhabditis elegans uncoordinated 33 (unc-33) gene. hUlip also has homology with the 3′ region of the C. elegans gene unc-33 (16Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Google Scholar) and the bacterial enzymed-hydantoinase as well as a series of highly conserved genes among several different vertebrate species including the avian CRMP62 (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar), and mUNC, 2S. Tontsch, unpublished observation. the rat TOAD-64 (18Minturn J.E. Geschwind D.H. Fryer H.J.L.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Google Scholar), and two other human sequences named hCRMP1 and hCRMP2 (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar). This paper describes the isolation of a full-length hUlip cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library, hUlip expression in human tissues during development, and regulation of the expression of the hUlip gene and protein in during RA-induced differentiation of NB tumor cells. The NB cell lines SMS-KCNR (KCNR) (20Reynolds C.P. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Reynolds D.A. Ross R.A. Frenkel E.P. Smith R.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 375-387Google Scholar), SH-SY5Y (SY5Y) (21Biedler J.L. Helson L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2649Google Scholar), and NGP (22Brodeur G.M. Sekhon G.S. Goldstein M.N. Cancer. 1977; 40: 2257-2263Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (11Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Google Scholar, 23Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225Google Scholar, 24Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) or control solvent for the indicated times. A 3.7-kb fragment of hUlip (7G1) was cloned from RA-treated KCNR cDNA library by differential hybridization method as described previously (12Thiele C.J. Cazenave L. Bolen J.B. Israel M.A. Evans A.E. D'Angio G. Seeger R. Advances in Neuroblastoma Research 2. Wiley-Liss, New York1988: 185-194Google Scholar, 13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length hUlip cDNA, five hundred thousand phage from a human fetal brain λ ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were screened using a 32P-labeled 800-bp fragment of 7G1. Plaque purified phage clones were converted from λ ZAPII vector to pBluescript SK(−) plasmid according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and two overlapping clones, clone 1 and clone 2, contained the entire hUlip coding region. cDNA sequences were determined by dideoxyribonucleotide chain termination sequencing reactions (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides. Each clone was sequenced in both directions and sequencing confirmed that clones 1 and 2 are completely identical with the original 800-bp 7G1 cDNA fragment. RNA isolations and hybridizations were performed as described previously (12Thiele C.J. Cazenave L. Bolen J.B. Israel M.A. Evans A.E. D'Angio G. Seeger R. Advances in Neuroblastoma Research 2. Wiley-Liss, New York1988: 185-194Google Scholar, 13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar). Typically 25 μg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis and a 32P-labeled 5-kb insert of hUlip clone 1 or GAPDH. Washing conditions were as described (24Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). Membranes were exposed to X-Omat AR film at −70 °C using a intensifying screen. Nuclear RUN-ON assay was performed as described previously (26Gaetano C. Matsumoto K. Thiele C.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 487-493Google Scholar). A pBluescript SK(−) phagemid containing hUlip cDNA clone 2 served as a template for in vitro transcription using the T7 polymerase Ribo MAX kit (Promega), and the resulting mRNA was translated in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. For the immunoprecipitation, the translated product was diluted 10-fold with protein extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml of aprotinin, 20 mm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF) and incubated with anti-peptide A serum and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with extraction buffer, immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling 5 min in 1 × protein sample buffer (1 × = 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6, 10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells (1 × 106) were plated in 100-cm2 dishes for 24 h and treated with indicated the concentrations of RA or control solvent for the indicated times. Cells (1 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of protein extraction buffer at 4 °C for 30 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and protein concentration was determined by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) and hULIP proteins were detected using an antiserum (1:1000) raised against Peptide A. Peptide A corresponds to amino acids 499–511 of hULIP and ULIP. The anti-peptide A serum is specifically blocked by Peptide A and not the corresponding peptide in the TOAD-64/rCRMP2 gene. 3S. Hockfield, personal communication. The anti-peptide A serum was originally described to detect the TOAD-64 protein, which is now known to be Ulip/rCRMP4 (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar, 15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar). The blots were washed, and bound antibodies were detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). For protein phosphatase treatment, after cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml of aprotinin, 20 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol), 20 μg of protein extracts were incubated with 15 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by immunoblot as described above. The hUlip gene was originally isolated as a partial cDNA clone (7G1) from a cDNA library generated from NB cells that had been treated for 14 days with RA (12Thiele C.J. Cazenave L. Bolen J.B. Israel M.A. Evans A.E. D'Angio G. Seeger R. Advances in Neuroblastoma Research 2. Wiley-Liss, New York1988: 185-194Google Scholar). To study the kinetics of RA inducibility of the hUlip gene, we analyzed RNA isolated from SMS-KCNR NB cells at various times after treatment. An increase in hUlip steady-state mRNA levels was not detected after 15 min of RA treatment (Fig.1 A, lane 2). However, within 1 h a small increase in hUlip expression was detected (Fig.1 A, lane 3) that was markedly increased after 2 days of RA treatment (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). hUlip expression peaked between 4–8 days (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6) and remained relatively unchanged up to 18 days after RA treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and8). At this time, the transcriptional induction of hUlip gene was approximately 20-fold higher in RA-treated cells than in control cells (Fig. 1 B). This is not due to a generalized increase in transcription stimulated by RA because the specific transcription of the retinoblastoma and CDC2 genes was decreased less than 2-fold after RA treatment, whereas N-myc transcription was reduced approximately 50-fold by RA as has been previously described (24Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of hUlip is consistent with a previous observation that RA stimulated a 2-fold increase in 7G1 transcription in nuclei from cells treated for 2 days with RA and a 22-fold induction in nuclei from cells after 14 days of RA treatment (13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar). A Northern analysis of normal human fetal and adult tissues indicated that hUlip mRNA is detected in 59-day fetal brain (Fig.1 C, lane 6) and an increased level of hUlip mRNA is observed in a 135-day brain sample (lane 7). However, two different samples of adult brain mRNA (regions undefined) did not express hUlip mRNA (lanes 8 and9). Detectable levels of hUlip mRNA are also found in fetal spinal cord mRNA but not in adult dorsal root ganglion or peripheral nerve mRNA (Fig. 1 C, lanes 10,11, and 12). Expression of hUlip was not detected in RNA samples from adult muscle, fetal limb, adrenal, or pancreas (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1, 2, 3,13, and 14, respectively). The 7G1 clone contained a 3.7-kb cDNA, and recent sequence analysis comparisons showed that 7G1 shared homology with the C. elegans geneunc-33. The highest homology matched a 3′ region of theunc-33 cDNA. Using a polymerase chain reaction generated 800-bp DNA fragment to the most 5′ region of the 7G1 cDNA as a probe, we isolated a full-length cDNA insert of 5.5 kb from a human fetal brain library. Sequencing of both strands and computer analysis of the 5.5-kb cDNA indicated an open reading frame of 1710 bp predicted a 62-kDa polypeptide with a pI of 6.4 (Fig.2). Sequencing indicated that 7G1 was identical to this 5.5-kb clone in the 3′ region of the molecule. A more detailed nucleotide data base search revealed several highly homologous sequences. The highest homology, 98% identity at protein level, was observed with the mouse unc-33-like phosphoprotein Ulip (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The human sequences, hCRMP1 and hCRMP2 (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar), showed a lower level of homology ranging from 68 (hCRMP2) to 75% (hCRMP1) (data not shown).Figure 3Sequence comparison between hUlip and Ulip. Comparison of hUlip protein sequence with the highly related mouse Ulip protein showing 98% of identity in amino acid residues. Mismatched amino acid residues were indicated by asterisks.Shaded boxes represent the consensus sites for protein kinases such as protein kinase C (Ser14, Ser147, Thr372, Ser421, Thr509, Ser518, and Ser553), casein kinase II (Thr84, Ser115, Ser131, Ser177, Thr218, Ser226, Ser259, Thr312, Ser405, Ser427, and Thr543), protein kinase A (Ser363, Ser522, and Ser553), and proline-directed kinases (Ser308, Thr313, and Ser472). Potential N-myristoylation sites were indicated by dots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Amino acid sequence comparisons of the Ulip gene revealed domains within the Ulip protein that share significant homologies with thed-hydantoinase protein from Pseudomonas putida(14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). During the process of sequence analysis, we noted that the hUlip gene product shared a significant number of conserved amino acid residues with the protein sequence of the Bacillus stearothermophylus d-hydantoinase enzyme (36% homology) and the C. elegans unc-33 gene product (30% homology). By alignment of these three proteins we identified four conserved internal domains, A, B, C, and a D region of homology within C in which the level of identity was significantly higher than the average (60–76%) (Fig. 4). Further analysis is required to assess if these regions may be significant in the function of the hUlip protein. To identify the hUlip gene product, we prepared in vitrotranslated hULIP protein. The 2-kb hUlip mRNA that encompassed the coding region of hUlip was transcribed by T7 polymerase in vitro from the pBluescript II SK(−) hUlip cDNA clone 2 and translated into protein using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins ranging from 35 to 60 kDa are detected, and the 60-kDa labeled protein corresponds to the expected size from the deduced amino acid structure of the hUlip gene. To study the regulation of hULIP proteins, we used a rabbit anti-peptide A serum (18Minturn J.E. Geschwind D.H. Fryer H.J.L. Hockfield S.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 369-379Google Scholar), which is raised against the peptide YDGPVFDLTTTPK (amino acids 499–511; Figs. 3 and 6). To determine whether the anti-peptide serum recognizes the hULIP protein, the in vitro translated hULIP protein was reacted with specific anti-peptide A or a control antiserum in the absence or the presence of the immunizing peptide, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that the mRNA transcripts synthesized from hUlip cDNA translate a 60-kDa protein that is recognized by the anti-peptide A serum and competed out by co-incubation with the immunizing peptide. Immunoprecipitation with a normal rabbit antiserum did not detect hUlip proteins. The smaller peptide fragments synthesized by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate may represent truncated protein products of the hUlip gene, because immunoprecipitation of these truncated proteins by the anti-peptide A serum was also inhibited by the immunizing peptide (Fig. 5 A). The hULIP peptide is found in its rodent homologue ULIP but not in the other members of this family (Fig. 6). Western analysis indicated that the anti-peptide A antibody detected several hULIP proteins of 58, 60, 65, and 70 kDa in extracts from RA-treated SMS-KCNR, and the immunodetection of these bands was specifically blocked if the immunizing peptide was included during the antibody incubation step (Fig. 5 B). This antibody did not detect other members of the family because the corresponding peptides (amino acids 499–511) (Fig. 6) from these family members did not block the anti-peptide A antibody (Fig. 5 B). Western analysis was performed on protein extracts isolated from SMS-KCNR cells treated with RA for 2–12 days. Four distinct but immunogenically related polypeptides with apparent electrophoretic mobilities of 70, 65, 60, and 58 kDa were detected (Fig. 5 C,lanes 2–6). An increase in the p60 hULIP band (Fig.5 C, lane 2) was detected after 2 days of RA stimulation, and this polypeptide was the most abundant. The second most abundant polypeptide was the p70 hULIP protein that was also detected at day 2, whereas the intermediate band, p65 hULIP was faintly detected at day 2 (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and4, respectively). A fourth protein with an apparent molecular weight of 58 kDa was recognized by the anti-peptide A serum, but it was detected after 9 days of RA treatment. Upon prolonged exposure of the western (Fig. 5 B), the 58-kDa hULIP protein could be detected, and this was also competed by the immunizing peptide (data not shown). The finding that peptide A (499–511 amino acids) specifically inhibits antibody binding to all hUlip proteins (Fig. 5 B) indicates that these four proteins all contain an identical antigenic epitope. The p70, p65, and p60 hULIP proteins are detected within 48 h after RA stimulation, the p58 hULIP protein is detected after 9–14 days of RA treatment. The differential regulation of hULIP proteins suggests that they may be translational modifications of a smaller number of proteins. Studies of ULIP, the murine counterpart, indicate that it is a phosphoprotein (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). To test whether the different proteins detected by the anti-peptide A serum in RA-treated NB cells may be phosphorylated forms of a single protein, protein extracts from 6 day RA-treated KCNR NB were incubated with alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C. After a 30-min incubation, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and analyzed with the anti-peptide A serum (Fig.5 D). Western analysis of phosphatase treated extracts resulted in the detection of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 70, 65, 60, and 58 kDa. These studies indicate that the p70 and p60 hULIP proteins may be phosphorylated forms of the p65 and p58 proteins, respectively. The kinetics of detection of the underphosphorylated forms of the proteins suggests that RA may be inducing a specific phosphatase activity. hULIP protein expression was evaluated in three neuroblastoma cell lines whose differentiation response when treated with RA was variable. In KCNR, RA induced a high level of expression of all three hUlip related proteins in KCNR (Fig. 5 E, lane 2). In the NGP NB cell line, the 70- and 60-kDa hULIP proteins are constitutively expressed (Fig. 5 E, lane 3), and the level of expression is not significantly altered by RA (Fig.5 E, lane 4). RA is a poor inducer of differentiation in the cell line SY5Y (11Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Google Scholar), and expression of hULIP proteins in SY5Y (Fig. 5 E, lanes 5 and6) was at a level not detected when compared with the levels of hULIP proteins in KCNR and NGP. Prolonged exposure of blots revealed that RA did induce hULIP in SY5Y (data not shown). This paper describes the identification, cloning, and sequence of the human homologue of the mouse Ulip (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar) and the rat CRMP4 (15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar) gene. An analysis of fetal and adult human tissues indicates that hUlip is developmentally regulated like its rodent counterparts. By utilizing RA-induced differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells, we have found that the hUlip gene is transcriptionally regulated during the process of induced differentiaion, and there is a dramatic increase in hULIP protein expression during neuritogenesis. hUlip is a member of a family of evolutionarily conserved and structurally related genes. Homologous sequences were isolated from different species: d-hydantoinase from P. putida, unc-33 from C. elegans (16Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Google Scholar), CRMP62 from chicken (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar), the rat gene TOAD-64 (19Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J.L. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Google Scholar), the mouse genes Ulip (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar) and mUNC, 4C. Gaetano, T. Matsuo, and C. J. Thiele, unpublished observations. the human genes CRMP1 and CRPM2 (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar) several EST sequences (28Adams M.D. Soares M.B. Kerlavage A.R. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 373-380Google Scholar), and four rat genes CRMP1–4 (15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar). The presence of multiple sequences with different levels of homology even within the same specie suggests that multiple unc-33 like genes are present among the vertebrates. hUlip has an overall homology with the bacterial enzyme d-hydantoinase and the C. elegans unc-33 of only 36 and 30%, respectively, yet it is possible to detect areas of the proteins that have a higher level of identity in the primary sequence (Fig. 4). A previous study identified at least three areas of homology that may represent functional domains in the protein by comparison of Ulip with thed-hydantanoise of P. putida (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). However, by comparing hUlip to the d-hydantanoise of B. stearothermophylus, we have detected an additional region D within the C region with a high number of conserved residues present in the human, bacterial, and worm genes that may have functional significance. To date it has not been possible to assign enzymatic functions to these domains in other unc-33-like proteins (CRMP62 and Ulip), and studies are in progress to address this issue in hUlip. It may be possible that those conserved areas underlie functional domains of the protein. Such a hypothesis is supported by the evidence that the function of the chicken unc-33 homologue, CRMP62, as a collapsin response mediator may be suppressed by injecting an antibody raised against a peptide within the first conserved domain A into the cell (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar). Clues to the role these proteins play during differentiation have been inferred from the functional identification of several members of this family; all members share homology with unc-33, a C. elegans mutant with uncoordinated movements and defects in axonal outgrowth (16Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Google Scholar); chicken CRMP1 was identified as a mediator of collapsin-induced growth cone retraction (17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar); and TOAD-64 is one of the earliest and most abundant proteins expressed in post-mitotic neurons during corticogenesis and migration, yet its expression decreases dramatically in adult neural cells (18Minturn J.E. Geschwind D.H. Fryer H.J.L. Hockfield S.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 369-379Google Scholar, 19Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J.L. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Google Scholar); Family members have an intracellular cytoplasmic location and the proteins, including hUlip, contain consensus sites of phosphorylation for protein kinase C, casein kinase II, protein kinase A, and “proline-directed” kinases as well as N-myristoylation sites. This has lead to speculation that these proteins may be intracellular mediators of collapsin signal transduction and play a role in axonal guidance during neurite outgrowth. The analysis of hUlip distribution in fetal and adult human tissue samples of the central and peripheral nervous system is consistent with the reports for the tissue distribution of the murine homologue of hUlip as well as other members of this gene family in other species (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar, 15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar, 16Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E.

We found a high level of specific mRNA in fetal brain and spinal cord samples but not in any of the non-neuronal and adult tissues examined. This finding may underlie a tissue-specific regulation of hUlip expression and suggests that, like its rodent counterparts, it has a specific role in developing the human nervous system. Members of this family of genes have been almost exclusively localized in rodent neural tissues by in situ analysis (15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar,17Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar), although Ulip expression has been found in muscle localized at the neuromuscular junction (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). The finding of differential expression and regulation of hUlip in neuroblastoma cell lines enables biochemical and functional studies of the hUlip gene and protein to be performed that may be important in determining its functional role during neural development. The expression of hUlip mRNA by Northern blot analysis was increased in RA-treated SMS-KCNR cells after 24–48 h of treatment reaching the peak at 8 days and stabilizing thereafter (Fig. 1 A). The increase in hUlip parallels the kinetics of neurite extension that peak 6–8 days after RA treatment (24Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). This increase in the steady-state levels of hUlip mRNA is due in part to an increase in gene transcription as shown by RUN-ON assays (Fig. 1 B), indicating that chromatin changes are required to activate the expression of this gene in differentiating neuroblasts. The kinetics of induction of hUlip transcription increase gradually with time after RA treatment (2-fold at 2 days, 20-fold at 7 days (Fig. 1 B), and 22-fold at 14 days (13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar)), indicating that the effects of RA may be indirect and not mediated by RA receptors. hUlip mRNA expression is also increased in RA-treated NB cells at a time in which cells have arrested in G1 of the cell cycle and neuritogensis begins. This is similar to the pattern of expression of TOAD-64 that is absent in the mitotic precursors of corical neurons but is highly expressed once cells have stopped dividing (18Minturn J.E. Geschwind D.H. Fryer H.J.L. Hockfield S.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 369-379Google Scholar, 19Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J.L. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Google Scholar). However, constitutive hUlip expression can be detected in the proliferating neuroblastoma cell line, NGP, and this suggests that arrest of cell growth may be coincident and not required for expression of hUlip in neuroblastoma. Conversely, it is possible that during normal development hUlip expression is coordinately regulated with arrest of cell growth, yet this process is disrupted as a consequence of genetic changes leading to tumorigenesis in some neuroblastoma cell lines. During RA-induced growth arrest and neurite extension in KCNR NB cells, four immunologically related hULIP proteins with apparent molecular masses of 58, 60, 65, and 70 kDa were detected. The specificity of the anti-peptide A antiserum to detect hULIP and not other members of the family indicates that these proteins are post-translational modifications of hULIP. Whether other members of this family are expressed during RA-induced differentiation of NB cells is not known, although it is possible as rat studies have shown that all CRMP family members are differentially and developmentally expressed in the peripheral nervous system (15Wang L. Strittmatter S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 6197-6207Google Scholar). We have found that phosphatase treatment of protein lysates from RA-treated cells indicates that the p65 may be an underphosphorylated form of p70, whereas p58 may be an underphosphorylated form of p60 (Fig. 5 D). During kinetic analysis, p58 and p65 are detected later after RA treatment and in lower abundance compared with p60 and p70, respectively. This suggests that during RA-induced differentiation a phosphatase may be induced. The products of the chicken, rat, and mouse genes, CRMP62, TOAD64, and Ulip, have been shown to be phosphoproteins. In particular the phosphorylation of several proteolytic peptides are altered after nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells, indicating a possible involvement of the unc-33-like proteins in the Trk-mediated signal transduction pathways (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor stimulates an increase in TOAD-64 protein (18Minturn J.E. Geschwind D.H. Fryer H.J.L. Hockfield S.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 369-379Google Scholar) and Ulip phosphorylation in PC12 cells (14Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar). These observations indicate that members of the unc-33gene family may also be involved in Trk signal transduction pathway. We find that hUlip expression can be stimulated in the RA-treated NB cell line SY5Y and the addition of BDNF enhances hUlip expression.4 However, RA is also known to regulate a number of membrane receptors in NB including TrkB (11Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto K. Wada R.K. Yamashiro J.M. Kaplan D.R. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1798-1806Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor (13Thiele C.J. Deutsch L.A. Israel M.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 281-288Google Scholar) c-kit (29Cohen P.S. Chan J.P. Lipkunskaya M. Biedler J.L. Seeger R.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 3465-3472Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β receptors (30Cohen P. Matsumoto K. Letterio J. Sporn M. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2380-2386Google Scholar), and c-RET (31Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Nakayasu M. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2333-2338Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that activation of these or other unidentified signaling pathways may also contribute to the increased transcription of hUlip mRNA in NB cells stimulated by RA. In this study, we present the isolation and preliminary characterization of the human homologue of the Ulip gene. The ability of RA to regulate transcription of this gene provides a model to study factors affecting the developmental expression of this protein. Furthermore, the variable expression of hUlip in neuroblastoma cells offers a model system to study the function of this protein as it relates to neuronal differentiation. We thank Dr. Susan Hockfield for the anti-peptide A serum and for critical and thoughtful reading of our manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1985577647,"Islet-3 is an LIM/homeodomain protein that is expressed specifically in the eyes and the presumptive tectum in the central nervous system of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Overexpression of the protein (LIMIsl-3) consisting only of the Islet-3 LIM domains in embryos specifically prevented formation of the optic vesicles; caused abnormal termination of the expression of wnt1, engrailed2, and pax2 in the mesencephalic and metencephalic region between 14 hr and 20 hr postfertilization; and severely impaired morphogenetic movement in this region between 20 hr and 26 hr, which should normally lead to formation of the cerebellar primordium. Such defects were all rescued by simultaneous overexpression of Islet-3, suggesting that LIMIsl-3 acted as a specific dominant-negative variant of Islet-3. These data, combined with the results of mosaic analyses, suggest that Islet-3 is activated by putative LIM-binding cofactors and functions to promote evagination of the optic vesicles and to maintain reciprocal interaction between the mesencephalon and the mesencephalic–metencephalic boundary essential for normal development of this region."
https://openalex.org/W1985955083,"While the TR4 orphan receptor (TR4) is able to repress the expression of its target genes via its interaction with the direct repeat 1-hormone response element (DR1-HRE) and DR2-HRE, we now report that TR4 can also induce the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene containing a DR4-HRE via chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Scatchard analysis reveal a strong binding affinity (dissociation constant = 2 nm) between TR4 and DR4-HRE. The induction mediated by TR4 was detected not only in the synthetic DR4-HRE but also in some genes, such as rat α-myosin heavy-chain and S14 genes, containing the DR4 or DR4-like motif, which have been suggested to be the response elements for a thyroid hormone receptor. Our data also demonstrate this TR4-mediated gene induction is TR4 dose- and DR4 sequence-dependent. Together, our data suggest that DR4-HRE can be a positive regulatory element for TR4, which may be able to induce the transcriptional activity of the genes containing such positive HREs. While the TR4 orphan receptor (TR4) is able to repress the expression of its target genes via its interaction with the direct repeat 1-hormone response element (DR1-HRE) and DR2-HRE, we now report that TR4 can also induce the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene containing a DR4-HRE via chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay.

The nuclear receptor superfamily comprises a large group of ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that control the expression of target genes by binding to their cognate hormone response elements (HREs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone response element; TR4, TR4 orphan receptor; DR, direct repeat; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; FUR, far upstream regulatory region; HIV, long terminal repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus I; T3R, thyroid hormone receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor; RA, retinoic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

It includes the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and retinoids. In addition to the classical receptors, a large number of members in this superfamily have been cloned via their sequence conservation, for which ligands were not found and therefore were classified as orphan receptors (5O'Malley B.W. Conneely O.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1359-1361Google Scholar). The human TR4 orphan receptor (TR4) was initially isolated by our laboratory from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries by degenerative polymerase chain reaction cloning (6Chang C. Lopa da Silva S. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Google Scholar). TR4 shows a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology with the TR2–11 orphan receptor and thus forms a unique subfamily in this superfamily (7Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S. Takeda H. Chang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 735-741Google Scholar). Recently, TR4 has also been identified from human lymphoblastoma cells, called TAK1 (8Hirose T. Fujimoto W. Tamaai T. Kim K.H. Matsuura H. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1667-1680Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis shows that TR4 is expressed in many tissues, being predominantly located in granule cells of the hippocampus and the cerebellum (6Chang C. Lopa da Silva S. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Google Scholar). This implies that the TR4 may regulate the specific gene function in a cell-specific manner. A cysteine-rich cluster that comprises two zinc finger-like structures can be easily identified within the DNA binding domain of the nuclear receptors (9Green S. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 325: 75-78Google Scholar, 10Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar, 11Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R.

Three amino acids in the stem of the first zinc finger (the P box) are critical to specify the half-site sequence, while 5 amino acids in the second finger (the D box) can alter the selection pattern of the half-site spacing. On the basis of its distinct P box, TR4 can be classified into the estrogen receptor/thyroid hormone receptor subfamily which displays cross-recognition of the palindromic or direct repeat (DR) HREs. These HREs consist of a core half-site, AGGTCA, or related sequence (13Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 313-323Google Scholar, 14Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y.

Our previous data suggested that TR4 preferred to bind to the HREs, which consist of two DRs of consensus half-site, rather than a palindrome. 2Y.-F. Lee and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, TR4 can repress the retinoic acid-induced transactivation by competitive DNA binding to the response elements of other receptors (i.e. DR5 for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and DR1 for retinoid X receptor (RXR)).2 In addition, the TR4-mediated suppression can also be found in the gene promoter containing DR2-like response element that is located in the +55 region of the SV40 major late promoter (16Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Google Scholar). All of the above findings suggest that TR4 may function as a repressor to block other receptor-mediated transcriptional activities through competitive DNA binding to the same HREs. In the present study, we tested the regulation of TR4 on a DR4-HRE which has been shown to be a hormone response element for thyroid hormone receptor (T3RE) by using a reporter gene assay (17Tsika R.W. Bahl J.J. Leinwand L.A. Morkin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 383-397Google Scholar, 18Liu H.C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037Google Scholar, 19Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Google Scholar). Through these studies, we found that the TR4 can induce gene expression through the interaction with DR4-HRE in a sequence- and dose-dependent manner. In addition to repressing its target genes, our data provide the first evidence to show that TR4 can also activate its target genes, through a DR4- or DR4-like T3RE. This finding may expand our understanding of the physiological function of the TR4 orphan receptor. For the transient transfection or coupled in vitro transcription and translation of the full-length TR4 protein, the pCMX-TR4 and pET14b-TR4 plasmids were constructed as described, respectively (16Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Google Scholar). pCD-TRα1, the expression vector for thyroid hormone receptor α, was provided by Dr. Leslie J. Degroot. The reporter plasmids -32TK-CAT and TK-(DR4)2-CAT, either without or with two copies of DR4 (5′-GATATAGGGGTCAAATAAGGTCAAATG-3′, Fig. 1 A), were kindly provided by Dr. RC. Ralff. TK-(mDR4)-CAT containing one copy of the mutated DR4 (5′-GATCTAGGGCTCAAATAAGCTCAAATG-3′) inserted into the BamHI site of -32TK-CAT plasmid was generated as a negative control. The reporter genes used pCATp reporter genes fused with either the 5′-flanking region of rat α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) (from −374 to +420) (17Tsika R.W. Bahl J.J. Leinwand L.A. Morkin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 383-397Google Scholar), the far upstream regulatory region (FUR) (from −2952 to −2448) in the rat S14 gene (FUR1/2/3-CAT) (18Liu H.C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037Google Scholar), or the long terminal repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus I (from −454 to +82, HIVLAILTR.CAT) (19Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5944-5951Google Scholar), which contains the T3RE motif in the natural promoter region. Expression plasmids pET14b-TR4 and pCD-TRα1 were in vitro transcribed and translated by the TNT system (Promega) as described previously (16Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Google Scholar). EMSA analysis was performed according to the methods described by Cooney et al. (20Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Google Scholar). In general, the double-stranded DR4 oligonucleotides were end-labeled with a [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase to 2–8 × 108 cpm/μg. For competitive DNA binding reactions, 100-fold excess of cold double-stranded DR4 or mDR4 oligonucleotides were mixed with the proteins prior to the addition of labeling probe to the reactions. For antibody supershift analysis, 1 μl of the monoclonal anti-TR4 antibody (G232–303.4) was added to the reaction. As a control for supershift assays, the monoclonal anti-androgen receptor antibody (N1–15) (21Chang C. Whelan C.T. Popovich T.C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Endocrinology. 1989; 123: 1097-1099Google Scholar) was added. Gels were fixed in 50% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min before drying. The radioactive gels were analyzed by either PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.) or autoradiography. The DNA-protein binding assay was performed as described previously (16Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Google Scholar). In brief, free probes (32P-DR4) and DNA-protein complexes were resolved in native gel and quantified by scintillation counting. The dissociation constant (K d) was determined from the minus reciprocal of the slope of the line generated from the empirical data. HepG2 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. HepG2 cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 6-cm culture dishes 24 h before transfection. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal dextran-treated serum at least 1 h before transfection. The cells were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (22Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5434-5440Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiency, the β-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the differences among multiple groups. Student's t test was used for analyzing differences between two groups. The degree of significance (p value) was shown with asterisks. p < 0.05 was accepted as the level of statistical significance. EMSA was used to determine binding specificity for TR4 to DR4-HRE. In vitro translated TR4 protein was incubated with32P-labeled DR4-HRE and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a specific DNA-protein complex (indicated with arrowhead, lane 2) was identified that has a migration distinct from the nonspecific DNA-protein complexes in the presence of mock-translated product (lane 1). The binding specificity was further confirmed by adding excess unlabeled DR4-HRE or mutated DR4 (mutated DR4-HRE, in which the third G was replaced with C) (Fig.1 A). Competition by 100-fold excess unlabeled DR4-HRE abolished the specific DNA protein complex (lane 3). In contrast, this complex could not be abolished completely with the unlabeled mutant DR4-HRE (lane 4). This DNA-protein complex could not be affected when androgen receptor monoclonal antibody (N1–15) was added (lane 5). In addition, when the anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody (G232–303.4) was added in the reaction, a supershifted band made by DNA-receptor-antibody complex was visible (lane 6). All these data clearly demonstrated that the TR4 can bind specifically to DR4-HRE. We also calculated the binding affinity between TR4 and DR4-HRE by the Scatchard analysis. Fixed amounts of in vitrotranslated TR4 proteins were incubated with an increasing amount of32P-labeled DR4 (0.1–12.8 ng) and resolved in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2, Scatchard analysis displays a single binding component with a dissociation constant (K d) of 2 nm and B max of 0.075 nm. These data fit the K d range for steroid receptors and their HREs. As shown above, TR4 can bind to a DR4-HRE with high specificity and affinity. We were then interested in knowing the consequences of this binding. The reporter gene TK-(DR4)2-CAT and the TR4 expression (pCMX-TR4) plasmid were co-transfected into HepG2 cells. Surprisingly, we found that TR4 itself was able to activate CAT activity (Fig.3 A, lane 3). This transactivation could not be observed when pCMX-TR4 was co-transfected with the reporter plasmids without DR4-HRE (-32TK-CAT, lane 1), or with the mutated DR4-HRE (TK-(mDR4)-CAT, lane 2). Moreover, the CAT activity was increased as increasing amounts (from 0.01 to 1 μg) of pCMX-TR4 were co-transfected (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6) Transcriptional activity reached a plateau when 2 μg of pCMX-TR4 was co-transfected (lane 7). In summary, these data clearly demonstrated that TR4 induced transcriptional activation is TR4 dose- and DR4-HRE sequence-dependent. All of the data above suggest that DR4-HRE is a positive novel response element for the TR4. Previous reports suggest that the DR4-HRE can also serve as the response element for the T3RE. Therefore we investigated how these two receptors interacted with each other on the same target sequence by designing the following experiments. First, a fixed amount (2 μg) of thyroid hormone receptor expression vector, pCD-TRα1, was transfected singly or co-transfected with increasing amounts of pCMX-TR4 (from 0.125 to 1 μg) in the absence of T3. As shown in Fig.4 A, CAT activities were activated only when pCMX-TR4 was transfected (lane 1 versus 2). No activation was detected when pCD-TRα1 was transfected alone (lane 1 versus 3). The induction was significant increasing (p < 0.005) by increasing amounts of pCMX-TR4 (lanes 3–7). The induced CAT activities mediated by TR4 were slightly reduced when the unliganded pCD-TRα1 (2 μg) was co-transfected (lane 2 versus 7). However, the reduction of TR4-mediated CAT activation by unliganded TRα1 was not very significant (p < 0.1) by Student's t test. This phenomenon was also observed by co-transfection of pCMX-TR4 (1 μg) with increasing amounts of unliganded pCD-TRα1 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3–7). The activities induced by TR4 (1 μg) was reduced 50% when 2.0 μg of unliganded TRα1 was co-transfected. (Fig. 4 C, lane 3 versus 7). Again, the dose of unliganded TRα1 does not significantly (p < 0.1) repress the activation of CAT activities by TR4. This may be due to the fact that TR4 is more potent than liganded TRα1 in the activation of TK-(DR4)2-CAT reporter gene. The tendency for repression of TR4-mediated transcriptional activity by the unliganded TRα1 is consistent with previous reports (23Casanova J. Helmer E. Selmi-Ruby S. Qi J.S. Au-Fliegner M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Google Scholar) in which suggested that unliganded TRα1 may act as a gene silencer. In contrast, in the presence of T3 (10−7m), both pCD-TRα1 and pCMX-TR4 can activate CAT activities up to 15- and 22-fold alone, respectively (Fig. 4,B and D, lanes 1–3). The transcriptional activity slightly increased when we co-transfected 2 μg of pCD-TRα1 and increasing amounts of pCMX-TR4 (0.125 to 1 μg) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–7). Furthermore, when a fixed amount of pCMX-TR4 (1 μg) was transfected together with increasing amounts of pCD-TRα1 (from 0.5 to 2 μg) (Fig. 4 D,lanes 3–7), the results showed that CAT activity induced by TR4 did not increase significantly by adding additional TRα1. This may suggest that transcriptional activity could be saturated by expression of 1 μg of TR4 alone. As described above, TR4 can recognize synthetic DR4-HRE and activate TK-(DR4)2-CAT reporter gene in a dose- and DNA sequence-dependent manners. We then explored whether this TR4-mediated CAT induction could also be applied to the DR4-T3RE-containing or nonclassical T3RE natural promoters. The sequences corresponding to T3RE were shown in Fig. 5 A with an arrow or underline. The first gene used was from the 5′-flanking region of rat α-MHC gene (from −347 to +420), which contains a DR4-HRE that serves as a T3RE (17Tsika R.W. Bahl J.J. Leinwand L.A. Morkin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 383-397Google Scholar). The expected results were shown in Fig. 5 B, panel a. The transcriptional activity of this gene can be induced up to 9.5-fold with co-transfection of pCMX-TR4. The second gene tested was the FUR of the rat S14 gene (from −2952 to −2448) which contains multiple T3REs that synergize with each other in their responsiveness to T3 (18Liu H.C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037Google Scholar, 26Zilz N.D. Murray M.B. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8136-8143Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 B, panel b, the transcriptional activity of rS14 can be induced up to 6.3-fold upon co-transfection with pCMX-TR4. The third native gene we tested was the HIV-LTR (from −454 to +82), which contains a nonclassical T3RE, GGCGGG, and can be activated by unliganded TRα1 (27Rahman A. Esmaili A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31059-31064Google Scholar). A 3.9-fold induction mediated by pCMX-TR4 can also be observed (Fig. 5 B, panel c). The differences of CAT activity obtained between TR4-transfected and control in these three native T3RE responsive genes were considered significant (p < 0.05) based by Student'st test. All these data suggest that the DR4-T3RE as well as some nonclassical T3REs can serve as potential target sequences for both T3R and TR4. To further define the correlation between TR4 and TRα1 in these natural promoter constructions, we then tested the overexpression of both pCMX-TR4 and pCD-TRα1 in the reporter gene assay. Fig.6 A showed that CAT activities were significantly (p < 0.05) induced by the transfection of pCMX-TR4 alone in all reporter plasmids we had tested, but induction could not be observed in the transfection of unliganded pCD-TRα1. In the absence of T3, the activation induced by TR4 was slightly reduced by unliganded TRα1 in synthetic DR4, α-MHC, and S14 reporter gene constructs but not in HIV-LTR reporter gene. These results agree with a previous report in which HIV-LTR was shown to be activated by unliganded TRα1, and the addition of T3could reverse this effect (27Rahman A. Esmaili A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31059-31064Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the presence of T3 (Fig. 6 B), cotransfection of pCMX-TR4 with pCD-TRα1 slightly increased the activation as compared with the single receptor transfection but the increasing effect is not very significant. Together, our data provides the first evidence showing that the TR4 is capable of activation of CAT reporter genes containing a DR4-T3RE. This is true for both synthetic and native T3REs as well as other nonclassical T3REs. Like the TR2 orphan receptor, TR4 can also serve as a repressor in RAR/RXR-mediated gene induction and transcription from the major late promoter of the SV40+55 gene (16Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Google Scholar, 22Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5434-5440Google Scholar, 28Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed TR4 can also induced the transcriptional activity of genes containing a DR4 or DR4-like sequence. These data suggest that the selectivity of the receptor response is dependent on the core motif, including the spacing, orientation, and precise sequence composition of the adjacent core motifs. In Fig. 1, when we replaced the third G with C in DR4-HRE (mDR4), an excessive amount of unlabeled mDR4 could not abolish with the specific DNA-receptor complex completely. This suggests that the precise sequence of the core motif plays an essential role in TR4-mediated gene regulation, a result in agreement with our previous studies as the TR2 orphan receptor (22Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5434-5440Google Scholar, 28Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Google Scholar). In addition, the spacing of core binding motifs may also be a key factor in dictating specificity of transcriptional response to a transcriptional factor. TR4 can either induce or suppress transcription through the binding to HREs with same sequence of the core binding motif but different spacing. Activation or repression may be dependent on different spacing of the motifs (DR1/DR5 for the repression of RAR/RXR-mediated gene induction and DR2 in suppression of SV40 gene versus DR4 in induction of α-MHC and S14 genes). Similar results are also observed in the case of the thyroid responsive pathway, as transactivation was observed only on the unspaced palindromic element (PAL), a native rat growth hormone T3RE but not on the 3-base pair-spaced vitellogenin A2 estrogen response element, PAL(+3) (29Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar). Interestingly, when we tested the TR4-mediated induction on different native T3REs, we found that the levels of induction are different among these three T3REs. The order for the TR4-mediated induction among these three native gene promoters is α-MHC > rS14 > HIV-LTR. This implies that TR4 had a better induced effect on the DR4-T3REs than TRα1 on such nonclassical T3REs. This suggests that the orientation, and the sequence composition of these adjacent putative core motifs are also very important in the determination of gene regulation. Overall, the combination of core motif spacing, orientation the sequence composition of the core motif and adjacent area could determine the pattern of responsiveness exhibited by genes that are regulated by TR4. However, the molecular structure of the receptor also contributes to the specificity of gene regulation. For example, the two helical regions in the DNA binding domain of the receptor may also contribute to the specificity of base-specific contacts (30Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar, 31Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Google Scholar). The third helix formed between the two helices can also serve as a gap to separate two core binding motif (32Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Google Scholar, 33Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). When the DNA binding domain of the receptor binds to HREs, the receptor may change its conformation and allow access to different factor(s). As a result, TR4 may bind to different co-factors and contribute to both positive or negative gene regulation through different protein-protein interactions (34Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that other nuclear receptors, such as RXR, can serve as a common heterodimerization partner for several nuclear receptors, including the thyroid hormone receptors and retinoic acid receptors (35Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar). The intrinsic binding properties of RXR are masked in such T3R-RXR and RAR-RXR heterodimers. In contrast, RXR is active as a non-DNA-binding co-factor with the NGFI-B/nurr1 orphan receptors (35Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar). Although we were unable to demonstrate the interaction between RXR and TR4, it is still possible that TR4 may need other co-factors for proper function. Using a yeast-two hybrid system, we are in the process of isolating several TR4-associated proteins. 3S. Yeh and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. Recently, COUP-TF has been shown to inhibit the transcriptional activities of T3R, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (36Cooney A.J. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4152-4160Google Scholar), RAR, RXR (37Tran P. Zhang X.K. Salbert G. Hermann T. Lehmann J.M. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4666-4676Google Scholar), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (38Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19169-19172Google Scholar, 39Baes M. Castelein H. Desmet L. Declercq P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 338-345Google Scholar), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (40Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression may also be involved in some other activator(s) (41Leng X. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tasi M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that interactions among proteins may contribute to receptor-mediated gene induction or suppression. Ligands have always played a central role in the activation of steroid hormone receptors. For example, unliganded T3R is associated with cellular co-repressor p270/N-CoR which serves as a gene silencer (24Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, T3R dissociates with the co-repressor and actively turns on its target genes (23Casanova J. Helmer E. Selmi-Ruby S. Qi J.S. Au-Fliegner M. Desai-Yajnik V. Koudinova N. Yarm F. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5756-5765Google Scholar, 42Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3494-3498Google Scholar). However, a similar effect was also observed in this study. Unliganded TRα1 has a potential suppressive effect on the TR4-mediated transactivation in both synthetic DR4 or native T3RE-CAT reporter genes, although the effect is not very significant (p < 0.1). One of the potential explanation is that TR4 has higher binding affinity than TRα1 to T3REs. Therefore, TR4 may compete stronger than TRα1 on binding to the same HRE to activate its target gene. On the other hand, the physiological function of orphan receptors still remains obscure because information regarding ligand is lacking. Nevertheless, the induced CAT activity shown in this study may still provide us a useful assay system for searching for potential ligands or activators for the TR4 orphan receptor. What then is the relationship between TR4 and TRα1, since they both recognize the same HRE? Transient transfection studies show that TR4 can activate CAT activity in the presence or absence of T3suggesting that T3 is not the ligand or activator for TR4. In contrast, T3R can only activate transcriptional activity when the ligand, T3, is present. These results suggest that two different receptors may use different ligands to induce similar or different sets of target genes. Another possibility is that although two different receptors can recognize the same HRE, they may function differently and independently in gene regulation. For example, T3R can also bind with high affinity to estrogen response element and serves to antagonize estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation (15de Verneuil H. Metzger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4489-4497Google Scholar). In our present study, we found that the T3-induced transactivation of TRα1 could be overwhelmed by TR4. In addition, the repression effects from unliganded TRα1 could be overcome by adding more TR4. The dominant effect of TR4 may be due to its higher binding affinity to DR4-HRE as compared with that of TRα1 (data not shown). Together, our data suggested TR4 may play an important role in TRα-mediated gene regulation. In summary, our data suggest that the ability of TR4 to induce genes with T3RE-DR4-HRE may provide us with a model system for future studies in determining the mechanisms to determine how the TR4 activates and represses its target genes. Moreover, this TR4-mediated induction system may provide a potential assay for finding a possible ligand and/or activators for TR4. We thank Dr. Leslie J.

SSAT degradation was blocked by the binding of polyamines or of the polyamine analog,N 1,N 12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BE-3-4-3), to the protein, providing a mechanism for the increase of SSAT activity in response to these agents. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a number of residues including arginine 19, cysteine 122, histidine 126, glutamic acid 152, arginine 155, and methionine 167 were needed for protection of SSAT by BE-3-4-3. These residues have previously been shown to reduce the affinity for the binding of polyamines to the SSAT protein, and these results indicate that the change in protein configuration brought about by this binding renders the protein resistant to proteasomal degradation. Mutations to alanines of residues arginine 7, cysteine 14, and lysine 141 also prevented the protection by BE-3-4-3, and these residues may be required for the formation of the protected conformation. The rapid degradation of SSAT required the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, and the two terminal glutamic acid residues at positions 170 and 171 were found to be of critical importance. Truncation of the protein to remove these residues or the mutation of either of these acidic residues to glutamine completely abolished the rapid degradation of SSAT. The addition of two extra lysine residues at the carboxyl terminus or the conversion of the glutamic acids at positions 170 and 171 to lysines also prevented SSAT degradation by the proteasome. These results show the key role of the acidic residues at the carboxyl terminus of the protein in reacting with the proteasome. In contrast, mutation of lysine 166 to alanine, which extends the length of the acidic region in the carboxyl-terminal fragment of SSAT, actually increased the rate of degradation of SSAT without affecting its stabilization by BE-3-4-3. The binding of BE-3-4-3 or polyamines is therefore likely to change the configuration of the SSAT protein in a way that prevents the exposure of the carboxyl-terminal region of the ubiquitinated protein to the proteasome.

It is also strongly induced by polyamines, and it has been suggested that a rise in the free polyamine content is an intermediary in the induction by other agents (6Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Google Scholar). The most potent inducers of SSAT are polyamine analogs that have substitutions on the terminal nitrogens and, therefore, are not substrates for acetylation (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar) binding sites have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Dimerization is needed for the formation of the active site, and complementation experiments with inactive mutants have shown that the active site involves residues from both subunits (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar). It is a very interesting feature of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway that all three of the key enzymes that regulate polyamine levels, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and SSAT, turn over very rapidly (6Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Google Scholar, 23Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Google Scholar, 24Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar). The turnover of ODC, which is mediated by a polyamine-inducible protein termed antizyme, has been studied extensively (25Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 205-210Google Scholar), but there is no published information available on the mechanism of degradation ofS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and SSAT. The present studies were carried out to obtain a better understanding of the degradation of SSAT and its regulation by the natural polyamines and the polyamine analog,N 1,N 12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BE-3-4-3). Previous studies have indicated that SSAT turns over very rapidly and that the half-life is greatly increased by polyamines or polyamine analogs (5Persson L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12364-12367Google Scholar, 15Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Google Scholar, 16Matsui I. Pegg A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Google Scholar). It is very difficult to measure the turnover of SSAT accurately in cells with low polyamine levels because the content of SSAT protein is extremely small under such noninducing conditions. However, estimates of a half-life of less than 1 h have been made (15Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Google Scholar, 16Matsui I. Pegg A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1986; 238: 581-587Google Scholar), and this half-life is increased by more than an order of magnitude in the presence of BE-3-4-3 and other polyamine analogs. Experiments have been carried out in which the sensitivity of the SSAT protein and various mutants prepared by site-directed mutagenesis to degradation by proteases was used to investigate the binding of polyamine analogs to the protein and the subsequent conformational changes (22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). There have been no reported studies on the mechanism of cellular degradation of SSAT or of the residues needed for the rapid turnover and for mediating the stabilization by polyamines. In the present report we provide evidence that SSAT is a good substrate for degradation via the proteasomal/ubiquitin pathway (30Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar, 31Coux O.

Sci. 1996; 21: 96-101Google Scholar), that this degradation is prevented by the binding of polyamines or BE-3-4-3 to the protein, and that interaction with the proteasome requires the glutamic acid residues located at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The similarity of the carboxyl end of the molecule to the PEST sequences known to be involved in the degradation of rapidly turning over proteins including ODC is also discussed.

Full-length and 7.6-kDa fragments of human S5a proteasomal subunit were generously provided by Dr. Martin Rechsteiner, Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Polyclonal anti-SSAT antibody was prepared as described previously (4Casero J., R.A. Gabrielson E.W. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3955-3958Google Scholar). Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. The plasmid pSAT9.3 containing the SSAT cDNA in Bluescript (19Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.A. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Google Scholar) and pGEM-ODC containing the ODC cDNA (33Lu L. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 671-675Google Scholar) were used to express the respective proteins from the T7 promoter of each vector. All mutations were introduced into the SSAT cDNA using pSAT9.3 as the template for site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar, 22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). The sequence of the entire coding region of all mutant cDNAs was checked to ensure the absence of secondary mutations. Plasmid DNA was purified from DH5αEscherichia coli extracts on Qiagen-tip 500 anion exchange columns according to the manufacturer's directions. The 35S-labeled wild type or mutants of SSAT (and wild type ODC) were synthesized from plasmid (0.125 μg/12.5 μl) in the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system as described previously (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar, 22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). Degradation of SSAT was studied using an in vitrodegradation system essentially as described for ODC (33Lu L. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 671-675Google Scholar). Briefly, the35S-labeled proteins generated as described above were used as substrates for degradation by incubating 4-μl aliquots of the synthesis mix with crude rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a standard assay volume of 200 μl at 37 °C. Each degradation assay contained 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.05 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cycloheximide, and 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate unless stated otherwise. In experiments testing an energy requirement for SSAT degradation, ATP and the ATP regenerating system were replaced by 20 mm2-deoxyglucose and 10 μg/ml hexokinase. In experiments testing the effect of antizyme on the reaction, a polyhistidine-tagged preparation of antizyme was used. This was obtained by inserting the antizyme cDNA containing a deletion of the thymidine present at position 205 (34Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Google Scholar) into the pQE-30 plasmid, expressing the protein in E. coli and purifying the resulting protein to homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The rate of SSAT or ODC degradation was followed by removing 30-μl aliquots from the degradation assay at timed intervals as shown in the legends to the figures. Aliquots were mixed with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min prior to being resolved by SDS-PAGE. The rate of35S-labeled protein degradation was determined by quantifying the fixed and dried gels using a Molecular Dynamics 425E-120 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant application software. The degradation of SSAT was studied by using a reticulocyte lysate system shown previously to degrade ODC in a physiologically relevant manner (29Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 205-210Google Scholar, 33Lu L. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 671-675Google Scholar, 35Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Google Scholar). Labeled SSAT was synthesized using the TNT synthesis system with pSAT9.3, and aliquots were added to reticulocyte lysates. As shown in Fig. 2, SSAT was degraded very rapidly by these lysates, and the loss of the SSAT band occurred at a rate comparable to that of ODC. A maximal rate of ODC degradation required the addition of antizyme, which is known to be present in limited amounts in reticulocyte lysates (26Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 1-10Google Scholar), whereas antizyme had no effect on the rate of loss of SSAT. The rapid degradation of the 35S-labeled SSAT required the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (results not shown). SSAT was stable during a 3-h incubation when ATP was omitted from the reaction and 2-deoxyglucose and hexokinase was included to deplete ATP pools present in the lysate. Substitution of ATP and the ATP-regenerating system with 2 mm of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, also resulted in a marked stabilization of SSAT with only a 30% loss in intensity of the 20-kDa band after 3 h of incubation. This small loss is likely to reflect the depletion of preexisting ATP pools in the lysate, as most of the degradation seen occurred early in the incubation. Incubation of the35S-labeled SSAT in reticulocyte lysates led to the appearance of a ladder of higher molecular weight bands of labeled protein, which were readily visible in the films developed from the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figs. 3 and 4). The characteristic ladder was noticed to be more intense at earlier times, becoming fainter with extended incubation in the degradation reaction. To confirm that the higher molecular weight bands were associated with SSAT, aliquots taken at timed intervals from the degradation reaction were mixed with a polyclonal antibody to SSAT, and the immune complexes were precipitated upon addition of protein A and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The higher molecular weight bands were precipitated by this antibody showing that the ladder does represent SSAT complexes. The size of the two lowest molecular weight complexes are consistent with the predicted size of mono- and di-ubiquitinated SSAT, suggesting that SSAT may be degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Figure 4Effect of inhibitors on SSAT degradation. Assays of degradation of 35S-labeled SSAT were carried out as in Fig. 3 without antibody precipitation and using reaction mixes containing no extra additions, 0.5 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml S5a fragment, 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 500 μm calpain inhibitor I plus 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide as indicated. Panel A shows SDS-PAGE analysis, and panel B shows quantitation of the time course of the effect of 0, 0.5, or 1.5 mg/ml of protein S5a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, the rate of degradation of SSAT was reduced by the addition of calpain inhibitor I, which is one of a class of peptide aldehydes reported to be inhibitors of 20 S proteasomal function (36Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar). This inhibitor also caused a persistence in the SSAT-ubiquitin bands. Since calpain inhibitor I is not absolutely specific for proteasomal proteases, the effect of a fragment of human S5a protein was also studied. The S5a protein (37Ferrell K. Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 143-148Google Scholar) is a component of the 26 S proteasomal complex that has been shown to recognize and bind polyubiquitinated substrates (38Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Google Scholar, 39van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Google Scholar), thus targeting them for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Rechsteiner and colleagues (40Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Google Scholar) showed that this protein acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. A fragment of this protein that contains the portion responsible for the inhibitory activity blocked SSAT degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). The characteristic ladder of ubiquitinated SSAT associated with SSAT degradation persisted longer in the presence of the S5a fragment (Fig. 4 A). The addition of 1.5 mg/ml S5a fragment led to about 58% of the 20-kDa band corresponding to SSAT remaining after a 3-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). The degradation of 35S-labeled SSAT became progressively slower with increasing concentrations of spermidine and spermine added to the degradation assay (Fig. 5). Spermine was more effective than spermidine in preventing SSAT degradation with 73% compared with 36% of the 20-kDa band remaining after a 2-h incubation in the presence of 1 mm spermine or spermidine, respectively. BE-3-4-3 was more potent than either of the natural polyamines, giving maximal protection of SSAT from degradation in the reticulocyte lysate system at 100 μm concentrations (Fig. 6). It is known that either BE-3-4-3 (22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar) or much higher albeit physiological levels of natural polyamines 2H. Huang, C. S. Coleman, and A. E. Pegg, unpublished observations. produce a conformational change in SSAT structure, and the results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 therefore indicate that this conformational change renders SSAT resistant to degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent system present in the reticulocyte lysates. Addition of BE-3-4-3 did not prevent the ubiquitination of the SSAT protein, since the higher molecular weight bands were still present when either wild type or the K166A mutant SSAT described below were incubated with the lysates supplemented with BE-3-4-3 (results not shown).Figure 6Effect of mutations and BE-3-4-3 on rate of SSAT degradation. Incubation of 35S-labeled wild type and mutant SSAT proteins was carried out as in Fig. 2 in the absence (left lanes) or presence (right lanes) of 100 μm BE-3-4-3, and aliquots were removed at the times shown. Panel A shows results for control SSAT and the E171Q, E170Q, A168Stop, and K166A SSAT mutants. Panel B shows results for control SSAT and the R155A, E152K, K141S/R142A/R143S, H126A, and R101A SSAT mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Effect of mutations on SSAT degradation and protection by BE-3-4-3. The 35S-labeled wild type and mutants of SSAT were incubated in the reticulocyte lysate degradation assay in the absence and presence of 100 μm BE-3-4-3 as in Fig. 6. The results are shown as the percent of SSAT protein degraded in 1 h. The mutations used are shown and the results are plotted in order of mutations from the carboxyl to the amino terminus of the protein. Panel A shows results for the region covering amino acids 166–171, panel B shows results for the region covering amino acids 122–161, and panel C shows results for the region covering amino acids 7–120.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the structural features of SSAT responsible for the rapid proteasomal degradation and for the prevention of this degradation by BE-3-4-3, a series of alterations to the SSAT sequence (Fig. 1) were made by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were incubated for varying periods of up to 3 h in the presence or absence of BE-3-4-3. Results for the amount of degradation that occurred in 1 h, which were representative of the results of the entire time courses, are shown in Fig. 7. The gels showing results for selected mutants of particular interest are shown in Fig. 6. The rapid degradation of SSAT in the absence of BE-3-4-3 requires the carboxyl end of the molecule, since mutants E170Stop, A168Stop, and M167Stop were not rapidly degraded (Fig. 7 A). The critical importance of the carboxyl side chain of the terminal two glutamic acid residues is shown by the results with point mutations where either was altered to glutamine. Both of these mutants (E170Q and E171Q) were stable (Figs. 6 A and 7 A). Replacing these two acidic residues with basic lysines (mutant E170K/E171K) or adding two lysines as additional residues to the end of the SSAT sequence (mutant +172K/173K) also rendered the SSAT stable (Fig. 7 A). The SSAT mutants rendered stable by mutation or truncation of the carboxyl domain were still subject to ubiquitination since the higher molecular weight bands similar to those seen in Figs. 3 and 4 were still seen with mutants E170Stop, E171Q, E170Q, and E170K/E171K (results not shown). Only changes in the carboxyl end of the protein caused the SSAT to become resistant to proteasomal degradation. None of the other point mutations studied (which encompass residues throughout the molecule) prevented the rapid degradation of the SSAT protein (Fig. 7). The triple mutant K141S/R142A/R143S did prevent rapid degradation of SSAT (Fig. 6 B). This mutation removes the site of tryptic digestion (22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar) of pure SSAT but may distort the structure of the protein since this mutation also renders the protein completely inactive. Mutant K166A was degraded even more rapidly than the wild type protein. This effect is seen in the data shown in Fig. 7 A but is underestimated because even the control protein is substantially degraded in the 1-h time period. Fig. 6 A, in which the entire time course is shown, indicates clearly that this mutation substantially increases the rate of degradation of the SSAT. However, this K166A mutation did not prevent the ability of BE-3-4-3 to stabilize the SSAT protein. Several mutations did reduce or totally abolish the protective effect of BE-3-4-3. These included mutants M167A, R155A, E152K (and E152Q), H126A, C122A, and R19A (Figs.6 B and 7). All of these mutations have been shown to reduce the ability of SSAT to bind polyamines or polyamine analogs (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar, 22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). Mutations R7A, C14A, and K141A also prevented the stabilization by BE-3-4-3 (Fig. 7, B and C). In addition to providing information on the residues responsible for stabilization by BE-3-4-3, these observations rule out the possibility that BE-3-4-3 inhibits the degradation system directly. Evaluation of the properties of protein mutants generated by site directed mutagenesis is sometimes subject to question because of the possibility that the protein structure is distorted as a result of the mutation. However, this is unlikely to account for our results since the key mutations have previously been tested and shown to produce little or no alteration in SSAT enzymatic activity or in the characteristic pattern of SSAT sensitivity to proteases (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar, 22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SSAT shows a distinctive and limited degradation when exposed to trypsin or to protease Glu-C and is cleaved only at discrete sites which are -Lys141Arg142Arg143- and -Glu151Glu152-, respectively (Fig. 1). Degradation by these proteases is completely blocked by addition of BE-3-4-3 (22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). Mutations E170Q and E171Q, which are shown in the current experiments to abolish the rapid degradation, and mutation K166A, which increases the rate of proteasomal degradation, produced little or no reduction in SSAT enzymatic activity and no change in the binding of BE-3-4-3 or polyamines (measured by the ability to protect SSAT from proteolytic degradation or by the K m for spermidine) (22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). The results reported here were obtained with a reticulocyte lysate system in vitro and are entirely consistent with the known facts about SSAT degradation in vivo. The half-life of SSAT in polyamine-depleted and control cells was estimated at 9 and 20–40 min, respectively (15Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Google Scholar, 16Matsui I. Pegg A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 373-378Google Scholar, 17Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 581-587Google Scholar) and was increased to >12 h by the presence of polyamine analogs (15Parry L. Balaña Fouce R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Google Scholar, 18Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Google Scholar). The findings that SSAT degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system is greatly reduced by BE-3-4-3 is in agreement with these observations. It appears likely that this protection is mediated by an alteration in configuration in the SSAT protein brought about by binding the polyamine analog. Most of the mutations that were found in the experiments illustrated by Figs. 6 and7 to abolish the stabilization of SSAT by BE-3-4-3 have also been shown to abolish the protection of the SSAT protein from protease cleavage and to increase the K m for spermidine in the acetylation reaction. These include the mutants M167A, R155A, E152K or E152Q, H126A, C122A, and R19A (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar, 22Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the inability of BE-3-4-3 to stabilize these mutant SSATs in the proteasomal degradation system is due to a lack of binding of the polyamine analog. Although these mutations do have reduced levels of SSAT activity, it is unlikely that they cause major alterations in the structure of SSAT since (a) the major part of the reduction in activity is due to a change in the K m for polyamines, and (b) the mutant E152K forms enzymatically active heterodimers when co-expressed with mutant R101A which forms part of the acetyl-CoA binding site (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Google Scholar). A simple model that would account for our findings would be that SSAT degradation is brought about by ubiquitination of the protein that causes it to be bound to the proteasomal structure. Degradation then requires the interaction of the proteasome with the carboxyl end of the SSAT, and this interaction requires the carboxyl side chains of the glutamic acid residues 170 and 171. The binding of BE-3-4-3 or polyamines alters the configuration of the protein so that this carboxyl end is not exposed and the degradation is therefore prevented. Several peptide motif sequences have been proposed to target intracellular proteins for rapid destruction (41Rechsteiner M. Rogers S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar). The terminal -MATEE motif of the SSAT appears to provide another example of such a sequence. The most widespread motif that has been hypothesized to mark proteins for rapid turnover is the PEST sequence, which is defined as a region of ≥12 amino acids that contains proline, serine/threonine, and glutamic acid/aspartic acid in the absence of basic residues (41Rechsteiner M. Rogers S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar, 42Rogers S. Wells S. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Google Scholar). The PEST hypothesis has received much support from the almost ubiquitous presence of such PEST sequences in rapidly turning over proteins, although it has not yet been determined how the sequences act. SSAT (Fig. 1) does not contain an obvious PEST sequence. The terminal -MATEE motif, which is identified in the current study as a critical region for SSAT turnover, is eliminated from consideration by the absence of a proline residue, but the other components of the PEST motif, acidic residues and serine or threonine, are present in the carboxyl-terminal sequence, and the carboxyl-terminal location may permit this sequence to be exposed for interaction with the proteolytic machinery without the need for a proline. Furthermore, positively charged residues are not compatible with PEST sequences, and the mutation to alanine of lysine 166, which increases the liability of SSAT, extends the length of the acidic carboxyl-terminal sequence. It is therefore possible that -MATEE acts as a “pseudo-PEST” sequence. Although both enzymes lead to an increase in putrescine in the cell, ODC and SSAT have opposing roles in polyamine synthesis, with ODC tending to increase and SSAT to decrease polyamine levels (24Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar). Both enzymes are regulated at the level of protein stability by polyamines but in opposite directions. ODC content is reduced by polyamines via the antizyme-mediated enhancement of degradation, whereas SSAT is increased by polyamines via the prevention of degradation. In both cases, the carboxyl end of the protein is a critical region for interaction with the proteasome. Removal of from 5 to 37 residues from the carboxyl terminus of ODC (43Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Google Scholar, 44Ghoda L. Sidney D. Macrae M. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2178-2185Google Scholar), or the point mutation of cysteine 441, which is contained within this region (45Miyazaki Y. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 837-844Google Scholar), renders ODC stable without affecting its enzymatic activity. Attaching the same 37 residues of ODC to the terminus of dihydrofolate reductase rendered this protein subject to rapid degradation (46Loetscher P. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11213-11220Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether the carboxyl-terminal domain of SSAT is also able to impart rapid turnover to other proteins. We thank Dr. M. Rechsteiner for the gift of protein S5a fragment and D. Feith for the antizyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2057424895,"The mechanism of drug resistance to gallium nitrate is not known. Since gallium can be incorporated into ferritin, an iron storage protein that protects cells from iron toxicity, we investigated whether ferritin expression was altered in gallium-resistant (R) CCRF-CEM cells. We found that the ferritin content of R cells was decreased, while heavy chain ferritin mRNA levels and iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) RNA binding activity were increased. IRP-1 protein levels were similar in gallium-sensitive (S) and R cells, indicating that R cells contain a greater proportion of IRP-1 in a high affinity mRNA binding state. 59Fe uptake and transferrin receptor expression were decreased in R cells. In both S and R cells, gallium inhibited cellular 59Fe uptake, increased ferritin mRNA and protein, and decreased IRP-1 binding activity. Gallium uptake by R cells was markedly diminished; however, the sensitivity of R cells to gallium could be restored by increasing their uptake of gallium with excess transferrin. Our results suggest that R cells have developed resistance to gallium by down-regulating their uptake of gallium. In parallel, iron uptake by R cells is also decreased, leading to changes in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, since gallium has divergent effects on iron uptake and ferritin synthesis, its action may also include a direct effect on ferritin mRNA induction and IRP-1 activity.

(5Harris W.R. Pecoraro V.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 292-299Google Scholar) and is incorporated into cells by Tf receptor-dependent and -independent transport systems (6Larson S.M. Rasey J.S.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 8Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that gallium inhibits the growth of several leukemic cell lines by inhibiting cellular iron uptake and by blocking the activity of ribonucleotide reductase (9Chitambar C.R. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1538-1546Google Scholar, 10Chitambar C.R. Matthaeus W.G. Antholine W.E. Graff K. O'Brien W.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 1930-1936Google Scholar, 11Chitambar C.R. Narasimhan J. Guy J. Sem D.S. O'Brien W.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6199-6201Google Scholar). Iron taken up by cells is stored in ferritin, a high molecular weight protein composed of 24 subunits of H and L chains (12Harrison P.M. Andrews S.C. Artymiuk P.L. Ford G.C. Lawson D.M. Smith J.M.A. Treffry A. White J.L. Iron Transport and Storage.in: Ponka P. Schulman H.M. Woodworth R.C. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 81-101Google Scholar). Ferritin sequesters excess intracellular iron and protects cells from the toxicity of iron overload. An increase in the delivery of iron to cells therefore serves as a powerful stimulus for ferritin synthesis. It is now established that iron-dependent ferritin and transferrin receptor gene expression is regulated by the binding of two iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), IRP-1 and IRP-2, to sequences termed iron-responsive elements (IREs) present at the 5′-untranslated region of ferritin mRNA and the 3′-untranslated region of Tf receptor mRNA (13Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar, 14Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Google Scholar, 15Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K.

Nutr. 1995; 15: 239-261Google Scholar). In iron-depleted cells, IRPs bind with high affinity to the IREs, resulting in suppression of ferritin mRNA translation and stabilization of Tf receptor mRNA (increased Tf receptor synthesis). Conversely, under conditions of intracellular iron excess, IRPs are converted to low affinity forms that no longer bind IREs. As a result, ferritin synthesis proceeds unhindered in iron-repleted cells, and Tf receptor synthesis is down-regulated. The iron-induced decrease in IRP-1 binding activity occurs through a switch between apoprotein (high affinity) and [4Fe-4S] forms (low affinity) without changes in IRP-1 levels (18Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24466-24470Google Scholar), whereas the decrease in IRP-2 binding activity is due to iron-induced IRP-2 proteolysis (19Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Google Scholar, 20Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Google Scholar). IREs are also present on the 5′-untranslated regions of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (21Dandekar T. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Goosen B. Constable A. Johansson H.E. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1903-1909Google Scholar) and mitochondrial aconitase (22Zheng L. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Zalkin H. Arch. Biochem.

Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Google Scholar), and ascorbic acid (29Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Google Scholar) have also been shown to regulate IRP binding to the IREs (reviewed in Ref. 30Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Google Scholar). Tumor cell resistance to antineoplastic agents is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of malignancy. Recently, we reported the development of a line of human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of gallium nitrate (31Chitambar C.R. Boon P. Wereley J.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1009-1015Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have attempted to advance our understanding of the basis for this drug resistance. Because gallium interacts with various steps in iron metabolism, we hypothesized that the development of gallium resistance may be associated with changes in the cellular handling of iron and iron proteins. Moreover, since gallium can be incorporated into ferritin (7Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 32Hegge F.N. Mahler D.J. Larson S.M. J. Nucl. Med. 1977; 18: 937-939Google Scholar) and ferritin protects cells from iron toxicity, we questioned whether this protein might play a role in modulating the cytotoxicity of gallium. Our studies show that the development of gallium resistance is due to a down-regulation in the transport of gallium into cells and that iron transport is affected in parallel, resulting in changes in the regulation of ferritin gene expression. Gallium nitrate was obtained from Alpha Products (Danvers, MA). Heparin, bovine serum albumin, MTT, Tf, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. RNase T1 was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Na125I,59FeCl3, [32P]GTP, and [32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Corp.59Fe-Tf was prepared as described by Bates and Schlabach (33Bates G.W. Schlabach M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3228-3232Google Scholar), and 125I-Tf was prepared by the chloramine-T method (34Hunter H.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Google Scholar). Human T lymphoblastic leukemic CCRF-CEM cells (S cells) were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 6% CO2 at 37 °C. A clone of CCRF-CEM cells resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of gallium nitrate (R cells) was developed in our laboratory through a process of continuous exposure of these cells to stepwise increments of gallium nitrate over the course of several months. R cells were routinely cultured in medium containing 150 μm gallium nitrate. For experiments, cells grown to confluency were harvested, washed with complete medium to remove gallium nitrate, and then subcultured in fresh medium in the presence or absence of gallium nitrate. At specified times, cells were harvested and analyzed as described below. The effect of gallium on the proliferation of S and R cells was determined by MTT assay as described by Mossman (35Mossman T. J. Immmunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Cells were plated at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well microwell plates and incubated for 72 h in the presence of 0–1000 μm gallium nitrate. At the end of the incubation, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml stock solution) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. Cells were then solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol to each well, and the absorbance of each well was determined spectrophotometrically at a dual wavelength of 570/630 nm using an EL 310 microplate auto-reader (Biotech Instruments, Winooski, VT). The effect of gallium nitrate on cell proliferation was determined by comparing the absorbance of the wells containing gallium nitrate with that of wells in which the drug was omitted. In some experiments, cell number was determined by directly counting cells using a hemocytometer. cDNAs for rat L and H ferritin cloned into pGEM4Z and pSP65 vectors (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively, and rabbit antiserum to IRP-1 were generously provided by Richard Eisenstein and have been previously described (36Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Google Scholar). cDNAs for L and H ferritin were excised from the plasmids withPstI and EcoRI, respectively, and were32P-labeled using a RadPrime DNA labeling system from Life Technologies, Inc. Human β-actin cDNA probe was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). 32P-Labeled IRE mRNA for the RNA band-shift assay was prepared, using as a template, a 1000-base pair rat L ferritin pseudogene that contains the conserved IRE sequence. The plasmid (p66-L gene) containing this insert (generously provided by Elizabeth Leibold) (13Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar) was linearized with SmaI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used forin vitro transcription of IRE mRNA. Transcription was carried out with Sp6 RNA polymerase using a Riboprobe transcription system from Promega. Ferritin in S and R CCRF-CEM cells was measured before and after a 24-h incubation in fresh medium. Cells were harvested; washed with 10 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl buffer (PBS); and disrupted by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min), and the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was assayed for protein content using a Pierce BCA protein assay and for total ferritin using a Bio-Rad Quantimune ferritin assay. The ferritin content is expressed as ng/mg of protein. Total cellular RNA was isolated from S and R cells by a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The integrity of the RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Twenty micrograms of RNA from each preparation was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using the capillary-blotting method. H and L ferritin and β-actin mRNA were detected by sequential hybridization of the membranes to the corresponding32P-labeled cDNA probes (1.2 × 106cpm/ml) using QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Autoradiography of the membranes was carried out by exposing the membranes to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 24–48 h. For quantitation of band intensities, the autoradiograph was scanned on an AMBIS optical imaging system. The band intensities obtained with 32P-labeled β-actin were used to monitor for equal loading of RNA on the gels and to normalize the results obtained with hybridization using 32P-labeled L and H ferritin cDNA probes. The binding of IRP-1 to ferritin IRE mRNA was examined by an RNA band-shift assay as described by Leibold and Munro (13Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar). For preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, S and R cells were incubated for 24 h in fresh medium with or without gallium. Cells were then washed by centrifugation with PBS and were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein content of the supernatant was measured. For the band-shift assay, 40 μg of cytoplasmic extract from cells was incubated with 200,000 cpm of32P-labeled IRE mRNA in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. To specifically identify IRP-1 binding to the IRE, incubation conditions were as described above, except that cytoplasmic extracts were incubated in binding buffer with 5 μl of antiserum to IRP-1 for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of 32P-labeled IRE mRNA. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, 1 unit of RNase T1 was added to the reaction mixture, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. Heparin (5 mg/ml) was then added to the reaction, and incubation was continued for another 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiography of the gel was performed at −70 °C. For quantitation of band intensities, the autoradiograph was scanned on an AMBIS optical imaging system. S and R cells were incubated for 24 h in fresh medium containing 0–250 μm gallium nitrate. Approximately 5 × 107 cells were harvested; washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl buffer; and then resuspended in 150–500 μl of the same buffer. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration of 1 mm) was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for protein content and used for Western blotting to detect IRP-1. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the samples was performed according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described by Towbinet al. (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) using a Transblot system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl buffer (TS buffer) containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 90-min incubation in the same buffer containing rabbit antiserum against IRP-1 (1:1000 dilution). Following sequential washes in TS buffer and in TS buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (TST), membranes were incubated for an additional 90 min at room temperature in TS buffer/bovine serum albumin containing 125I-protein A (200,000 cpm/ml). The membranes were finally washed in TS and TST buffers, and autoradiography of the membranes was carried out at −70 °C. S and R cells were washed twice with medium and replated (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) in 1-ml 24-well plates in fresh medium with or without 150 μm gallium nitrate. 59Fe-Tf (6 μg of Tf, 10,000 cpm of 59Fe) was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 24 h. Following this, cell counts were determined, and the cells were removed from the wells and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. 59Fe cpm in the cell pellet was counted using a Wallac Compugamma γ-counter. In addition to measuring59Fe uptake by R cells that had been continuously grown in gallium-containing culture medium, 59Fe uptake by R cells was also determined after these cells had been washed to remove gallium and cultured for 72 h in culture medium without additives. To measure the cellular uptake of gallium, cells were plated in triplicate in fresh medium (5 × 105 cells/ml) in 1-ml multiwell plates. Gallium nitrate (100–1000 μm) containing 67Ga as a tracer (1 μCi of 67Ga/1 mm gallium nitrate) was added to wells at the onset of incubation. After 48 and 72 h of incubation, cell counts were determined, and the cells were harvested and washed by centrifugation with PBS. 67Ga radioactivity in the cell pellet was counted in a Wallac Compugamma γ-counter, and the amount 67Ga incorporated per 106 cells was determined. Cell-surface Tf receptor density was determined by 125I-Tf binding to intact cells. Confluent S and R CCRF-CEM cells were washed and reincubated in fresh medium without gallium nitrate. After 24 and 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and assayed for125I-Tf binding at 37 °C as described previously (40Chitambar C.R. Massey E.J. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1314-1325Google Scholar). In separate experiments, R cells that had been grown for 8 weeks in the absence of gallium were also assayed for 125I-Tf binding. Maximal Tf binding and Tf receptor affinity for Tf were determined according to the method of Scatchard (41Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar). As previously reported (31Chitambar C.R. Boon P. Wereley J.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1009-1015Google Scholar), a gallium-resistant CCRF-CEM cell line was developed by us. To confirm that these cells continued to display a gallium-resistant phenotype, their growth in the presence of gallium was compared with that of S cells (the parent cell line). Based on the concentration of gallium required to inhibit cell growth by 50%, R cells were ∼8-fold more resistant to growth inhibition by gallium nitrate than S cells (Fig. 1). Since prior studies have shown that gallium can be incorporated into ferritin (7Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 32Hegge F.N. Mahler D.J. Larson S.M. J. Nucl. Med. 1977; 18: 937-939Google Scholar), we first investigated whether gallium resistance could be due to an increase in ferritin content, leading to sequestration of intracellular gallium. S and R cells were therefore analyzed for ferritin content. However, as shown in TableI, R cells were found to contain significantly less ferritin than S cells. At stationary phase (confluency, 0 h), the ferritin content of R cells was ∼27% that of S cells. Following 24 h of growth in fresh medium without gallium nitrate, ferritin in both S and R cells decreased significantly; however, the decrease in ferritin was greater in R cells than in S cells. As a result, after 24 h, the amount of ferritin in R cells was only 9% that in S cells. When the 24-h incubation was carried out in the presence of a concentration of gallium nitrate that did not inhibit cell growth, the amount of ferritin in R cells decreased, but remained almost 2-fold higher than that in cells incubated without gallium nitrate. In contrast, in the presence of gallium nitrate, the ferritin content of S cells increased rather than decreased over this period (Table I).Table IEffect of gallium on cellular ferritin contentCellsFerritin0 h24 hNo additive+Gaa+Ga, 150 μm gallium nitrate; +FAC, 50 μm ferric ammonium citrate.+FACng/mg proteinSensitive92 ± 5.964 ± 10.3119 ± 46249 ± 32Resistant25 ± 1.26 ± 1.211 ± 3.335 ± 3.9Gallium-sensitive and -resistant CCRF-CEM cells were analyzed for ferritin at stationary phase (0 h) and after 24 h of growth in fresh medium with or without additives.

Open table in a new tab Gallium-sensitive and -resistant CCRF-CEM cells were analyzed for ferritin at stationary phase (0 h) and after 24 h of growth in fresh medium with or without additives. Data shown represent means ± S.E. of three to five separate experiments. To determine whether R cells were able to increase their production of ferritin in response to iron, cells were incubated with ferric ammonium citrate for 24 h. Table I shows that 50 μm ferric ammonium citrate produced 2.7- and 1.4-fold increases in ferritin in S and R cells, respectively. Steady-state H and L ferritin mRNA levels in S and R cells were examined to determine whether the differences in ferritin content were due to changes in mRNA. Northern blot analysis of mRNA, however, revealed that although R cells had markedly less ferritin protein than S cells, they displayed increased levels of H ferritin mRNA and equivalent levels of L ferritin mRNA (Fig.2, upper panel, compare the band intensities of S and R cells incubated without gallium). Unexpectedly, incubation of cells with gallium induced a marked increased in H and L ferritin mRNAs in both R and S cells (Fig. 2, upper panel). As illustrated further in the lower panel of Fig. 2, H ferritin mRNA levels in S cells increased in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to increasing concentrations of gallium. S cells incubated with 50 and 150 μm gallium nitrate displayed 1.6- and 3.7-fold increases in H ferritin mRNA, respectively, relative to cells grown without gallium. The above experiments suggested that although H and L ferritin mRNA levels were increased in R cells, their translation was inhibited. Since ferritin synthesis is regulated at the translational level by the binding of IRPs to H and L ferritin mRNAs, IRP binding activity in S and R cells was examined by band-shift assay. As shown in Fig.3, IRP mRNA binding was increased ∼2.4-fold in R cells incubated for 24 h in the absence of gallium (comparelanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and2). Antibody to IRP-1 produced a supershift in these bands (lanes 9 and 10), indicating that they specifically represent IRP-1 binding to ferritin mRNA. Fig. 3 also shows that in the presence of gallium, IRP activity in both S and R cells was decreased; however, it still remained greater in R cells than in S cells. To exclude the possibility that the differences in IRP-1 activity in R cells were due to changes in the amount of IRP-1 protein, cells were analyzed by Western blotting after a 24-h incubation with increasing concentrations of gallium nitrate (0–250 μm). In three separate experiments, S and R cells were found to contain comparable amounts of IRP-1, which did not change significantly following exposure of cells to gallium (data not shown). Since prior studies showed that gallium inhibits the cellular uptake of iron (9Chitambar C.R. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1538-1546Google Scholar), we investigated whether the differences in ferritin content between S and R cells could be explained by an effect of gallium on iron transport into cells. Cells were therefore examined for 59Fe uptake in the presence and absence of gallium nitrate. As shown in Fig. 4, 59Fe uptake by S cells was decreased by ∼31% in the presence of 150 μm gallium nitrate. In contrast, 59Fe uptake by R cells was markedly decreased even in the absence of gallium nitrate and was ∼60% lower than that by S cells. With the addition of gallium nitrate to the incubation, 59Fe uptake by R cells was decreased further, albeit to a lesser extent than that seen with S cells. Prior to being used in these experiments, R cells were washed extensively to remove gallium present in the stock cultures; however, to confirm that the decrease in iron uptake by R cells was not due to residual gallium in the system, 59Fe uptake studies were also performed using R cells that had washed, incubated for 3 days in fresh medium without gallium, and then washed again. 59Fe uptake by these cells (R1 cells) was identical to that seen with washed R cells taken directly from stock cultures (Fig. 4). Even after 12 days (three passages) of culture of R cells in gallium-free medium, 59Fe uptake by R cells remained only 40% that of S cells (data not shown). Hence, the decrease in iron incorporation into R cells was not a result of an inhibition of iron uptake by the presence of residual gallium. To determine whether the mechanism of drug resistance to gallium involves changes in its transport into cells, gallium uptake by R cells was compared with that of S cells. To correlate gallium transport into cells with the cytotoxicity assays, gallium uptake by cells was examined after 48- and 72-h incubations in the presence of increasing concentrations of gallium nitrate with 67Ga as a tracer. When incubated with 100 μm gallium (a noncytotoxic concentration), both S and R cells incorporated similar amounts of gallium/cell over 48 and 72 h (Fig. 5). Incubation with higher concentrations of gallium nitrate resulted in increases in gallium uptake by both S and R cells; however, gallium incorporation into R cells was significantly lower and, in the presence of 1000 μm gallium nitrate, was only 34–36% that into S cells (Fig. 5). 125I-Tf binding to S and R cells was examined to determine whether the decrease in gallium and iron uptake by R cells could be explained on the basis of a decrease in Tf receptors. As shown in Fig.6 A, 125I-Tf binding to R cells was ∼72 and 54% that of S cells after 24 and 48 h of incubation, respectively, in the absence of gallium. To examine whether this decrease in Tf receptors was related to a residual effect of exogenous gallium, 125I-Tf binding to R cells was measured again after 8 weeks of growth of these cells in medium without gallium. Drug resistance to gallium was retained even after growth of these cells in the absence of gallium (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of125I-Tf binding to cell-surface Tf receptors (shown in Fig.6 B) revealed that maximal 125I-Tf binding to R cells was ∼53% that of S cells at 48 h without a significant change in Tf receptor affinity for Tf (K D = 9.8 × 10−9m for S cells and 6.71 × 10−9m for R cells). The above experiments show that R cells have a decrease in gallium uptake and changes in transferrin receptor number. Since Tf is known to enhance gallium uptake by cells (6Larson S.M. Rasey J.S. Allen D.R. Nelson N.J. Grunbaum Z. Harp G.D. Williams D.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1980; 64: 41-53Google Scholar, 7Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 9Chitambar C.R. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1538-1546Google Scholar), further experiments were performed to determine whether increasing the amount of exogenous Tf would enhance gallium uptake and increase its cytotoxicity in R cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the presence of 1 mg/ml transferrin resulted in a marked increase in the uptake of gallium by R cells (upper panel) and a progressive inhibition of cell proliferation (lower panel). When added to R cells incubated with 1000 μm gallium, Tf produced a 3.4-fold increase in gallium uptake and completely inhibited cell proliferation. As an iron storage protein, ferritin plays an important role in protecting cells from the toxicity of excessive intracellular iron. In addition to sequestering iron, however, ferritin can also bind gallium (7Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 32Hegge F.N. Mahler D.J. Larson S.M. J. Nucl. Med. 1977; 18: 937-939Google Scholar). This latter property of ferritin prompted us to initially investigate whether the development of drug resistance to gallium was associated with changes in ferritin gene expression. Our studies revealed that whereas ferritin mRNA levels were increased in R cells, ferritin protein content was markedly diminished. Further investigation demonstrated that IRP-1 RNA binding activity was increased, thus suggesting that the decrease in ferritin production in R cells was the result of a repression of ferritin mRNA translation. IRP-1 protein levels were equivalent in R and S cells, indicating that the increase in IRP-1 binding activity in R cells was due to a greater proportion of IRP-1 existing in a high affinity mRNA binding state. Since IRP/RNA interactions are directly influenced by changes in cellular iron, iron uptake studies were carried out that showed that 59Fe incorporation into R cells was <50% that into S cells even in the absence of gallium. Hence, it appears that the switch in IRP-1 from a low to a high affinity mRNA binding state in R cells is due to a down-regulation of iron uptake and a depletion of an intracellular iron “pool” responsible for influencing IRP binding activity. Whereas the inhibitory effect of gallium on iron uptake by S and R CCRF-CEM cells was consistent with earlier results in other gallium-sensitive cell lines (9Chitambar C.R. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1538-1546Google Scholar), an unexpected finding was that iron uptake by R cells was consistently less than that by S cells even after extended growth of R cells in the absence of gallium. Since earlier studies have shown that cells incorporate iron and gallium by similar Tf-dependent and -independent transport systems (6Larson S.M. Rasey J.S. Allen D.R. Nelson N.J. Grunbaum Z. Harp G.D. Williams D.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1980; 64: 41-53Google Scholar, 7Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic Z. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3929-3934Google Scholar, 8Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Google Scholar), we questioned whether the uptake of gallium by R cells was also decreased. Gallium uptake studies were therefore performed that showed that when challenged with increasing concentrations of gallium nitrate, R cells incorporated significantly less gallium than S cells. Hence, it appears that R cells have a decrease in the activity of a metal uptake transport system that affects both gallium and iron. This decrease in gallium uptake would serve to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of gallium, while the parallel decrease in iron uptake would lead to changes in intracellular iron homeostasis. While the gallium uptake studies strongly suggest that the development of gallium resistance is primarily due to a down-regulation of gallium transport into cells, the specific transport mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. One explanation for the decrease in gallium uptake is that the lower number of Tf receptors expressed on R cells during proliferation may serve to limit transferrin-mediated uptake of Tf-gallium complexes (formed by the binding of gallium to Tf in the culture medium). Alternatively, the decrease in gallium uptake by R cells may be secondary to a decrease in the activity of a transferrin-independent gallium/iron transport system. It is conceivable that both transport systems work in concert to decrease the uptake of gallium by R cells. Regardless of the membrane transport system involved, our studies indicate that the decrease in gallium uptake is central to the mechanism of drug resistance to gallium. Further evidence for this mechanism is provided by the demonstration that the sensitivity of R cells to gallium could be restored by increasing their uptake of gallium with excess Tf (Fig. 7). Increasing the amount of Tf favors the formation of Tf-gallium complexes and stimulates Tf receptor-mediated uptake of gallium, thereby overriding the basal decrease in gallium transport into R cells. Studies are in progress to elucidate how Tf-dependent and -independent gallium transport pathways are regulated in R cells and to determine their relative roles in gallium resistance. Although the decrease in ferritin in R cells appears to be secondary to the decrease in iron uptake, the effect of gallium on ferritin gene expression appears to be complex. Since gallium inhibited iron uptake by both S and R cells, cells incubated with gallium would be expected to contain less ferritin than cells incubated without gallium. Instead, cells incubated with gallium contained more ferritin mRNA, lower IRP-1 binding activity, and more ferritin protein than cells incubated without this metal. These results suggest that gallium may affect ferritin expression through mechanisms that are independent of its inhibitory action on cellular iron uptake. Although there is no evidence that gallium interacts directly with IRP-1 to alter its mRNA binding activity, Cowley et al. (42Cowley A.H. Jones R.A. Harris P.R. Atwood D.A. Contreras L. Burek C.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1143-1144Google Scholar) have reported the synthesis of a cubic gallium-sulfur cluster with gallium in place of iron. This raises the intriguing possibility that intracellular gallium may be capable of interacting with the iron-sulfur cluster of IRP-1 to produce a change in its affinity for the IREs. However, an alternative explanation for the gallium-induced increase in ferritin may be that intracellular gallium displaces iron from its binding to different ligands/macromolecules, thereby leading to an increase in an iron pool, which, in turn, produces a decrease in IRP activity and an increase in ferritin synthesis. While a direct interaction of gallium with IRP-1 remains speculative at this time, our studies clearly demonstrate that gallium, in a dose-dependent manner, increases H ferritin mRNA and, to a lesser degree, L ferritin mRNA. The mechanism for this increase is unknown and is under investigation. Several studies have shown that ferritin gene expression can be induced by a number of stimuli that are unrelated to iron. Cytokines such as interleukin-1α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ induce H ferritin mRNA transcription and increase H ferritin synthesis in cells (43Tsuji Y. Miller L.L. Miller S.C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7257-7261Google Scholar,44Fahmy M. Young S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 175-181Google Scholar), whereas interleukin-1β increases the synthesis of both H and L ferritin by increasing mRNA translation (45Rogers J.T. Bridges K.R. Durmowicz G.P. Glass J. Auron P.E. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14572-14578Google Scholar). More recently, thyroid hormone has been shown to increase ferritin synthesis by modulating the interaction between IRP and ferritin mRNA (46Leedman P.J. Stein A.R. Chin W.W. Rogers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12017-12023Google Scholar). Hence, it is conceivable that gallium may influence ferritin mRNA transcription and IRP activity through mechanisms that are independent of iron metabolism. In conclusion, these studies are the first to show that the development of drug resistance to gallium involves a diminution in the transport of gallium into cells and that this alteration in gallium transport also affects iron transport and ferritin gene expression. Continued investigation of the interaction of gallium with biological systems may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of its transport, cytotoxicity, and drug resistance and may allow us to increase its efficacy as an antineoplastic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2135438031,"A cDNA expression clone of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, λPf4, which was reactive only to the immune sera and not to the patient sera, has recently been found to be the P. falciparum homologue of the P0 ribosomal phosphoprotein gene. A Northern analysis of the P0 gene revealed the presence of two transcripts, both present in all the different intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle. A 138-base pair amino-terminal domain of this gene was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli. Polyclonal antibodies raised against this domain immunoprecipitated the expected 38-kDa P0 protein from the35S-labeled as well as 32P-labeled P. falciparum cultures. Monospecific human immune sera affinity-purified using the expression clone λPf4 also immunoprecipitated the same size protein from [35S]methionine-labeled P. falciparum protein extract. Purified IgG from polyclonal antibodies raised against the amino-terminal domain of P0 protein completely inhibited the growth ofP. falciparum in vitro. This inhibition appears to be mainly at the step of erythrocyte invasion by the parasites.

This inhibition appears to be mainly at the step of erythrocyte invasion by the parasites. It has been documented that people living in malaria-endemic areas acquire immunity to Plasmodium falciparum after repeated infections. The nature of this immunity is poorly understood at the molecular level. It is apparent from studies involving passive transfer of IgG from immune adults to the non-immune subjects that circulating antibodies do play an important role (1Cohen S. Mcgregor I.A. Carrington S.P. Nature. 1961; 192: 733-737Google Scholar, 2Bouharoun-Tayoun H. Attanath P. Sabchareon A. Chongsuphajaisiddhi T. Druihle P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1633-1641Google Scholar). The specificity of these protective antibodies is as yet unknown. It has been shown that the antibodies present in immune adults recognize domains that are conserved in different strains of P. falciparum (3Marsh K. Howard R.J. Science. 1986; 231: 150-153Google Scholar). However, it has also been documented that many malarial antigens possess repetitive protein domains, which evoke a strong antibody response. Many of these antibodies are non-protective, and the corresponding malarial epitopes are postulated to be immune-evasive or smokescreen domains (4Anders R.F. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf .). 1986; 8: 529-539Google Scholar, 5Schofield L. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 99-105Google Scholar). Thus, to search for pan-specific and possibly protective antibodies, a differential immunoscreening of an erythrocytic stage-specific cDNA expression library of P. falciparum was carried out using malaria-immune and acute patient sera. This resulted in the identification of several novel cDNA clones, which reacted exclusively and yet extensively with immune sera samples (6Lobo C.A. Kar S.K. Ravindran B. Kabilan L. Sharma S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 651-656Google Scholar). The clone λPf4, which was reactive to the largest number of immune sera (80 out of 92), has been cloned and sequenced recently (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar). This was found to be the P. falciparum gene homologue of the ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (PfP0). 1The abbreviations used are: PfP0, P. falciparum P0 protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PfP0-N, recombinant fusion protein of GST with the 46-amino acid peptide from the amino-terminal domain of P0 protein; kb, kilobase(s); IFA, indirect immunofluorescence assay; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: PfP0, P. falciparum P0 protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PfP0-N, recombinant fusion protein of GST with the 46-amino acid peptide from the amino-terminal domain of P0 protein; kb, kilobase(s); IFA, indirect immunofluorescence assay; bp, base pair(s). Ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 is considered to be related to the family of the acidic ribosomal phosphoproteins P1 and P2, because of the highly homologous carboxyl-terminal domain (8Rich B.E. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4065-4074Google Scholar). Antibodies against this domain coprecipitate all three P proteins (9Towbin H. Ramjoue H.-P. Kuster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12709-12715Google Scholar). P0 could be cross-linked to P1 and P2 protein in Artemia salina ribosomes (10Uchiumi T. Wahha A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5580-5584Google Scholar), and these data, along with that from yeast cells (11Saenz-Robles M.T. Remacha M. Vilella M.D. Zinker S. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 51-55Google Scholar), strongly indicate the existence of a (P1)2·P0·(P2)2 protein complex in the eukaryotic ribosomes. This complex has been compared with the bacterial complex L10·(L7/L12)2, which forms the stalk of the large subunit at the GTPase domain along with the 23 S ribosomal RNA (12Beauclerk A.A.D. Cundliffe E. Dijk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6559-6563Google Scholar, 13Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S.D. Liljas A. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Google Scholar). It has been documented that P0 protein is absolutely required for the ribosomal activity and cell viability in yeast (14Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Google Scholar). The conserved carboxyl-terminal domain of the P proteins is very antigenic and found to be the main antigenic target for sera reactivity of about 10–15% of patients of the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (15Elkon K. Skelley S. Parnassa A. Moller W. Waleed D. Weissbach H. Nathan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 38: 7419-7423Google Scholar). Antibodies to this domain have also been detected in patients of suffering from diseases caused by protozoan parasites such as Chagas' heart disease (16Levin M.J. Vazquez M. Kaplan D. Schijman A.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 381-384Google Scholar) and leishmaniasis (17Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Elwasila M. Badaro R. Burns Jr., J.M. Reed S.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1643-1651Google Scholar). In this paper we report the characterization of this protein from P. falciparum, and we show for the first time that P0 is indeed a phosphoprotein. We also show that antibodies raised against the amino-terminal domain of this protein inhibitsP. falciparum growth in vitro. All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]dATP, [32P]orthophosphoric acid were provided by the Board of Radiation Technologies, India. [35S]Methionine and [35S]cysteine were purchased from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, England). Asexual stages of FCR3 (Gambia) and the FCK2 (India) strains of P. falciparum were cultured in vitro at 37 °C in the presence of human erythrocytes of serological type O+ in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 28 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, and supplemented with either 10% human serum or 0.5% Albumax (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 80 μg/ml Gentamycin sulfate) in sterile Petri dishes using the candle-jar method or sealed flasks flushed with 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 gas mixture (18Rathod P.K. Leffers N.P. Young R.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 704-711Google Scholar). For stage-specific RNA preparation and in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays, cultures were synchronized by sorbitol treatment according to the method of Lambros and Vanderberg (19Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Google Scholar). Intracellular parasites from each of the substages were liberated from infected erythrocytes by saponin lysis (20Zuckerman A. Spira D. Hamburger J. Bull. W. H. O. 1967; 37: 431-436Google Scholar) for total RNA and genomic DNA extraction. The gametocytic stages of the parasite (NF54 strain) used for the immunofluorescence studies were kindly provided by Dr. Nirbhay Kumar, Johns Hopkins University (21Lobo C.A. Konings R.N.H. Kumar N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 151-154Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted using a single step method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from total erythrocytic stages of the parasite as described in detail elsewhere (6Lobo C.A. Kar S.K. Ravindran B. Kabilan L. Sharma S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 651-656Google Scholar). Southern and Northern hybridization were performed with the radioactively labeled [α-32P]dATP 251-bp λPf4 cDNA fragment as well as the 700-bp L-4-7 (carboxyl-terminal fragment of PfP0 protein) with specific activity of 2 × 108 cpm by following the membrane manufacturer's protocol (Amersham International) in the presence of 50% formamide. Briefly, 2 μg of parasite genomic DNA cut with appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc.) was electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel. In the case of Northern hybridization, total RNA from the parasite was electrophoresed in formaldehyde containing 0.8% agarose gel. 0.69–9.44-kb RNA markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were run and stained separately with ethidium bromide before transfer of the gel onto the membrane. Gels were transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham International) by capillary blotting following membrane manufacturer's protocol. Air-dried blots were then UV cross-linked in a UV cross-linker (Bio-Rad) for 2 min and pre-hybridized at 42 °C for 2–3 h. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 18–20 h. Blots were washed twice at 65 °C for 15 min each with 2 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS followed by washes with 1 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and exposed to Fuji x-ray film for autoradiography. The quantitation was performed using the gel-documentation system (Ultraviolet Products Inc.) as per manufacturer's protocol by estimating the volume of the signal. A GST reporter-based vector (pGEX-1) was used as an expression vector (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). A HindIII-EcoRI restricted 138-bp amino-terminal fragment of PfP0 (46–184 bp of GenBankTM accession number U56663) (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar) was flushed at both ends with Klenow and subcloned in pGEX-1 restricted withSmaI. The Escherichia coli cells harboring the vector pGEX-1 and the recombinant containing PFP0-N insert were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). The total cell lysates were run on a 12% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue to show the fusion protein (PfP0-N). The polyacrylamide gel piece containing the fusion protein band was cut out and crushed in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 1.44 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.24 g/liter KH2PO4, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The resulting slurry containing an estimated amount of 100 μg of protein was injected into two rabbits. Five boosts were given to each animal to generate antibodies with reasonable titer (>1000 as checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). λPf4 cDNA clones in λgt11, as well as wild type λgt11, were grown on E. coli strain Y1090 to lytic phase (6Lobo C.A. Kar S.K. Ravindran B. Kabilan L. Sharma S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 651-656Google Scholar). Hybond-C membrane (Amersham International) soaked in isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was overlaid on these phage plates and grown for an additional 12–16 h. The membranes were washed three times with 1 × TBS-T (200 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5). A pool of six reactive human immune sera (1:100 dilution) used for the differential immunoscreening (6Lobo C.A. Kar S.K. Ravindran B. Kabilan L. Sharma S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 651-656Google Scholar) was first incubated overnight at 4 °C with membrane saturated with the wild type λgt11 lysate. Then the sera was incubated overnight with several membranes containing the lysate of recombinant λPf4. Monospecific antibodies against λPf4 were eluted with 5 mm glycine from the membrane, neutralized with 1m Tris, and then dialyzed overnight with three changes of TBS-T. Resulting monospecific antibody solution against λPf4 was concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Amicon Inc.), reconstituted to the original volume of the human sera with 1 × TBS-T, and used for immunoprecipitation. Asynchronous cultures of P. falciparum containing 10–12% parasitemia were washed twice with methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended at a final hematocrit of 5% in the same medium supplemented with 10% human serum. 100 μCi/ml of both radiolabeled methionine and cysteine were added to the culture medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under normal culture conditions with occasional shaking. After labeling, the cells were washed and extracted as described elsewhere (24Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Google Scholar). In the case of 32P-labeling, 1 mCi/ml radiolabeled orthophosphoric acid was neutralized using 1n NaOH added to the washed parasites at 5% hematocrit (about 10% parasitemia) in the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% Albumax (Life Technologies, Inc.), incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and the rest of the steps were the same as above. Monospecific human immune sera against λPf4 as well as rabbit polyclonal antibody against PfP0-N were used to precipitate the35S- and 32P-labeled parasite proteins (24Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated samples were run on 12% denaturing gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue for 1 h and destained with destaining solution (30% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 2 h.35S-Containing gels were soaked with 1m sodium salicylate for 30 min and washed with water for another 30 min. In the case of 32P-containing gels, the destaining was continued overnight with several changes of the destaining solution. The gels were then dried using Gel dryer (Hoefer Scientific Co.) and exposed to Fuji x-ray film for autoradiography. IFA studies were done with P. falciparum asexual (FCR3 strain) as well as gametocytic stages (NF54 strain) with polyclonal antibodies against PfP0-N as described earlier (25Jakobsen P.H. Grellier P. Theander T.G. Behrendt N. Torii M. Aikawa M. Schrevel J. Jepsen S. APMIS. 1991; 99: 155-162Google Scholar). Briefly, asynchronous asexual and sexual stage cultures of P. falciparum were coated on glass slides as smears and air dried for overnight. The slides were fixed with methanol for 30 s at room temperature, blocked with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin solution for 2–3 h at room temperature, and washed at room temperature with 1 × TBS-T for 10 min each for three times. Slides were incubated with respective antibodies for 3–4 h at room temperature. FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Cappel, Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) at 1:80 dilution were used as the secondary antibody. The slides were observed under a Zeiss (Axioplan) microscope using × 100 Neofluor phase contrast objective and Zeiss filter FT500/600. All antibodies were cleared with GST andE. coli crude proteins and used at 1:100 dilution. IgG from rabbit sera were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by batch purification with DEAE-cellulose at pH 6.5 (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 283-318Google Scholar). P. falciparum growth inhibition assays were performed in triplicates in 24-well sterilized tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in a total culture volume of 1 ml. The effect of IgG on parasite growth was assessed by starting with ring stage-synchronized parasites at a 0.2–0.5% initial parasitemia and monitoring growth over 48 h without any medium replacement. Blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The adherent monocytes were selected in 24-well plates and counted (2Bouharoun-Tayoun H. Attanath P. Sabchareon A. Chongsuphajaisiddhi T. Druihle P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1633-1641Google Scholar). In the wells containing the adherent monocytes,P. falciparum cultures were added at a ratio of approximately 200 red blood cells/monocyte. Control wells consisted of (a) culture alone, (b) culture and monocytes alone, (c) culture and control IgG, and (d) culture, control IgG, and monocytes. Test and control IgG were added at a concentration of 1.0–1.5 mg/ml of final culture volume. Parasitemia was monitored every 6 h by preparing thin smear slides from each well and by microscopic examination of >10,000 red blood cells. In each experiment, the number of rings, trophozoites, and schizonts were counted separately. Total parasitemia was estimated as the sum total of the rings, trophozoites, and schizonts. A Southern blot of genomic DNA from the HB3 strain of P. falciparum, probed with the 251-bp λPf4 insert, showed that it hybridizes with the 6.1-, 13-, 1.5-, and 11-kilobase pair band when the DNA was restricted with EcoRI, ClaI,DraI, and HaeIII, respectively (Fig.1, panel A). The gene has an internalEcoRI site, and this was demonstrated by probing the same blot with a 700-bp fragment, L-4-7, representing the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar), which lit up the same bands for all restriction digests except that of EcoRI, where it showed a 7.0-kilobase pair band (Fig. 1, panel B). Southern analysis of genomic DNA from two other P. falciparum strains, FCR3 and NF54, was also performed with these two probes, and no significant restriction fragment length polymorphism was observed. These results show that the PfP0 is coded by a single gene and is well conserved in different strains of the parasite. A Northern blot of stage-specific total RNA from the asexual stages ofP. falciparum, probed with the 251-bp λPf4 fragment, showed a dominant 3.0-kb-size fragment in every substage (Fig.2). However, a second band, about 2.0 kb in size, was also seen in all stages. A quantitative determination of the ratio of these transcripts showed that the 3.0-kb message was 2.1 ± 0.26-fold as abundant as the 2.0-kb message in each of the stages. However, the 3.0-kb transcript was about 2.0- and 1.5-fold greater in abundance in the trophozoites compared with the rings and the schizont stages, respectively. The coding region of the P0 gene is 957 bp. However, the gene seems to possess a long 5′-untranslated region of about 1.4 kb in length, as observed by the size of cDNA clones isolated (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction studies using primer sequences within the coding region amplify the same size of fragments when genomic DNA is used as a template (data not shown), and therefore, there are no introns within the coding sequence. However, the presence of introns in the 5′-untranslated region is yet to be determined. Fig. 3 A shows the expression of the GST-fusion protein of the amino-terminal domain of the P. falciparum P0 protein (PfP0-N) in the total E. colicell lysate. The 46-amino acid stretch (17–62 amino acids) from the 138-bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar) produced the expected 31-kDa GST-fusion protein. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies, with a titer of >1000, were raised against PfP0-N and used for immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and growth inhibition studies. This antibody immunoprecipitated a single 38-kDa phosphoprotein from the 35S- and 32P-labeled P. falciparum proteins (Fig. 3 B). Control antibodies such as rabbit preimmune sera and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against GST did not show any band (data not shown). To ascertain that the human immune sera originally used for the differential screen actually recognized the PfP0 protein domain in the λPf4 expression clone, monospecific human immune sera was affinity-purified using λPf4 expression clone and used for immunoprecipitation analysis. This also brought down the 38-kDa P0 protein from 35S-labeled parasite proteins (Fig. 3 B). Human immune sera affinity-purified against the control phage λgt11 did not show any reactivity with the parasite extract (Fig. 3 B). Western blots of the recombinant PfP0-N protein with immune and patient sera samples showed that the recombinant protein was detected only by immune sera samples and not by patient sera samples (data not shown). Rabbit antibodies raised against PfP0-N were used for IFA studies with different asexual stages (Fig. 4, A andB) as well as gametocytic stages of the parasite (Fig. 4,C and D). Rabbit preimmune sera and polyclonal antibodies against GST were used as control. The control antibodies showed no staining with parasites, whereas the anti-PfP0 antibody showed staining with all the different developmental stages of the parasite. In some of the gametocytic stages, intense staining of some sub-cellular domains were noticed (Fig. 4 D), but the significance of this observation is not clear. The localization of the antigen was predominantly intracellular, however there appeared to be some staining at the surface as well. Preliminary experiments with biochemically fractionated parasite extracts do show antibody reactivity to the particulate fractions on Western blots (data not shown). When tested on Toxoplasma gondii, an apicomplexan parasite closely related to Plasmodium, it was observed to stain the surface, as confirmed by double staining with surface and internal markers ofToxoplasma. 2A. Goswami and S. Sharma, unpublished data. It has been reported that the protective human immune sera inhibits thein vitro growth of P. falciparum only in the presence of monocytes (2Bouharoun-Tayoun H. Attanath P. Sabchareon A. Chongsuphajaisiddhi T. Druihle P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1633-1641Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed with mixed specificities of immunoglobulins. To ascertain whether anti-PfP0 antibody inhibits the growth of P. falciparum in the presence or absence of monocytes, in vitro inhibition studies using synchronized parasites starting from the ring stages were performed (Fig. 5). The antibodies raised against PfP0-N completely inhibited the growth of the parasites over a 48-h period (Fig. 5, panel A). Preimmune sera and sera raised against an irrelevant P. falciparum GST-fusion protein showed no inhibition in the growth of the parasites. Cultures without any IgG and with sera raised against GST protein showed normal growth (data not shown). 4–6 independent experiments were performed for each treatment, and the figure represents an average of these experiments. The presence of monocytes were found to stimulate the parasite growth, but the inhibition of growth of P. falciparum by the antibody was independent of the presence of monocytes (Fig. 5 A). The growth inhibition studies were assayed by microscopically counting at least 10,000 red blood cells for each time point. The counting assay was performed rather than the hypoxanthine-uptake assay, because the uptake of hypoxanthine by the monocytes would cause errors in the assay. Also, starting with a synchronized culture and counting the different substages at every time point would show the development of the substages of the parasite with time. Cultures with synchronized ring stages were the starting point, and every 6 h the different substages of the parasite were counted. In the presence of the control antibody, the parasites progressed through the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages in about 24 h, and subsequently there was an increase in the ring stages, indicating the invasion of fresh red blood cells (Fig. 5 B, top panel). However, in the presence of anti-PfP0 antibody, even though the parasites developed from rings to trophozoite and schizont stages, fresh infection of red blood cells did not take place as the number of ring stages remained close to zero until 48 h in culture (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). The same profile was observed for the distribution of the parasite substages irrespective of the presence (Fig. 5 B) or absence (data not shown) of monocytes. Earlier we had reported the cloning of the full-length gene of PfP0 from the 7G8 strain of P. falciparum (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar). The largest cDNA clone had a coding region 957 bases long, an unusually long 5′-untranslated region of at least ∼1.4 kb, and a 3′-untranslated region of ∼50 bases, making it a total of at least ∼2.4 kb in size. The 3.0-kb transcript therefore matches with this size. It is not clear whether the second transcript of ∼2.0-kb size is a processed transcript or a degradation product. The transcripts are twice as abundant in the trophozoite stages, indicating that the expression of this gene may be regulated. The predicted molecular mass of the full-length gene sequence is 37.5 kDa. The rabbit sera raised against the recombinant protein domain of the P0 gene recognized a 38-kDa P. falciparum protein from both 35S- and 32P-labeled cultures, which matches with the expected size of the deduced P0 protein. The monospecific immune sera also recognized the same size protein. These immunoprecipitation studies showed that the antibodies raised against the PfP0-N recognize a protein of the predicted size, that it is indeed a phosphoprotein, and that antibodies against PfP0-N are present among malaria-immune people and not in patients. The P0 protein was first identified as a member of the P family of proteins through coprecipitation studies using antibodies against the conserved carboxyl-terminal region (9Towbin H. Ramjoue H.-P. Kuster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12709-12715Google Scholar, 15Elkon K. Skelley S. Parnassa A. Moller W. Waleed D. Weissbach H. Nathan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 38: 7419-7423Google Scholar). Although definitive studies have been performed to demonstrate that P1 and P2 are phosphoproteins (27Naranda T. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2451-2457Google Scholar), there has been no direct evidence that P0 is a phosphoprotein.32P-Labeled cultures of yeast cells showed a large number of phosphoriboproteins (28Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Google Scholar), of which the 41-kDa protein has been assumed to be the P0 protein (9Towbin H. Ramjoue H.-P. Kuster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12709-12715Google Scholar). Thus, for the first time, through immunoprecipitation studies using anti-P0 antibodies, we are demonstrating that P0 is indeed a phosphoprotein. Autoantibodies against the conserved carboxyl-terminal domain of the P proteins have been found in 10–15% of patients with an autoimmune disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (15Elkon K. Skelley S. Parnassa A. Moller W. Waleed D. Weissbach H. Nathan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 38: 7419-7423Google Scholar). These autoantibodies have been implicated as a cause for the psychotic disorders among these patients. Immune response has also been documented against P0 protein in chronic Chagas' disease (16Levin M.J. Vazquez M. Kaplan D. Schijman A.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 381-384Google Scholar) and leishmaniasis (17Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Elwasila M. Badaro R. Burns Jr., J.M. Reed S.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1643-1651Google Scholar). However, in each of these cases the reactivity has been reported against the carboxyl-terminal domain. The systemic lupus erythematosus patient sera have been tested for reactivity against the amino-terminal domain of the P2 protein but did not show any response (15Elkon K. Skelley S. Parnassa A. Moller W. Waleed D. Weissbach H. Nathan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 38: 7419-7423Google Scholar). The reactivity of the malaria-immune sera to P0 is widespread (87% of immune sera samples) (6Lobo C.A. Kar S.K. Ravindran B. Kabilan L. Sharma S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 651-656Google Scholar) and is directed toward the Pf4 region which is the amino-terminal domain of the PfP0 protein (7Goswami A. Chatterjee S. Sharma S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 117-120Google Scholar). Thus this immune response toward P0 in malaria-immune persons appears to be different from that observed for the systemic lupus erythematosus patients. The mechanism of the passive clearance of the parasites in malaria patients with IgG of malaria-immune persons is not clearly understood. The IgG may be specifically interacting and blocking crucial parasite domains, or it may be attaching to the parasitized cells and allowing other cellular components of the immune system to clear the parasites. The latter has been supported by studies in which a pool of immune human sera inhibited the in vitro growth of P. falciparum only in the presence of monocytes (2Bouharoun-Tayoun H. Attanath P. Sabchareon A. Chongsuphajaisiddhi T. Druihle P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1633-1641Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed with mixed specificities of immunoglobulins. Anti-PfP0-N antibody inhibits the growth of P. falciparumirrespective of the presence or absence of monocytes, indicating a direct block of parasite invasion. The mechanism behind the inhibition of the P. falciparum growth with anti-PfP0-N antibodies is unclear given the predominant cytoplasmic localization of the PfP0 protein. The inhibition is unlikely to be due to the inhibition of theP. falciparum ribosomal activity as the development from the ring to the schizont stages were nearly normal in the presence of anti-PfP0-N antibody over a period of 24 h. The growth inhibition by anti-PfP0-N IgG clearly seems to act at the erythrocyte-invasion step. While the IFA results do indicate a surface component in addition to the cytoplasmic localization of P0 in the trophozoites and gametocytic stages, whether there is a surface localization of this protein in the merozoite stage is yet to be determined. Interestingly, the presence of an antigenic determinant related to the carboxyl-terminal of P0 protein has been localized to the surface of hepatoma, neuroblastoma, and human fibroblast cells (29Koren E. Reichlin M.W. Koscec M. Fugate R.D. Reichlin M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1236-1241Google Scholar). What this surface determinant of P0 protein may be and what role it may play in the erythrocyte invasion by the malarial parasite remains to be established. We are indebted to Nirbhay Kumar and Cheryl Ann Lobo for help with the supply of gametocytes and general immunoprecipitation techniques. We thank Namita Surolia for the FCK2 strain of P. falciparum and Ruchira Jaitly, a visiting summer student, for help with the expression of PfP0-N fusion protein."

The understanding of the mechanisms involved in PACAPR expression at transcriptional and translational levels and the physiologic role of the PACAPR gene would be facilitated greatly by elucidation of the structure and processing of its gene. In this report, we describe the complete structural organization of the coding region of the rPACAPR gene. We demonstrate that this gene consists of at least 15 exons and 14 introns with an intron-exon structure highly conserved among other known genes in the secretin/calcitonin/PTH family of G protein-coupled receptors. We also provide the first evidence for tissue-specific differential splicing in the 5′-UTR of the rPACAPR mRNA generating rPACAPR transcripts with unexpected diversity in the 5′-UTR. Overlapping fragments of genomic DNA encompassing the entire coding sequence of the rPACAPR gene (Fig. 1) were amplified from rat genomic DNA (CLONTECH) by long distance PCR using Elongase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a series of forward and reverse primers to rPACAPR cDNA sequences. The routine PCR mixture (50 μl) contained 60 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.1, 18 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm primers, and 2 units of Elongase enzyme mix. Amplification was performed for 35–40 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s followed by annealing/extension at 68 °C for 5–15 min. Automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. The ATG 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene was PCR-amplified using the Rat Promoter Finder kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, the supplied rat genomic DNA, digested with various restriction enzymes and ligated at both 5′ and 3′ ends with an adaptor DNA of known sequence, served as templates in PCR using a forward primer to the adaptor sequence and a reverse primer to sequences unique to the rPACAPR cDNA. The 5′-flanking sequence was obtained by automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing of the purified PCR products (University of Iowa DNA Core Facility). The sizes and locations of introns within genomic DNA PCR products were determined by a combination of agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. By comparison of the sequence of the amplified genomic DNA to that of the rPACAPR cDNA we were able to confirm the rPACAPR cDNA sequence and to identify intron-exon boundaries and thereby also determine the sizes of the introns and exons. Restriction mapping of the rPACAPR gene was performed by digestion of the overlapping genomic DNA PCR products with EcoRI,BamHI, BglII, HindIII, andSacI followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Rat genomic DNA (15 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI,BamHI, BglII, HindIII, andSacI, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a 767-bp cDNA probe (nucleotides 185–951 of the rPACAPR cDNA) (Fig. 1) labeled with [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by the random priming method. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in 1 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate and then washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 4 days at −70 °C. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from rat spinal cord was ligated to a synthetic oligonucleotide of known sequence at its 3′ end essentially as we described (37Chatterjee T.K. Sarkar G. Bolander M.E. Fisher R.A. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 26: 29-44Google Scholar). This anchor-ligated cDNA served as the template for PCR amplification of its 3′ end (i.e.corresponding to the 5′ mRNA end) using a forward primer complementary to the anchor sequence and a reverse primer specific to sequences of the rPACAPR cDNA. Two rounds of seminested PCR (i.e. with different reverse primers and the same forward primer) resulted in amplification of products ranging in size from approximately 250 to 900 bp. The reverse primer used in the final round of PCR corresponded to nucleotides 783–807 of the rPACAPR cDNA, suggesting that the largest PCR product extended approximately 100 bp into the 5′-UTR region of the rPACAPR cDNA. PCR products were cloned, and multiple colonies were selected for sequencing. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from various rat tissues or cells (pancreatic β-islets) were amplified in two successive rounds of seminested PCR using a forward primer corresponding to a sequence found within the 5′-UTR (GTCTGGACCGGCCCGGAGACCAG, obtained by anchored PCR) of the rPACAPR transcript. In the first round of PCR, this forward primer was used in combination with a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 292–325 of the rPACAPR cDNA. In the final round of PCR, the same forward primer was used in combination with a nested reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 230–262 of the rPACAPR cDNA. PCR-amplified products were resolved by agarose gel (2%) electrophoresis, and selected products were extracted from the gel, purified, and subjected to DNA sequencing. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from rat cerebellum and rat cerebral cortex using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA from rat cerebral cortex (7 μg) and rat cerebellum (5 μg) and yeast tRNA (30 μg) were reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase using a32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (1 × 105cpm) corresponding to nucleotides −1 to −37 of the rPACAPR cDNA. Reaction products were separated on a denaturing 9% polyacrylamide gel using the sequence of the rPACAPR cDNA as a size standard. To determine the structure of the coding sequence of the rPACAPR gene, we performed long distance PCR with rat genomic DNA and primers to rPACAPR cDNA sequences to systematically walk up the entire coding sequence of the rPACAPR gene. Amplification by Taq polymerase is limited generally to DNA templates less than 5 kb because of its inability to correct misincorporations via 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. To accomplish amplification of long segments of genomic DNA and to assure the fidelity of amplification, we used a commercially available mixture (Elongase) of Taq polymerase and Pyrococcus sp. GB-D DNA polymerase, the latter exhibiting 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. Using this strategy, we successfully amplified six overlapping genomic DNA segments ranging in size from 1.1 to 11.9 kb that spanned the entire coding sequence of the rPACAPR gene (Fig.1). By sequencing these PCR products, we were able to confirm the rPACAPR cDNA sequence and identify the locations and sizes of introns. Alignment of these genomic PCR products demonstrated that the coding region of the rPACAPR gene spans 40 kb of DNA and is interrupted by 14 introns. The intron-exon organization of the rPACAPR gene in relation to its mRNA is shown in Fig. 1. Table I shows the sizes of introns and the intron-exon splice junction sequences in the coding region of the rPACAPR gene. As shown, the introns vary in size from 320 bp to 10.5 kb, and all of the splice acceptor and donor sequences agree with the GT/AG consensus sequence (38Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Google Scholar). The rPACAPR gene intron splice phasing is type 0 (the intron occurs between codons) for introns 1, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 14; type 1 (the intron interrupts the first and second base of the codon) for introns 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9; and type 2 (the intron interrupts the second and third base of the codon) for introns 7, 10, and 12.Table IIntron sizes and splice junction sequences in the coding region of the rPACAPR geneExon-intron junction sequenceIntron numberIntron size5′ donor site3′ acceptor sitekbCTG CTG CCT GTG gtaagg.................cctacagGCT ATT GCT ATG CAC11.5Leu Leu Pro Val Ala Ile Ala Met HisGAG TCT TCC CCA Ggtgagtg...........ctctcctccagGT TGC CCT GGC ATG210.2Glu Ser Ser Pro G ly Cys Pro Gly MetAAC CCG GAC CAA Ggtagg................acatacagTC TGG ATG ACA GAA32.2Asn Pro Asp Gln V al Trp Met Thr GluACC ATA Ggtaagagg........................tacagGA GAT TCT GGT41.3Thr Ile G ly Asp Ser GlyTCC TTG GAG ATC ACA Ggtaagg...........ctcttcagAC ATG GGG GTC52.8Ser Leu Glu Ile Thr A sp Met Gly ValCCT GAG TCT GGA GAT CAGgtaagt........tccag GAT TAT TAC TAC CTG60.46Pro Glu Set Gly Asp Gln Asp Tyr Tyr Tyr LeuATC TTG TGC CGC TTC CGgtgaga..........ccacgcagG AAG CTG CAT TGC70.37Ile Leu Ser Arg Phe Ar g Lys Leu His CysTGC TTC GTT TCC ACCgtaagtg..............ctgtagGTG GAG TGC AAA GCT80.90Ser Phe Val Ser Thr Val Glu Cys Lys AlaATC ATC GGC TGG Ggtaggt..................tccagGG ACA CCT ACT GTG TGT90.32Ile Ile Gly Trp G ly Thr Pro Thr Val CysTTT GAT GAT GCA GGgtaagt...............ctttcagA TGC TGG GAT ATG AAT100.62Phe Asp Asp Ala Gl y Cys Trp Asp Met AsnCCC CTG GTT GGC TCT ATA ATGgtgagt...cactcctcagGTT AAC TTT114.2Pro Val Val Gly Ser Ile Met Val Asn PheTCC AGC ATC TAC TTgtaagt................tgacagA CGG CTG GCC CGC TCC1210.5Ser Ser Ile Tyr Le u Arg Leu Ala Arg SerCTG GGC TCC TTC CAGgtagg.................cccagGGC TTT GTG GTG GCT131.93Leu Gly Ser Phe Gln Gly Phe Val Val AlaTTC CTC AAT GGG GAGgtaagac..............ttgcagGTA CAG GCA GAG ATT141.57Phe Leu Asn Gly Glu Val Gln Ala Glu IleExon and intron sequences are represented by capital and lowercase letters, respectively. Base pairs in exons are grouped in codons. Open table in a new tab Exon and intron sequences are represented by capital and lowercase letters, respectively. Base pairs in exons are grouped in codons. The relationship between exon and intron locations to proposed structural domains of the rPACAPR is shown in Fig. 2. Exons range in size from 21 bp (exon 4) to more than 185 bp (exon 15). The N-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor is encoded by the first six exons and part of the seventh exon. Transmembrane domains I, II, III, and VI are entirely within exons 7, 8, 9, and 13, respectively, while transmembrane domains IV, V, and VII are each interrupted by a single intron. Intracellular domains 1, 2, and 4 are either intronless (2i) or have a single intron located one amino acid from the intracellular domain/transmembrane domain junction (1i and 4i). However, the third intracellular domain (3i) is interrupted by an intron located four amino acids from transmembrane VI. This intron (intron 12) is the largest intron present in the coding sequence of the rPACAPR and is located precisely where alternative splicing can occur to produce the third intracellular loop splice variant forms of the PACAPR (30Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Google Scholar). Indeed, we identified alternate 3′ splice acceptor sites located 2.8 and 7.7 kb from the 5′ end of intron 12 that represent the splicing sites used to produce the hip and hop cassette forms of the rPACAPR, respectively, described by these workers. Introns interrupt two of the three extracellular loops of the rPACAPR. Thus, the regions of the rPACAPR gene coding for the intracellular domains of the receptor are largely intronless compared with the regions coding for the extracellular receptor domains. Also, four of the seven transmembrane domains of the rPACAPR are encoded by individual exons. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA digested by EcoRI,BamHI, BglII, HindIII, orSacI was performed using a cDNA probe covering exons 3–11 of the rPACAPR gene (nucleotides 185–951 of the rPACAPR cDNA) (Fig. 1). This region of the rPACAPR gene was mapped entirely with each of these restriction enzymes, although Fig. 1 shows only theEcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII sites for purposes of clarity. Fig. 3 shows the results of the Southern blot, and Table II shows the predicted and actual sizes of the fragments recognized by the cDNA probe. As shown, the observed patterns of hybridization were consistent with the restriction sites we mapped in the rPACAPR gene coding sequence. These results confirm the structural organization of the rPACAPR gene. They indicate also that the rPACAPR is encoded by a single gene and that no pseudogenes are present in the rat genome.Table IIComparison of the sizes of restriction enzyme digestion products of the rPACAPR gene determined by Southern analysis with those predicted by restriction mapping of the rPACAPR geneTreatmentPredicted sizeActual sizekbEcoRI17.117.0BamHI11.011.44.03.91.21.2BglII7.07.94.94.80.80.8HindIII5.75.62.42.62.42.61.61.5SacI7.27.56.16.52.62.6Actual sizes were determined from the Southern blot shown in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab Actual sizes were determined from the Southern blot shown in Fig. 3. Nearly 1.2 kb of the ATG 5′-flanking sequence (GenBankTM accession number U82669) of the rPACAPR gene was PCR amplified from restriction enzyme-digested, anchor-ligated genomic DNA. Comparison of 5′-UTR sequences of rPACAPR cDNAs to this ATG 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene revealed that the region upstream of nucleotide −76 represents part of an intron (4 kb) that is located between the 3′ splice acceptor site and exon 2 of the 5′-UTR of the rPACAPR gene (see below). To compare the 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene to the 5′-UTR of the rPACAPR cDNA, we performed 5′-RACE with rat spinal cord cDNA to amplify the 5′ ends of the rPACAPR cDNA. Using this approach, we amplified and cloned two cDNAs with 5′-UTR sequences beginning −81 and −102 nucleotides from the translation start site, which we named cDNA 1 and cDNA 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, cDNA 2 was identical to cDNA 1 in its 5′-UTR sequence up to nucleotide −79, where it then diverged from cDNA 1 over the next two bases and possessed an additional 21 bp of 5′ sequence. Interestingly, both cDNA 1 and cDNA 2 are identical to the genomic DNA sequence up to nucleotide −79, whereupon they both diverge. In view of these findings, it is particularly noteworthy that there is a consensus splice acceptor sequence located at nucleotide −77 in the 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene. The observed divergence in sequence of cDNA 1 and cDNA 2 from each other and from the genomic DNA sequence as well as the existence of a splice acceptor site in this region suggested alternative splicing of the rPACAPR gene in the 5′ noncoding region. We obtained further evidence for alternative splicing of the rPACAPR gene in the 5′ noncoding region by amplifying two additional rPACAPR cDNAs with unique 5′-UTR sequences. Because cDNA 1 diverged from cDNA 2 by only 2 bp at its 5′ end, we considered the possibility that it represented a truncated form of cDNA 2 and that the 2-bp divergence may have resulted from a PCR artifact, 5′ anchor ligation artifact, or cloning artifact, although five individual clones exhibited the identical sequence of cDNA 1. To examine this possibility, we performed PCR using the unique sequence at the 5′ end of cDNA 2 as a forward primer, rather than the anchor primer, with reverse primers to sequences present in the coding region of the rPACAPR cDNA. Seminested PCR was performed using reverse primers to nucleotides 292–325 and 230–262 of the rPACAPR cDNA in the first and second rounds of PCR, respectively, with direct sequencing of the PCR products. We used rat cerebral cortex and rat liver cDNA as templates in these reactions. We gel-purified the major PCR product amplified from cerebral cortex cDNA and the largest PCR product amplified from rat liver cDNA. Unexpectedly, we amplified two additional rPACAPR cDNAs with unique 5′-UTR sequences that we named cDNA 3 (liver) and cDNA 4 (cerebral cortex). Alignment of cDNAs 1–4, as shown in Fig. 4, reveals the existence of a unique pattern of alternative splicing in the noncoding region of the rPACAPR gene. As shown, cDNA 3 is identical to cDNA 4 except for the presence of an intervening sequence of 94 nucleotides. This intervening sequence begins precisely at the putative splice junction sequence (nucleotide −77) that we identified in the 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene. This strongly suggests that this sequence represents a 3′ splice acceptor site. None of the cDNAs match the genomic sequence beyond nucleotide −79, further supporting alternative splicing of the rPACAPR transcript to produce mRNAs with unique 5′-UTRs. We performed PCR using genomic DNA as template to identify the genomic locations and intron-exon junction sequences encoding the 5′-UTRs of cDNAs 2–4. As described above, we amplified 5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the rPACAPR gene. Although we did not sequence this entire segment of 5′-flanking DNA, we sequenced nearly 1.5 kb from each end, and we were unable to find a noncoding exon matching the 23-nucleotide sequence present at the 5′ ends of cDNAs 2–4. We hypothesized that this 23-nucleotide sequence was upstream of this region, and we performed PCR using the 23-nucleotide sequence as a forward primer with a reverse primer to a sequence 3.5 kb upstream of the translation start site (i.e. −3.5 kb). Using this approach, we amplified a single product of 4.5 kb from rat genomic DNA, suggesting that the 23-nucleotide sequence in question is present in the genomic DNA approximately 8 kb upstream of the translation start site. Sequence analysis of this PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed the presence of a 5′ splice donor sequence (gtaag) at the 3′ end of the conserved 26-bp sequence found in cDNAs 2–4. We used a similar approach to locate the sequence shared by cDNAs 3 and 4, which i"
https://openalex.org/W1999410561,"The 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been implicated in modulating steroid receptor function in vitroand in vivo. Previous studies have suggested that hsp90 interacts with large portions of the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand-binding domain and sequences of the receptor required for stable DNA binding. To characterize the interaction of the ER ligand-binding domain with hsp90, we have compared the properties of chimeras created by coupling the ligand-binding domain to the constitutive transactivator VP16-GAL. Two types of chimeras were created: VP16-GAL-ERG, containing the wild-type ligand-binding domain derived from the cDNA HEG0, and VP16-GAL-ERV, containing the substitution G400V derived from the ligand-binding domain of the original ER cDNA isolate, HE0. The G400V mutation alters the physical properties of VP16-GAL-ERV by rendering it hormone-dependent for DNA binding and more strongly dependent on estradiol for transactivation compared with VP16-GAL-ERG. Glycerol gradient analyses and chemical cross-linking/coimmunoprecipitation showed that, unlike VP16-GAL-ERG, VP16-GAL-ERV formed stable complexes with hsp90 in vitro. These data show that hsp90 selectively recognizes the altered ER ligand-binding domain containing the G400V substitution and indicate that the wild-type ER ligand-binding domain of VP16-GAL-ERG does not interact with hsp90 in vitro. Hormone binding studies showed that the ligand-binding domain of VP16-GAL-ERV was destabilized by incubation in the presence of high concentrations of salt or in the absence of sodium molybdate, conditions that disrupt its interaction with hsp90. The ligand-binding domain of the Val-400 ER thus behaves similarly to that of the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor, which has previously been shown to interact with hsp90 in vitro. These results provide evidence for the action of hsp90 as a molecular chaperone by selectively recognizing destabilized proteins.

Among these accessory proteins are at least two members of the heat shock protein (hsp) family, hsp90 and hsp70, as well as members of the immunophilin family and several other receptor-associated proteins. It is thought that ligand-free steroid receptors interact directly with hsp90, stabilizing the receptor in an inactive state. The ER is a member of a large family of nuclear receptors and, as such, is a hormone-dependent transcriptional regulator. The ER has been subdivided into six functionally distinct domains on the basis of sequence homology between receptors from different species (see Fig.1) (11Krust A. Green S. Argos P. Kumar V. Walter P. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 891-897Google Scholar, 12Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Shutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). The highly conserved DNA-binding domain, encoded by region C, is composed of two zinc finger motifs, each with four conserved cysteine residues (13Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korzun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 334: 543-546Google Scholar, 14Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J.A. Gustaffson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Google Scholar). In addition to amino acids controlling site-specific DNA binding, region C contains a dimerization interface (15Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Google Scholar). Region D contains amino acids required for stable DNA binding (16Mader S. Chambon P. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1125-1132Google Scholar) and has been shown to stabilize interactions with accessory proteins (1Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Google Scholar). Region E is also well conserved and contains domains required for ligand binding as well as the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function known as AF-2 (17Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Google Scholar, 18Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Google Scholar, 19Gronemeyer H. Annu.

Region E also contains sequences responsible for the interaction between the ER and accessory proteins (1Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Google Scholar, 2Church-Landel C. Kushner P.J. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1407-1419Google Scholar, 21Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S.

Lee H.S. DeGannes C. Horsford J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12568-12577Google Scholar, 24Salomonsson M. Haggblad J. O'Malley B.W. Sitbon G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 447-452Google Scholar). An additional transactivation function (AF-1) is provided by the poorly conserved N-terminal A/B region of the receptor, which functions in a tissue- and promoter-specific context (18Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Google Scholar,25Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielan P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ligand binding induces a conformational change in the ER ligand-binding domain that releases hsp90, exposing those regions on steroid receptors required for homodimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. Thus, hsp90 is thought to play a regulatory role by controlling several of the ligand-inducible functions of receptors. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeshowed that disruption of the interaction between hsp90 and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) severely reduced the function of the GRin vivo (26Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Google Scholar, 27Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Google Scholar). Reduced expression of hsp90 strongly inhibits GR-dependent transactivation, suggesting that the GR can function properly only in the presence of hsp90. In parallel studies, however, ER-driven transactivation was less dependent on hsp90 expression, suggesting that hsp90 may be less important for controlling hormone-dependent function of the receptor in vivo. Analysis of hsp90-ER interactions has been complicated by the overlap in domains D and E between regions of the receptor required for DNA binding, homodimerization, and nuclear localization and those required for interaction with hsp90 (1Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we recently constructed a series of chimeric ERs in which the DNA-binding domain has been replaced with that of the yeast transactivator GAL4. In addition, transactivation potential was increased by replacing the N-terminal AF-1 region with the strong acidic activator VP16, derived from herpes simplex virus, creating VP16-GAL-ER chimeras. These chimeras do not interact stably with hsp90 in vitro, bind DNA in a ligand-independent manner, and yet remain hormone-dependent for transactivation (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar). The original cDNA for the ER (HE0) contains the substitution G400V (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar), which was subsequently found to destabilize the structure of the ligand-binding domain (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar, 30Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Google Scholar). This suggests that the ligand-binding domain of HE0 may be like that of the hormone-free GR, which has been shown to be unstable in the absence of hsp90 (27Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine the effect of such a destabilizing mutation on the interaction of the ER ligand-binding domain with hsp90 using VP16-GAL-ER chimeras as a model. To this end, VP16-GAL-ERVwas constructed, containing the mutation equivalent to the G400V substitution of HE0. Unlike its wild-type counterpart, VP16-GAL-ERV interacts stably with hsp90 in vitro. The mutation destabilizes the ligand-binding domain, affecting its DNA binding and transactivation properties. All chimeras were constructed in the pSG5 expression vector (31Green S. Isseman I. Scheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 361Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate regions of VP16 and GAL4 and either wild-type ER HEG0 or HE0. Duplicates of each recombinant were tested for transactivation and verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown in 3.5-cm dishes in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5–10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Lipofections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For luciferase assays, 100 ng of receptor expression vector was transfected along with 500 ng of 17M5-TATA-Luc or ERE3-TATA-Luc reporter vector and 1 μg of p610AZ-β-galactosidase expression vector for standardization. 16 h after lipofection, the medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was changed, and cells were incubated in the presence of 25 nm estradiol or ethanol vehicle for a further 20 h. Cells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). 50- and 45-μl aliquots of crude cell extracts were used for β-galactosidase and luciferase assays, respectively. For Western and gel retardation analyses, 1.0 μg of ER expression vector was transfected by lipofection along with 1.0 μg of p610AZ-β-galactosidase expression vector as an internal control. For glycerol gradients, 10 μg of ER expression vector was transfected into COS-7 cells plated in 10-cm dishes. Gradients were performed essentially as described (10Whitesall L. Cook P. Mol.

Briefly, cells from six individual 10-cm plates were scraped into 6 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing PMSF and protease inhibitors and resuspended in 1.5 volumes of TEGM buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mm sodium molybdate, and 5 mm DTT). Cells were lysed by drawing 30 times through a 25-gauge needle, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. [3H]Estradiol (Amersham Corp.) was added to a final concentration of 25 nm, and extracts were incubated for 2 h on ice. Excess [3H]estradiol was stripped away by incubation with 0.5% activated charcoal (Aldrich) and 0.05% dextran T-70 (Amersham Corp.) for 20 min on ice. Aliquots were divided in half and adjusted to 400 mm KCl where required. Samples were loaded into 10–35% glycerol gradients in TEGM buffer in the presence or absence of 400 mm KCl along with horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as sedimentation markers and centrifuged in an SW 55Ti rotor at 49,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Samples were collected in 150-μl aliquots, and 50 μl was assayed by scintillation counting. 75-μl samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels to detect the fractional localization of horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase. COS-7 cells were transfected in 10-cm plates as described above and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of PMSF. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1.5 volumes of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 30 mm sodium molybdate in the presence of PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. Cells were lysed by drawing 25–30 times through a 25-gauge needle, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of 400 mm KCl on ice for 30 min. Proteins were cross-linked by incubation with 0.1 mm N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP; PDI) for 30 min at room temperature. Excess SPDP was removed by running the extracts through a Sephadex G-50 spin column equilibrated in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Samples were treated with 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (10 min at 23 °C) to block all free SH groups that could prematurely cleave cross-links and divided into two equal aliquots. Intermolecular disulfide bonds formed during cross-linking were either reduced by incubation with 50 mmDTT for 30 min on ice or left intact. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 12 h with a mixture of the anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibodies 2GV3 and 3GV2 on ice and then for 2 h with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech AG) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). Samples were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 s, washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer supplemented with 50 mm DTT. Western analysis using the anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody SPA 835 (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) was carried out as described below. Hormone binding assays were performed essentially as described (11Krust A. Green S. Argos P. Kumar V. Walter P. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 891-897Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected as described for glycerol gradient experiments. Cells (10-cm dishes) were harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing PMSF and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended and lysed as described for glycerol gradient analysis in 100 μl of hormone binding buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitors PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) containing 10 mmsodium molybdate where indicated. Lysates were diluted to 200 μl in hormone binding buffer and clarified by centrifugation. For each binding reaction, 20-μl aliquots were diluted to 50 μl with hormone binding buffer. For preincubations with high salt, KCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mm. Aliquots were preincubated at room temperature as indicated, prior to incubation on ice for 5 h in the presence of 20 nm17β-[3H]estradiol (Amersham Corp.). To determine nonspecific binding, 4 μm estradiol was also included. Unbound estradiol was removed by incubation with 0.5% Norit-A charcoal and 0.05% dextran T-70 for 10 min and then centrifuged. Radioactive estradiol in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were harvested by combining those scraped from two or three 3-cm plates in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was carefully removed; and the pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of high salt extraction buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.3 mm DTT, 0.1 EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing at −70 °C and thawing at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice in a 10-μl final volume of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, and 20% glycerol containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and then for a further 20 min at 23 °C after the addition of 50,000–100,000 cpm (5–10 fmol) of32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. Samples were run on 5% polyacrylamide gels (20:1), which were dried prior to autoradiography. Immunoprecipitates were run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp.) and probed with an anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody (SPA 835) diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and 1% milk powder. Aliquots of extracts expressing ER chimeras were taken before or after preincubation, resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS, transferred to Hybond-C membranes, and probed with anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibodies 2GV3 and 3GV2 diluted 1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and 1% milk powder. Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (DuPont NEN). We have recently reported the construction of a series of VP16-GAL-ER fusion receptors to study the role of hsp90 interaction in modulating ER function (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar). Addition of the ER ligand-binding domain rendered constitutively active VP16-GAL partially dependent on hormone for transactivation. The VP16-GAL-ER chimeras bind DNA equally well in the presence or absence of estradiol and are at least partially nuclear in the absence of ligand (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar). More important, glycerol gradient analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies suggested that the chimeras do not interact with hsp90 in vitro (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar). Assays have thus been established to measure transactivation, DNA binding, and hsp90 association by VP16-GAL-ER chimeras. We were interested next in determining the effect on the interaction of chimeras with hsp90 of the destabilizing mutation G400V, found in the original ER cDNA, HE0 (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar). A well characterized chimera was chosen to study the functional differences between the Gly-400 and Val-400 homologues, containing ER ligand-binding domain sequences from amino acid 258 (Fig. 1). VP16-GAL-ERG and VP16-GAL-ERV are used to denote chimeras derived from HEG0 and HE0, respectively (Fig. 1). hsp90-ER chimera interactions were first probed by glycerol gradient analysis. Sedimentation profiles of full-length receptors were used as positive controls. In the presence of molybdate ions, HEG0 formed a stable complex, characteristic of its interaction with hsp90, that migrated in a glycerol gradient with a sedimentation coefficient of 8–9 S. Under high ionic strength conditions, the molybdate-stabilized complex dissociated, resulting in an “activated” ER that migrated at 4–5 S (Fig.2 A). Conversely, VP16-GAL-ERG did not exhibit a salt-dependent shift in its migration and sedimented at 4–5 S under both low and high salt conditions (Fig.2 B). To test the characteristics of Val-400 mutants, we performed identical analyses on HE0 and VP16-GAL-ERV. As expected, HE0 was found to form molybdate-stabilized, salt-sensitive 8 S complexes in vitro (Fig. 2 C). Significantly, VP16-GAL-ERV also formed a salt-sensitive 8 S complex (Fig.2 D), suggesting that hsp90 may recognize the altered ligand-binding domain of the chimera. To verify that hsp90 is indeed a component of the 8–9 S complex containing VP16-GAL-ERV, a combined chemical cross-linking/coimmunoprecipitation protocol was developed using extracts of transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing either VP16-GAL-ERV or VP16-GAL-ERG. Cells were lysed in the presence of molybdate ions under conditions in which an 8–9 S complex formed in the absence of salt. Extracts were divided into two equal aliquots; one was treated with KCl at a final concentration of 400 mm, and the other with water alone. Cellular proteins were cross-linked using the heterobifunctional cross-linker SPDP (see “Materials and Methods”). Following cross-linking, reactions were once more divided into two equal aliquots, and one was treated with 50 mm DTT to reduce the intermolecular bonds formed by SPDP. All reactions were immunoprecipitated overnight with an antibody directed against the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Following immunoprecipitation, proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with monoclonal antibody SPA 835 (raised against hsp90). A 90-kDa protein recognized by SPA 835 was precipitated along with VP16-GAL-ERV (Fig. 3, lane 1). Treatment of the extracts with DTT prior to immunoprecipitation to reduce the intermolecular cross-linker strongly decreased the amount of detectable hsp90 that coprecipitated with the chimera, indicating that hsp90 is not being precipitated nonspecifically by the anti-GAL4 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3,lane 2). In the presence of 400 mm KCl, very low amounts of hsp90 can be seen to be associated with VP16-GAL-ERV, and this faint band disappeared upon treatment with DTT (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that, in the presence of KCl, only a minute amount of hsp90 may remain associated with the receptor and is consistent with the migration of VP16-GAL-ERV at 4–5 S in glycerol gradients under these conditions (Fig. 2). While glycerol gradient analyses suggested that VP16-GAL-ERG does not interact stably with hsp90, we cannot rule out the possibility that hsp90 may interact transiently with the chimera in extracts. Chemical cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation of extracts expressing VP16-GAL-ERG were therefore performed to trap any transient binding to hsp90. Even under these conditions, no coimmunoprecipitation of hsp90 was detected from extracts incubated in the presence or absence of salt (Fig. 3,lanes 5–8). Taken together, these results indicate that hsp90 selectively recognizes ER chimeras containing the G400V substitution under low salt conditions in the presence of molybdate. Previous studies have suggested that the G400V substitution destabilizes the ER ligand-binding domain (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine the effect of salt and molybdate ions, which modulate the stability of the interaction of the ER with hsp90, on the stability of the G400V ligand-binding domain. Extracts of COS-7 cells transiently expressing either VP16-GAL-ERG or VP16-GAL-ERV were preincubated for varying times in the presence of molybdate under low or high salt conditions prior to performing hormone binding assays. The results (Fig.4 A) indicate that high salt concentrations only slightly affected the stability of the wild-type ligand-binding domain of VP16-GAL-ERG. The VP16-GAL-ERVligand-binding domain was less stable than that of VP16-GAL-ERG under low salt conditions and was significantly destabilized by high salt concentrations. In addition, the removal of molybdate from the preincubation destabilized the VP16-GAL-ERV ligand-binding domain under low salt conditions (Fig. 4 B). A control Western analysis showed that the loss of hormone binding activity in extracts containing VP16-GAL-ERV was not due to proteolytic degradation of the chimera during preincubation (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the VP16-GAL-ERV ligand-binding domain is most stable at low salt concentrations and in the presence of molybdate, conditions under which it interacts most stably with hsp90. The effect of the G400V substitution on the function of VP16-GAL-ER chimeras was analyzed by gel retardation analyses performed with cognate ERE sequences in the presence or absence of estradiol. No specific retarded complexes were formed by high salt extracts of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the parental expression vector pSG5 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2). As expected, HEG0 bound a synthetic ERE oligonucleotide in the absence of estradiol, and addition of hormone did not affect the level of DNA binding by the receptor (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, DNA binding by HE0, which contains the G400V mutation, exhibited a clear requirement for estradiol (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5and 6). VP16-GAL-ERG, like HEG0, binds to cognate DNA sequences both in the presence and absence of estradiol (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). In this respect, it is indistinguishable from the constitutive activator VP16-GAL (Fig.5 B, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, significant DNA binding by VP16-GAL-ERV was observed only in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5and 6). These results show that the chimeric ERs display DNA binding characteristics that are very similar to those of their respective full-length receptors and that the G400V mutation disrupts DNA binding in the absence of hormone by both the full-length ER HE0 and the corresponding chimera VP16-GAL-ERV. In the presence of HEG0, low but consistent levels of transactivation of an ERE-containing reporter gene were observed in the absence of estradiol. Hormone induced transactivation by 10-fold (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, no hormone-independent transactivation over background levels was observed in the presence of HE0, consistent with previous reports (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar, 30Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Google Scholar). Transactivation by HE0 was induced at least 20-fold by hormone. VP16-GAL-ERG activated a 17-mer-containing reporter gene in the absence of ligand to levels 20–30% of those seen in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, only very low levels of transactivation by VP16-GAL-ERV were observed in the absence of ligand. However, in the presence of hormone, VP16-GAL-ERV activated transcription to levels ∼40% of those seen with VP16-GAL-ERG (Fig. 6 C). Thus, in both the full-length receptor HE0 and in VP16-GAL-ERV, the G400V substitution abolished hormone-independent transactivation (Fig.6, B and D). Given the highly synergistic transactivation potential of VP16 derivatives when bound to multiple DNA elements and the observations above of hormone-dependent DNA binding, these data suggest that VP16-GAL-ERV does not bind to DNA at significant levelsin vivo in the absence of ligand. Western blot analysis using a combination of monoclonal antibodies raised against the GAL4 DNA-binding domain indicated that the differences in transactivating capabilities in the presence or absence of hormone are not due to differing levels of protein expression (Ref. 28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar and data not shown). Introduction of the G400V mutation into the ER ligand-binding domain profoundly affected its interaction with hsp90. Unlike VP16-GAL-ERG, the VP16-GAL-ERV chimera formed salt-sensitive 8 S complexes in glycerol gradients and interacted with hsp90 in cross-linking/coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figs. 2 and3). This is consistent with previous observations that hsp90 could be coimmunoprecipitated with β-galactosidase-ER ligand-binding domain chimeras derived from HE0 (21Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Google Scholar). In this respect, the isolated ligand-binding domain of the ER mutant behaved similarly to that of the wild-type GR, which interacts with hsp90 in vitro (21Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Google Scholar). The G400V substitution also significantly affected ER ligand-binding domain function. Previous results indicated that the HE0 form of the ER has a reduced affinity for ligand in vitro and that this reduction may be at least partially responsible for the observed alterations in receptor function (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar). Our gene transfer experiments (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar) and those of others (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar, 32Zhuang Y. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 457-466Google Scholar, 33Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Herman T. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 613-620Google Scholar) indicate that the wild-type ER ligand-binding domain is able to dimerize in the absence of hormone both in vitro and in vivo. The G400V mutation alters the conformation of the ER ligand-binding domain to such a degree that the full-length receptor is rendered hormone-dependent for dimerization and hence DNA binding (Fig. 5) (29Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Google Scholar, 34Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Google Scholar). Our results with chimeric receptors show that the equivalent mutation can render a heterologous DNA-binding domain, which is capable of dimerizing independently, hormone-dependent for DNA binding. This suggests that the mutated ligand-binding domain sterically hinders the function of the GAL4 dimerization function or masks the amino acids responsible for DNA recognition. The effect of the G400V mutation on the interaction with hsp90, coupled with inhibition of DNA binding in the absence of hormone, provides an explanation for the observations that both HE0 and VP16-GAL-ERV are more strongly dependent on hormone for transactivation than their wild-type counterparts. These results would be consistent with mutated receptors and their chimeric homologues being maintained more stably in a cytoplasmic complex with hsp90 than their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, any dissociated receptors would homodimerize poorly and hence not bind DNA efficiently. The conformational change induced by the G400V mutation significantly destabilized the ER ligand-binding domain. The ligand-binding domain of VP16-GAL-ERV was somewhat less stable than that of VP16-GAL-ERG under low salt conditions (Fig. 4). In addition, the ligand-binding domain of VP16-GAL-ERV, but not that of VP16-GAL-ERG, was destabilized by the addition of high salt. Similarly, the VP16-GAL-ERV ligand-binding domain was significantly less stable in the absence of sodium molybdate than in its presence. The presence of sodium molybdate and the absence of high salt are two conditions that stabilize the interaction of steroid receptors with hsp90 (1Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Google Scholar, 35Segnitz B. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2179-2183Google Scholar). These results establish a strong correlation between the interaction of VP16-GAL-ERV with hsp90 and the stabilization of its ligand-binding domain. The interaction of hsp90 with VP16-GAL-ERV is consistent with its acting as a molecular chaperone by binding to the destabilized ER ligand-binding domain. These results are important because hsp90 has only recently been recognized as a molecular chaperone (36Wiech H. Buchner R. Zimmermann R. Jacob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Google Scholar, 37Miyata Y. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7042-7047Google Scholar). They would support a model in which hsp90 selectively recognizes partially folded or partially denatured protein domains. Interestingly, hsp90 has recently been shown to stabilize the structure of the GR ligand-binding domain (27Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Google Scholar). Experiments using temperature-sensitive point mutations in the S. cerevisiae hsp90 homologue (HSP82) showed that hsp90 is required for the GR to attain a functional, ligand-inducible state. Furthermore, to remain in such a state, continuous interaction of the GR with hsp90 is required (27Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Google Scholar). The apparent instability of the GR ligand-binding domain further emphasizes its similarity to that of the HE0 form of the ER. It is noteworthy that the ER ligand-binding domain has been used to confer hormone-dependent function on the nuclear protein Fos (38Superti-Furga G. Bergers G. Picard D. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic kinase Raf-1 (39Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Google Scholar). In both cases, the ER ligand-binding domain was derived from HE0. Based on our results, one can speculate that chimeras derived from HEG0 would be more nuclear in the absence of hormone than those derived from HE0, which would fundamentally affect the function of the resulting fusion proteins. Current models of steroid receptor action suggest that aporeceptors form high molecular mass complexes with hsp90 and other proteins. These complexes are thought to keep the receptor in a stable inactive state until ligand binding frees it from hsp90. Indeed, both genetic and biochemical studies using the GR are consistent with this hypothesis (26Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Google Scholar, 27Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Google Scholar). Although cross-linking analysis suggests that the ER also forms complexes with hsp90 in vivo (35Segnitz B. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2179-2183Google Scholar), several experiments have suggested that at least a portion of the hormone-free ER is nuclear and capable of binding DNA (32Zhuang Y. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 457-466Google Scholar, 33Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Herman T. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 613-620Google Scholar, 40Ishibashi T.

Cytochem. 1985; 33: 915-924Google Scholar) and that hsp90 may not be essential for ER function (26Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that HEG0 interacts with hsp90 in vivo, but that this interaction is transient, resulting in dissociation, homodimerization, and nuclear transport of aporeceptors. Glycerol gradient and combined cross-linking/coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figs. 2 and 3) did not provide any evidence that the wild-type ER ligand-binding domain interacts transiently or stably with hsp90. Previous results have shown that the isolated wild-type GR ligand-binding domain can interact with hsp90 in vitro (21Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Google Scholar). These results provide support for the idea that the ER binds less stably to hsp90 than the GR. While our present and previous results (28Lee H.S. Aumais J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25727-25730Google Scholar) and those of others (26Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R.

Pfahl M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 613-620Google Scholar) suggest that hsp90 may not be essential for controlling the function of the native wild-type ER, it may be important for correct folding of the receptor. Genetic studies in yeast showed that reduced hsp90 levels compromised ER function, although not to the same degree as GR function. hsp90 may therefore be necessary to reduce the levels of partially folded or misfolded ER, which, once correctly folded, dissociates from the chaperone and translocates to the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W1987397867,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes and may function as positive effectors as well as negative regulators of intracellular signaling. Recent data demonstrate that malignant transformation of cells is frequently associated with changes in PTP expression or activity. Our analysis of PTP expression in mammary carcinoma cell lines resulted in the molecular cloning of a receptor-like PTP, also known as DEP-1. DEP-1 was found to be expressed at varying levels in mammary carcinoma cell lines and A431 cells. In all tumor cell lines analyzed, DEP-1 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of DEP-1 increased significantly after treatment of cells with the PTP inhibitor pervanadate. In A431 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of DEP-1 was also observed after stimulation with epidermal growth factor, however, only after prolonged exposure of the cells to the ligand, suggesting an indirect mechanism of phosphorylation. In addition, DEP-1 coprecipitated with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from pervanadate-treated cells.In vitro binding experiments using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the catalytically inactive PTP domain of DEP-1 (Gst-DEP-1-C/S) identify these proteins as potential substrates of DEP-1. In addition, we found a 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase to be constitutively associated with DEP-1 in all tumor cell lines tested. The 64-kDa kinase forms a stable complex with DEP-1 and phosphorylates DEP-1 and DEP-1-interacting proteinsin vitro. These data suggest a possible mechanism of DEP-1 regulation in tumor cell lines involving serine/threonine and/or tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes and may function as positive effectors as well as negative regulators of intracellular signaling. Recent data demonstrate that malignant transformation of cells is frequently associated with changes in PTP expression or activity. Our analysis of PTP expression in mammary carcinoma cell lines resulted in the molecular cloning of a receptor-like PTP, also known as DEP-1. DEP-1 was found to be expressed at varying levels in mammary carcinoma cell lines and A431 cells. In all tumor cell lines analyzed, DEP-1 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of DEP-1 increased significantly after treatment of cells with the PTP inhibitor pervanadate. In A431 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of DEP-1 was also observed after stimulation with epidermal growth factor, however, only after prolonged exposure of the cells to the ligand, suggesting an indirect mechanism of phosphorylation. In addition, DEP-1 coprecipitated with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from pervanadate-treated cells.In vitro binding experiments using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the catalytically inactive PTP domain of DEP-1 (Gst-DEP-1-C/S) identify these proteins as potential substrates of DEP-1. In addition, we found a 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase to be constitutively associated with DEP-1 in all tumor cell lines tested. The 64-kDa kinase forms a stable complex with DEP-1 and phosphorylates DEP-1 and DEP-1-interacting proteinsin vitro. These data suggest a possible mechanism of DEP-1 regulation in tumor cell lines involving serine/threonine and/or tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues is a key mechanism in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is controlled by two families of enzymes: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTP, receptor PTP; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, EGF receptor; Gst, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein. (1Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Google Scholar) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (2Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Google Scholar, 3Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Google Scholar). In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the analysis of PTK structure and function, whereas still relatively little is known about the biological role and regulation of PTPs. Similar to PTKs, PTPs can be structurally subdivided into two classes: transmembrane receptor-like molecules (RPTPs) and cytosolic enzymes. All PTP domains contain a conserved 11-residue sequence motif that specifies the active site of the phosphatase. The conserved cysteine and arginine residues within this motif are essential for catalytic activity (4Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the RPTPs identified to date contain two tandem PTP domains, with the membrane proximal domain accounting for most of the activity (5Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8698-8702Google Scholar, 6Lau K.-H.W. Baylink D.J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 452-471Google Scholar). Within their extracellular domains, RPTPs frequently contain multiple fibronectin type III and immunoglobulin-like repeats, reminiscent of cell adhesion molecules such as neural cell adhesion molecule and fasciclin (7Saito H. Streuli M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 59-65Google Scholar, 8Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 650-657Google Scholar), suggesting that these enzymes might be regulated by cell-to-cell contact. Consistent with this structural characteristic, homophilic binding of the extracellular domains has been demonstrated for RPTP-μ and RPTP-κ (9Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Google Scholar, 10Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Google Scholar, 11Sap J. Jiang Y.P. Friedlander D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1-9Google Scholar, 12Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.-P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Google Scholar), although these interactions did not result in changes of the activity of the respective PTPs. Initial studies on the function of PTPs suggested that this class of enzymes is largely involved in negative regulation of cell growth and is needed for the termination of growth-promoting signals,i.e. after activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Experiments with PTP inhibitors supported this idea. For example, incubation of NRK cells with vanadate results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and cell transformation (13Klarlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Google Scholar). Interestingly, an increasing number of reports describe elevated expression of PTPs in tumor cell lines and tissues. For example, PTP1B was found to be highly expressed in breast cancer (14Wiener J.R. Kerns B.J. Harvey E.L. Conaway M.R. Iglehart J.D. Berchck A. Bast Jr., R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 372-378Google Scholar). The RPTP SAP-1, which is related to HPTP-β, is expressed at high levels in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, whereas its expression could not be detected in normal pancreas and colon tissue (15Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Google Scholar). Another example is PRL-1, a mitogen-induced PTP that is predominantly located in the nucleus. Transfection of PRL-1 into tissue culture cells results in cell transformation and altered growth characteristics (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the function of PTPs in cell growth and development is far more complex than previously anticipated, and that, depending on the individual phosphatase and the cellular context, PTPs may function in either a signal-promoting or inhibiting manner. We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach to identify PTPs that are expressed in mammary carcinoma cell lines. This study led to the molecular cloning of a RPTP, which is characterized by eight fibronectin type III repeats within the extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a single catalytic domain. Further analysis revealed its identity with the previously described RPTP DEP-1 (17Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that DEP-1 is expressed in various mammary carcinoma cell lines and in A431 cells. Using coprecipitation andin vitro binding experiments, we found several cellular proteins associated with DEP-1. Coprecipitating proteins were detected due to their tyrosine phosphorylation in cells treated with pervanadate or, in the case of A431 cells, with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Further analysis revealed that one of the DEP-1-associated proteins is a 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase, which specifically associates with the C terminus of the phosphatase and phosphorylates DEP-1 in vitro. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs KCAQYWP and HCSAGIG within PTP domains were used in a PCR with single-stranded cDNA, derived from mRNA isolated from the human mammary carcinoma cell line BT474 as template. An amplified ∼200-base pair PCR fragment was used to screen a human mammary cDNA library (CLONTECH). cDNA clones encoding DEP-1 were isolated using standard techniques (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). For expression in tissue culture cells, the entire DEP-1 cDNA was subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into the expression vector pCMV, resulting in the plasmid pCMV-DEP-1. For the construction of glutathione S-transferase (Gst) fusion proteins, the entire cytoplasmic domain (amino acid residues 997 to 1337), the juxtamembrane domain (amino acid residues 997 to 1059), and the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1297 to 1337), respectively, were amplified by PCR. PCR products of the expected size were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned in frame into the expression vector pGEX2T*, a derivative of pGEX2T with a modified polylinker (details of the vector are available upon request). All PCR products were verified by sequence analysis. The purification of Gst fusion proteins was done essentially as described (20Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies (anti-DEP-1 antiserum 42) were generated against a peptide corresponding to 15 amino acids of the juxtamembrane region of DEP-1 (QPKYAAELAENRGK) and affinity purified using the same peptide. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (RC20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. All cell lines used were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in media as recommended. For transient expression studies, 293 human embryonic kidney fibroblasts were transfected with CsCl gradient-purified plasmid DNA according to the protocol of Chen and Okayama (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer as described previously (22Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4357-4363Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting procedures were carried out essentially as described previously (22Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4357-4363Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, ∼10 μg of anti-DEP-1 antibodies or 10 μl of preimmune serum together with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry were added to the cleared lysates and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Precipitates were washed with 3 × 1 ml HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA), and the proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with the primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Corp.). For in vitro kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG, once with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, and 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with 10 ml of Tris buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 10 min at 23 °C. The samples were diluted with HNTG, washed once, and then mixed with SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 8.5% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, myelin basic protein (MBP) was used as exogenous substrate for in vitro phosphorylation. 10 μg of MBP/sample were added to the kinase buffer, and the reaction was carried out as described above, omitting the washing step. For the detection of protein kinase activity in in-gel kinase assays, the method described by Kameshita and Fujisawa (23Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed in HNTG buffer and fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE, with MBP (0.5 mg/ml) polymerized into the separating gel. The gel was first incubated in buffer A (20% isopropanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 2 × 30 min at room temperature) and then in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h. Proteins were denatured by incubating the gel two times for 1 h in buffer C (6m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After renaturing the proteins by incubation in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.04% Tween 40, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 16 h at 4 °C, the gel was equilibrated in buffer E (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm vanadate) for 30 min at 22 °C. The kinase reaction was done in buffer E containing 50 mm ATP and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 22 °C. The gel was washed in buffer G (5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate), dried, and exposed. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on proteins phosphorylated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the bands were identified by autoradiography. Proteins of interest were excised from the gel and eluted. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out essentially as described (24Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 397-402Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify PTPs that are expressed in mammary carcinoma cells and may be involved in the oncogenic process, we performed PCR analysis on single-stranded cDNA obtained from poly(A)+ RNA of various cell lines. The primers used for amplification correspond to the conserved amino acid sequence motifs KCAQYWP and HCSAGIG, found within PTP catalytic domains (25Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 68: 1-36Google Scholar). Screening of a human mammary cDNA library with a 200-base pair PCR fragment obtained with cDNA derived from BT474 cells as template resulted in the cloning of a 4756-base pair cDNA, which contains an open reading frame of 4011 base pairs and encodes a receptor-like molecule. Data base searches revealed the identity of the isolated cDNA with DEP-1 (17Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar), a RPTP that is characterized by eight fibronectin type III repeats within the extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a single cytoplasmic catalytic domain. The expression of DEP-1 has been demonstrated to be regulated by cell density, with the protein levels of DEP-1 increasing in dense relative to sparse cultures, and it has been suggested that DEP-1 might be involved in regulation of contact inhibition (17Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar). Because the loss of contact inhibition is one of the characteristics of transformed cells, we analyzed the expression of DEP-1 in a series of mammary carcinoma cell lines as well as in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. DEP-1 was detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-DEP-1 antiserum 42, which we raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1055 to 1068 of the phosphatase (Fig. 1). For the analysis of DEP-1 expression, cells were lysed when the cultures had just reached confluency. In all tumor cell lines tested, DEP-1 protein was readily detectable. In repeated experiments, MDA-MB231, T47D, and MDA-MB453 cells exhibited the highest levels of DEP-1 expression among the cell lines tested. Given the previous report on density-dependent expression of DEP-1 in WI-38 and AG1518 cells (17Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Google Scholar), we analyzed the influence of cell density on the expression of DEP-1 in A431 cells and HBL100 mammary carcinoma cells. For both cell lines, cell density had no significant influence on DEP-1 protein levels, as detected by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). As a first step to further analyze DEP-1 on a molecular level, we asked if DEP-1 was associated with other cellular proteins. The identification of proteins interacting with DEP-1 or of potential substrates could give further clues regarding the function and regulation of this phosphatase. We tried to detect proteins that could be directly coprecipitated with DEP-1 from different tumor cell lines. As a means to visualize DEP-1 coprecipitating proteins, we incubated the cells with pervanadate prior to lysis. Pervanadate is a potent membrane-permeable PTP inhibitor (26Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Google Scholar,27Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with pervanadate results in high level phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues and allows the detection of proteins by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot, even if their tyrosine phosphorylation is subject to rapid turnover under normal growth conditions (28Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Google Scholar). A431, DU4475, and MDA-MB231 cells were incubated with 100 mm pervanadate prior to lysis, followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-DEP-1 antiserum 42 and then by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 A (upper panel), a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 190 kDa was specifically detected in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated cells. This protein was not detected when preimmune serum (NS) was used for immunoprecipitation. Similarly, this protein was absent when anti-DEP-1 antibodies were preincubated with the peptide antigen before addition to the cell lysate (data not shown). Reprobing the same blot with anti-DEP-1 antibodies further confirmed the identity of p190 (Fig.2 A, lower panel). We consistently observed the presence of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). As for DEP-1, these proteins could not be detected when preimmune serum was used for the immunoprecipitations. For A431 cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular weights of M r 58,000–60,000, 60,000–63,000, 120,000 and 170,000 were detected. With the exception of the 170-kDa protein, the pattern observed for MDA-MB231 cells was very similar, although the signal intensities for these proteins in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were much weaker. In anti-DEP-1 precipitates from lysates of DU4475 cells, all of the above proteins plus an additional phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 105 kDa were detected. When the proteins in the lysates of pervanadate-treated cells were denatured by boiling in the presence of SDS prior to immunoprecipitation with 42 antibodies, only tyrosine-phosphorylated DEP-1 could be detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates. This indicates that the anti-DEP-1 antibody has no cross-reactivity with the DEP-1-associated proteins (data not shown). When pervanadate treatment was omitted, constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of DEP-1 was observed in all cell lines used for this study (data not shown and Fig. 3 A). However, no other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from lysates of untreated cells. To confirm these results and to address the question of whether tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is required for the interaction with DEP-1, we performed in vitro binding experiments using DEP-1 fusion proteins with Gst as affinity matrix. For this analysis, we used fusion proteins containing the complete intracellular domain of DEP-1 (Gst-DEP-1). In Gst-DEP-1-C/S, the active site cysteine residue had been exchanged for serine, resulting in an enzymatically inactive phosphatase. When lysates of pervanadate-treated DU4475 cells were incubated with the fusion proteins, only Gst-DEP-1-C/S precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.2 B). As judged by molecular weight, the profile of precipitated proteins detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots was essentially identical to the one observed previously in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from DU4475 cell lysates (compare Fig.2 A). However, because antibodies to these proteins are not yet available, we cannot directly test for the identity of the proteins detected in these two assays. The specific detection of the tyrosine-phosphorylated versions of DEP-1-associated proteins in Gst-DEP-1-C/S but not in Gst-DEP-1 precipitates suggests that these proteins are potential substrates of DEP-1. When the enzymatic activity of the wild-type fusion protein, Gst-DEP-1, was blocked by incubation with vanadate before addition to the cell lysate, two of the observed tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, p120 and p72, were coprecipitated. Vanadate exerts its inhibiting effect on PTPs through interacting with the thiolate anion of the active site cysteine residue, and thus blocks binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates (28Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Google Scholar). Consequently, the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 and p72 in precipitates of vanadate-treated Gst-DEP-1 is most likely the result of constitutive binding of these proteins to sites outside the active center of the phosphatase and inhibition of DEP-1 catalytic activity by vanadate. The failure to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated p105, p62, and p50 under these conditions suggests that these proteins primarily interact with DEP-1 through binding of phosphorylated tyrosine residues with the active site, which would be blocked in the presence of vanadate. Because vanadate specifically interacts with the active site cysteine residue, preincubation of Gst-DEP-1-C/S with vanadate has no significant influence on the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates (Fig. 2 B). In all tumor cell lines used in this study, we found DEP-1 to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Mammary carcinomas and mammary carcinoma cell lines frequently exhibit high levels of expression of RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) or p185HER2/neu (c-erbB2) (29Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Google Scholar, 30Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Google Scholar, 31Ro J. North S.M. Gallik G.E. Hortobagyi G.N. Gutterman J.U. Blick M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 161-164Google Scholar, 32van den Vijver M.J. Nusse R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 33-50Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether DEP-1 was a direct or indirect target of RTKs. Because the highest levels of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in A431 cells, which overexpress the EGF-R, we investigated whether DEP-1 was a substrate for this RTK. We analyzed the phosphorylation state of DEP-1 in this cell line after stimulation with EGF. As shown in Fig. 3 A, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of DEP-1 as well as associated proteins was observed only after stimulation of A431 cells with EGF for 30 min. Shorter periods of stimulation had no significant effect on DEP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. After incubation of cells for 1 h with EGF, tyrosine phosphorylation of DEP-1 returned back to the basal level (data not shown). The kinetics of EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation suggested that DEP-1 was not directly phosphorylated by the EGF-R, which was confirmed by coexpression experiments in 293 human embryonic kidney fibroblasts. 293 cells also express endogenous EGF-R as well as low but detectable levels of DEP-1, 2J. Zachwieja and B. Jallal, unpublished observation. which makes this cell line suitable for this analysis. EGF stimulation of cells cotransfected with DEP-1 and EGF-R had no detectable effect on DEP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas pervanadate treatment of DEP-1-overexpressing cells resulted in significant phosphorylation of DEP-1 on tyrosine residues (Fig.3 B, upper panel). Reprobing the blot with anti-DEP-1 antibodies confirmed expression in all samples (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). This result suggests that A431 cells, and possibly other cell lines used in this study, express a protein-tyrosine kinase the activity of which may be stimulated by RTKs and which is able to phosphorylate DEP-1, and that this kinase may not be expressed to significant levels in 293 cells. To further elucidate the nature of the DEP-1-associated proteins, we tested if one of these was a PTK itself. To this end, DEP-1 was precipitated from the lysates of different tumor cell lines and subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction using [γ-32P]ATP. After extensive washing, the phosphoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 A, DEP-1 precipitated from lysates of A431, MDA-MB231, and DU4475 cells coimmunoprecipitated with a protein kinase activity. In addition to DEP-1 itself, according to its mobility on SDS-PAGE, several other phosphoproteins were detected. The most prominent bands detected correspond to proteins of 120 kDa (p120), 72 kDa (p72), 62 kDa (p62), and 50 kDa (p50) (compare Fig. 2). When pervanadate pretreatment was omitted, identical patterns of phosphorylated proteins were detectable after in vitro kinase reactions, although with reduced signal intensity (data not shown). To further characterize the associated protein kinase, anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from A431, DU4475, and MDA-MB231 cells were analyzed by an in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 4 B). For all of three cell lines, a protein kinase with an apparent molecular weight of M r 64,000 (p64) was detected in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates, whereas no kinase activity was present in precipitates with preimmune serum. To determine the amino acid specificity of the protein kinase activity present in DEP-1 immune complexes, we used MBP as exogenous substrate. After washing the anti-DEP-1 immune complexes, MBP was added to the precipitates, and in vitro kinase assays were performed (Fig. 5, upper panel). Following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, the band corresponding to MBP was excised from the gel, eluted, and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 5, lower panel). Phosphorylation was found in serine and threonine residues, whereas no phosphorylation of tyrosine residues was detected. In similar experiments, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis on individual DEP-1-associated proteins from DU4475 cells after in vitro kinase reactions and SDS-PAGE. For all proteins analyzed, including DEP-1, only serine and threonine phosphorylation was detected (data not shown). To identify the binding site of the DEP-1-associated kinase, we used Gst-fusion proteins containing the juxtamembrane and the C-terminal domain of DEP-1, respectively, as affinity matrices. Binding of the 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase to DEP-1 or DEP-1-Gst fusion proteins was detected by an in-gel kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 6, kinase activity was recovered in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates as well as in precipitates with the DEP-1 C-terminal Gst-fusion protein. No binding of the kinase to either Gst alone or the fusion protein containing the juxtamembrane domain of DEP-1 was detected. These data demonstrate that the C-terminal tail is sufficient for binding of the 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase to DEP-1. PTKs and PTPs play critical roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and changes in the activity of both classes of enzymes may contribute to malignant transformation of cells and the development of cancer. A possible involvement of PTPs in contact inhibition was proposed by Pallan and Tong (33Pallan C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Google Scholar), who observed that the PTP activity in the membranes of contact-inhibited Swiss 3T3 cells was increased 8-fold compared with proliferating cells. We analyzed the expression of DEP-1 in various mammary carcinoma cell lines as well as in A431 cells. In all cell lines tested, DEP-1 expression was readily detectable by immunoblot analysis. We also observed that expression of DEP-1 is not up-regulated in denseversus sparse cultures of A431 and HBL100 cells. Keaneet al. (34Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243Google Scholar) recently analyzed the expression of DEP-1 in breast cancer cell lines undergoing sodium butyrate-induced differentiation. Although the expression of DEP-1 was up-regulated in differentiating ZR75–1 and SKBr-3 cells, no significant influence of cell density on DEP-1 expression was observed (34Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243Google Scholar). To further address the involvement of DEP-1 in contact inhibition, density-dependent expression of DEP-1 must be studied in more detail in a larger number of different cell types. In all tumor cell lines analyzed, we found DEP-1 to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation increased significantly after incubation of the cells with pervanadate or, in A431 cells, after stimulation with EGF. However, two lines of evidence suggest that DEP-1 is not a direct target for phosphorylation by the EGF-R: (a) the relatively long-time A431 cells had to be stimulated with EGF to increase DEP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and is indicative of a secondary response; and (b) when DEP-1 and EGF-R were coexpressed in 293 fibroblasts, EGF-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphatase could not be detected. Thus, the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of DEP-1 in A431 cells is presumably mediated by a PTK distinct from the EGF-R, but one that can be activated in response to EGF stimulation. We do not yet know if the observed constitutive phosphorylation is mediated by the same or a second kinase. We demonstrate that the RPTP DEP-1 is associated with several cellular proteins. Initially, we detected DEP-1-associated proteins due to their tyrosine phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated cells and their specific coprecipitation with DEP-1. The increase in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated cells is a direct result of the active PTKs present in a given cell line and the simultaneous inhibition of cellular PTPs (28Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Google Scholar). Thus, the differences observed in the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coprecipitating with DEP-1 from different cell lines could reflect either differences in the expression of these proteins or differences in the repertoire of PTKs expressed in the cell lines tested. The analysis of DEP-1-interacting proteins from DU4475 cells using Gst-DEP-1 fusion proteins as affinity matrix resulted in the recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of comparable molecular weight as the ones observed in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates. The specific interaction with the catalytically inactive Gst-DEP-1-C/S suggests that these proteins are potential targets for dephosphorylation by DEP-1. Although tyrosine-phosphorylated p105, p62, and p50 most likely bind to the active site of the phosphatase, consistent with the idea of being substrates of DEP-1, we could demonstrate that DEP-1 also engages in protein-protein interactions that require binding determinants other than the catalytic center. For proteins from DU4475 cells, this is the case for p120, p72, and the 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase. For the 64-kDa kinase (see below), we could localize the binding site to the C-terminal tail of DEP-1. The mode of interaction of these proteins with DEP-1 could indicate that they are involved in the regulation of DEP-1 activity or function. We attempted to identify the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates DEP-1 by analyzing if this kinase was one of the proteins coprecipitating with DEP-1. However, no tyrosine kinase activity could be detected in anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates. Instead, we found that DEP-1 is constitutively associated with a serine/threonine kinase (p64). Further analysis revealed that the 64-kDa kinase is capable of phosphorylating DEP-1 as well as associated proteins in vitro. Interestingly, anti-DEP-1 immunoprecipitates from A431 and DU4475 cells contain a 62-kDa protein that is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in pervanadate cells but only weakly phosphorylated inin vitro kinase assays. Because of the lack of specific antibodies, we presently cannot verify the identity of this protein with the 64-Da serine/threonine kinase. Phosphorylation of PTPs on serine and/or tyrosine residues has been described, but in only a few cases could these phosphorylation events be correlated with changes in the catalytic activity of the respective phosphatase. For example, the cytosolic enzyme PTP-PEST is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation, which results in reduced substrate affinity (35Garton A.A.J. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3763-3771Google Scholar). Yamada et al. (36Yamada A. Streuli M. Saito H. Rothstein D.M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1655-1660Google Scholar) have shown that CD45 phosphorylation in response to PKC activation results in down-regulation of PTP activity. Conversely, phosphorylation of CD45 on a C-terminal tyrosine residue by p50csk resulted in activation of the phosphatase and created a binding site for p56lck (37Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Google Scholar). Stover and Walsh (38Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Google Scholar) analyzed the influence of phosphorylation on CD45 activity in vitro and found that sequential phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues is necessary for activation. It is tempting to speculate that also the activity of DEP-1 can be modulated by serine/threonine and/or tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that ectopic overexpression of DEP-1 can inhibit the growth of breast cancer cell lines (34Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243Google Scholar). Although all cell lines used in our study show significant levels of DEP-1 protein, these cell lines are characterized by a transformed phenotype and are not contact inhibited. It is possible that inhibition of DEP-1 by phosphorylation is one of the steps leading to cell transformation. This will have to be tested in future experiments. Of special interest in this respect will be the identification of the DEP-1-associated serine/threonine kinase. The molecular cloning of this kinase will allow a direct analysis of its influence on DEP-1 activity.

Analysis of rotary-shadowed images of these molecules shows that the full-length enzyme assumes a tripartite structure, in which a large globular core comprising the carboxyl parts of the dimeric enzyme is connected to a pair of smaller spherical masses comprising the ATPase domains of the enzyme. The linkers bridging the large globular structure and each of the smaller spheres are not visible in most of the images but appear to be sufficiently stiff to keep the relative positions of the connected parts. The angle extended by the pair of spherical masses is variable and falls in a range of 50–100° for the majority of the images. On binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog to the enzyme, this angle is significantly reduced as the two spherical masses swing into contact. These observations, together with results from previous biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the enzyme, provide a sketch of the molecular architecture and conformational states of a catalytically active type II DNA topoisomerase.

These observations, together with results from previous biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the enzyme, provide a sketch of the molecular architecture and conformational states of a catalytically active type II DNA topoisomerase. Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of one double-stranded DNA segment through another. In this reaction, a dimeric enzyme cleaves a double-stranded DNA segment to create an opening or gate in it for the enzyme-mediated passage of a second double-stranded DNA segment; the enzyme rejoins the severed DNA strands following the passage of the second DNA segment to complete a reaction cycle. Together with the type I DNA topoisomerases, which transiently cleave one DNA strand at a time for the passage of another strand, these enzymes participate in a number of vital cellular processes that require disentanglement of DNA, for example, in the segregation of newly replicated pairs of intertwined chromosomes (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar). The complex set of reactions in the manipulation of DNA duplexes by a type II DNA topoisomerase is coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP at a specific site in each half of a dimeric enzyme. Studies using nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, such as the β,γ-imido derivative AMPPNP, 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, adenylyl-imidophosphate; Gyr, gyrase; Top, topoisomerase. implicate that the binding of ATP to a DNA-bound type II topoisomerase is sufficient to trigger a cascade of events leading to the transport of one DNA duplex through another; hydrolysis of ATP and release of the resulting ADP and orthophosphate are required only for enzyme turnover (2Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been carried out in the past two decades to deduce how a type II DNA topoisomerase catalyzes these intricate reactions. In our laboratories, most of the mechanistic studies were carried out with DNA topoisomerase II of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a protein containing two identical polypeptides with 1429 amino acid residues in each. Because all type II DNA topoisomerases are closely related, the yeast enzyme serves as a model for all other members of this subfamily of topoisomerases. Based mainly on the sequence homologies between the yeast enzyme and the two subunits GyrA and GyrB of Escherichia coli gyrase, various segments of the yeast enzyme have been termed the “GyrA” region (residues 660–1429), the “GyrB” region (residues 1–660), the ATPase domain (residues 1–410), the B′-fragment (residues 410–660), and the A′-fragment (residues 660–1200), as outlined in Fig.1. It has been shown that the C-terminal 260 amino acid residues of the yeast enzyme is dispensable for activity, and hence a GyrB fragment joined to an A′-fragment constitutes a fully active enzyme in vitro (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar). A molecular picture of an active yeast DNA topoisomerase II has emerged from a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the enzyme (3Roca J. Wang J. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar, 4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar, 5Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Google Scholar). The enzyme can be viewed as an ATP-modulated clamp with two sets of jaws at opposite ends of a homodimeric protein. The crystal structure of a 92-kDa yeast enzyme fragment spanning amino acids 410–1202 shows that the two A′-fragments form a V-shaped dimer through contacts between residues 1030–1130 of the two protomers (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar). This dimer interface represents contacts between one set of the jaws, which form the “C gate” of the enzyme, so named because residues forming this interface are close to the C terminus of the A′-fragments. There is a pair of symmetry-related semicircular grooves near the top of the V-shaped A′2-dimer, which have been postulated to bind the DNA segment within which a transient opening or gate is to be introduced for the passage of a second DNA double helix. The DNA segment containing the gate has been termed the G segment, and the second DNA segment has been termed the T segment. In the 92-kDa crystal, a pair of B′-fragments form a dimeric arch to cap the V-shaped A′2-dimer, enclosing a large hole (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar). The ATPase domain is absent in the fragment. The structure of this domain is most likely to resemble, however, that of its counterpart inE. coli gyrase, which has been determined to a resolution of 2.5 Å by x-ray crystallography (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar). Significantly, in the presence of AMPPNP the 43-kDa E. coli GyrB N-terminal fragment is dimeric in the crystal (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar) as well as in solution (7Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Google Scholar). In the absence of the nucleotide, the fragment was found to be monomeric in solution (7Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Google Scholar). The dimer contacts in the crystal structure of the 43-kDa E. coli GyrB fragment are made primarily between a 15-amino acid arm of each monomer and the opposite monomer (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar). Because AMPPNP binding is known to convert yeast DNA topoisomerase II to the closed clamp form inaccessible to a DNA ring (3Roca J. Wang J. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar), the AMPPNP-modulated dimerization between the N-terminal domains of E. coli GyrB suggests strongly that the N-terminal ATPase domains of yeast DNA topoisomerase II form the entrance gate of the enzyme. This gate has been termed the N-terminal gate or N gate (8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Google Scholar). According to the current model (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar, 8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Google Scholar), in the reaction catalyzed by a type II DNA topoisomerase a T segment first enters through the N gate of a G segment-bound enzyme. ATP binding triggers the closure of the N gate, and the trapped T segment is forced through a transient opening in the G segment and moved into the large hole seen in the 92-kDa yeast DNA topoisomerase II fragment structure. Following this event, the two halves of the enzyme retract toward each other to rejoin the G segment. This retraction in turn reduces the size of the central hole containing the T segment and forces the expulsion of the T segment through the C gate. The enzyme is set for another round of reaction when the N gate reopens after ATP hydrolysis and product release. Recently, site-directed mutagenesis based on the crystal structure of the 92-kDa fragment of the yeast enzyme has made it possible to form reversibly a pair of disulfide bonds across the C gate (5Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Google Scholar). It was shown that locking the C gate by disulfide cross-links interferes with neither the entrance of the T segment into the enzyme nor the transport of the T segment through the G segment; exit of the T segment from the enzyme is blocked, however, in agreement with the prediction of the model (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar,8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Google Scholar). Despite several attempts, crystallization of an active type II DNA topoisomerase has been unsuccessful. Thus how the complementary GyrB and A′ parts of a functional enzyme are positioned in an active enzyme remains uncertain. This uncertainty is compounded by the very large conformational changes of the enzyme as it undergoes the various steps of a reaction cycle (3Roca J. Wang J. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar, 9Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Google Scholar, 10Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). Because of these large conformational changes, the known crystal structure of an enzyme fragment is likely to represent its structure in a particular conformation of the enzyme, and it is difficult to establish which state of the enzyme this particular structure corresponds to. We and others have therefore resorted to electron microscopy to complement the x-ray crystallographic results (11Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.H. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar, 12Vassetzky Y.S. Dang Q. Benedetti P. Gasser S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6962-6974Google Scholar, 13Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancok R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Google Scholar). We report here electron microscopic examination of the 1429-amino acid full-length yeast DNA topoisomerase II and three of its deletion derivatives: a C-terminal truncation containing amino acids 1–1202 of the enzyme, a 92-kDa fragment spanning amino acids 410–1202, which was used in the earlier crystallographic work (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar), and an A′-fragment spanning amino acid residues 660–1202. Yeast DNA topoisomerase II and its truncation derivatives were purified from cells overexpressing these proteins, as described previously (14Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Google Scholar). Working stocks of the proteins were typically 1–3 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol by volume. Samples were kept at −70 °C and thawed before use. Mica was purchased from Polysciences, and AMPPNP was purchased from Sigma. Each 10-μl sample contained approximately 500 ng of yeast DNA topoisomerase II or its truncation derivative in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm KCl, 4 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. Samples were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min. For samples containing AMPPNP, the nucleotide was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and incubation was continued for 10 min after nucleotide addition. Samples were then diluted 10-fold into 100 mm ammonium acetate and 66% glycerol, and the mixture was immediately sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica by the use of a modified airbrush (15Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Google Scholar). After drying at reduced pressure in an Edwards 306 evaporator, samples were rotary-shadowed with platinum at an angle of 7°. A thin carbon film was then deposited at an angle of 90° onto the metal-shadowed surface, and the carbon-coated replicas were floated off mica and mounted on 400-mesh copper grids (11Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.H. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar, 12Vassetzky Y.S. Dang Q. Benedetti P. Gasser S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6962-6974Google Scholar, 16Fowler W.E. Erikson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Google Scholar). Samples were observed in a Philips CM 12 electron microscope at 80 kV. For samples examined by negative staining, the protein was adsorbed onto freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. For size measurements, some of the images on enlarged electron micrographs were scanned in a scanner (Apple) and analyzed with NIH Image 1.55 software. Tropomyosin paracrystals were used as a magnification standard. Fig.2 shows a typical field of full-length yeast topoisomerase II molecules, which had been sprayed onto mica and rotary-shadowed with platinum (11Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.H. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar, 12Vassetzky Y.S. Dang Q. Benedetti P. Gasser S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6962-6974Google Scholar). Most of the molecules appear as tripartite structures with a 170-Å diameter globular core and two 80-Å diameter spherical masses (unless stated otherwise, all sizes refer to direct measurements of images without corrections for platinum grains). In the majority of the images, the two spherical masses of each structure appear to be symmetrically oriented, and a line bisecting them and the 170-Å globular core can be drawn. This line is likely to represent a molecular dyad, as the enzyme is known to be made of two identical halves. The distance between the external edges of the 170-Å core and each of the 80-Å masses is about 240–270 Å, with a distinct gap but no discernible linker between the globular bodies in most of the images. The angle extended by the symmetrically oriented 80-Å spheres from the center of the 170-Å globular core varies from near 0 to about 180°, and the spacing between the external edges of the pair of 80-Å spheres varies accordingly from as small as 160 to as large as 400 Å. The images of the full-length enzyme molecules can be grouped into several categories, and representative images of each category are shown in Fig. 3, 1–5. The angles extended by the pair of smaller spherical masses of images shown in Fig. 3, 1, are in the range of 160–180°, and those in Fig. 3, 2, are in the range of 50–100°. In the images shown in Fig. 3,3, the pair of smaller masses are in contact; in those shown in Fig. 3, 4, they are unresolved. Fig. 3, 5, shows images in which the dimeric enzyme appears to have come apart during sample treatment. Molecules represented by images shown in Fig.3, 2, were the most abundant, whereas those represented by images shown in Fig. 3, 4 and 5, constituted only several percent of the population. To identify the protein domains in the structures seen in the electron micrographs described above, we examined three truncation derivatives of yeast DNA topoisomerase II in addition to the full-length enzyme: a C-terminal truncation containing amino acid residues 1–1202, a 92-kDa fragment spanning amino acid residues 410–1202, which was used in the determination of the crystal structure (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar), and an A′-fragment spanning amino acid residues 660–1202. These truncation derivatives are designated Top2(1–1202), Top2(410–1202), and Top2 (660–1202), respectively. Panels of representative micrographs of the proteins are shown in Fig. 4. A comparison of images of the Top2(410–1202) molecules (Fig. 4,3) and those of the intact enzyme and the C-terminal truncation Top2(1–1202) (Fig. 4, 1 and 2, respectively) shows that the diameter of the 80-Å spherical masses is much reduced by the removal of the N-terminal 409 amino acids of yeast DNA topoisomerase II. From these observations, it is clear that the two 80-Å spherical bodies in the images of intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II represent the N-terminal domains of the dimeric enzyme. Each 80-Å sphere probably contains the bulk of the N-terminal half of the intact enzyme (the GyrB half). In the Top2(410–1202) images, the 80-Å spherical masses are largely absent, and instead two minute dots appear to extend from the globular core. Removal of the C-terminal 230 amino acids of the intact enzyme, on the other hand, results in no major change in the dimension of either the 170-Å globular core or the 80-Å spherical masses (Fig. 4, 1 and 2). Thus the C-terminal 230 residues of the full-length enzyme are likely to be within the general confines of the 170-Å core and do not form protruding appendages. Whereas the 170-Å core in the images of intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II and its truncation derivatives Top2(1–1202) and Top2(410–1202) showed no distinctive classes of shapes, two major classes of images of Top2(660–1202) are discernible. Fig. 5 depicts a representative field of rotary-shadowed molecules of the protein. In about one-quarter of the images, the molecules show distinct V-shaped forms with varying angles between the arms (the top two and lower left images of the quartet shown in Fig. 4). These forms are in accordance with that of the A′2-dimer in the crystal structure (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar) and that of rotary-shadowed E. coli GyrA dimers in earlier electron micrographs (11Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.H. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar). Whereas differences in these images could be caused by molecules of the same shape but oriented differently on the mica surface, it is more likely that they correspond to molecules with different angles between the two arms of the V; the latter interpretation is more consistent with the observation that in images of this class the height of the V correlates inversely with its width. In the remaining three-quarters of the images, the expected pair of arms of each dimer are not resolved, and many of the molecules appear to be wedge shaped with a central indentation at the top. These images have a width of about 170 Å at the top and a height of about 150 Å (Fig. 4, lower right panels). The dimensions of the Top2(660–1202) molecules are consistent with the assignment of the 170-Å globular core of the tripartite structures of full-length yeast DNA topoisomerase II and its truncation derivatives Top2(1–1202) and Top2(410–1202) as the A′2-part of the enzyme. In the absence of AMPPNP, the majority of the rotary-shadowed images is of the category shown in Fig. 3, 2. The two 80-Å spheres extend from the larger globular core with an angular displacement between 50 and 100°. On incubation of the enzyme with AMPPNP, the major population seen is that represented by the images shown in Fig.3, 3, in which the two 80-Å spherical masses appear to contact each other. The presence of AMPPNP also reduces the abundance of images represented by those shown in Fig. 3, 1, in which the pairs of 80-Å satellites in the tripartite structures are nearly 180° apart, and increases that represented by images shown in Fig. 3,4, in which the satellite pairs are unresolved. Results from quantitating the distributions of yeast topoisomerase II molecules in the absence and presence of the nucleotide are summarized in Fig.6. From results presented above, it is clear that the large globular structure in the tripartite images of full-length yeast DNA topoisomerase II molecules corresponds to the C-terminal or GyrA part of the enzyme. Similarly, each of the 80-Å satellites in a tripartite structure must contain the N-terminal or GyrB part of the yeast DNA topoisomerase II polypeptide. The precise polypeptide stretches that form the 80- and 170-Å bodies are less certain. Because the images of the Top2(410–1202) but not the Top2(660–1202) molecules show clearly a pair of small dots extending out of the large globular core, the 80-Å sphere must contain at least the N-terminal 410 amino acid residues and probably a significantly longer stretch. By the same reasoning, the 170-Å globular core is likely to contain the bulk of the C-terminal region past residue 660 of the enzyme but probably not the B′-polypeptide spanning residues 410–660. Otherwise, it would be difficult to interpret the presence of the pair of minute satellites in the tripartite images of Top2(410–1202). In the crystal structure of yeast Top2(410–1202), each dimer has overall dimensions of 120 × 120 × 50 Å, and the B′-fragments (residues 410–660) form a compact dimeric arch to cap the opening of the V-shaped A′2-dimer. Whereas the B′-fragments form an integral part of the heart-shaped Top2(410–1202) dimer in the crystal structure, the images of Top2(410–1202) molecules in the electron micrographs suggest that they may extend away from the A′2-dimer through a linker. It is likely that the differences in structures seen in the crystal and in the electron microscope reflect differences in molecular conformations of the enzyme. The actual dimension of the 170-Å globular core in images of the full-length yeast enzyme or Top2(410–1202), after correction for the estimated average platinum grain size of about 20 Å, is around 130 Å. This size suggests that the 120 × 120 × 50-Å disclike core of yeast DNA topoisomerase II is more likely to lie flat rather than on its side on the mica surface. Whereas the linker between the 80- and 170-Å masses of the tripartite structures of full-length yeast DNA topoisomerase II and Top2(1–1202) is invisible in the electron micrographs, which suggests a low mass/length ratio, it nevertheless appears to be sufficiently stiff to keep the general shape of the tripartite structures; the two 80-Å spheres are usually symmetrically positioned relative to the globular core. There is a remarkable change in the appearance of the rotary-shadowed yeast DNA topoisomerase II molecules on AMPPNP binding to the enzyme prior to electron microscopy (Fig. 6). In the majority of the images of the enzyme in the presence of the nucleotide, the two 80-Å spheres came into contact. This AMPPNP-modulated structural change is consistent with the known dimerization of the N-terminal domains ofE. coli GyrB protein on AMPPNP binding (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Google Scholar, 7Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Google Scholar) and the conversion of the open clamp form of yeast DNA topoisomerase II to the closed clamp form by AMPPNP (3Roca J. Wang J. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar). In a previous examination of rotary-shadowed bacterial gyrase, no major change in molecular shape was observed after addition of AMPPNP (11Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.H. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar). This discrepancy was probably due to the presence of a large fraction of inactive enzyme molecules in the sample used in the earlier work. The large global conformational change accompanying the binding of AMPPNP to the yeast enzyme requires the presence of hinges and/or flexible linkers in the dimeric protein and may involve significant structural changes within particular regions of the polypeptide. It was previously observed that AMPPNP binding to the yeast enzyme changes the sites of cleavage by endoproteinase SV8: a strong cleavage site after Glu-480 disappears and a new cleavage site after Glu-680 appears (9Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Google Scholar). There is probably sufficient flexibility in the dimeric enzyme to permit the two N-terminal ATPase domains to swing into contact in the absence of ATP, and the binding of ATP to the enzyme presumably triggers a conformational change that stabilizes the closed clamp form of the enzyme. The present findings are generally in agreement with those of Schultzet al. (13Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancok R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Google Scholar). Their examination of negatively stained human and yeast DNA topoisomerase II by scanning transmission electron microscopy led to the conclusion that a type II topoisomerase is made of a larger core comprising the C-terminal parts of the pair of polypeptides and two smaller, symmetrically located bodies comprising the N-terminal portions of the polypeptides. Furthermore, the binding of AMPPNP was found to move the two smaller bodies toward each other. There are, however, some quantitative differences between their results and ours. The dimensions of the negatively stained molecules in their work are in general smaller than those of the rotary-shadowed molecules in our work. These differences can be attributed to a combination of two factors: the finite grain size in shadowing, which exaggerates molecular sizes, and the negative and positive staining occurring with uranyl acetate penetration into the protein domains, which may reduce their apparent sizes. We had also examined yeast DNA topoisomerase II adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. In our negatively stained images, the majority of the molecules appeared as a four-dot structure with a large central hole (not shown), suggesting that the two halves of the homodimeric protein had come apart during staining. Human DNA topoisomerase IIa is apparently more resistant to the staining treatment, and fewer molecules showed a split large globular core in the micrographs of Schultz et al. (13Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancok R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Google Scholar). In conclusion, the electron microscopic images of yeast DNA topoisomerase II reveal a remarkable tripartite structure with a large dimeric core and a pair of smaller spherical masses comprising the ATPase domains of the enzyme. The two globular bodies are bridged to each other by a pair of linkers, which, although invisible in the micrographs, appear to be sufficiently stiff to keep the globular bodies properly oriented and yet flexible enough to accommodate large conformational changes of the enzyme during its reaction cycle. These results, when combined with results obtained by biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, provide new insights on the molecular architecture and conformational states of a type II DNA topoisomerase.

https://openalex.org/W1983642713,"Members of the L1 family of homophilic neural cell adhesion molecules are thought to play an important role in nervous system development and function. It is also suggested that L1 is a direct target of ethanol in fetal alcohol syndrome, since ethanol inhibits the aggregation of cultured cells expressing L1 (Ramanathan, R., Wilkemeyer, M. F., Mittel, B., Perides, G., and Charness, M. E. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 133, 381–390). If ethanol acts directly on the homophilic adhesive function of the L1 molecule, then inhibition of aggregation by ethanol should be observed in any cell type that expresses L1. Here we examined the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol on the aggregation ofDrosophila S2 cells that expressed either neuroglian (theDrosophila homolog of L1) or human L1. The aggregation of these S2 cells is known to be solely dependent on the homophilic interactions between L1 or neuroglian molecules. Neither cell adhesion molecule was affected when cell aggregation assays were carried out in the presence of ≥38 mm ethanol. The recruitment of membrane skeleton assembly at sites of cell-cell contact (a transmembrane signaling function of human L1) was also unaffected by the presence of ethanol. Thus the previously described inhibition of cell adhesion by ethanol in L1-expressing cells cannot be explained by a simple direct effect on the adhesive activity of L1 family members. Members of the L1 family of homophilic neural cell adhesion molecules are thought to play an important role in nervous system development and function. It is also suggested that L1 is a direct target of ethanol in fetal alcohol syndrome, since ethanol inhibits the aggregation of cultured cells expressing L1 (Ramanathan, R., Wilkemeyer, M. F., Mittel, B., Perides, G., and Charness, M. E. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 133, 381–390). If ethanol acts directly on the homophilic adhesive function of the L1 molecule, then inhibition of aggregation by ethanol should be observed in any cell type that expresses L1. Here we examined the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol on the aggregation ofDrosophila S2 cells that expressed either neuroglian (theDrosophila homolog of L1) or human L1. The aggregation of these S2 cells is known to be solely dependent on the homophilic interactions between L1 or neuroglian molecules. Neither cell adhesion molecule was affected when cell aggregation assays were carried out in the presence of ≥38 mm ethanol. The recruitment of membrane skeleton assembly at sites of cell-cell contact (a transmembrane signaling function of human L1) was also unaffected by the presence of ethanol. Thus the previously described inhibition of cell adhesion by ethanol in L1-expressing cells cannot be explained by a simple direct effect on the adhesive activity of L1 family members. Human L1 and related neural cell-adhesion molecules in other vertebrates are thought to play an important role in the development and function of the nervous system. Mutations in the human L1 gene are associated with several phenotypes including hydrocephalus, macrocephaly, mental retardation, agenesis of the corpus callosum, aphasia, and adducted thumbs (1Wong E.V. Kenwrick S. Willems P. Lemmon V. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 168-172Google Scholar, 2Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Google Scholar). Studies of the L1 moleculein vitro have revealed some of the mechanisms that are likely to be responsible for its important roles in vivo. First, L1 behaves as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that promotes aggregation of L1-transfected fibroblasts (3Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Google Scholar) or latex beads that display purified L1 (4Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 193-208Google Scholar). Second, L1 adhesion transduces a signal that promotes neurite outgrowth from neurons grown on an L1 substrate (5Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Google Scholar). The pharmacological properties of L1-mediated signaling suggest that it may act through a second messenger system that involves the fibroblast growth factor receptor (6Williams E.J. Doherty P. Turner G. Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 883-892Google Scholar, 7Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Google Scholar). Third, L1-mediated adhesion induces ankyrin assembly specifically at sites of cell-cell contact (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). There is a direct interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of L1 family members and ankyrin (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar, 10Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Google Scholar), and the regulation of this interaction by cell adhesion may contribute to the adhesion-based signal for neurite outgrowth. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a clinical manifestation of alcohol abuse in pregnant women (11Abel E.L. Sokol R.J. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1987; 19: 51-70Google Scholar). Charness et al. (12Charness M.E. Safran R.M. Perides G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9304-9309Google Scholar, 13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar) noted that some of the neurological defects associated with fetal alcohol syndrome overlap with the phenotype of human L1 mutations. Their studies revealed that the aggregation of cultured fibroblasts expressing human L1 is significantly inhibited by the presence of ethanol in the culture medium at concentrations comparable to blood alcohol levels reached after consuming alcoholic beverages. In one study, transfected fibroblasts constitutively expressing a cDNA-based human L1 minigene were tested for their ability to aggregate in the presence of 0–50 mm ethanol (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar). Control untransfected cells did not aggregate under any conditions. The L1-expressing cells aggregated extensively in the absence of ethanol, but their aggregation was greatly reduced in the presence of as little as 5 mmethanol. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 7 mmethanol. Based on these results, it was suggested that ethanol acts directly on the L1 molecule to inhibit its adhesive activity. One interesting implication of these results is that the L1 molecule may be a target of ethanol in vivo, thereby suggesting a mechanism through which ethanol could exert some of its pathological effects. The Drosophila cell adhesion molecule neuroglian is related to vertebrate L1 in domain structure and sequence (14Bieber A.J. Snow P.M. Hortsch M. Patel N.H. Jacobs J.R. Traquina Z.R. Schilling J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1989; 59: 447-460Google Scholar). Like L1, neuroglian exhibits homophilic cell adhesion when expressed inDrosophila S2 tissue culture cells (15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar). Neuroglian also behaves as a signal-transducing molecule that recruits assembly of the membrane cytoskeleton (ankyrin and spectrin) at sites of cell-cell contact (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar). S2 cells expressing a recombinant human L1 gene under control of the metallothionein promoter exhibit similar adhesive properties as well as the ability to recruit ankyrin to cell contacts (9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). Thus S2 cells provide a useful experimental system in which to further examine the properties of the L1/neuroglian family of cell adhesion molecules. Here we used transfected S2 cells to examine the effects of ethanol on the activities of neuroglian and human L1. Drosophila S2 cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophilamedium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. S2 cells were stably transfected with either a Drosophila neuroglian (15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar) or a human L1 transgene (9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). A complete human L1-CAM cDNA including the alternatively spliced RSLE motif in the cytoplasmic domain was kindly supplied by Dr. Vance Lemmon (16Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar). The L1 cDNA was subcloned as a 4.5-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment into the pRmHa3 vector as described by Hortsch et al. (9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). Transgene expression was induced by the addition of copper chloride to the growth medium at a final concentration of 0.7 mm for 20–24 h. Neuroglian or L1 transfected cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 4.5-cm2 12-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 20 h at 25 °C. Cultures were gently rocked for an additional 4 h to promote cell aggregation. Cells were grown in culture medium alone, medium containing 100 mm ethanol (Aaper Alcohol & Chemical Co., Shelbyville, KY), or medium diluted with an equal volume of Drosophila Ringer's solution (17Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 378Google Scholar). Evaporation of ethanol was minimized by sealing the plates with parafilm. For quantitation of aggregation, cultures were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/ml under the above conditions. Cells were carefully resuspended at 24 h and diluted 50-fold, and single cells were counted on a hemacytometer. One ml of medium containing induced neuroglian cells seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, medium alone, medium containing 50 mm ethanol, or medium containing 100 mm ethanol were placed in 12-well tissue culture plates, sealed with parafilm, and incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. A sample of the medium was sealed in a microcentrifuge tube and stored at 4 °C for 24 h as a control. A fresh sample of ethanol-containing medium was also prepared immediately before the ethanol assay as a further control for evaporation. Ethanol concentration was measured in duplicate samples with an ethanol assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibodies (used at 1:500) were mouse monoclonal anti-human L1 (5G3, Ref. 18Mujoo K. Spiro R.C. Reisfeld R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10299-12305Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal anti-neuroglian (3F4, Ref. 15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-ankyrin antibody (19Dubreuil R.R. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10285-10289Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies (used at 1:1000) included affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.), Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). Alcian blue-coated microscope slides were used to immobilize cells for staining. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and then allowed to react with cells for 2 h at room temperature. After each incubation cells were rinsed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20. Cells were mounted in Testog fluorescein isothiocyanate guard (Testog, Inc.), viewed, and photographed with an ausJena microscope using a 50× 0.95 NA Plan Apo objective. For direct analysis of aggregation, cells were transferred to microscope slides and viewed and photographed with differential interference contrast optics using a 12.5× objective. Fields were photographed on TMax 400 film and digitized with a Polaroid Sprintscan scanner. Neuroglian levels in induced cells grown in medium alone, medium containing 100 mm ethanol, and medium containing DrosophilaRinger's solution (as above) were compared in Western blots of total cellular proteins probed with anti-neuroglian antibody. Cultures were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, induced with copper chloride, and incubated for 20 h at 25 °C. Cells were centrifuged, rinsed twice in Drosophila Ringer's, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 2–3 min. Sample loadings were normalized according to protein absorbance at 280 nm. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and reacted with anti-neuroglian antibody 3F4 and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (20Dubreuil R. Byers T.J. Branton D. Goldstein L.S.B. Kiehart D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2095-2102Google Scholar). Drosophila S2 cells ordinarily grow as a single cell suspension with no stable aggregate formation. S2 cells expressing recombinant neuroglian under control of the Drosophilametallothionein promoter (15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar) form large stable aggregates within 24 h of induction with 0.7 mm copper chloride (Fig.1 A). Here we examined the effect of ethanol on the aggregation of neuroglian-expressing cells. Aggregate formation was not visibly altered when cells were induced in the presence of up to 100 mm ethanol (Fig. 1 B). Preformed cell aggregates were also unaffected by the addition of 100 mmethanol to the culture medium for 30 min (not shown). To quantify the extent of aggregation in control and ethanol-treated cultures, unaggregated cells remaining in the culture were counted with a hemacytometer 24 h after neuroglian induction. Similar numbers of single cells were detected whether or not ethanol was present in the culture medium during the aggregation assay (TableI).Table IQuantitative assay for neuroglian- and L1-mediated cell adhesionCellsTreatmentSingle cells (× 106)/mlaCultures were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/ml and at the end of the 24-h aggregation assay single cells were directly counted with a hemacytometer.

Open table in a new tab A dramatic decrease in neuroglian-mediated cell aggregation occurred when cells were grown in culture medium diluted 1:2 withDrosophila Ringer's solution (Fig. 1 C). In initial experiments, ethanol was diluted first in DrosophilaRinger's solution and then added to the neuroglian-expressing cell culture. Subsequent control experiments revealed that the inhibition of aggregation (Fig. 1 C) was due to the Ringer's solution and not the ethanol. Thus neuroglian-mediated cell adhesion was sensitive to the culture conditions but not to the presence of ethanol in the culture medium. The synthesis of neuroglian was monitored in Western blots of induced cell cultures grown in the presence and absence of ethanol orDrosophila Ringer's solution. High level expression of neuroglian was observed in response to induction with copper chloride (Fig. 2), whether ethanol was present (lane 2) or absent (lane 1). In contrast, neuroglian synthesis was significantly suppressed (∼2-fold) in cultures treated with Drosophila Ringer's solution (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, Ringer's-treated cells did form aggregates during the second day of induction (not shown) once neuroglian accumulated to a sufficient level. Thus the inhibition of adhesion caused by Ringer's solution was simply due to the slowed rate of neuroglian synthesis and not to a direct effect on neuroglian activity. One possible explanation for the lack of an ethanol effect on neuroglian-mediated adhesion is the loss of ethanol from the growth medium during prolonged incubation. The previous demonstration of an ethanol effect on human L1-mediated aggregation was carried out over a short time course (30 min; Ref. 13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar) whereas the present experiments were carried out over a 24-h time course since aggregation required induction of the neuroglian gene. The ethanol concentration during these experiments was determined by a colorimetric assay (TableII). There was a significant drop in the ethanol concentration over time from a starting concentration of 50–100 mm ethanol to a final level of 19–38 mm, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. The drop was not due to metabolism of ethanol by the S2 cells since their presence or absence did not affect the final concentration of ethanol in the medium. However, the amount of ethanol remaining after 24 h (38 mm) produced a near-maximal effect on the adhesion of L1-expressing fibroblasts in the previous study (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of an effect of ethanol in the aggregation experiments described here was not due to the loss of ethanol from the medium.Table IIEthanol evaporation during aggregation assaySampleFinal EtOH concentrationmmMedium + 50 mm EtOH18.9 ± 3.2Medium + 50 mm EtOH + cells19.4 ± 2.0Medium + 100 mm EtOH38.2 ± 4.4Medium + 100 mmEtOH (refrigerated)79.1 ± 3.7Medium + 100 mmEtOH (fresh)83.1 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab Neuroglian and human L1 are related to one another in domain organization, amino acid sequence (28.5% overall identity; Refs. 14Bieber A.J.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar), and homophilic adhesive behavior (15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the ethanol insensitivity of neuroglian was due to its divergence from the human L1 protein, we examined the effect of ethanol on the aggregation of S2 cells that expressed an inducible human L1 minigene (9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). The L1-expressing S2 cells formed aggregates (Fig.3 B) under the same conditions as the neuroglian-expressing cells described above, although the aggregates were generally smaller after 24 h. L1-expressing cells aggregated normally when the assay was carried out in the presence of 100 mm ethanol (38 mm final concentration, Fig.3 C). Quantitative analysis also failed to detect a significant effect of ethanol on the aggregation of L1-expressing cells (Table I). A further test of L1 sensitivity to ethanol was carried out by staining cell aggregates with antibodies against ankyrin and human L1. Both neuroglian and L1 recruit ankyrin assembly at sites of cell contact in response to cell adhesion (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar). A representative field of L1-expressing cells grown in the presence of 100 mm ethanol is shown in Fig. 4 (A, stained for ankyrin;B, for human L1). Similar random fields of L1-expressing cells were scored for the presence of brightly stained aggregates and weakly stained single cells (Table III). The bright staining of ankyrin and L1 at cell contacts made it possible to accurately distinguish small cell aggregates from single cells. Once again, no difference was observed between cells grown in the presence or absence of 100 mm ethanol. Ankyrin was recruited specifically to sites of cell-cell contact. L1 also appeared concentrated at contacts, although control experiments showed that much of the total L1 was extracted by detergent during cell permeabilization (8Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R.

Aggregates and single cells were counted in randomly selected fields. Open table in a new tab The above results show that the ability of two members of the L1 protein family to promote aggregation of Drosophila S2 cells is insensitive to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol. Adhesive activity was measured using an established assay for cell aggregation in response to the inducible expression ofDrosophila neuroglian (15Hortsch M. Wang Y.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Google Scholar) or human L1 (9Hortsch, M., O'Shea, K. S., Zhao, G., Kim, F., Vallejo, Y., and Dubreuil, R. R. (1997) Cell Adhesion & Comm., in press.Google Scholar) inDrosophila S2 tissue culture cells. The robust aggregation exhibited by these cells was not inhibited by the presence of ethanol. Control experiments revealed that the level of ethanol in the growth medium remained physiologically significant throughout the duration of the assays. Differences in assay conditions between the present study and previous studies do not explain the lack of an ethanol effect on cell aggregation. The cells used by Ramanathan et al. (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar) constitutively expressed human L1, but were prevented from aggregating with each other because they grew as adherent cells in culture. Once released from their substrate, the suspended L1-expressing cells formed aggregates within 30 min. In contrast, the Drosophila S2 cells used here expressed neuroglian or human L1 under the control of an inducible promoter. Since S2 cells grow in suspension, cell adhesion commences once the induced adhesion molecule accumulates to a sufficient level (at ∼16 h). Ethanol was added to the cultures at the time of adhesion molecule induction, and the effect of ethanol was scored 24 h later after cell aggregates were allowed to form. Despite these differences in culture conditions and regulation of L1 expression, both experimental systems ultimately tested the ability of L1-expressing cells to aggregate in the presence of ethanol. There are several possible explanations for the inhibition of L1-mediated adhesion by ethanol in one cell system, but not another. First, ethanol may somehow act on the fibroblasts used in the previous study to produce an indirect effect on L1-mediated adhesion. The inhibitory effect of Ringer's solution in the present study illustrates that culture conditions can indirectly influence the outcome of a cell aggregation assay without affecting the activity of the adhesion molecule. However, ethanol-induced degradation of human L1 in fibroblasts was ruled out by the finding that the effects of ethanol were rapidly reversible (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar). A pleiotropic effect on cell adhesion was also ruled out by the finding that N-CAM-mediated cell adhesion was not inhibited by ethanol (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar). Second, there may be a post-translational modification of L1 (e.g. a difference in glycosylation) that causes L1 to become ethanol-sensitive in mammalian fibroblasts, but not in Drosophila S2 cells. It is possible that without this putative modification, L1 and neuroglian exhibit ethanol-insensitive adhesion, but whether or not there is a modification of L1 in fibroblasts, there is no evidence for an ethanol-sensitive modification of L1 function in the nervous system. Third, there may be interacting protein(s) found in fibroblasts but not S2 cells that confer ethanol sensitivity on the aggregation of L1-expressing cells. For example, heterophilic ligands that interact with L1 (2Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Google Scholar) may have contributed to the cell aggregation reported by Ramanathan et al. (13Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Google Scholar). If so, perhaps it is the heterophilic partner rather than L1 that is responsible for the ethanol effect. Nevertheless, the present results demonstrate that the homophilic adhesive activities of two L1 family members, as well as their cytoplasmic interaction with ankyrin, are not detectably altered by the presence of ethanol. Future studies should address the possibility that an indirect mechanism is responsible for the ethanol sensitivity of adhesion in L1-expressing fibroblasts. We thank Dr. Allan Bieber for providing anti-neuroglian antibody 3F4, Dr. Ralph Reisfeld for providing anti-human L1 antibody 5G3, and Drs. Michael Charness and Vance Lemmon for discussing unpublished studies of the effect of ethanol on aggregation of L1-expressing cells."

A promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing pathway replaced the exon 1 with the exon 1′. The exon 1′ contained GC-rich regions and an oligo(U) tail of 23 uridine residues. Moreover, it encoded for three open reading frames upstream of the La protein reading frame. Despite this unusual structure, when exon 1′ La mRNAs were expressed in transfected cells, both exon 1 and 1′ La mRNAs were translated to La protein, whereas the upstream open reading frames of the exon 1′ were not translated. In addition to full-length exon 1′ La mRNAs 5′-shortened exon 1′ La mRNAs were detected. The exon 1′ 5′-starts varied in dependence on the analyzed tissues. Like the full-length exon 1′ La mRNA a 5′-shortened exon 1′ construct starting downstream of the oligo(U) tail but upstream of the open reading frames 2 and 3 was also well translated when transfected in mouse cells. Thus all La mRNA forms represent functional La mRNAs. Transcription of the gene encoding for the nuclear autoantigen La resulted in La mRNA isoforms.

One of the target antigens of sera suffered from autoimmune patients with rheumatoid diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) 1The abbreviations used are: pSS, primary Sjögren's syndrome; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; ORF, open reading frame; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UAP, universal amplification primer; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; cLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is the nuclear autoantigen La (SS-B) (1Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Google Scholar). The La protein was described to associate at least transiently with all primary RNA polymerase III transcripts including precursor molecules of ribosomal 5 S RNA, tRNAs, and some 4.5 S RNAs, as well as a portion of the uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs U1 and U6 (2Hendrick J.P. Wolin S. Rinke J. Lerner M. Steitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 12: 1138-1149Google Scholar, 3Madore S.J. Wieben E.D. Pederson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1929-1933Google Scholar, 4Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2617-2629Google Scholar, 5Stefano J.E. Cell. 1984; 36: 145-154Google Scholar). Common to all primary RNA polymerase III transcripts is their 3′-terminal oligo(U) tail, which is transcribed during the transcription termination step. These oligo(U) tails were shown to be a binding site for the La protein (6Pruijn G.J.M. Slobbe R.L. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 43-48Google Scholar). In addition to the oligouridylated RNA polymerase III transcripts, an association of the La protein with some nonoligouridylated RNAs has been reported especially for some viral RNAs including the leader RNAs of the vesicular stomatitis virus and rabies virus (7Wilusz J. Kurilla M.G. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5827-5831Google Scholar, 8Kurilla M.G. Cabradilla C.D. Holloway B.P. Keene J.D. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 773-778Google Scholar). The La protein is assumed to be involved in transcription termination of RNA polymerase III and internal initiation of translation of at least the poliovirus mRNA (9Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 841-850Google Scholar, 10Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Google Scholar, 11Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Leibkowicz F. Kenan D. Chan E.K.L. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Google Scholar, 12Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Google Scholar). Most recently five La cDNAs were isolated when a cDNA library made from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of a patient with pSS was screened with her own anti-La serum (13Tröster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Google Scholar). In two of these five La cDNAs the exon 1 was replaced with an alternative 5′-end. Genomic analysis revealed that these La cDNAs represented alternatively spliced transcripts of the La gene. An additional promoter site was identified in the intron between exons 1 and 2, which served as initiation site for transcription of the alternative exon 1′. The exon 1′ La mRNA form had an unusual 5′ terminus. It contained GC-rich regions and an oligo(U) tail of 23 uridine residues and encoded for three upstream open reading frames (ORF1 to 3). The ORF1 encoded for a putative peptide of 5.4 kDa. It was interrupted from the La protein reading frame by two stop codons. The ORF2 and ORF3 were not in the reading frame of the La protein. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of expression of the exon 1 and exon 1′ La mRNAs showed that both La mRNA forms represented finally processed abundant cytoplasmic mRNAs. Exon 1 to exon 1′ La mRNAs were expressed at ratios between 1:1 and 1:5 (15Hilker M. Tröster H. Grölz D. Hake U. Bachmann M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 284: 383-389Google Scholar, 16Bachmann M. Hilker M. Grölz D. Tellmann G. Hake U. Kater L. deWilde P. Tröster H. J. Autoimmunity. 1996; 9: 757-766Google Scholar). Due to the unusual structure of the exon 1′ La mRNA it still remained unclear whether the exon 1′ La mRNA is a translatable mRNA and if so, which of the reading frames is used for translation. This was of special interest because one of the exon 1′ La cDNAs contained a frameshift mutation in a recently detected hot spot region in the exon 7 of the La gene (14Bachmann M. Bartsch H. Tröster H. Grölz D. J. Autoimmunity. 1996; 9: 747-756Google Scholar). The frameshift mutation caused a premature stop codon in the La protein reading frame. Thus the mutant exon 1′ La mRNA could encode for a C-terminally truncated mutant La peptide of 29 kDa. Here we present evidence that exon 1′ La mRNAs can be translated to La protein, whereas the upstream ORFs are not used for translation. The following materials were obtained:BstEII, EcoO109, EcoRI,KpnI, pGEX-2T, and T7-sequencing kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.

S. A.). The anti-La mAb SW5, which was found to be directed to the N-terminal domain of La protein (17Pruijn G.J.M. Thijssen J.P.H. Smith P.R. Williams D.G. vanVenrooij W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 611-619Google Scholar), was originally described by Smith et al. (18Smith P.R. Williams D.G. Venables P.J.W. Maini R.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 63-69Google Scholar). The hybridoma supernatant was kindly provided by Prof. vanVenrooij (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). As anti-La serum we used the serum of the patient (Ma) (12Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Google Scholar). PCR was performed using a TC9600 Cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Überlingen, Germany). The 50-μl assay in 1 × Taq buffer contained 2 units Taqpolymerase, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) Me2So, 200 μm dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, and 1 ng of DNA. Cycling was started by heating for 3 min to 95 °C. 40 cycles followed, each consisting of 15 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Then the temperature was held for 10 min at 72 °C and cooled down to 4 °C. The PCR products were further analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Isolated PCR fragments were either directly sequenced or sequenced after subcloning into pGEM-T (13Tröster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Google Scholar). DNA was prepared using the QIAprep-spin kit and concentrated by ethanol precipitation to a final concentration of about 1 μg/μl in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). DNA sequencing was performed as described previously (13Tröster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Google Scholar). For an analysis of the 5′-ends of the La mRNAs we chose the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (5′-RACE) supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. It includes a first strand cDNA synthesis and a PCR amplification step. During reverse transcription 40 units of RNase inhibitor were added to each 1-μg RNA sample. The RNA samples were isolated from either (adult) liver (L) of the tumor patient, human fetal spleen (20th week), PBLs of the patient with pSS, and PBLs of a (adult) control person, and mouse LTA cells, which were untransfected or transfected with the human either La gene or La exon 1 La cDNA (19Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Google Scholar). Although the liver tissue of the tumor patient did not obviously show metastasis, the tissue displayed an abundant expression of the c-myc oncogene (data not shown). The RNA was isolated as described earlier (13Tröster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Google Scholar). The reactions and the following 5′-RACE steps were performed according to the instructions of the supplier. For the first strand synthesis the primer P1 locating within the exon 4 was used (P1, CACTGATTTCCATGAGTTCTGCCTTGG). This primer was extracted with phenol/chloroform and diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated bidistilled water. The first amplification was performed using the Anchor primer of the supplier as upstream primer and the primer P2 locating in the exon 3 (P2, TGTCCCGTGGCAAATTGAAGTCGCC) as downstream primer. The cDNA synthesis and the first amplification step is schematically summarized in Fig. 2(S). The cDNAs were further amplified using nested primer pairs. The nested primer pairs consisted of the common downstream exon 2 primer P3 (P3, GATGACAGATTTTGGCCTCCAG) in combination with either the exon 1 specific upstream primer P4 (P4, GAGTCGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTTG) or the exon 1′ specific upstream primer P5 (P5, TTCTAGTCTCACCGAAGGCTTGTG) (see also Fig. 2 (A1). Alternatively the cDNAs were amplified using a combination of the universal amplification primer (UAP) of the supplier with either the exon 1′ specific downstream primer P6 (P6, CTGAAACCTGATGTGAGCGATG) or the exon 1 specific downstream primer P7 (P7, CCACAGGCTCACAAACAGCAAC) as schematically summarized in Figs. 2(B1) and 3 (S). All exon 1 and 1′ constructs were cloned in the two transfection vectors pCI-neo and pCI according to the following strategy. Cloning started from the La cDNA La23 in pBluescript SK(−). The La insert in La23 started at the 5′-site with an oligo(dT) tail and represented a 5′-shortened exon 1′ La mRNA derivative. Therefore, in a first step an exon 1′ full-length La cDNA had to be constructed. In parallel an exon 1 full-length La cDNA was constructed. Because La23 started at the 5′ terminus with 51 dT residues, this irregular oligo(dT) tail was shortened to 5 dT residues to obtain the 5′-shortened exon 1′ construct. During cloning we learned that La23 contained a frameshift mutation within the coding region (Ref. 14Bachmann M. Bartsch H. Tröster H. Grölz D. J. Autoimmunity. 1996; 9: 747-756Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6, ORF1 La(N)). Because all constructs were derivatives of La23, in a further cloning step the mutated reading frame was replaced with the correct reading frame, which was obtained from the La cDNA La19. For the first step of the cloning procedure 5′-exon 1′ and 5′-exon 1 fragments were required and prepared by PCR using the proofreadingPfu polymerase. In the case of the exon 1′ fragment, PCR was performed using DNA of a genomic subclone as substrate. The subclone was prepared from the charon phage Lambda 2.1 (19Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Google Scholar), which was a gift by Prof. J. D. Keene (Duke University, Durham, NC). Restriction of Lambda 2.1 DNA with EcoRI resulted in a 4.4- and a 4.6-kilobase fragment. The 4.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment was isolated and subcloned into pBluescript SK(−). This subclone contained besides the exons 1 and 2 the intron between exons 1 and 2 including the exon 1′. PCR was performed using as upstream primer P8 (P8, CGCTTTACTAGTGCGCGACTGCGCGTTTCC; the artificialSpeI site is underlined) and as downstream primer P6. The resulting exon 1′ fragment started at the predicted 5′-start of exon 1′ (13Tröster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Google Scholar) and ended downstream of an EcoO109 site, which located downstream of the oligo(dT) stretch in the La sequence. The exon 1′ fragments were cleaved with SpeI and EcoO109 and cloned into the respective sites of La23. For this purpose La23 was linearized with SpeI, and the isolated DNA was partially digested with EcoO109. Despite using Pfupolymerase a series of clones had to be characterized, because the vaste majority of clones had an incorrect length of dT residues in the oligo(dT) tail ranging from 14 to 28 residues. Finally a single clone was isolated with the correct length of 23 dT residues. The 5′-exon 1 fragment was obtained as follows. As substrate we used the La cDNA M13–3, which was originally described by Chan et al. (20Chan E.K.L. Sullivan K.F. Tan E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2233-2244Google Scholar) and which was a gift of Dr. E. K. L. Chan (Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA). Upstream exon 1 primer served the primer P9 (P9, CGCTTTACTAGTCGGTCCCCATCTTCTTGG; the artificialSpeI site is underlined). The downstream primer P1 located in the exon 4 downstream of the KpnI site in the La sequence. The exon 1 PCR fragments were cleaved with SpeI and KpnI and cloned into the respective sites of La23. For this purpose La23 was linearized with SpeI, and the isolated linearized DNA was partially digested with KpnI. The exon 1 and 1′ La inserts were isolated from the pBluescript SK(−) constructs by cleavage with SpeI and XhoI and cloned into pCI-neo and pCI, which were restricted with NheI andSalI. The exon 1′ construct in pCI was termed as ORF1 La(N) (see also Fig. 6, I). In the case of the 5′-shortened exon 1′ construct, a PCR fragment was prepared using as upstream primer P10 (P10, CGCTTTACTAGTTTTTACCTCCACCGCCTTC; the artificialSpeI site is underlined) in combination with P1 as downstream primer and La23 as substrate. The resulting fragment was cleaved with SpeI and KpnI and cloned in the respective sites of La23. Finally the reading frame of the exon 1 and 1′ constructs was corrected as follows. La19 cDNA containing the correct La coding sequence was restricted with BstEII, which cleaved in the exon 9 of the La sequence, and BglII, which cleaved in the exon 5 of the La sequence. The exon 1 and 1′ pCI-neo and pCI constructs were linearized with BstEII and after isolation of the linearized DNA partially digested with BglII. Then theBglII-BstEII fragment of La19 was cloned in the respective sites of the exon 1 and 1′ pCI-neo or pCI construct. The final constructs were sequenced. The human Raji and XPTA cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS in a humidified CO2 atmosphere. Mouse LTA and NIH 3T3 cells and human HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS in a humidified CO2 atmosphere either in culture flasks for preparation of extracts or on coverslips for epifluorescence microscopy. The mouse cells were transfected transiently according to the following protocol. Transfection was performed in 6-well tissue culture plates (35 mm) containing coverslips. Cells were grown to confluency of 70–80% in 4 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS. Prior to transfection the serum/medium was removed, and the cells were washed for 30 min with 2 ml of DMEM without FCS and antibiotics. In parallel 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA (see below) was dissolved in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium and combined with 100 μl of DMEM (without antibiotics and FCS) containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE. After removal of the 2 ml of DMEM, 0.8 ml of DMEM lacking FCS and antibiotics were added to the cells, and the DNA mixture followed. After an 5-h incubation 1 ml of DMEM containing 20% FCS and antibiotics was added. 20 h after the beginning of transfection the medium was replaced by 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. 44 h after transfection the cells were either harvested for preparation of total extracts or fixed with methanol/EGTA for immunofluorescence microscopy. In general we observed that even after optimization of the transfection conditions the expression level of the pCI-neo constructs was only 25% compared with the pCI constructs. In addition to transiently transfected cells, permanently transfected LTA cell lines were used. These lines were kindly provided by Dr. K. Keech of the group of Prof. J. McCluskey and Prof. T. Gordon (Flinders Medical Center, Bedfort, South Australia). The cells were transfected with either the human La gene or the human exon 1 La cDNA (19Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Google Scholar). The permanently transfected LTA cells were grown in the presence of 0.02% geneticin. For immunofluorescence microscopy the cells were fixed with methanol containing 0.02% EGTA at −20 °C for 1 h. Indirect immunofluorescence of cells with the anti-La mAb SW5 was performed by incubating the fixed cells, which had been rehydrated for 5 min with PBS, with cell culture supernatant of hybridomas secreting the anti-La mAb SW5 for at least 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS (5 min), and the bound anti-La mAb was detected using Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody developed in goat. The incubation time for the secondary antibody was 15 min. The staining occurred at room temperature and the unbound secondary antibodies were removed by washing with PBS (twice, 5 min). The stained cells were mounted using PBS/glycerol (1:1 v/v). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM) was performed using a Zeiss LSM 10. The stained specimens were cut automatically into horizontal sections (512 × 512 pixels/8 bit, objective lenses Plan-Neofluar 40 ×/1.3 oil). Evaluation of the stored stacks of the horizontal optical sections was performed with the LSM 10 image processing unit. Total extracts of transiently transfected cell lines were prepared by incubation with 350 μl of SDS-PAGE sample solution (95 °C). Total extracts from XPTA cells or permanently transfected LTA cells were harvested by adding 100 μl of hot cell lysis buffer (100 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.3, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol (v/v)) per cm2. Raji cells were harvested by centrifugation (250 × g, 10 min). The lysed cells were heated for 5 min to 95 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 5-μl aliquots were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample solution and used for SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). After blocking and washing the blots were incubated with cell culture supernatant of hybridoma cells secreting the anti-La mAb SW5. Formed immune complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence-Western blotting detection reagents. Then the anti-La SW5 immune complexes were eluted, and the blot was processed a second time using either the patient's anti-La antibody or the anti-ORF1 rabbit serum. The formed immune complexes were detected using anti-human or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as substrate. To obtain antibodies against the ORF1, a fusion protein consisting of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and a portion of ORF1 was constructed. For this purpose an exon 1′ fragment spanning nucleotides 171–260 (6Pruijn G.J.M. Slobbe R.L. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 43-48Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the upstream primer P11 (P11, CCCGGGATCCATGCGAGATCCTGG; the artificialBamHI site is underlined; A indicates a point mutation introduced in the native BamHI site) and the downstream primer P12 (P12, AGGATCCAAGACGCAATGGGGATGAG; the artificial BamHI site is underlined) subcloned into pGEM-T and after restriction with BamHI inserted into theBamHI site of pGEX-2T. To proof the specificity of the anti-ORF1 serum and to look for or to rule out an expression of the ORF1 further constructs were prepared. In a first step the complete exon 1′ was cloned in the transfection vector pCI. Because the translation initiation site of the ORF1 in the exon 1′ is not optimal according to Kozak (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-902Google Scholar), a further construct was prepared in which the translation initiation site was optimized according to the Kozak rules. This construct was termed ORF1 Kozak construct. Finally, the ORF1 was cloned downstream of a 3′-terminally truncated exon 1′-La mRNA. This clone was termed as ORF1 La(N)-ORF1 (see also Fig. 6,I). The ORF1 in the pCI transfection vector was obtained as follows. The pCI vector containing the full-length exon 1′ La cDNA was cut withSmaI. Then the cleaved DNA was partially digested withBalI and religated. The resulting clone contained the 5′ leader sequence of the exon 1′ La mRNA (nucleotides 1–137), the complete ORF1 (starting at nucleotide 138 and ending at nucleotide 276 including the oligo(dT) tail). It ended at nucleotide 293 in the exon 1′. The ORF1 Kozak construct was prepared as follows. The full-length exon 1′ La cDNA served as substrate for PCR using as upstream primer the primer P13 (P13, TGCTAGC GCCACCATGGGGGATCCTGGGGTTC; the artificial NheI site is underlined, the mutated optimized translational initiation site according to Kozak is given in italics). The primer P14 (P14, TCTAGACGCTATGGGGATGAGG; the artificialXbaI site is underlined) served the downstream primer. The resulting fragment was subcloned in pGEM-T, isolated by cleavage withNheI and XbaI, and cloned into the respective sites of pCI. The resulting ORF1 construct contained the same portion of the ORF1, which was also cloned in the GST-ORF1 construct. The ORF1 La(N)-ORF1 construct was prepared as follows. The exon 1′ full-length construct in pCI was cleaved with XbaI and dephosphorylated. The resulting deletion La mutant encoded for amino acids 1–228 of La protein. The ORF1 insert was amplified from the above mentioned ORF1 subcloned in pGEM-T using as upstream primer P15 (P15, TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG) and as downstream primer P16 (P16, ATGAAATCACTAGTGATTGCTAGCGCCACC; the SpeI site is underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was cleaved withSpeI and XbaI and cloned in the XbaI site of the N-terminal truncated La deletion construct. In a recent study Keech et al. (21Keech C.L. Gordon T. Reynolds P. McCluskey J. J. Autoimmunity. 1993; 6: 543-555Google Scholar) describe a mouse LTA cell line transfected with the human La gene. This cell line expressed human La protein in addition to the endogenous mouse La protein. As shown in Fig. 1 a differentiation between the human La protein and the endogenous mouse La protein in this mouse LTA cell line was possible by two techniques, including immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 A) and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 A (a) LTA cells transfected with the human La gene were stained with the anti-La mAb SW5, whereas untransfected cells were not stained (Fig. 1 A, b and c). After SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, the anti-La mAb SW5 reacted with a single protein band according to a molecular mass of 50 kDa from the extract of the LTA cell line transfected with the human La gene (Fig.1 B, lane 2). The same band was also recognized by the patient's anti-La antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The anti-La mAb SW5 did not react with the total extract of the untransfected LTA cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). In contrast, the patient's antibody reacted with a further protein band according to a molecular mass of 45 kDa in the extract of both the transfected (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) and the untransfected cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). These data allowed the following conclusions: (i) the human and the mouse La protein can be separated by SDS-PAGE, (ii) the protein band with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa represented the human La protein, (iii) the protein band with a molecular mass of 45 kDa represented the endogenous mouse La protein, (iv) the patient's anti-La antibody reacted with both the human and the mouse La protein, and (v) the anti-La mAb SW5 reacted only with the human but not with the endogenous mouse La protein. Consequently, transfection of mouse cells with a human exon 1′ La construct should allow the decision if the exon 1′ La mRNA is a translatable mRNA. Moreover, a mouse cell line transfected with an exon 1′ La construct but also the LTA cell line transfected with the human La gene should be useful to look for translation products of the upstream ORFs of the exon 1′ La mRNA. One prerequisite to use the LTA cell line transfected with the human La gene for such a purpose was that the exon 1′ La mRNA was made and expressed similarly to human cells. Therefore, in a first step we analyzed if the mouse LTA cells allowed the expression of the exon 1′ La mRNA type from the human La gene. For this purpose 5′-RACE experiments were performed as schematically summarized in Fig. 2(S). The PCR products obtained after the first amplification step were further amplified using a primer combination consisting either of the common exon 2 downstream primer together with an exon 1 (Fig. 2, A1, PCR 2a) or exon 1′ (Fig. 2,A1, PCR 2b) specific upstream primer or of the common UAP upstream primer in combination with an exon 1′ specific downstream primer (Fig. 2, B1, and also Fig.3, S, B). As shown in Fig. 2 (A2, lanes 1), both the exon 1′ and exon 1 human La mRNA forms could be detected in the mouse LTA cells transfected with the human La gene, whereas they were not detectable in the untransfected cell line (Fig. 2, A2,lanes 3). The human exon 1′ La mRNAs were also not detectable in a LTA cell line permanently transfected with the human exon 1 La cDNA (Fig. 2, A2, exon 1′,lane 2), whereas the human exon 1 La mRNA was detectable in this LTA cell line (Fig. 2, A2, exon 1,lane 2). Finally, when the exon 1 and 1′ bands were excised, subcloned, and sequenced, the PCR products could be unequivocally characterized as human exon 1 or exon 1′ products. Already during determination of the 5′-start of the exon 1′ La mRNA type a series of 5′-shortened exon 1′ La cDNAs were isolated. The decision of the 5′-start of the exon 1′ La mRNA was made on the longest 5′-exon 1′ La cDNA fragment obtained by the 5′-RACE technique. However, when the 5′-RACE products obtained for mRNAs isolated from the LTA cells transfected with the human La gene were separated on a NuSieve-agarose gel (Fig. 2, B2,lane 1), several bands were obtained. Therefore, further 5′-RACE studies were performed, and the PCR products were characterized. For this purpose exon 1 and exon 1′ 5′-RACE products were prepared in parallel from different mRNA preparations according to the procedure that is schematically summarized in Fig. 2(S). After the first amplification (Fig. 2, S,PCR(1)) the PCR products were further amplified as schematically summarized in Fig. 3 (S). The second amplification was performed using the common UAP primer in combination with either an exon 1 (Fig. 3, S, [A]) or an exon 1′ (Fig. 3, S, [B]) specific downstream primer. The mRNA preparations used for the 5′-RACE experiments were obtained from different human tissues including liver (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes L), PBLs of a patient with pSS (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes P p) and a healthy donor (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes P h), and fetal spleen (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes FS). As shown in Fig. 3 (A, lanes a–d), the exon 1 5′-RACE products gave"
https://openalex.org/W2019064657,"Tom70p is targeted and inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane in the Nin-Ccyto orientation, via an NH2-terminal signal anchor sequence. The signal anchor is comprised of two domains: an NH2-terminal hydrophilic region which is positively charged (amino acids 1–10) followed by the predicted transmembrane segment (amino acids 11–29). Substitution of the NH2-terminal domain with a matrix-targeting signal caused the signal anchor to adopt the reverse orientation in the outer membrane (Ncyto-Cin) or, if presented to mitoplasts, to arrest protein translocation at the inner membrane without insertion. Physically separating the transmembrane segment from the matrix-targeting signal by moving it downstream within the protein resulted in a failure to arrest in either membrane, and consequently the protein was imported to the matrix. However, if the mean hydrophobicity of the Tom70p transmembrane segment was increased in these constructs, the protein inserted into the inner membrane with an Nin-Cout orientation. Therefore we have determined conditions that allow the Tom70p transmembrane domain to insert in either membrane, pass through both membranes, or arrest without insertion in the inner membrane. These results identify the mean hydrophobicity of potential transmembrane domains within bitopic proteins as an important determinant for insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane.

These results identify the mean hydrophobicity of potential transmembrane domains within bitopic proteins as an important determinant for insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Nuclear-encoded precursor proteins destined for import into mitochondria are sorted to one of four compartments in the organelle: outer or inner membrane, intermembrane space, or matrix. Since import of most of these proteins is mediated by a common protein translocation machinery (for reviews see Refs. 1Hannavy K. Rospert S. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 694-700Google Scholar and 2Kiebler M. Becker K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 191-207Google Scholar), specificity for sorting must reside within topogenic domains present in the precursor protein. To date, four such domains have been characterized as follows: signal anchor sequences selective for protein insertion into the outer membrane (3Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 233-241Google Scholar, 4McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Google Scholar, 5Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Steenaart N.A.E.

In addition, complex variations of these domains may well exist, especially for proteins that assume polytopic structures within the lipid bilayer of either the outer or inner membrane, e.g.porin (12Smith M.D. Petrak M. Boucher P.D. Barton K.N. Carter L. Reddy G. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Price J. Verner K. McCauley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28331-28336Google Scholar) and uncoupling protein (13Liu X. Bell A.W.

With the exception of matrix-targeting signals, which are characterized by sequences rich in basic and hydroxylated amino acids with the potential to form an amphiphilic helix (10Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Google Scholar, 15Epand R.M. Hui S.W. Argan C. Gillespie L.L. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10017-10020Google Scholar, 16Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar), the others contain stretches of hydrophobic residues capable of spanning a membrane lipid bilayer.Outer membrane signal anchor sequences combine the function of targeting and membrane-anchoring into one sequence which also carries information that determines orientation. A well studied signal anchor sequence is that of Tom70p (3Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 233-241Google Scholar, 4McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J.

Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brutsch H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3191-3200Google Scholar). The Tom70p signal anchor sequence contains a positively charged hydrophilic domain (amino acids 1–10) followed by the predicted transmembrane segment (amino acids 11–29) (19Hase T. Muller U. Riezman H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3157-3164Google Scholar). The transmembrane segment contains all the information needed to target and insert a fusion protein into the outer membrane with the same orientation as Tom70p (Nin-Cout) (4McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Google Scholar). Signal anchor sequences control the orientation of insertion dependent on the hydrophilic NH2 terminus (17Steenaart N.A.E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3764-3771Google Scholar, 20Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Google Scholar) and can contribute to the formation of protein oligomers (21Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18403-18406Google Scholar, 22Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Google Scholar). Signal anchor sequences can also function at the COOH terminus of proteins such as Bcl-2 resulting in a Cin-Nout orientation (23Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Google Scholar, 24Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25823-25829Google Scholar).Stop-transfer sequences do not contain intrinsic membrane-selective targeting information but rather they are passive transmembrane segments that are located downstream of matrix-targeting signals, causing an otherwise matrix-destined protein to arrest translocation and insert into the outer or inner membrane. This is exemplified by yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit Va which has been shown to reside in the inner membrane and whose sorting signals are consistent with an NH2-terminal matrix-targeting signal combined with a downstream stop-transfer (7Glaser S.M. Miller B.R. Cumsky M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1873-1881Google Scholar, 25Miller B.R. Cumsky M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1021-1029Google Scholar). Introducing a heterologous stop-transfer sequence, derived from Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (26Rose J.K. Gallione C.J. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 519-528Google Scholar), into pre-ornithine carbamoyltransferase (pOCT) 1The abbreviations used are: pOCT, pre-ornithine carbamoyl transferase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. 1The abbreviations used are: pOCT, pre-ornithine carbamoyl transferase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. downstream of the matrix-targeting signal causes this otherwise matrix-destined protein to insert into the inner membrane (27Nguyen M. Argan C. Sheffield W.P. Bell A.W. Shields D. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1193-1198Google Scholar). However, when it is placed contiguous to the matrix-targeting signal, the protein arrests in the outer membrane (28Nguyen M. Bell A.W. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1499-1505Google Scholar).Likewise, intermembrane space-sorting signals contain a stretch of hydrophobic residues immediately downstream of a matrix-targeting signal (29Glick B.S. Beasley E.M. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 453-459Google Scholar), and indeed there is one example of a protein with such a sequence, NADH-cytochrome-b 5 reductase, that sorts to both the outer membrane and intermembrane space (30Hahne K. Haucke V. Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Google Scholar). Controversy remains, however, concerning the pathway followed by proteins bearing intermembrane space-sorting signals. In one model the hydrophobic stretch is suggested to arrest translocation during unidirectional import within the inner membrane translocation machinery; processing of the precursor on either side of the membrane then liberates the mature protein into the intermembrane space (29Glick B.S. Beasley E.M. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 453-459Google Scholar). Another model proposes that following removal of the NH2terminus in the matrix, the hydrophobic domain redirects the precursor protein back from the matrix compartment to the intermembrane space (31Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Google Scholar). It has been consistently observed, however, that the hydrophobic domain, while capable of translocation arrest within the inner membrane import machinery, does not integrate into the surrounding bilayer. Clearly, this domain is functionally different from the structurally analogous regions in signal anchor and stop-transfer sequences.Here we have addressed the question of how apparently similar stretches of hydrophobic amino acids within precursor proteins can function to target proteins to different locations within the mitochondrion. To do so, we have determined conditions and modifications that result in the transmembrane segment of a signal anchor sequence being inserted into either the outer or inner membrane, passing across both membranes without being arrested, or being arrested across the inner membrane without inserting into the bilayer. This recapitulation of targeting of the hydrophobic domain to different compartments was found to depend on several factors: 1) its net hydrophobicity, 2) whether or not it is permitted to pass across the outer membrane, 3) its distance from a matrix-targeting signal, and 4) the relative strength of the matrix-targeting signal.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA schematic of the various protein constructs employed in this investigation is presented in Fig. 1. pOMD29 contains the NH2-terminal signal anchor domain of Tom70p (amino acids 1–29) fused to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and is targeted and inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane in the Nin-Ccyto orientation (Fig. 5 A) (3Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 233-241Google Scholar,4McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Google Scholar, 20Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Google Scholar). Replacement of the extreme hydrophilic NH2 terminus of the pOMD29 signal anchor with the matrix-targeting signal of pOCT created pO-SA 36 (formerly pO-OMD), which inserts into the outer membrane in an orientation opposite that of pOMD29, i.e.Ncyto-Cin (Fig. 5 A) (17Steenaart N.A.E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3764-3771Google Scholar, 20Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Google Scholar). Deletion of the predicted transmembrane portion (amino acids 11–29) of the pOMD29 signal anchor abolishes the ability of the protein to target mammalian mitochondria in vitro (4McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Google Scholar), whereas the pO-SA 36 fusion construct containing the pOCT matrix-targeting signal but lacking the Tom70p transmembrane segment (i.e. pO-DHFR) is efficiently imported to the matrix (34Skerjanc I.S.

To investigate the consequences of physically separating these domains, a spacer region was introduced by replacing pOCT amino acids 1–36 in pO-SA 36 with pOCT amino acids 1–141 or amino acids 1–242 to create pO-SA 141 or pO-SA 242, respectively (Fig. 1). The import of pO-SA 141 was compared with that of pO-141Δ, which is pO-SA 141 lacking the Tom70p transmembrane segment. Both constructs contain the matrix signal sequence processing site, which occurs between amino acids 32 and 33 of the pOCT sequence (27Nguyen M. Argan C. Sheffield W.P. Bell A.W. Shields D. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1193-1198Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the pattern of import of pO-SA 141 and pO-141Δ into intact mitochondria was very similar to that of the control matrix protein, pO-DHFR. For all three constructs, sedimentation and processing was dependent on the presence of mitochondria (compare lane 2with lane 4) and was temperature-sensitive (comparelane 3 with lane 4). The processed, but not the full-length precursor, forms of all three polypeptides were resistant to external protease (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), and the appearance of the processed molecules was dependent on the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane since it was abolished by CCCP (Fig. 2 A,lane 6). These results indicate that all three molecules were transported across the outer membrane and that at least their amino termini were located in the matrix compartment, which is the site of signal sequence cleavage. Of particular note, however, is that the processed forms of the three polypeptides were extractable by alkali (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5 and 6) indicating a failure to integrate into a membrane lipid bilayer. This suggests, but does not prove, that the polypeptides were translocated entirely to the matrix compartment. Identical results to those presented in Fig. 2, A andB, were obtained for pO-SA 242 and pO-242Δ (pO-SA 242 lacking the transmembrane region, Fig. 1) (data not shown) suggesting that the failure of pO-SA 141 and pO-SA 242 to insert into mitochondrial membranes was unlikely to be the result of the immediate polypeptide context of the Tom70p transmembrane segment.Figure 2Import of pO-SA 141, pO-141Δ, and pO-DHFR into intact mitochondria. Standard import reactions and analyses were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods.”A, the 35S-precursor proteins, as indicated, were incubated with (lanes 3–6) or without (lane 2) mitochondria (Mitos) at either 4 (lane 3) or 30 ° C (lanes 2 and4–6), and in the presence (lane 6) or absence (lanes 2–5) of 1.0 μm CCCP.

The generation of mitoplasts (32McBride H.M. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 162-168Google Scholar) was monitored by the release of the intermembrane space marker, sulfite oxidase, which was over 90% complete as judged by Western blot analysis (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (top panel), pO-SA 141 was imported and processed (lane 4), and the processed form of the molecule demonstrated ΔΨ-dependent resistance to exogenous trypsin (compare lanes 5 and 6 withlane 4) indicating complete translocation of the polypeptide chain to the soluble matrix compartment. Consistent with this conclusion, both pO-DHFR and pO-SA 141 were also protected from trypsin following import into intact mitochondria and subsequent hypo-osmotic shock of the organelle to disrupt the outer membrane (20Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Google Scholar) (not shown). As expected (see also Fig. 2), the imported product in mitoplasts was extracted by alkali (lane 9). Very similar import results were obtained for pO-141Δ and pO-DHFR (Fig. 3, panels 2and 3) and for pO-SA 242 and pO-242Δ (not shown). Finally, pO-SA 141 was completely degraded by trypsin following incubation with intact mitochondria in the presence of CCCP (not shown), indicating that pO-SA 141 did not insert into the outer membrane even in the absence of an electrochemical potential across the inner membrane.Figure 3Import of pO-SA 141, pO-141Δ, pO-DHFR, pO-SA 36, and pOMD29 into mitoplasts. Standard import reactions and analyses were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods” and in Fig. 2 except that mitoplasts were used in place of intact mitochondria. The 35S-precursor proteins, as indicated (p), were incubated in the presence (lanes 3–9) or absence (lane 2) of mitoplasts at either 4 (lanes 3 and 8) or 30 ° C (lanes 2,4–7 and 9) and in the presence (lanes 6 and 7) or absence (lanes 2–5, 8, and 9) of 1.0 μmCCCP. In lanes 5 and 6 the mitoplasts were subjected to treatment with protease at the end of the import reaction (Post-Trypsin), whereas the alkali-resistant fraction was analyzed in lanes 8 and9 (Alkali).p and m refer to precursor and processed (mature) polypeptides, respectively, and are designated byarrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies have documented import and insertion of pOMD29 into the inner membrane of mitoplasts in the Nin-Cout orientation (3Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 233-241Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 3, panel 5, this results in acquisition of resistance to extraction by alkali (compare lanes 4 and9) but leaves the bulk of the polypeptide exposed at the surface of mitoplasts where it is susceptible to degradation by exogenous trypsin (compare lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the transmembrane segment of Tom70p is competent for insertion into the inner membrane in the context of pOMD29 but not in the context of pO-SA 141 or pO-SA 242. However, of particular interest were the findings with pO-SA 36, in which the Tom70p transmembrane segment is immediately adjacent to the pOCT matrix-targeting signal. Import and processing of pO-SA 36 (Fig. 3, panel 4) was dependent on the presence of mitoplasts (compare lanes 2 and 4) with an intact electrochemical potential (compare lanes 4 and7), indicating that the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide reached the matrix. The bulk of the polypeptide, however, was accessible to trypsin (lane 5) and therefore was located outside the organelle. This is in distinct contrast to pO-SA 141, pO-141Δ, and pO-DHFR, for which the processed forms of the polypeptides were protected against trypsin (panels 1–3, compare lanes 4 and 5). In addition, and in contrast to pOMD29, the processed form of pO-SA 36 was extractable by alkali (compare lanes 4 and 9). Taken together, therefore, these results suggest that the Tom70p signal anchor transmembrane segment caused pO-SA 36 to pause or arrest during translocation across the inner membrane, but it did not trigger release of the transmembrane segment into the surrounding lipid bilayer.Increasing the Hydrophobicity of the Tom70p Signal Anchor Transmembrane Segment Permits Insertion into the Inner MembraneIn a previous study (22Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Google Scholar), mutations were introduced into the transmembrane segment of the Tom70p signal anchor, in which alanines at positions 14, 15, 17, and 18 were converted to isoleucine. These changes did not affect the ability of the signal anchor in the context of pOMD29 to select and insert into the mitochondrial outer membrane in vitro (22Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Google Scholar). Here, the identical changes were introduced into the Tom70p hydrophobic domain of pO-SA 141, to create pO-SA 141-I4 (Fig. 4 A). They resulted in the mean hydrophobicity of this segment increasing from 1.17 to 1.74 (Fig.4 A) employing the hydrophobicity scale of Kyte and Doolittle (36Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) (Secondary Structure Prediction, Prosis Program, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). Import and processing of pO-SA 141-I4 was dependent on mitochondria (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 4), and the processed product, but not the full-length precursor, acquired resistance to external trypsin (lane 5) that was dependent on the presence of an electrochemical gradient (lane 6). Thus, the trypsin-resistant component of pO-SA 141-I4 had crossed the outer membrane and deposited its NH2 terminus into the matrix. However, in contrast to pO-SA 141 (Figs. 2 and 3) and pO-DHFR (Figs. 2,3, and the lower panel in Fig. 4 B) that are imported to the matrix where they remain extractable by alkali, pO-SA 141-I4 was resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 4 and 7). Therefore, the results show that pO-SA 141-I4 was inserted into the inner membrane. Since the polypeptide has a single downstream transmembrane segment, this means that this bitopic-processed polypeptide spans the inner membrane once, leaving the COOH terminus in the intermembrane space. This was confirmed following import into mitoplasts, where subsequent digestion of processed pO-SA 141-I4 by trypsin yielded a polypeptide fragment whose size was consistent with an Nin-Coutorientation (data not shown).Figure 4Mutations in the yTom70p domain of pO-SA 141 that permit insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane. A, the amino acid sequence (single letter code) of the transmembrane portion of the yTom70p signal anchor (amino acids 11–29) is shown together with mutations of alanine residues at positions 14, 15, 17, and 18 to isoleucine. These mutations were made in pO-SA 141 to create pO-SA 141-I4 and result in the predicted hydrophobic index of the Tom70p transmembrane domain increasing from 1.17 to 1.74, as determined using the Secondary Structure Prediction, Prosis Program (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). B, standard import of pO-SA 141-I4 and pO-DHFR into intact mitochondria was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Conditions and analyses were the same as in Fig. 2, as is the nomenclature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ConclusionsIn this study, we have examined the function of the Tom70p signal anchor transmembrane segment when placed in different contexts relative to a matrix-targeting signal. The results are summarized in Fig. 5. When the Tom70p transmembrane segment is contiguous to the pOCT matrix-targeting signal (pO-SA 36) and presented to intact mitochondria in vitro, it inserts into the outer membrane in the Ncyto-Cinorientation, which is opposite that observed for the native Tom70p signal anchor (pOMD29) (Fig. 5 A). When this same polypeptide construct, pO-SA 36, is presented to mitoplasts, the transmembrane segment causes arrest of the polypeptide across the inner membrane in the Nin-Cout orientation, but it does not trigger insertion into the membrane lipid bilayer (Fig. 5 B). If placed at some distance downstream of the matrix-targeting signal (pO-SA 141 and pO-SA 242) and presented to either intact mitochondria or mitoplasts, the transmembrane segment is no longer capable of arresting translocation or triggering insertion into either mitochondrial membrane, and the protein is translocated entirely to the matrix compartment. Increasing the net hydrophobicity of the Tom70p transmembrane segment within the context of this latter construct, however, results in its insertion into the inner membrane in the Nin-Cout orientation (pO-SA 141-I4). These findings are similar to those found for bacteria, where it has been shown that protein insertion into the cell membrane requires a threshold hydrophobicity for the transmembrane segment (37Whitley P. Saaf A. Gafvelin G. Johansson M. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 965-967Google Scholar).The observed outcomes that were specified by the hydrophobic domain within the various polypeptide constructs examined in this study closely mimic those specified by hydrophobic domains that exist within native proteins: signal anchor sequences that direct insertion into the outer membrane, stop-transfer sequences that specify insertion into the outer or inner membrane, and intermembrane sorting sequences that cause translocation arrest across the inner membrane. The results, therefore, help to identify characteristics of these closely related hydrophobic segments that are likely important for function. In particular, our findings suggest that insertion of a potential transmembrane segment into the inner membrane requires a relatively high net hydrophobicity when this segment is located at some distance downstream of a strong matrix-targeting sequence. In the absence of an outer membrane (i.e. mitoplasts), however, a transmembrane segment of lower hydrophobicity will either insert into the inner membrane if located adjacent to a weak matrix-targeting signal (i.e. the native Tom70p signal anchor) or it will only arrest translocation if adjacent to a strong matrix-targeting signal. The ability of a hydrophobic domain to insert into the inner membrane, therefore, likely depends on four inter-related factors: 1) its net hydrophobicity, 2) whether or not it is permitted to pass across the outer membrane, 3) its distance from a matrix-targeting signal, and 4) the relative strength of the matrix-targeting signal. How the constituent components of the outer and inner membrane translocation machineries discriminate between these different contexts and control protein sorting, however, is not known. Presumably, it involves a complex interplay between the dynamic and reversible interactions that can occur between the two import machineries and, in addition, may result from the different requirements that individual precursor proteins may have for ATP, the electrochemical potential, and chaperone interactions. Nuclear-encoded precursor proteins destined for import into mitochondria are sorted to one of four compartments in the organelle: outer or inner membrane, intermembrane space, or matrix. Since import of most of these proteins is mediated by a common protein translocation machinery (for reviews see Refs. 1Hannavy K. Rospert S. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 694-700Google Scholar and 2Kiebler M. Becker K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 191-207Google Scholar), specificity for sorting must reside within topogenic domains present in the precursor protein. To date, four such domains have been characterized as follows: signal anchor sequences selective for protein insertion into the outer membrane (3Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2027224119,"Two tyrosine phosphoproteins in phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 (S-EL4) mouse thymoma cells have been identified as the p120 c-Cbl protooncogene product and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 and p85 increased rapidly after phorbol ester stimulation. Phorbol ester-resistant EL4 (R-EL4) cells expressed comparable amounts of c-Cbl and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein but greatly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed complexes of c-Cbl with p85, and of p85 with the tyrosine kinase Lck in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 but not in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells. In vitro binding of c-Cbl with Lck SH2 or SH3 domains was detected in both S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells, suggesting that c-Cbl, p85, and Lck may form a ternary complex. In vitrokinase assays revealed phosphorylation of p85 by Lck only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that Cbl-p85 and Lck-p85 complexes may form in unstimulated S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells but were not detected due to absence of tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. Greatly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and p85 in the complexes may contribute to the failure of R-EL4 cells to respond to phorbol ester. Two tyrosine phosphoproteins in phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 (S-EL4) mouse thymoma cells have been identified as the p120 c-Cbl protooncogene product and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Greatly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and p85 in the complexes may contribute to the failure of R-EL4 cells to respond to phorbol ester. T lymphocyte activation is triggered by interaction between the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; S-EL4 cells, phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 mouse thymoma cells; R-EL4 cells, phorbol ester-resistant EL4 mouse thymoma cells; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDB, phorbol dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IEF, isoelectric focusing; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; IL-2, interleukin-2; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3, respectively. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; S-EL4 cells, phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 mouse thymoma cells; R-EL4 cells, phorbol ester-resistant EL4 mouse thymoma cells; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDB, phorbol dibutyrate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IEF, isoelectric focusing; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; IL-2, interleukin-2; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3, respectively. and its cognate antigen. One of the earliest signaling events following TCR stimulation is the rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar and 2Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 4: 259-274Google Scholar). Unlike growth factor receptors that have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (reviewed in Ref. 3Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Google Scholar), the TCR components transduce their signals through noncovalently associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 2Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 4: 259-274Google Scholar). Three tyrosine kinases, Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70, have been implicated in the function of the TCR. Identification of substrates for these tyrosine kinases has been an area of intense investigation. Several tyrosine kinase substrates in T cells have been identified in the past few years, including phospholipase C-γ (4Park D.J. Rho H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, c-Cbl, a protooncogene protein of 120 kDa has been identified as another prominent tyrosine kinase substrate in T cells (14Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that c-Cbl becomes rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation (14Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar) and forms complexes with several signaling molecules (15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B.

Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Google Scholar), the function of c-Cbl in T cells is not clear. T cell activation can be mimicked by the addition of tumor-promoting phorbol esters plus calcium ionophores, suggesting important roles for protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium (20Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Google Scholar). The role of PKC in T cell activation is further emphasized by studies showing that induction of the transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and nuclear factor of activated T cell for cytokine gene expression is regulated by PKC (21Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Google Scholar). PKC is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases, most of which can be stimulated directly by phorbol ester treatment (reviewed in Refs. 22Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Google Scholar and 23Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). Although a functional role for PKC in T cell activation is demonstrated, the signaling events mediated by PKC are not clear. Stimulation of T lymphocytes with phorbol esters induces a marked phosphorylation of Lck at N-terminal serine residues (24Veillette A. Horak I.D. Bolen J.B. Oncogene Res. 1988; 2: 385-401Google Scholar, 25Luo K. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 803-808Google Scholar). Whether this phorbol ester-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Lck has any functional significance is not well understood. Stimulation of some T cells with phorbol ester also induces accumulation of a Ras-GTP complex (26Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC might mediate Ras activation. Ras has been shown to interact directly with Raf-1 kinase in vitro and in vivo (27Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Google Scholar, 28Zhang X.F. Settlemen J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Google Scholar). The evidence that PKC can phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 suggests that PKC may be an upstream regulator of this kinase (29Siegel J.N. Klausner R.D. Rapp U.R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18472-28480Google Scholar, 30Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Google Scholar). Raf-1 can trigger a kinase cascade by phosphorylating and activating mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK), which subsequently phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase (reviewed in Ref. 31Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Google Scholar). The demonstration that MAP kinase can translocate to the nucleus (32Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar), where it can directly modulate transcriptional factors (33Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar, 34Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Google Scholar), might provide a mechanism for PKC regulation of cytokine gene expression. To study the PKC-mediated signaling events, we have employed an EL4 mouse thymoma cell line that requires only phorbol ester treatment to stimulate interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, growth inhibition, and adherence to the substrate (35Farrar J.J. Fuller-Farrar J. Simon P.L. Hilfiker M.L. Stadler B.M. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2555-2558Google Scholar, 36Sando J.J. Hilfiker M.L. Piacentini M.J. Canfer T.M. Can. Res. 1982; 42: 1676-1680Google Scholar). Comparison with an EL4 variant that lacks all of these responses (36Sando J.J. Hilfiker M.L. Piacentini M.J. Canfer T.M. Can. Res. 1982; 42: 1676-1680Google Scholar, 37Harrison J.R. Lynch K.R. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 234-238Google Scholar) has allowed us to investigate signaling molecules that may be essential for these responses. Previous work has revealed deficient induction of c-Jun and Fra transcription factors (38Jenson D.E. Frankis R.C. Sando J.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1219-1225Google Scholar) and deficient activation of MEK in phorbol ester-resistant EL4 (R-EL4) cells (39Gause K.C. Homma M.K. Licciardi K.A. Seger R. Ahn N.G. Peterson M.J. Krebs E.G. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16124-16129Google Scholar), suggesting potential functional roles for these signaling molecules. In addition, treatment of phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 (S-EL4) cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin) blocks phorbol ester-stimulated IL-2 mRNA production (40Sando J.J. Holman V.P. Am. Assoc. Can. Res. 1993; 34: 176Google Scholar), which raised the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation may be important for phorbol ester-stimulated IL-2 production. To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation events potentially important for phorbol ester-stimulated IL-2 production and other responses, we have compared tyrosine phsophoproteins between S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells. A tyrosine phosphoprotein, p85, was detected in S-EL4 but not R-EL4 cells, and phorbol ester stimulation enhanced its tyrosine phosphorylation only in sensitive cells (41Richardson A.F. Sando J.J. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 17-30Google Scholar). Here we report an additional tyrosine phosphoprotein, p120, that has a tyrosine phosphorylation response similar to that of p85. We have identified this p120 protein as the product of the c-Cbl protooncogene and further investigated its associated signaling proteins. Our studies have revealed greatly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in R-EL4 cells and some deficiencies in its associated signaling molecules in these cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) and anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other antibodies, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and glutathione-agarose beads were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phorbol dibutyrate (PDB), aprotinin, sodium pyrophosphate, sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-agarose beads and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were supplied by Amersham Corp. Phorbol ester-sensitive and -resistant EL4 cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD), and fetal calf serum was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Luminescent stickers for marking and aligning autoradiographs were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). EL4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine to a density of approximately 1–2 × 106/ml. Cells were treated with 150 mm PDB for the times indicated. Cells (2 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 nm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm sodium pyrophosphate). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 min, and supernatants were incubated with 2–5 μg of the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by incubation with 15 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer five times and treated with 1 × Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Cell lysates from 1.5 × 107 cells were precleared with 40 μl of glutathione-agarose beads overnight and then incubated with 10 μg of purified GST proteins noncovalently coupled to 15 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The bead-bound proteins were washed five times with lysis buffer, suspended in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Proteins from 2 × 105cells were separated by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were blocked by incubation (30 min) with either 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for Tyr(P) blots or 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, followed by incubation for 1 h with the indicated primary antibodies at concentrations of 0.5 μg/ml. Blots were then washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween, and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were added for a further 30 min. Blots were washed, and proteins were visualized by the addition of enhanced chemiluminescence reagents as described by the manufacturers. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proteins from 2.5 × 106 cells were separated on isoelectric focusing tube gels with pH 3.5–10 ampholines followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Tyr(P) antibody, and then the blots were stripped and reprobed with the antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase or c-Cbl. Luminescent stickers were used during exposure of the immunoblots to film to help align the films with the immunoblots and to mark the positions of molecular weight markers. The positions of tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and of p120 and c-Cbl on two-dimensional gel could be compared unambiguously by overlaying and aligning the two films. Cell lysates from 2 × 107 cells were precleared with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads for about 3 h. Precleared cell lysates were incubated overnight with 5 μg of Lck antibodies, followed by incubation with 15 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and one time with 25 mm HEPES and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The kinase reactions were stopped with 3 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was exposed to Kodak film at −70 °C overnight and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Previous studies revealed a tyrosine phosphoprotein, p85, in phorbol ester-sensitive but not -resistant EL4 mouse thymoma cells and found that phorbol ester stimulation enhanced its tyrosine phosphorylation only in sensitive cells (41Richardson A.F. Sando J.J. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 17-30Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting reveals an additional protein, p120, that exhibits a similar pattern. It could not be discerned from this experiment whether the proteins were deficient in the resistant cells or merely the tyrosine phosphorylation. In attempt to identify these proteins, blots were probed with antisera to known tyrosine phosphoproteins of similar molecular weight that could have a role in T cell signaling. Probing with antibodies to c-Cbl, a prominent tyrosine kinase substrate of 120 kDa recently identified in T cells (14Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar), revealed expression of c-Cbl in S-EL4 cells and equal or greater expression in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 1 B). Identification of p120 as c-Cbl would suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was much higher in S- than in R-EL4 cells. To test this possibility, c-Cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated from both S- and R-EL4 cells, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was determined by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. C-Cbl did exhibit much greater tyrosine phosphorylation in S- than in R-EL4 cells (Fig.2), consistent with the possibility that c-Cbl was p120. To further address the possible identity of p120 as c-Cbl, attempts to separate p120 from c-Cbl were made using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Lysates from cells that were stimulated with 150 nm PDB for 5 min were electrophoresed through isoelectric focusing gels followed by SDS-PAGE gels and then subjected to anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. The tyrosine phosphoproteins were resolved into a number of distinct spots or arrays of spots, corresponding to major tyrosine phosphoproteins observed in one-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 1 A). A series of 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins of varying isoelectric points was detected in S- but not in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 3, left panels). When the anti-Tyr(P) immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Cbl antibody, a set of anti-Cbl reactive proteins, also exhibiting several pI forms, was detected in both cell lines (Fig. 3, right panels). Overlaying the two films revealed that the p120 signal exactly overlapped with the c-Cbl signal, arguing strongly that p120 was c-Cbl.Figure 3Co-migration of p120 and c-Cbl proteins on two-dimensional gel analysis. S-EL4 or R-EL4 cells (2.5 × 106) were treated with 150 nm PDB for 5 min and then lysed in isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample buffer and subjected to IEF with pH 3.5–10 ampholines in the first dimension (IEF; from acid to base, left to right) followed by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (left panels), and then stripped and reprobed with anti-Cbl antibody (right panels). The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120, the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation after phorbol ester stimulation was examined. Lysates from cells stimulated with 150 nm PDB for various times up to 60 min were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 in S-EL4 cells began to increase about 1.5 min after PDB stimulation, remained elevated for 20 min, and decreased by about 30 min (Fig. 4 A). Although resistant cells exhibited a faint tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, no obvious p120 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in R-EL4 cells (Fig.4 B). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Cbl antibody to confirm that the amount of c-Cbl proteins did not change over the assay period (Fig. 4). Since it has been reported that c-Cbl could form complexes with several signaling molecules (15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E.

Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Google Scholar), the possibility that c-Cbl may form a complex with tyrosine phosphoproteins in EL4 cells was investigated. c-Cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells that had been unstimulated or treated with PDB for 2 min, and Cbl-associated tyrosine phosphoproteins were detected with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. An 85-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was observed in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells but not in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells despite comparable immunoprecipitation of c-Cbl in both cells (Fig. 5). In addition to the similar pattern of expression, this 85-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein co-migrated with the previously observed p85 detected by direct immunoblotting of lysates (data not shown), suggesting that they are the same protein. To our surprise, we did not observe enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells. We suspect that some phosphotyrosines of c-Cbl in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells may be lost during the longer time required for immunoprecipitation as opposed to direct immunoblotting of lysates. Although p85 was detected by anti-Tyr(P) antibody in Cbl immunoprecipitates after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells, it was not clear whether phorbol ester stimulation induced more tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 to be associated with c-Cbl in S-EL4 cells or whether phorbol ester stimulation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 that associated with c-Cbl in either phosphorylation state. To explore these possible mechanisms, we first tried to identify potential tyrosine kinases for p85. The lymphocyte tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared after a 10-min treatment of cells with 150 nm PDB to determine whether p85 can be co-immunoprecipitated with these tyrosine kinases. Monoclonal antibodies to c-Fos and cyclin E were used as negative controls. The tyrosine kinase-associated tyrosine phosphoproteins were detected by anti-Tyr(P) antibody. A strong p85 signal was detected in Lck immunoprecipitates from S-EL4, not R-EL4, cells (Fig. 6 A). A weak p85 signal also could be detected in Fyn immunoprecipitates from S-EL4 cells; however, this signal did not exceed that detected in control immunoprecipitates (Fig.6 A). Since p85 was observed to co-immunoprecipitate with Lck in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, we next tried to determine whether phorbol ester stimulation had any effect on the co-immunoprecipitation of p85 with Lck. Lysates from S-EL4 cells that were unstimulated or treated with 150 nm PDB for 10 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody, and p85 was detected by anti-Tyr(P) antibody. A prominent p85 band was detected in Lck immunoprecipitates from stimulated S-EL4 cells, but signals in immunoprecipitates from unstimulated S-EL4 cells did not exceed those from control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 B). The appearance of p85 in Lck immunoprecipitates after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells was very rapid, being detectable after only 2 min of phorbol ester stimulation (data not shown). To investigate which domains of Lck could bind p85, lysates from cells that were unstimulated or were treated with 150 nm PDB were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 or SH3 domains of Lck, and the tyrosine phosphoproteins that bound to these GST fusion proteins were detected by anti-Tyr(P) antibody. An 85-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was observed to bind the Lck SH2 (Fig.7 A) and the Lck SH3 domains (Fig.7 B). This 85-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein co-migrated with the p85 detected in whole cell lysates and was detected only in S-EL4 cells (Fig. 7). The binding of p85 with the SH2 or SH3 domains of Lck was enhanced after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells (Fig. 7). Since the Lck SH2 domain should bind only tyrosine-phosphorylated p85, whereas the SH3 domain would be expected to bind the 85-kDa protein independent of its phosphorylation state, it is not surprising that Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody provides a stronger p85 signal with the SH2 GST fusion protein than with the SH3. Collectively, these results suggested that Lck was a potential tyrosine kinase for p85. Since we observed p85 in both c-Cbl and Lck immunoprecipitates after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells, we tried to test whether c-Cbl could bind Lck and form a ternary complex with p85 in EL4 cells. When Lck proteins were immunoprecipitated from sensitive or resistant EL4 cells that had been unstimulated or treated with PDB, no obvious c-Cbl proteins were detected in Lck immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Since it was reported that c-Cbl could bind the SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck in vitro in Jurkat cells (14Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar), we next examined whether this was the case for EL4 cells. Lysates from sensitive and resistant EL4 cells that were unstimulated or treated with 150 nm PDB for 5 min were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing Lck SH3 or Lck SH2 domains. c-Cbl proteins were observed to constitutively bind GST fusion proteins containing Lck SH3 (Fig. 8 A) or Lck SH2 domains (Fig.8 B) in both S- and R-EL4 cells but not to control GST fusion proteins. The binding of c-Cbl to Lck SH2 domains was better in S- than in R-EL4 cells. This was not surprising, since SH2 domains serve as the binding sites for phosphotyrosine during protein-protein interaction (42Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar, 43Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Google Scholar) and c-Cbl exhibited significantly greater tyrosine phosphorylation in sensitive than in resistant EL4 cells (Fig. 2). The co-immunoprecipitation of p85 with c-Cbl and with Lck after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells and the in vitro binding of Lck SH2 or SH3 domains with c-Cbl suggested that c-Cbl, Lck, and p85 might form a ternary complex in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells. The failure to detect an Lck-Cbl complex via co-immunoprecipitation may be due to weak or transient complex formation. Although Cbl-p85 and Lck-p85 complexes were observed only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, we could not exclude the possibility that a Cbl-p85 or Lck-p85 complex did form in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells but was not detected due to absence of tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. We therefore tested whether p85 could be phosphorylated by Lck in vitro after phorbol ester stimulation of the cells. Lck proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from unstimulated cells or from cells treated with 150 nm PDB for 5 min and subjected to an in vitrokinase assay to detect 32P transfer to any co-immunoprecipitated proteins. A 32P-containing band of 56 kDa, probably reflecting autophosphorylation of Lck, was detected in all Lck immunoprecipitates, but an 85-kDa protein was phosphorylated in Lck immune complex kinase assays only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, not in unstimulated S-EL4 cells, in R-EL4 cells, or in control immune complexes (Fig. 9, upper panel). Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting demonstrated its co-migration with p85 (Fig.9, lower panel). The phosphorylation of p85 in Lck immune complex was very rapid, being detectable after only 2 min of phorbol ester stimulation (data not shown). These results supported the possibility that detection of p85 in Cbl-p85 and Lck-p85 complexes in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells was due to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. But without identification of p85, we could not exclude the possibility that the detection of p85 in these complexes in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells was due to association of more tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 with c-Cbl or Lck. Since it was reported that the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with c-Cbl (15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Google Scholar, 16Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar) and bound the SH3 domains of Lck (42Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar, 43Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Google Scholar), we speculated that p85 might be the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. To test this possibility, lysates from cells that were stimulated with 150 nm PDB for 5 min were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblots were probed successively with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-PI 3-kinase p85 antibodies. While a series of tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 spots was detected in S- but not in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 10, left panels), a set of spots reactive with the antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was observed in both S- and R-EL4 cells (Fig. 10, right panels). These PI 3-kinase spots exactly overlapped with the Tyr(P)-p85 spots in S-EL4 cells when the films were superimposed, arguing that p85 was the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. To further confirm that p85 was the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, we examined whether Cbl- and Lck-associated p85 was recognized by the antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. c-Cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from cells that were unstimulated or treated with PDB and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by anti-PI 3-kinase immunoblotting. In phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, Cbl-associated p85 was recognized by the antibody to PI 3-kinase p85 subunit (Fig. 11 A). However, we also observed the co-immunoprecipitation of PI 3-kinase with c-Cbl in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 11 A), whereas we did not detect the co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 with c-Cbl in these cells (Fig. 5). This may indicate that p85 does associate with c-Cbl in both cell lines but is not detected with Tyr(P) antibodies due to the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. This notion was supported by our observations that p85 was phosphorylatedin vitro in Lck immunoprecipitates only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells but not in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 9). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase, like p85, also could be co-immunoprecipitated with Lck in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells. In addition, binding between PI 3-kinase and Lck was observed in unstimulated S-EL4 and in R-EL4 cells, and phorbol ester stimulation slightly enhanced the association of PI 3-kinase with Lck in both cell lines (Fig. 11 B). Compared with the strong tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 signal in Lck immunoprecipitates from phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, the amount of PI 3-kinase p85 that associated with Lck seemed quite small. A potential explanation for this difference could be heavy tyrosine phosphorylation of the few Lck-associated PI 3-kinase molecules. Two potentially important tyrosine phosphoproteins, p120 and p85, have been identified in phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 cells. These two proteins were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in S-EL4 but not in R-EL4 cells, and phorbol ester stimulation enhanced their tyrosine phosphorylation only in sensitive cells (Fig. 1). P120 was identified as the c-Cbl protooncogene product by anti-Cbl immunoblotting, by comparison of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation between S- and R-EL4 cells, and by two-dimensional gel analysis (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Co-migration of p85 with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase on two-dimensional gel analysis and reactivity of Cbl- and Lck-associated p85 with the antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Figs. 10 and11) strongly argue that p85 is the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit. Association of c-Cbl with some signaling molecules has been observed in several cell lines (15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Google Scholar, 16Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Google Scholar) and also occurred in EL4 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed formation of complexes of c-Cbl with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with Lck in both S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells (Fig. 11, Aand B). Co-immunoprecipitation of c-Cbl with Lck was not observed. However, in vitro binding of c-Cbl with Lck SH2 or SH3 domains was detected in both cell lines (Fig. 8), suggesting that c-Cbl, Lck, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase may form a ternary complex. Failure to detect association of c-Cbl with Lck in immune complex may be due to weak or transient binding. Alternatively, c-Cbl may associate with Lck SH2 or SH3 domains indirectly via their association first with p85. While this might explain the lack of co-immunoprecipitation of Lck with c-Cbl and the weak Cbl-Lck SH2 association detected in vitro, the strong signal detected with the Lck-SH3 domain suggests some direct Cbl-Lck SH3 interaction. Complexes of Cbl-PI 3-kinase p85 and of Lck-PI 3-kinase p85 have been observed also in other cells (16Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and PI 3-kinase activity were observed in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates. After TCR stimulation, the association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with c-Cbl and the PI 3-kinase activity in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates was further enhanced. In addition to binding to c-Cbl, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase also was observed in Lck immunoprecipitates in IL-2-dependent helper and cytolytic T cell clones (46Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar). IL-2 stimulation not only enhanced the association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with Lck but also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Lck-associated PI 3-kinase (46Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase can bind to Lck SH2 or SH3 domains dependent on the cell lines examined (44Prasad K.V. Kapeller R. Janssen O. Repke H. Duke-Cohan J.S. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7708-7717Google Scholar, 45Vogel L.B. Fujita D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7408-7417Google Scholar). While the binding of PI 3-kinase p85 to Lck SH2 domains is largely phosphotyrosine-dependent, PI 3-kinase p85 binds to Lck SH3 domains through a proline-rich motif independent of phosphotyrosine (43Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Google Scholar). We also observed binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to Lck SH2 or SH3 domains in EL4 cells (data not shown) in addition to the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 to these domains (Fig. 7). Although S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells have comparable amounts of c-Cbl, PI 3-kinase, and Lck proteins and form complexes of Cbl-PI 3-kinase p85 and Lck-PI 3-kinase p85, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in these complexes becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells but not in unstimulated S-EL4 or in R-EL4 cells (Figs. 5 and 6), and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is greatly diminished in R-EL4 cells (Fig. 2). Since phosphotyrosine residues can bind SH2 domains, promoting protein-protein interaction (42Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar, 43Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and of the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit that associates with c-Cbl and Lck may promote the downstream signal transduction that contributes to the phorbol ester-stimulated responses in S-EL4 cells. Since this tyrosine phosphorylation happens rapidly after phorbol ester stimulation of S-EL4 cells (2 min), it may contribute to rapid phorbol ester-stimulated responses such as adherence to the substrate, which occurs 30 min after phorbol ester stimulation, as well as to late responses such as IL-2 production or growth inhibition. Although treatment of osteoclast-like cells with c-Cbl antisense did not inhibit cell adherence (47Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Google Scholar), potential roles for c-Cbl in lymphocyte adherence or other responses remain to be tested. Greatly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase that associates with c-Cbl or Lck in R-EL4 cells suggests that the tyrosine kinases for these proteins may be defective in R-EL4 cells. While the tyrosine kinases for c-Cbl have not been well examined, the fact that Lck can phosphorylate p85 in vitroonly in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells (Fig. 9) suggests that Lck may be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl- and Lck-associated PI 3-kinase p85. However, we cannot exclude the possible involvement of other tyrosine kinases. Lck is expressed in both S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells and undergoes autophosphorylation in both cell lines (Fig. 9), suggesting that it is not inactive in R-EL4 cells. Determination of whether mutation of some tyrosine phosphorylation sites in c-Cbl or PI 3-kinase p85 contributes to the greatly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins will require further investigation. In addition to possible defects in tyrosine kinases or tyrosine phosphorylation sites, it is possible that some upstream regulators for c-Cbl, PI 3-kinase p85, or Lck are defective in R-EL4 cells, accounting for the greatly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Several PKC isoforms (PKC-ε, -η, and -θ) exhibit greatly decreased expression in R-EL4 cells (48Homan E.C. Jensen D.E. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5676-5681Google Scholar, 49Resnick, M. S., Luo, X., Vinton, G., and Sando, J. J. (1997)Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar), raising the possibility that these PKC isoforms may contribute to the regulation of c-Cbl, PI 3-kinase p85, or Lck by serine or threonine phosphorylation in S-EL4 cells and facilitate phorbol ester-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. In conclusion, these studies have identified two potentially important phosphotyrosine proteins in EL4 cells, p120 and p85, as the c-Cbl protooncogene product and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. C-Cbl, Lck, and PI 3-kinase p85 proteins and complexes of Cbl-PI 3-kinase p85 and of Lck-PI 3-kinase p85 were observed in S-EL4 and R-EL4 cells; however, tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase p85 in these complexes was detected only in phorbol ester-stimulated S-EL4 cells, and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was much higher in S-EL4 than in R-EL4 cells, raising the possibility that these complexes and tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins may be important for phorbol ester-stimulated responses in S-EL4 cells. Understanding how PKC regulates these signaling molecules and which PKC isoforms may be involved will be of special interest in the future.
