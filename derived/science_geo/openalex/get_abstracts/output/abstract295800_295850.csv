https://openalex.org/W2071106922,"Recent developments in the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of large text files are described. The text analysis problem is examined, and modern approaches leading to the identification and retrieval of selected text items in response to search requests are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981101269,"Geological observations reveal that mid-ocean ridges are segmented by numerous rigid and nonrigid discontinuities. A hierarchy of segmentation, ranging from large, long-lived segments to others that are small, migratory, and transient, determines the pattern and timing of creation of new ocean floor. To the extent that spreading segments behave like giant cracks in a plate, the crack propagation force at segment tips increases with segment length, which may explain why long segments tend to lengthen and prevail over shorter neighboring segments. Partial melting caused by decompression of the upper mantle due to plate separation and changes in the direction of spreading result in the spawning of new short segments so that a balance of long and short segments is maintained."

The distribution of species in a core from Splan Pond in Atlantic Canada indicates that there were abrupt transitions in late-glacial temperatures between warm and cold states. The transitions are correlative with the well-known warm Allerød and cold Younger Dryas events in Europe. These data thus confirm the inference from palynological data that these events affected regions on both sides of the Atlantic."

Analysis of Voyager data shows that a radial distortion with an amplitude of approximately 30 kilometers is traveling through the ring arcs, a perturbation attributable to the nearby satellite Galatea. Moreover, the arcs appear to be azimuthally confined by a resonant interaction with the same satellite, yielding a maximum spread in ring particle semimajor axes of 0.6 kilometer and a spread in forced eccentricities large enough to explain the arcs' 15-kilometer radial widths. Additional ring arcs discovered in the course of this study give further support to this model."

This provided a unique opportunity to observe the comet's coma with the ultraviolet spectrometer orbiting the planet aboard the Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft when the coma was otherwise obscured from Earth's view by the sun's glare. More than 9000 data points acquired systematically over the 5-day period from 2 to 6 February were combined to construct an excellent Lyman-α image of the hydrogen coma. The Lyman-α image was successfully reproduced with a comprehensive physical model, thereby verifying and documenting the underlying chemical kinetics and dynamics of the hydrogen coma."
https://openalex.org/W1971020835,"Six months after Saddam Hussein's torching of more than 700 Kuwaiti oil wells, health officials, meteorologists, and environmental experts convened during mid-August in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to assess the impact of the fires. The soot cloud produced by the fires hasn't produced a nuclear winter, nor are the carbon dioxide and other gases released going to have an appreciable effect on global warming, although regional weather changes are possible. So far adverse health effects from the heavy pall of pollution caused by the fires have been surprisingly mild. This isn't to say that premature deaths will not occur, but many scientists had feared much worse. Nevertheless, all researchers concede that the data for this particular conclusion are still preliminary, and they expressed concerns that health problems may worsen in the coming months. Most of the health effects are expected in a region blanketed by a plume of smoke 800 to 1,000 kilometers long. The average concentrations of the primary pollutants it contains, carbon-based particles and sulfur dioxide, are similar to those in any large urban center. Still, the oil fires increase the pollution burden on Kuwait, which already had a problem with particulates in the air, and some epidemiologists expect thatmore » the extra pollutants will take their toll.« less"
