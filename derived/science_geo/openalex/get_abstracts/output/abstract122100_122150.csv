https://openalex.org/W2095480781,"Caveolae are plasma membrane specializations present in most cell types. Caveolin, a 22-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural and regulatory component of caveolae membranes. Previous studies have demonstrated that caveolin co-purifies with lipid modified signaling molecules, including G<sub>α</sub> subunits, H-Ras, c-Src, and other related Src family tyrosine kinases. In addition, it has been shown that caveolin interacts directly with G<sub>α</sub> subunits and H-Ras, preferentially recognizing the <i>inactive</i> conformation of these molecules. However, it is not known whether caveolin interacts directly or indirectly with Src family tyrosine kinases. Here, we examine the structural and functional interaction of caveolin with Src family tyrosine kinases. Caveolin was recombinantly expressed as a glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase fusion. Using an established <i>in vitro</i> binding assay, we find that caveolin interacts with wild-type Src (c-Src) but does not form a stable complex with mutationally activated Src (v-Src). Thus, it appears that caveolin prefers the <i>inactive</i> conformation of Src. Deletion mutagenesis indicates that the Src-interacting domain of caveolin is located within residues 82-101, a cytosolic membrane-proximal region of caveolin. A caveolin peptide derived from this region (residues 82-101) functionally suppressed the auto-activation of purified recombinant c-Src tyrosine kinase and Fyn, a related Src family tyrosine kinase. We further analyzed the effect of caveolin on c-Src activity <i>in vivo</i> by transiently co-expressing full-length caveolin and c-Src tyrosine kinase in 293T cells. Co-expression with caveolin dramatically suppressed the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src as measured via an immune complex kinase assay. Thus, it appears that caveolin structurally and functionally interacts with wild-type c-Src via caveolin residues 82-101. Besides interacting with Src family kinases, this cytosolic caveolin domain (residues 82-101) has the following unique features. First, it is required to form multivalent homo-oligomers of caveolin. Second, it interacts with G-protein α-subunits and down-regulates their GTPase activity. Third, it binds to wild-type H-Ras. Fourth, it is membrane-proximal, suggesting that it may be involved in other potential protein-protein interactions. Thus, we have termed this 20-amino acid stretch of caveolin residues the caveolin scaffolding domain."

Since superoxide (O2−•) ) generation is triggered during the early period of reperfusion the cytotoxic oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−) could be formed, but it is not known if this occurs. Therefore electron paramagnetic resonance and chemiluminescence studies were performed of the magnitude and time course of NO·, O2−•, and ONOO− formation in the postischemic heart. Isolated rat hearts were subjected either to normal perfusion or to reperfusion after 30 min of ischemia in the presence of the NO· trap Fe2+-N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate with electron paramagnetic resonance measurements performed on the effluent. Although only trace signals were present prior to ischemia, prominent NO· adduct signals were seen during the first 2 min of reflow which were abolished by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition. Similar studies with theO2−•trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide demonstrated a burst of O2.∑ generation over the first 2 min of reflow. Chemiluminescence measurements using 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (luminol) demonstrated a similar marked increase in ONOO− which was blocked by NOS inhibitors or superoxide dismutase. NOS inhibition or superoxide dismutase greatly enhanced the recovery of contractile function in postischemic hearts. Immunohistology demonstrated that the ONOO−-mediated nitration product nitrotyrosine was formed in postischemic hearts but not in normally perfused controls. Thus, NO· formation is increased during the early period of reflow and reacts with the early period of reflow and reacts with O2.∑ to form ONOO−, which results in amino acid nitration and cellular injury.

NO· is known to play an important role in blood pressure regulation, vascular tone, neural signaling, and immunological function (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). It is formed by a class of enzymes, nitric oxide synthases, which synthesize NO· from arginine. NO· binds to and activates guanylate cyclase resulting in the formation of the second messenger molecule cyclic GMP (2Ignarro L.J. Adams J.B. Horwitz P.M. Woods K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4997-5002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which accounts for many of the physiological effects of NO·. Beyond its homeostatic effects, it has been proposed that NO· can induce cellular injury either due to direct toxicity (3Drapier J.-C. Pellat C. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10162-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lancaster J.R. Hibbs J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that alterations in NO· formation are particularly important in the pathogenesis of the injury that occurs in ischemic and reperfused tissues. In the postischemic heart it has been reported that alterations in NO· result in altered endothelial function with impaired tissue perfusion (7Cooke J.P. Tsao P.S. Circulation. 1993; 88: 2451-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There has been considerable controversy regarding whether reperfusion results in increased or decreased NO· formation in the heart. Studies of endothelial function and vascular reactivity have been interpreted to suggest that NO· production is decreased in postischemic myocardium, and based on this evidence it was hypothesized that a loss of basal NO· production is an important source of postischemic injury (8Ma X.L. Weyrich A.S. Lefer D.J. Lefer A.M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 403-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, other studies have shown that inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) can dramatically protect against postischemic injury (9Morita K. Sherman M.P. Buckberg G.D. Ihnken K. Matheis G.

Woolfson R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). From these latter studies it was suggested that NO· may be involved in the process of tissue injury and that the production of NO· may actually be increased during reperfusion. Subsequent direct electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping measurements were performed which demonstrated that NO· formation is greatly increased in ischemic myocardium (11Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since it was demonstrated previously that there is a burst of O⨪2 generation in the postischemic heart, it was hypothesized that if NO· is also increased upon reperfusion it might react with this O⨪2, resulting in the formation of the potent cytotoxic oxidant ONOO− (6Beckman J.S. Nature. 1990; 345: 27-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although increased NO· and ONOO− has been hypothesized to be a critical biochemical mechanism of postischemic injury in the heart and in other tissues (9Morita K. Sherman M.P. Buckberg G.D. Ihnken K.

A. 1994; 91: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), there is only indirect evidence to support this since no direct measurements of NO· and ONOO− formation during reperfusion have been performed. Since NO· is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to a variety of metal chelates and metalloproteins, the distinctive EPR spectra of these nitroso complexes can serve as a quantitative measure of NO· generation (14Mordvintcev P. Mulsch A. Busse R. Vanin A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, the ferrous iron complex of N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD), Fe2+-MGD2 (Fe-MGD), has been shown to be suitable for measurement of NO· in living tissues (15Lai C.S. Komarov A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously using this EPR spin trapping technique that increased levels of NO· are generated in ischemic myocardium (11Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It also has been shown that 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (luminol)-enhanced luminescence can be used to specifically measure ONOO− formation (16Radi R. Consgrove T.P. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Further measurements of ONOO−-mediated protein damage with nitration of the amino acid tyrosine have been reported using specific antibodies directed against nitrotyrosine (17Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P. Chen J. Accavetti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to measure and characterize the process of NO· and ONOO− generation during postischemic reperfusion and to assess the functional importance of this process in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury. EPR spin trapping measurements of the relative magnitude and time course of NO· formation in the postischemic heart were performed using the NO· trap Fe-MGD. These measurements were correlated with EPR measurements of oxygen radical generation using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and measurements of ONOO− formation performed using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. To assess the functional importance of this process in the pathogenesis of myocardial injury, hemodynamic studies of the recovery of contractile function were also performed, in the presence and absence of NOS inhibition or superoxide dismutase (SOD), along with histochemical measurements of the formation of the ONOO−-mediated nitration product nitrotyrosine. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were heparinized with 500 units of heparin and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital at a dose of 30-35 mg/kg. The hearts were excised rapidly, and the ascending aorta was cannulated and perfused at 37°C with a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs bicarbonate perfusate (in mM: 16.7 glucose, 120.0 NaCl, 25.0 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 5.9 KCl, and 1.2 MgCl2), which was bubbled continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas. Two side arms in the perfusion line located just proximal to the heart cannula allowed infusion of treatment agents and spin traps directly into the heart. Coronary flow was measured continuously using a Transonic flowmeter, model HT107, with a 2N in-line flow probe. A fluid-filled latex balloon was inserted into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and secured with a ligature around the left atrium. The balloon was initially inflated to an end-diastolic pressure of 8-12 mm Hg and connected to a pressure transducer via a hydraulic line. Left ventricular pressures were recorded with a Gould model RS3400 recorder and stored along with coronary flow values using a MacLab system. Subsequently, the left ventricular developed pressure (the difference between peak-systolic and end-diastolic pressures) and the rate pressure product (product of heart rate and left ventricular developed pressure) were calculated as indexes of contractile function. Hearts were allowed to stabilize for 10-15 min prior to initiating the experimental protocol. For measurements of NO·, the Fe-MGD spin trap complex was infused through one of the side arms with a final concentration of 2 mM in Fe(II) and 10 mM in MGD. Spin trap-containing effluent was collected in 20-s aliquots prior to 30 min of global ischemia and during the first 2 min of reflow as well as after 5 and 15 min of reperfusion. While samples were collected, heart perfusion was switched from constant pressure to constant flow at 9 ml/min via a syringe infusion pump. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 77 K until EPR measurement. The protocol for oxygen radical trapping was identical to that utilized for NO· except that the spin trap DMPO was used, with experiments performed in the dark to minimize any light-induced DMPO degradation. DMPO was purchased from Aldrich and purified further by double distillation. All reported spin trapping studies were repeated in a series of at least three hearts for each protocol or treatment. EPR spectra were recorded in flat cells at room temperature with a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with 100-kHz modulation frequency and a TM110 cavity, as described previously (18Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microwave frequency and magnetic field were measured precisely with an EIP 575 microwave frequency counter and Bruker ER 035M NMR gaussmeter. Relative quantitation of the NO· and oxygen free radical signals was performed by double integration. Luminol chemiluminescence was used for measurement of ONOO− in the coronary effluent. An alkaline solution containing 5 mM Na2CO3 and 40 μM luminol, pH 9.2, was infused during the 1st or 2nd min of reflow and after 5 and 15 min of reflow with samples collected in 10-s intervals and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were directly transferred and thawed in the measurement chambers of a six-channel Berthold multi-Biolumat LB9505C luminometer. After either normal perfusion or 45 min of reperfusion hearts were quickly removed from the cannula, and the ventricles were sliced into 3-4 mm-thick sections and immersed immediately in 10% formalin at 4°C. Histological processing was done by conventional methods (20DeLellis R.A. Basic Techniques of Immunohistochemistry. Masson, New York1981Google Scholar). The formalin-fixed paraffin sections were cleared in xylene for 5 min and then rehydrated and washed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6 (TBS). To block any naturally occurring biotin within the tissue, the slides were preincubated with 0.1 mg/ml avidin for 20 min, then rinsed in TBS and incubated in 0.05 mg/ml biotin for 20 min. The sections were quenched with 7.5% H2O2 methanol solution for 20 min. The slides were rinsed in a TBS/milk solution (0.5% Carnation milk) and blocked with TBS, milk, 1% normal goat serum for 10 min. The sections were incubated for 60 min with the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody, at a 1:25 dilution in a solution of TBS, milk, 1% normal goat serum. After the primary incubation, the slides were rinsed in TBS/milk and incubated with the biotinylated secondary for 30 min and then rinsed again and incubated with the tertiary, ExtrAvidin alkaline phosphatase, diluted 1:800 in Tris buffer, pH 8.2, for 60 min and then washed a final time. Fast red was used as the substrate and produces a red reaction when exposed to the tertiary (20DeLellis R.A. Basic Techniques of Immunohistochemistry. Masson, New York1981Google Scholar). The stained sections were counterstained with 5er's modified hematoxylin, washed in ethanol solutions, cleared with xylene, and coverslipped. All incubations were performed at 24°C in a humidity chamber, and all rinses were for 5 min each. Each tissue block was stained with and without the primary antibody to monitor any background staining. MGD was synthesized as described previously (11Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21Shinoby L.A. Jones S.G. Jones M.M. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 54: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized in a quenched flow reactor from the reaction of an aqueous 0.6 M HCl, 0.7 M H2O2 solution with a solution of 0.6 mM nitrite as described previously (5Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6591) Google Scholar). Perfusate reagents, bovine erythrocyte copper zinc SOD, L-NAME, L-NMMA, uric acid, H2O2, sodium nitrite, avidin, and ExtrAvidin alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma. S-Nitrosoacetylpenicillamine was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA); sodium heparin was from Elkins Sinn, Inc. (Cherry Hill, NJ); and sodium pentobarbital was from Steris Laboratories, Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the groups were calculated using two-way analysis of variance. p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Preischemic and postischemic measurements of NO· formation were performed from the coronary effluent of hearts infused with the NO· trap Fe-MGD. Hearts were infused with Fe-MGD for 30 s, and the effluent was sampled. The hearts were then allowed to reequilibrate in the absence of Fe-MGD for 5 min and were then subjected to 30 min of global ischemia. The hearts were then reperfused in the presence of Fe-MGD with effluent collected in 20-s aliquots. No EPR spectrum was observed from the Fe-MGD complex in Krebs bicarbonate buffer; however, after addition of the NO· donor compound S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine (50 nM) a prominent triplet EPR spectrum was observed due to formation of the NO·Fe-MGD complex with a characteristic central g value of 2.04 and hyperfine splitting of 12.7 G (Fig. 1, A and B). Although only a trace signal was observed in the effluent of hearts perfused with Fe-MGD prior to ischemia, a prominent triplet spectrum, similar to that seen with the NO· donor, was observed from the effluent of rat hearts reperfused after 30-min global ischemia (Fig. 1, C and D). In measurements performed in a series of four hearts, more than a 30-fold increase in the NO·Fe-MGD signal was observed during the first 20 s of reflow followed by a decline over the 1st min, but it still remained more than 10-fold elevated above preischemic values. Subsequently, a second peak occurred during the 2nd min of reflow after which the observed signal intensity gradually declined (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). After 5 min of reperfusion, the NO·Fe-MGD signal declined toward but remained higher than preischemic values. In additional series of hearts that were pretreated with 1.0 mM concentrations of either of the NOS inhibitors L-NAME or L-NMMA, no increase was seen after reperfusion with more than 80% inhibition of the reperfusion-associated increase observed (Fig. 3). Spin trapping measurements of oxygen radical generation were performed in hearts in a manner identical to that performed for NO·, except that the spin trap DMPO was infused at a final concentration of 40 mM. When hearts were subjected to 30 min of 37°C global ischemia followed by reperfusion, prominent radical generation was observed during the early period of reflow, as described previously (18Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to ischemia, however, only trace signals were seen. The observed signal was a 1:2:2:1 quartet with aN = aH = 14.9 G, indicative of DMPO-OH (Fig. 4). The time course of this radical generation was measured in a series of four hearts, and it was observed that peak radical generation occurred over the 1st min of reperfusion, peaking after 20-60 s of reflow followed by a gradual decline to preischemic levels by 5 min post-reflow (Fig. 5). To determine if the observed DMPO-OH signal was derived from O⨪2, similar experiments were performed in which a series of hearts was subjected to reperfusion in the presence of 200 units/ml SOD. In these SOD-treated hearts no signal was seen either before or after reperfusion. Since SOD totally quenched the observed DMPO-OH signal, this suggested that this radical adduct was derived from O⨪2. It is well known that the DMPO superoxide adduct, DMPO-OOH, can rapidly react or be metabolized to form DMPO-OH in biological systems (22Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 262-265PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of NOS inhibition on the process of oxygen radical generation further experiments were performed in a series of hearts that were pretreated with 1 mML-NAME, as described above. As shown in Fig. 5, a similar magnitude and time course of radical generation were seen in these L-NAME-treated hearts, indicating that L-NAME neither quenched nor enhanced radical formation. A small 20-25% decrease in the radical signals was seen over the first 40 s of reflow; however, this was not statistically significant. To detect ONOO− generated in situ, hearts were perfused with an alkaline solution of perfusate containing 5 mM Na2CO3 along with the luminescence enhancer luminol, 40 μM. When the pH is raised above 9 the process of ONOO− protonation and decomposition is slowed greatly (5Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6591) Google Scholar), so that it becomes possible to stabilize and detect ONOO− ex vivo by luminol chemiluminescence. Although only a very weak luminol chemiluminescence signal was observed from the effluent of normally perfused hearts prior to ischemia, upon reperfusion following 30 min of global 37°C ischemia the intensity of luminol luminescence markedly increased over the 1st min of reperfusion reaching a maximum after 40 s, with more than a 10-fold increase seen (Fig. 6). Subsequently a gradual decline was observed with values returning to base line by 15 min. This luminescence was quenched when hearts were reperfused in the presence of 200 units/ml SOD and markedly decreased in hearts pretreated with L-NAME or L-NMMA (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). With L-NAME-treated hearts, increased background luminescence was observed both in preischemic and postischemic samples; however, the reperfusion-associated increase in luminol luminescence was quenched. In L-NMMA-treated hearts, less increase in background occurred, and again the reperfusion-associated increase in luminescence was blocked with more than a 6-fold decrease observed. Thus, inhibition of NOS greatly decreased the observed luminol luminescence, suggesting that it was derived from NO· synthesized by NOS. When hearts were reperfused in the presence of the ONOO− scavenger urate, the observed luminescence was quenched totally, further demonstrating that this luminescence was derived from ONOO−. In repeat experiments performed with SOD, L-NAME, L-NMMA, or urate, with four hearts/group, similar results were obtained with highly significant quenching of luminescence with each of these treatments, p < 0.001 versus untreated control for each group (Fig. 7). To further confirm that the chemiluminescence observed in these studies was derived specifically from ONOO−, experiments were performed in which the pH of effluent solutions was lowered to pH 7.4 just prior to measurement, and it was observed that the luminescence was quenched. In further experiments with the addition of 50 mM DMPO to these samples no radical signals were observed, further confirming that no measurable radical generation continued in these effluent samples after exiting the coronary circulation. These experiments suggested that the observed luminol chemiluminescence was specifically due to ONOO−. To determine if ONOO−-mediated cellular injury with amino acid nitration occurred in reperfused myocardium, experiments were performed measuring the formation of the specific ONOO−-mediated nitration product nitrotyrosine. A specific affinity-purified nitrotyrosine antibody was used with measurements performed on normally perfused control heart tissue and on tissue from hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion. To establish a positive control, a series of hearts were perfused with 1 mM ONOO− for 5 min. In these positive controls, strong dense red staining was seen in a vascular distribution pattern indicative of high concentrations of nitrotyrosine formed at the site of endothelial or vascular proteins coming into direct contact with the infused ONOO− (Fig. 8A). In normally perfused control heart tissue, little if any positive staining was observed (Fig. 8B). In the postischemic myocardium, however, strong positive red staining for nitrotyrosine was observed within myocytes (Fig. 8). This positive nitrotyrosine staining was either diffusely or focally increased within the reperfused myocardium. In control experiments with postischemic myocardium in the absence of the primary nitrotyrosine antibody, no staining was observed. These experiments suggest that ONOO− is formed in postischemic myocardium and results in nitration of proteins within cardiac myocytes. To assess the importance of the reperfusion-associated increase of NO· and ONOO− formation in the process of postischemic injury, experiments were performed measuring the recovery of contractile function in a series of hearts reperfused after 30 min of ischemia. Three groups of hearts were studied: untreated control, pretreated with 1 mML-NAME, or treated with 200 units/ml SOD during the first 5 min of reflow, with eight hearts in each group. Base-line contractile function and coronary flow values were identical in each of these groups with left ventricular developed pressures of 164 ± 4 mm Hg, rate pressure product values of 34.3 ± 2.2 × 103 mm Hg/min, and coronary flow values of 19.8 ± 0.8 ml/min. In the control untreated hearts, marked injury was seen upon reperfusion with a final recovery of only 8.7 ± 1.8% of the preischemic rate-pressure product. As shown in Fig. 9, both L-NAME and SOD resulted in greatly enhanced recovery of contractile function with final recovered rate pressure product of 24 ± 2% or 27 ± 2.6%, respectively. Thus, with either L-NAME or SOD, a similar almost 3-fold increase in functional recovery was observed throughout the time course of reflow. In either untreated control hearts or hearts treated with SOD, a similar recovery of coronary flow was observed with final recoveries of 60 ± 6% and 56.3 ± 6%, respectively. In hearts pretreated with L-NAME, however, lower values of coronary flow of 27.5 ± 4% were observed throughout the time course of reflow as expected due to the inhibition of endothelial NOS (Fig. 10). These results suggest that both NO· and O⨪2 generation were required for the occurrence of myocardial reperfusion injury with impaired contractile function and therefore suggest that much of the observed injury is mediated by ONOO−. Over the last decade much evidence has accumulated demonstrating that O⨪2 and O⨪2-derived oxygen radicals are important mediators of postischemic injury in the heart. Early studies demonstrated that SOD could decrease cell death and enhance the recovery of contractile function (23Kukreja R.C. Hess M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Subsequent direct and spin trapping EPR measurements demonstrated that a burst of O⨪2 and O⨪2-derived radical generation occurs during the early period of reperfusion (18Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4917) Google Scholar). Although in these early studies the role of NO· was as yet unrecognized, over the last several years much attention has focused on the potential interaction of these oxygen radicals with NO·. A number of studies have shown that NO· reacts rapidly with O⨪2 to form ONOO− (5Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many of the actions of IL-13 are also exhibited by another T-cell-derived cytokine, IL-4, with which it shares approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity. These shared activities include down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C.

Although almost all functions of IL-13 are shared by IL-4, IL-4 additionally exerts unique effects, including the ability to induce responses on certain cell types, including T cells, which do not respond to IL-13 (7Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Google Scholar). Although the receptor for IL-4 on T cells was found to contain both the 140-kDa IL-4-binding protein (denoted IL-4R or IL-4Rα) and the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) (8Russell S.M. Keegan A.D.

Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Google Scholar), it was subsequently demonstrated that IL-4 could also induce actions on nonhematopoietic cells such as COS-7 cells and renal cell carcinoma lines that expressed IL-4Rα but not γc or the γc-associated signaling molecule Janus kinase 3 (10Lin J.-X.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar). These data indicated that there are two classes of IL-4 receptor: the type I IL-4 receptor (containing IL-4Rα and γc), which is expressed on a number of lineages, including T cells, B cells, and monocytes; and the type II IL-4 receptor (containing IL-4Rα and another protein originally denoted γ′), which is not expressed on T cells but is expressed on certain other cell types (10Lin J.-X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; : 331-339Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether the exact signals induced by these two types of IL-4 receptors are identical, it is clear that IL-4 can activate signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 via either type of receptor (10Lin J.-X.

Since antibodies to IL-4Rα could block IL-13 action even though IL-13 could not bind to IL-4Rα (10Lin J.-X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J.

Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; : 331-339Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with biochemical data that IL-13 can partially compete for binding of IL-4 to cells responding to both IL-4 and IL-13 (11Zurawski S.M. Chomarat P. Djossou O. Bidaud C. McKenzie A.N. Miossec P. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13869-13878Google Scholar), with the ability of both IL-4 and IL-13 to chemically cross-link to ∼65 kDa proteins (12Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

The ability of IL-4 and IL-13 to act through a shared type II IL-4 receptor (10Lin J.-X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J.

A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that overexpression of murine IL-13Rα in COS cells showed specific binding of 125I-labeled murine IL-13 that could not be competed by murine IL-4 (a finding likely explained by the inability of murine IL-4 to bind to the primate IL-4Rα constitutively expressed on COS cells); however, when CTLL-2 cells were transfected with murine IL-13Rα, both IL-4 and IL-13 could cross-compete with each other for binding to the cells (16Hilton D.J.

We now report the cloning of a human IL-13Rα cDNA, which together with IL-4Rα allows high affinity IL-13 binding. interleukin interleukin receptor α chain cytokine receptor γ chain polymerase chain reaction base pair. A cDNA library in λZap-II (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) was prepared from mRNA from human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I-transformed MT-2 cells. Based on the sequence of the murine IL-13Rα cDNA (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Wilson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar), primers were selected and evaluated for their ability to generate by PCR from DNA from this library a band that was appropriate in size for IL-13Rα. In this fashion, we found that the MT-2 cDNA library contained human IL-13Rα. A total of 6 × 105 phage clones were plated on LB plates using XL1-Blue MRF′ cells as plating bacteria, and plaques were transferred onto nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) for hybridization. As described under “Results,” a 431-bp probe was generated by PCR by using primers from two Expressed Sequence Tags clones that appeared to correspond to human IL-13Rα. This probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim DNA labeling kit) and hybridized with membranes in 5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA containing 0.1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65°C. Secondary screening was performed with the eluted primary plaques as described above to obtain pure positive plaques. The pBluescript phagemid was excised in vivo from the positive phage clones using Ex-Assist helper phage and XL1-Blue MRF′ bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The phagemids were propagated in XLOLR cells, plasmid DNA was purified, and DNA from each clone was sequenced both on an Applied Biosystems 431 automated sequencer and by manual sequencing using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Multiple tissue poly(A)+ Northern blots (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized with a random-primed, labeled 909-bp PCR-amplified probe corresponding to nucleotides 168-1076 of human IL-13Rα, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) at 60°C, washed for 40 min in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.05% SDS at room temperature, followed by 40 min at 50°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. 293T+ and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Full-length IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18S. 293T+ cells were transfected at 50% confluence using calcium phosphate precipitation reagents (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc.). Briefly, 61 μl of 1 M CaCl2 was mixed with 5 μg of plasmid DNA plus H20 to 500 μl. DNA precipitation buffer (500 μl) was added gently, and the mixture was added to 293 T+ cells covered with 30 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed after 16 h, and cells were harvested after 24-36 h. COS-7 cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran by standard methods. 125I-Labeled human IL-4 (927 Ci/mmol) and 125I-labeled human IL-2 (885 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. Human IL-13 was labeled to a specific activity of 1135 Ci/mmol with 125I (Amersham) and IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) as described previously (12Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar). Binding was performed for the indicated times on ice in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) and the appropriate unlabeled and iodinated ligands (IL-4, IL-13, or IL-2). For affinity-labeling experiments, cells to which 125I-labeled cytokines had been bound were pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM MgCl2. The bifunctional water-soluble chemical cross-linker BS3 (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were then further incubated for 20 min on ice. After termination of the reaction with 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.875% Brij, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA) and lysates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For binding assays, after the incubation period, cells were centrifuged through 20% olive oil and 80% dibutyl phthalate, tubes were frozen on dry ice, and bound and free fractions were separated by cutting the tubes and counted on a γ counter. Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (17Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). The NIGMS somatic cell hybrid mapping panel 2 was obtained from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). Human-specific IL-13Rα PCR primers were designed (sense, nucleotides 957-979; antisense, nucleotides 1104-1077; see Fig. 1), and these primers were used to analyze DNA from cell hybrids to specify the chromosome bearing the human IL-13Rα gene. The sequence for murine IL-13Rα cDNA (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Wilson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar) was used to search for homologous sequences in the data base of the Expressed Sequence Tags, and two partial human clones of unknown function were identified. One clone (GenBank accession number H57074) exhibited an 81% match to nucleotides 406-550 of murine IL-13Rα, whereas another clone (GenBank accession number H89334) was 76% identical to nucleotides 804-985. Primer pairs based on these human sequences were prepared. Using plasmid DNA made from MT-2 and peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA libraries as templates, we identified primer pairs that could amplify human cDNA fragments of the size anticipated based on the murine IL-13Rα sequence. A 431-bp PCR product was gel purified and sequenced. The sequence showed 80% homology to murine IL-13Rα, indicating that it corresponded to human IL-13Rα. This PCR product was then used to screen a λZap-II library made from MT-2 cells, and 11 hybridizing clones were sequenced. A full-length clone of 1572 bp was identified; it contained an 84-bp-long 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame encoding 427 amino acids (calculated molecular weight of 48,774), and a 204-bp-long 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The sequence around the predicted ATG start codon had Kozak consensus sequences typical of translation start sites (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). At the N terminus was a hydrophobic region consistent with a signal peptide. We analyzed residues 15-34 as potential signal peptide cleavage sites by summing the weight matrices for positions −12 to +2 for each of these residues; these positions most accurately predict the site of cleavage (19von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Google Scholar). The highest score was obtained for glycine 21, with a total weight matrix of 7.52. A cleavage site after this glycine also fulfills the other suggested criteria for the signal peptide cleavage site, including a small amino acid in position −1, no aromatic or charged residue at −3, and the absence of proline from positions −3 to +1 (20von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar). Thus, we predict that the first 21 amino acids represent the signal peptide. This prediction is consistent with a hydrophobicity plot of the IL-13Rα amino acid sequence using the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (data not shown). Based on the hydrophobicity plot, the transmembrane domain was predicted to span amino acids 344-367. Like other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (21de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar), a WSXWS motif and four conserved cysteine residues were found in the extracellular domain of IL-13Rα (Fig. 1, boxed). A total of 11 potential N-linked carbohydrate addition sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) are present in the extracellular domain, including one that is contained within the WSXWS motif. The open reading frame of human IL-13Rα has 81% nucleotide and 76% amino acid identity with the published murine IL-13Rα sequence (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Wilson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar) and contains 3 additional amino acids (Fig. 2). Interestingly, 57 of the 60 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain (95%) are identical in human and murine IL-13Rα, underscoring the likely significance of this region in signal transduction. The expression pattern of human IL-13Rα was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). Two species of mRNA of approximately 4.0 and 2.0 kilobases were detected (Fig. 3). Expression of IL-13Rα mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest levels in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and ovary and the lowest levels in brain, lung, and kidney. The high level of expression in skeletal muscle was interesting, since murine IL-13Rα mRNA was not detected in this tissue (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Wilson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Google Scholar). Like murine IL-13Rα, human IL-13Rα also exhibits two principal transcripts (5.2 and 2.2 kilobases for murine IL-13Rα; Ref. 15Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Google Scholar; 4.0 and 2.0 kilobases for human IL-13Rα), presumably reflecting alternative polyadenylation in each case. As expected, the human mRNAs are each longer than our full-length cDNA, which did not contain a consensus AATAAA polyadenylation sequence and, therefore, presumably does not contain the entire 3′-untranslated region. To examine the binding specificity of human IL-13Rα, we performed affinity-labeling experiments in which 125I-labeled human IL-13 or IL-4 was bound and cross-linked to 293T+ fibroblasts that had been transfected with IL-13Rα, IL-4Rα, or both IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα. No signal was detected except in cells transfected with both IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα (Fig. 4A). In cells transfected with both cDNAs, a major 75-80-kDa band was seen, presumably reflecting the cross-linking of 125I-labeled human IL-13 (12-13 kDa) to IL-13Rα, thus resulting in an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa for IL-13Rα (although the calculated molecular weight for this protein is 48,774, the presence of multiple glycosylation sites presumably explains its slower migration on gels). In addition, a larger band corresponding to affinity-labeled IL-4Rα was also seen. Both bands were competed when a 500-fold molar excess of either unlabeled IL-13 and IL-4 were added in the binding phase (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 125I-labeled human IL-4 was cross-linked mainly to the 140-kDa IL-4Rα chain in a fashion that was independent of coexpression of IL-13Rα (Fig. 4B). In cells transfected with both IL-4Rα and IL-13R, in addition to affinity-labeled IL-4Rα, a weak 75-80-kDa band corresponding to affinity-labeled IL-13Rα was also observed. The appearance of both of these affinity-labeled bands was competed by excess unlabeled IL-4 or IL-13 in the binding phase, whereas in cells transfected only with IL-4Rα, only IL-4 and not IL-13 competed the binding of 125I-IL-4 to IL-4Rα. These results were confirmed in binding assays. Corresponding to the affinity-labeling experiments, significant specific binding of 125I-IL-13 was observed only when both receptor chains were expressed on 293T+ cells and either excess IL-4 or IL-13 could compete the binding. The minimal IL-13 binding activity detected when cells were transfected with only IL-13Rα (Fig. 5A) is consistent with the low binding affinity of murine IL-13Rα for murine IL-13 (2-10 nM; Ref. 15Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of IL-4Rα resulted in significant binding of 125I-IL-4, and additional expression of IL-13Rα only slightly increased this binding (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the affinity-labeling experiments, unlabeled IL-13 could not compete with the binding of 125I-IL-4 in the absence of IL-13Rα. In cells transfected with both IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα, however, IL-13 displaced approximately 80% of specifically bound 125I-IL-4 (Fig. 5B), consistent with previously published results in COS cells (11Zurawski S.M.

Cells were incubated with a 200 pM concentration of 125I-IL-13 (A) or 125I-IL-4 (B) in the presence or absence of a 500-fold molar excess of IL-4 or IL-13 for 3 h at 4°C. Bound and free radioactivity were determined. An experiment representative of four independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the kinetics of binding of IL-13 to its receptor, we incubated 293T+ cells cotransfected with IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα with 125I-IL-13 in the presence or absence of 500-fold excess unlabeled IL-13 and analyzed the bound radioactivity at different times. As shown in Fig. 6A, the specific binding of 125I-IL-13 steadily increased over 6 h, after which time binding equilibrium was achieved. Based on this slow on rate, displacement experiments for Scatchard analysis were performed after 6 h of binding at 4°C. Consistent with a previous report (11Zurawski S.M. Chomarat P. Djossou O. Bidaud C. McKenzie A.N. Miossec P. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13869-13878Google Scholar), IL-4 bound more rapidly, with equilibrium being achieved by 2 h (data not shown). We also examined the dissociation of the ligand receptor complex for IL-13. Cells were incubated with 125I-IL-13 for 6 h, washed twice, resuspended in binding buffer, and incubated on ice. After 5 h, only 20% of the bound radioactivity was released into the medium (data not shown). These data indicate that IL-13 has slower on and off rates than does IL-4. Formal Scatchard analysis revealed that IL-13 bound with a Kd of approximately 400 pM to cells transfected with both IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα (Fig. 6, B and C). The binding and affinity-labeling experiments together confirm that a receptor complex consisting of human IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα can efficiently bind either IL-4 or IL-13, and that in this context IL-4 and IL-13 can compete for the same binding sites. All known cytokines of the cytokine receptor superfamily use multimerized forms (homodimers, heterodimers, or higher order oligomers) of receptors for signaling. According to the current understanding, one receptor chain functions as a primary ligand-binding protein, and the accessory receptor chain(s) are then recruited to form the functional multimerized receptor complex, which has a higher affinity for the ligand than the primary binding subunit. For IL-4 and IL-13, it is clear from the affinity-labeling experiments that IL-4 more efficiently cross-links to IL-4Rα, whereas IL-13 more efficiently cross-links to IL-13Rα. The weak binding of IL-13 to cells expressing human IL-13Rα was therefore unexpected, since IL-4 shows substantial binding to IL-4Rα. In contrast, human IL-13 needs the expression of both IL-13Rα and IL-4Rα for efficient binding. The relatively poor binding of IL-13 for IL-13Rα suggests that IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα may have certain affinity for each other and that a heterodimer of these chains might exist in the absence of ligand. The development of antibodies will facilitate the ability to address this question. In this regard, it is interesting that in addition to ligand binding sites, the growth hormone receptor also contains a receptor-receptor dimerization surface (site 3) (21de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). Although site 3 is not sufficient by itself to allow growth hormone receptor dimerization, in the presence of ligand it significantly stabilizes the receptor dimer. It remains to be determined whether IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα can interact in the absence of ligand. It is useful to also consider the possibility that the receptor for IL-13 may contain a third, as of yet unrecognized, receptor component. A precedent for such a model is provided by analogy to the IL-2 receptor system in which IL-2 binds very poorly to IL-2Rβ (22Johnson K. Choi Y. Wu Z. Ciardelli T. Granzow R. Whalen C. Sana T. Pardee G. Smith K. Creasey A. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 23-34Google Scholar, 23Sana T.R. Wu Z. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 17: 5838-5845Google Scholar), even though this binding is a prerequisite for interaction of the common γc. However, IL-2 binding to IL-2Rβ is greatly facilitated by its binding to IL-2Rα (24Wu Z. Johnson K.W. Choi Y. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16045-16051Google Scholar), a receptor-binding protein that is not part of the cytokine receptor superfamily (25Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar) but which has a much faster on rate for IL-2 than IL-2Rβ (26Wang H.-M. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1055-1069Google Scholar, 27Lowenthal J.W. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1156-1161Google Scholar). It is conceivable that such an additional receptor component could also exist for IL-13, although at present, no definitive biochemical data indicate the existence of such a protein. IL-4Rα can form a functional IL-4 receptor in combination with γc (8Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A. Puri R.K. Paul W.E. Leonard W.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1880-1883Google Scholar, 9Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Google Scholar). The fact that both IL-13Rα and γc can interact with IL-4Rα to form functional IL-4 receptors implies that IL-13Rα and γc may share at least one epitope for IL-4 binding, even though the extracellular domains of γc and IL-13Rα share only 18% sequence identity (overall homology is 14%). Since IL-2 and IL-4 share related structures containing four α helices in an “up-up-down-down” configuration (28Wlowawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1373-1382Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to assume that they contact similar regions of γc, we asked whether IL-13Rα might also share an epitope with γc for IL-2 binding. However, affinity-labeling studies showed that 125I-IL-2 could not bind to COS cells when these cells were transfected with IL-13Rα together with IL-2Rβ, although, as expected, it could affinity label cells transfected with both IL-2Rβ and γc (Fig. 7). These data show that IL-13Rα binding is specific for IL-4 and IL-13. However, in addition to their being similar in size, it is noteworthy that the genes encoding γc and IL-13Rα are both located on the X chromosome (Fig. 8). In view of the expression of IL-13Rα in multiple tissues, it is conceivable that mutations in IL-13Rα may result in a severe or even lethal phenotype. This will be clarified by targeted deletion of IL-13Rα in mice.Fig. 8Localization of the human IL-13Rα gene to chromosome X. A panel of 24 DNA samples from mostly monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids were analyzed by PCR using primers specific for human IL-13Rα. A specific band of 148 bp was amplified reproducibly from two hybrids, one containing only human chromosome X and the other containing both human chromosomes 1 and X, indicating that the gene encoding human IL-13Rα is located on human chromosome X. The human chromosomes contained in each hybrid are indicated. As controls, human genomic DNA (hu.gen.DNA) and murine (Mu) and human (Hu) IL-13Rα cDNAs were included as templates for the PCR reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since submission of this manuscript, Caput et al. (29Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar) have reported the cloning of an IL-13-binding protein that is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, providing biochemical proof of the existence of a third receptor component. Thus, we hypothesize that the high affinity human IL-13 receptor contains the protein we have cloned, the one cloned by Caput et al. (29Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar), and IL-4Rα. It may make sense for investigators in the IL-4 and IL-13 fields to reconsider the nomenclature for the receptor subunits, since by analogy to the IL-2 receptor system, the protein cloned by Caput et al. (29Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Google Scholar) is most similar to IL-2Rα (since it has a relatively short cytoplasmic domain and exhibits good binding for its cognate cytokine) and the protein cloned by Hilton et al. (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Wilson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1980219322,"Many integral membrane proteins contain tyrosine-based signals within their cytoplasmic domains that mediate internalization from the cell surface and targeting to lysosomal compartments. Internalization depends on an interaction of the tyrosine-based signals with the clathrin-associated adaptor complex AP-2 at the plasma membrane, whereas lysosomal targeting involves interaction of the signals with an analogous complex, AP-1, at the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network. Recent studies have identified the medium chains μ<sub>2</sub> of AP-2 and μ<sub>1</sub> of AP-1 as the recognition molecules for tyrosine-based signals. We have now investigated the structural determinants for interaction of the signals with μ<sub>2</sub> and μ<sub>1</sub>. The position of the signals was found to be an important determinant of interactions with μ<sub>2</sub> and μ<sub>1</sub>; signals were most effective when present at the carboxyl terminus of a polypeptide sequence. Another important determinant of interactions was the identity of residues surrounding the critical tyrosine residue. Mutation of some residues affected interactions with μ<sub>2</sub> and μ<sub>1</sub> similarly, whereas other mutations had differential effects. These observations suggest that both the position and the exact sequence of tyrosine-based sorting signals are major determinants of selectivity in their interaction with clathrin-associated adaptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2135920982,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two structural genes, ACS1 and ACS2, each encoding an active acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. Characterization of enzyme activities in cell-free extracts from strains expressing either of the two genes revealed differences in the catalytic properties of the two enzymes. The Km for acetate of Acs1p was about 30-fold lower than that of Acs2p and Acs1p, but not Acs2p, could use propionate as a substrate. Enzyme activity measurements and mRNA analyses showed that ACS1 and ACS2 were both expressed during carbon-limited growth on glucose, ethanol, and acetate in aerobic chemostat cultures. In anaerobic glucose-limited cultures, only the ACS2 gene was expressed. Based on these facts, the products of the ACS1 and ACS2 genes were identified as the previously described “aerobic” and “non-aerobic” forms of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, respectively. Batch and glucose-pulse experiments revealed that transcription of ACS1 is subject to glucose repression. A mutant strain lacking Acs2p was unable to grow on glucose in batch cultures, but grew readily in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures, in which the low residual glucose concentration alleviated glucose repression. Experiments in which ethanol was pulsed to aerobic ethanol-limited chemostat cultures indicated that, in addition to glucose, ethanol also repressed ACS1 transcription, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, transcription of ACS2 was slightly induced by ethanol and glucose. Absence of ACS2 prevented complete glucose repression of ACS1, indicating that ACS2 (in)directly is involved in the transcriptional regulation of ACS1.

When Saccharomyces cerevisiae grows on acetate or ethanol, ATP-dependent activation of acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A is catalyzed by acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1). In addition to serving as the fuel for the citric acid cycle, acetyl-coenzyme A is an essential building block for the synthesis of lipids and some amino acids. During growth on glucose, direct formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate is catalyzed by the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Alternatively, conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-coenzyme A can be accomplished by the concerted action of the enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass: pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (1Holzer H. Goedde W.H. Biochem. Z. 1957; 329: 175-191Google Scholar, 2Pronk J.T. Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A.H. Klaassen C.C.M. Scheffers W.A. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 601-610Google Scholar). Recent work has indicated that the latter pathway is essential for growth, probably for the provision of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A required for lipid synthesis (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar, 4Flikweert M.T. Van der Zanden L. Janssen W.M.T.M. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a completely respiratory sugar metabolism is only observed at relatively low growth rates in aerobic, sugar-limited cultures (e.g. chemostat cultures). Upon exposure of such cultures to high sugar concentrations, metabolism becomes respirofermentative and pyruvate metabolism occurs predominantly via pyruvate decarboxylase (5Petrik M. Käppeli O. Fiechter A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 135: 43-49Google Scholar, 6Van Urk H. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1988; 4: 283-291Google Scholar). Under such conditions acetate is formed as a by-product, indicating that the in vivo activity of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase exceeds that of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. Acetate production can be a major problem in industrial high-biomass-density cultures of S. cerevisiae (e.g. for heterologous protein production), because this weak organic acid dissipates the pH gradient across the plasma membrane, leading to a reduction of the biomass yield (7Verduyn C. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek Int. J. Gen. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 60: 325-353Google Scholar). In view of the central role of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase in the carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae, it is not surprising that the biochemistry of this enzyme has been studied in detail. Two immunologically distinct forms of the enzyme have been described (8Satyanarayana T. Mandel A.D. Klein H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 341: 396-401Google Scholar). The two forms differed with respect to kinetic properties, substrate specificity, and cellular localization (9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar, 10Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 600-606Google Scholar, 11Klein H.P. Jahnke L. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 179-184Google Scholar) and, based on their levels in shake-flask cultures, were called “aerobic” and “non-aerobic” acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (12Satyanarayana, T., Klein, H. P., (1974) Proceedings of the IVth International Symposium on Yeasts, Vienna, Austria, July 8-12, 1974, Abstr. A34.Google Scholar). The differences in regulation, localization, and kinetic aspects suggest different roles in metabolism for both enzymes. Only the aerobic form of the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity (13Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 480-490Google Scholar, 14Frenkel E.P. Kitchens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 504-507Google Scholar), and it has remained unclear whether the two forms are encoded by different genes. Recently two structural genes, ACS1 (15DeVirgilio C. Bürckert N. Barth G. Neuhaus J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1043-1051Google Scholar) and ACS2 (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar), each encoding acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, have been cloned from S. cerevisiae. Disruption of both genes was lethal (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar), indicating that acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase is an essential enzyme in S. cerevisiae. Strains in which only ACS2 was disrupted grew normally on ethanol or acetate, but were unable to grow on glucose in batch cultures (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar). This may be related to the observation that ACS1 is subject to glucose repression (16Kratzer S. Schüller H.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 75-79Google Scholar). In contrast, acs1 mutants grow well on glucose (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiological function and regulation of both ACS proteins, and to determine whether they correspond to the aerobic and non-aerobic forms of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. To this end, kinetic properties of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase were compared in cell-free extracts of isogenic wild type, acs1 and acs2 S. cerevisiae strains. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulation of both genes was studied in batch and chemostat cultures. Yeast strains used for detailed physiological studies should preferably lack auxotrophic markers, and, whenever mutants are used, these should be isogenic to the wild type. These criteria were met by using the set of isogenic strains constructed in a previous study (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar): S. cerevisiae T2-3D (HO/HO ACS1/ACS1 ACS2/ACS2), GG621 (HO/HO acs1::APT1/acs1::APT1 ACS2/ACS2), and GG625 (HO/HO ACS1/ACS1 acs2::Tn5ble/acs2::Tn5ble). For small-scale pilot experiments, cells were grown at 30°C in 750-ml shake-flasks (250 rpm) containing 100 ml of mineral medium (17Zonneveld B.J.M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1986; 4: 287-291Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (10 g·liter−1), ethanol (30 g·liter−1), or acetate (5 g·liter−1). Chemostat cultivation was performed in 2-liter laboratory fermenters (Applikon, Schiedam, The Netherlands), at a dilution rate of 0.10 h−1. The working volume of the culture was kept at 1.0 liter via an electrical level sensor. Removal of effluent from the center of the culture ensured that biomass concentrations in the effluent line differed by less than 1% from those in the culture. The temperature was kept at 30°C, and the pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition of 2.0 M KOH. To maintain aerobic conditions, an air flow of 0.3 liter·min−1 through the culture was maintained using a Brooks 5876 mass-flow controller and the culture was stirred at 800 rpm. The dissolved oxygen concentration, continuously measured with an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode, remained above 25% of air saturation in all aerobic experiments. For anaerobic growth experiments, the culture and the reservoir medium were sparged with nitrogen. To minimize oxygen diffusion, anaerobic cultures were equipped with Norprene tubing. Chemostat data refer to steady state cultures without detectable metabolic oscillations. Culture purity was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy at 1000× magnification and plating on selective media. The mineral medium used in the chemostat experiments has been described (18Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Google Scholar). Carbon sources were added at a concentration of: 10 g·liter−1 glucose, 7.5 g·liter−1 ethanol, or 10 g·liter−1 acetic acid. For anaerobic cultivation, the medium was supplemented with the anaerobic growth factors Tween 80 and ergosterol as described (19Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 395-403Google Scholar) and the glucose concentration was 25 g·liter−1. After glucose-limited steady state cultures had been obtained, glucose was added by means of a syringe to give an initial concentration of 75 mM. Ethanol (40 mM) and combined ethanol/acetic acid (20 mM of each) pulses were added to ethanol-limited steady state cultures. Throughout the pulse experiments, the medium flow into the fermenter and the removal of effluent were continued. The effluent was cooled on ice immediately after leaving the fermenter. At appropriate intervals, samples were collected from the effluent line and used for metabolite determination and mRNA analysis. Dry weights of culture samples (10 ml) were determined using nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.45 μm; Gelman Sciences). After removal of the medium by filtration, the filters were washed with demineralized water and dried in a Sharp R-7400 microwave oven for 20 min. Parallel samples varied by less than 1%. Glucose was determined with the Merck glucose-oxidase kit (catalog no. 14143). Ethanol was assayed with a colorimetric assay kit (EK 003, Leeds Biochemicals Ltd., Leeds, United Kingdom). Acetate was assayed using the Boehringer Mannheim acetic acid kit (catalog no. 148261). Cells (approximately 100 mg dry weight) were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, washed once with 100 mM potassium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 4°C), and resuspended in 100 mM potassium-phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Cells were disrupted immediately by sonication with 0.7-mm diameter glass-beads at 0°C for 4 × 30 s using an MSE sonicator (150-watt output, 8 μm peak-to-peak amplitude). Whole cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g (10 min at 4°C). The clear supernatant, typically containing 2-4 mg of protein·ml−1, was used as cell-free extract. Protein concentrations were measured by the Lowry method. The specific activity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase was determined at 30°C in a Hitachi spectrophotometer at 340 nm. The standard reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 100 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10 μmol of L-malate (pH 7.7), 0.2 μmol of coenzyme A, 8 μmol of ATP (pH 7.5), 1 μmol of NAD+, 10 μmol of MgCl2, 3 units of malate dehydrogenase, 0.4 unit of citrate synthase, and cell-free extract. The reaction was started with 100 μmol of potassium acetate. Enzyme activities were calculated assuming an extinction coefficient of NADH of 6.3 mM−1 cm−1. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the acetate-dependent formation of 1 μmol of NADH·min−1 in the coupled assay. For determination of the Km, the acetate or ATP concentration in the assay was varied, leaving the other components constant. Kinetic parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, using the program Fig.P (Fig.P Software). This assay would also measure the combined activity of acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase, acting together in hydrolyzing acetyl-coenzyme A to generate ATP during anaerobic growth in bacteria (20Grundy F.J. Waters D.A. Takova T.Y. Henkin T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 259-271Google Scholar). However, they can also perform the reverse reaction, which generates acetyl-coenzyme A. To rule out the possibility that this two-step reaction is present in yeast (e.g. either ACS1 or ACS2 encodes an acetate kinase), we tested cell-free extracts from wild type and mutant strains for the presence of phosphotransacetylase by omitting ATP from the reaction mixture and starting the reaction with 10 μmol of acetyl phosphate. Escherichia coli extracts were used as a positive control. No activity was observed in any of the three S. cerevisiae strains (data not shown), indicating that both ACS1 and ACS2 encode genuine acetyl-coenzyme A synthetases. Activity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase with propionate as a substrate was determined in a discontinuous assay, measuring the propionate dependent consumption of coenzyme A (21Pronk J.T. Van del Linden-Beuman A. Verduyn C. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 170: 717-722Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was calculated from the decrease in coenzyme A. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the propionate-dependent consumption of 1 μmol of coenzyme A·min−1. Kinetic analysis of acetate activation by cell-free extracts indicated that the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetases encoded by the ACS1 and ACS2 genes both obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but exhibited a substantially different Km for acetate. The ratio of the capacities of the two enzymes (Vmax,ACS1/Vmax,ACS2) was estimated by performing enzyme activity assays at two different acetate concentrations (1 and 100 mM, respectively). The ratio of the capacities was calculated from Equation 1. r1r100=Vmax,ACS1KS,ACS1+1=Vmax,ACS2KS,ACS2+1Vmax,ACS1⋅100KS,ACS1+100+Vmax,ACS2⋅100Vmax,ACS2+100(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, r1 and r100 are the reaction rates observed with 1 and 100 mM acetate, respectively. Total RNA was isolated from 2-ml samples as described (22Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Google Scholar), except that the final samples were stored in pure formamide. This reduced the total sample volume by a factor of 2, thus avoiding the need to concentrate samples with a low amount of RNA. For Northern blot analysis, approximately 5 μg of each sample were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (2 × MOPS, 1The abbreviation used is: MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2.88% formaldehyde, and 0.1 mg·ml−1 ethidium bromide) and separated on a 0.7% agarose gel containing 1.44% formaldehyde. The RNA molecules were transferred to a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) by vacuum blotting in 20 × SSC (3.0 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate). Hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 18 h in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% sodium lauroylsarcosine, and 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Probes were prepared as described previously (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar). The blots were washed twice for 10 min in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65°C. Quantification of the signals was done using the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, B&L Systems, Maarssen, The Netherlands). In all experiments, PDA1 mRNA was used as an internal loading standard. All solutions were made RNase free by autoclaving for 40 min at 120°C. Gel trays were washed overnight with a 10% Glorix solution. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. To investigate whether the gene products of the ACS genes correspond to the aerobic and non-aerobic forms of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (8Satyanarayana T. Mandel A.D. Klein H.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 596-602Google Scholar), the kinetic properties of the enzymes were compared. Ethanol-limited chemostat cultures of wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isogenic acs1 and acs2 mutants, grown at a dilution rate of 0.10 h−1, were used as a reproducible source of biomass. The aerobic and non-aerobic forms of S. cerevisiae acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase have been reported to exhibit different affinities for acetate and ATP, with the aerobic form exhibiting lower Km values for both substrates (9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar). The Km for acetate of the strain containing only ACS1 was about 30-fold lower than that of the strain expressing only ACS2 (Table I). In extracts from wild type, the Km for acetate was close to that of GG625 extracts (Table I). Extracts prepared from the three strains did not exhibit substantial differences with respect to their Km for ATP (Table I).Table IKinetic properties of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase in cell-free extracts prepared from wild type S. cerevisiae and in mutants in which either ACS1 or ACS2 was inactivatedStrainRelevant genotypeKinetic constantsActivity with propionateVmaxKm, acetateKm, ATPunits · mg protein−1mMmMunits · mg protein−1T2-3DACS1 ACS21.2 ± 0.10.60 ± 0.091.1 ± 0.10.22GG621acs1 ACS20.34 ± 0.018.8 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.1<0.01GG625ACS1 acs21.10 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.00.16 Open table in a new tab A striking difference between the aerobic and non-aerobic forms of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase is the inability of the latter to activate propionate (9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar). Extracts from wild type and the isogenic mutant expressing only ACS1 were able to activate propionate, albeit at lower rates than acetate (Table I). In contrast, activation of propionate was not observed with extracts from the strain expressing only ACS2 (Table I). From these data we concluded that the aerobic protein is encoded by the ACS1 gene and non-aerobic protein by the ACS2 gene. S. cerevisiae mutants in which the ACS2 gene has been disrupted are unable to grow on glucose in batch cultures (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar). This may be due to repression of ACS1 by glucose (16Kratzer S. Schüller H.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 75-79Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may indicate that Acs2p has an indispensable function in glucose metabolism that cannot be met by Acs1p (e.g. due to different catalytic properties or subcellular compartmentation). In a preliminary study, transcriptional regulation of both genes was studied in shake-flask cultures of wild type yeast grown on glucose. ACS1 mRNA was not detectable during exponential growth, but appeared when the culture entered stationary phase (Fig. 1). Apparently, glucose repression of ACS1 was relieved when glucose was consumed and the culture switched to consuming ethanol and acetate produced during exponential growth. In contrast, ACS2 mRNA was observed throughout the growth curve (Fig. 1). Experiments in which glucose was added to acetate-grown batch cultures indicated that repression of ACS1 transcription started at glucose concentrations of 100 mg·liter−1 (data not shown). The low residual substrate concentration in glucose-limited chemostat cultures is known to alleviate glucose repression (24Sierkstra L.N. Nouwen N.P. Verbakel J.M.A. Verrips C.T. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1077-1087Google Scholar, 25De Jong-Gubbels P. Vanrolleghem P. Heijnen S. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1995; 11: 407-418Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether a strain expressing only ACS1 was able to grow under these conditions by switching an ethanol-limited chemostat culture to medium with glucose as the sole carbon source. The strain rapidly adapted to glucose-limited growth. In the resulting glucose-limited steady state cultures its biomass yield was the same as that of the wild type strain (Table II). This indicated that glucose repression of ACS1 is the sole reason for the inability of acs2 mutants to grow on glucose in batch cultures.Table IIAcetyl-coenzyme A activities and biomass yields in cell-free extracts from carbon-limited chemostat cultures (D = 0.10 h−1) of wild type S. cerevisiae and mutants in which either ACS1 or ACS2 have been inactivatedStrainRelevant genotypeCarbon sourceAcs activityVmax,ACS1/Vmax,ACS2Biomass yieldunits · mg protein−1g dry mass · g substrate−1T2-3DACS1 ACS2Glucose0.424.20.5GG621acs1 ACS2Glucose0.240.5GG625ACS1 acs2Glucose0.380.5T2-3DACS1 ACS2Ethanol1.26260.6GG621acs1 ACS2Ethanol0.300.6GG625ACS1 acs2Ethanol1.040.6T2-3DACS1 ACS2Glucose (anaerobic)0.08<0.010.1 Open table in a new tab To investigate effects of carbon source on the regulation of both genes, their expression was studied in carbon-limited chemostat cultures. In contrast to batch cultivation, chemostat cultivation can be carried out with a constant dissolved-oxygen concentration and growth rate, which is known to have substantial effect on acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase levels in S. cerevisiae (26Postma E. Verduyn C. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1989; 53: 468-477Google Scholar). This enables studies on the regulation by carbon source without interference. As the Km values of the ACS gene products for acetate are different (Table I), the ratio of their maximum activities in cell-free extracts (Vmax,ACS1/Vmax,ACS2) can be estimated by measuring acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase activities at two substrate concentrations (see “Materials and Methods”). These estimations indicated that in aerobic, carbon-limited chemostat cultures grown on glucose, ethanol, or acetate, both genes were expressed simultaneously (Table II). Under these conditions, ACS1 was responsible for most of the total capacity (Table II). In the aerobic cultures grown on ethanol and glucose, expression levels of ACS2 were not substantially different, whereas the expression of ACS1 was higher in ethanol-limited cultures (Table II). In anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures, ACS activity was lower than in aerobic cultures and appeared to be encoded exclusively by the ACS2 gene (Table II). This is in line with the identification of ACS2 as the gene encoding the non-aerobic enzyme. Nevertheless, it should be noted that ACS2 expression is not limited to anaerobic or fermentative growth conditions (Table II). Northern analysis corroborated that in aerobic carbon-limited chemostat cultures grown on glucose, ethanol, or acetate, both ACS1 and ACS2 were expressed, whereas only the ACS2 transcript was detected in anaerobic cultures (Table III).Table IIILevels of ACS1 and ACS2 mRNA in steady state carbon-limited chemostat cultures (D = 0.10 h−1) of wild type S. cerevisiae T2-3DmRNACarbon sourceGlucoseEthanolAcetateGlucose (anaerobic)ACS111.41.80ACS211.63.22.8 Open table in a new tab In the experiments discussed above, growth was studied under carbon-limited conditions. Although industrial fed-batch cultures of S. cerevisiae are in principle sugar-limited, transient exposure to high sugar concentrations is inevitable due to imperfect mixing and the high sugar concentration in the feed of large scale bioreactors. On a laboratory scale, this situation can be simulated by glucose pulses to aerobic, glucose limited cultures. One of the consequences of such transient exposure of aerobic grown S. cerevisiae cultures to excess glucose is the accumulation of ethanol and acetate, the so-called short term Crabtree effect (27Van Urk H. Voll W.S.L. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 281-286Google Scholar). Since the capacity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase may be a relevant factor in the occurrence of acetate formation, transcriptional regulation of the ACS genes was studied after addition of 75 mM glucose to aerobic, glucose-limited yeast cultures. After applying the glucose pulse, three metabolic phases could be discerned (Fig. 2A). During the first phase (0-160 min), the glucose added to the culture was rapidly consumed. Glucose metabolism was accompanied by the production of ethanol and, to a lesser extent, acetate. In the second phase (170-380 min), ethanol was consumed, resulting in the formation of more acetate. This was consumed in the third phase (390-420 min). The levels of ACS1 and ACS2 mRNA during these phases were monitored by Northern analysis (Fig. 2B). Transcription of ACS1 decreased below the detection limit within 10 min after addition of the glucose (Fig. 2B), confirming ACS1 glucose repression. As soon as glucose was exhausted and ethanol consumption started, ACS1 mRNA reappeared. During this phase ACS1 mRNA levels were 2-4-fold higher, compared to the steady state level (Fig. 2B). As the ethanol concentration in the culture decreased below 10 mM and acetate consumption started, a sharp increase of mRNA occurred (Fig. 2B). The maximum level, observed after 410 min, corresponded to approximately 40-fold the steady state value. Throughout the pulse experiment, the levels of ACS2 mRNA varied between 60 and 180% of the steady state value, suggesting that transcription of ACS2 is relatively insensitive to the transient accumulation of metabolites. However, ACS2 completely disappeared at the end of the experiment (Fig. 2B). Only after several hours did ACS2 mRNA return to its steady state level (data not shown). It is obvious that full transcription of ACS1 only occurred when ethanol is completely consumed (Fig. 2B). Either the gene is relieved from ethanol repression, or the increased level of acetate might induce ACS1 transcription. To further investigate the regulation by ethanol, C-2 carbon pulses were given to ethanol-limited chemostat cultures. Since, full transcription of ACS1 occurred when the concentrations of ethanol and acetate were approximately 10-20 mM, we first added a mix of 20 mM ethanol and 20 mM acetate to an ethanol-limited culture. If the disappearance of any residual glucose was responsible for the increase of ACS1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2, 350-min sample and greater), no increase of transcription is expected in this new experiment. On the other hand, repression by ethanol would lower the levels of ACS1 mRNA, whereas induction by acetate would increase it. As can be seen from Fig. 3A the level of ACS1 mRNA decreased rapidly, although at a lower rate than after a glucose pulse (Fig. 2B), to approximately 20% of the steady state level. As soon as ethanol and acetate were consumed, ACS1 mRNA returned to the original level. The ACS2 mRNA level, on the other hand, increased to almost 200% before returning to the steady state level at the end of the pulse. These data strongly suggest that ACS1 transcription is repressed by ethanol. This was confirmed in another pulse experiment, in which 40 mM ethanol was added to an ethanol-limited chemostat culture. Both genes responded exactly the same as during the ethanol/acetate pulse. Apparently, ACS1 is repressed by ethanol and ACS2 is slightly induced by ethanol. Since ACS1 and ACS2 catalyze the same reaction, it does not seem unlikely that interactions exist between the regulatory mechanisms affecting the transcription of both genes. To test whether the transcription of ACS1 is influenced by the presence of an active ACS2 gene, glucose repression of ACS1 expression was compared in wild type and GG625, which lacks an active ACS2 gene. When exponential-phase shake-flask cultures growing on acetate were pulsed with 1 g·liter−1 glucose, ACS1 expression in the wild type showed exactly the same pattern as in the chemostat experiment shown in Fig. 2B. Within 15 min after the pulse, ACS1 mRNA could no longer be detected (Fig. 4A). After 60 min the mRNA reappeared. In the acs2 mutant GG625, a decrease of ACS1 transcription was also observed. However, in this case significant levels of ACS1 mRNA remained present throughout the experiment (Fig. 4B). These results, showing that the regulation of ACS1 is influenced by the presence of an active ACS2 gene, were confirmed in glucose-pulse experiments with glucose-limited chemostat cultures of the acs2 mutant (data not shown). In similar experiments, levels of the ACS2 transcript were monitored after glucose pulses to an acs1 mutant and the isogenic wild type. ACS2 transcription did not differ in the two strains, neither in batch cultures nor in chemostat cultures (data not shown). One of the goals of the present study was to determine whether the gene products of the ACS1 and ACS2 genes could be correlated with the aerobic and non-aerobic forms of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase described previously (8Satyanarayana T. Mandel A.D. Klein H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 341: 396-401Google Scholar, 9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar, 10Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. J.

Based on the difference in Km for acetate, substrate specificity, and expression under anaerobic conditions, we concluded that ACS1 encodes the aerobic form of the enzyme, whereas ACS2 encodes the non-aerobic form. Identity of the ACS1 gene product and the aerobic isoenzyme is further supported by the correlation between the amino acid composition of purified aerobic acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (13Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 480-490Google Scholar) and the predicted protein sequence of the ACS1 gene product (15DeVirgilio C. Bürckert N. Barth G. Neuhaus J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1043-1051Google Scholar). So far, the ACS2 gene product (the non-aerobic form) has not been purified to homogeneity. Attempts in our laboratory to achieve this goal were hindered by instability of partially purified preparations of the enzyme. 2C. J. Kortland, M. A. van den Berg, C. Verduyn, J. P. van Dijken, J. T. Pronk, and H. Y. Steensma, unpublished data. We propose that the terms aerobic and non-aerobic acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase should no longer be used, because ACS2 is expressed not only during anaerobic growth, but also during aerobic growth on glucose, ethanol, and acetate. Palmitoyl-coenzyme A was reported to be a strong inhibitor of ACS1-encoded isoform (10Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 600-606Google Scholar). In the present study, palmitoyl-coenzyme A was found to be an equally effective inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity in cell-free extracts of all three strains (50% inhibition at ∼25 μM palmitoyl-coenzyme A; data not shown). In contrast to earlier reports (9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar), no difference was found in Km for ATP of both gene products. However, it should be taken into account that both the cultivation conditions and assay procedures employed in the previous work (9DeVicenzi D.L. Klein H.P. Fed. Proc. 1970; 872 (Abstr. 3551)Google Scholar, 10Satyanarayana T. Klein H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 600-606Google Scholar) were different from those used in the present study. Consistent with earlier reports (3Van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Google Scholar, 16Kratzer S. Schüller H.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 75-79Google Scholar), ACS1 was found to be subject to glucose repression. Upon exposure of wild type cells to glucose, the level of the ACS1 transcript decreased very rapidly; within 10-20 min after exposure to glucose concentrations as low as 0.1 g·liter−1, ACS1 was no longer detectable. A similar rapid decline of the transcript level was found for the tightly regulated genes FBP1, PCK1, and SDH1 and was attributed to glucose-accelerated mRNA turnover (28Lombardo A. Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2941-2948Google Scholar, 29Mercado J.J. Smith R. Sagliocco F.A. Brown A.J.P. Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 473-481Google Scholar). The possibility that this mechanism is also involved in the regulation of ACS1 transcription deserves further attention. It has recently been proposed that, as part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass, acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase is indispensable for the synthesis of lipids in the yeast cytosol (4Flikweert M.T. Van der Zanden L. Janssen W.M.T.M. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Google Scholar). This implies that, in addition to its role in the dissimilation of ethanol and acetate, the enzyme also plays a vital role in assimilatory metabolism. The observation that both ACS gene products are inhibited by a long-chain fatty acyl ester (e.g. palmitoyl-coenzyme A) is consistent with a role in lipid synthesis; inhibition by fatty-acyl coenzyme A esters is a logical feed-back mechanism to control this key assimilatory process. The inability of acs2 mutants to grow on glucose in batch cultures might lead to the conclusion that Acs2p performs an essential role in glucose metabolism. However, the ability to grow in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures (no glucose repression of ACS1) shows that neither the kinetic properties nor the subcellular localization of Acs1p prevents it from operating as part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass. A similar conclusion holds for the activity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase in gluconeogenic growth on ethanol and acetate; neither of the two acetyl-coenzyme A synthetases is indispensable for growth on these C-2 compounds. Nevertheless, the regulation of transcription of both genes by these compounds is different. Kratzer and Schüller (16Kratzer S. Schüller H.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 75-79Google Scholar) reported a strong derepression of ACS1 on ethanol. However, these experiments were done in uncontrolled shake-flask batch cultures. When the yeast is grown in an ethanol-limited chemostat culture and excess ethanol is added, it became clear that in fact ACS1 is repressed by ethanol (Fig. 3). It is not clear whether ethanol itself causes repression of ACS1. Another possible candidate is acetaldehyde, which is formed after oxidation of ethanol. Unfortunately, due to the toxic and volatile nature of this compound it was not possible to pulse the cultures with acetaldehyde, or even measure its concentration during the pulse experiments. The high expression of ACS1 during growth on acetate (Fig. 2) suggests that Acs1p is primarily responsible for acetate activation during gluconeogenic growth. The relatively low Km for acetate of Acs1p enables it to gain enough energy to sustain growth, even at low acetate concentrations. Acs2p, on the other hand, has a lower affinity for acetate, but is expressed during growth on glucose, when the main energy generating flux does not require ACS activity. Therefore, Acs2p is likely to be the major producer of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A, in total approximately 4% of the total amount of carbon (4Flikweert M.T. Van der Zanden L. Janssen W.M.T.M. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Google Scholar), required for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis. We thank R. A. Dingemans for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2090845744,"The primary structure of the opioid receptors have revealed that many of the structural features that are conserved in other G protein-coupled receptors are also conserved in the opioid receptors. Upon exposure to agonists, some G protein-coupled receptors internalize rapidly, whereas other structurally homologous G protein-coupled receptors do not. It is not known whether opioid receptors are regulated by rapid endocytosis. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the epitope-tagged wild type delta opioid receptor, exposure to 100 nM [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin causes internalization of the receptor within 30 min as determined by confocal microscopy. The rate of internalization of the wild type receptor is rapid with a half-maximal reduction by about 10 min, as determined by the reduction in mean surface receptor fluorescence intensity measured using flow cytometry. In contrast, the cells expressing receptors lacking the C-terminal 15 or 37 amino acids exhibit a substantially slower rate of internalization. Furthermore, the cells expressing receptors with point mutations of any of the Ser/Thr between Ser344 and Ser363 in the C-terminal tail exhibit a significant reduction in the rate of receptor internalization. These results suggest that a portion of the C-terminal tail is involved in receptor internalization. Agents that block the formation of clathrin-coated pits considerably reduce the extent of agonist-mediated internalization of the wild type receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the wild type opioid receptor undergoes rapid agonist-mediated internalization via a classic endocytic pathway and that a portion of the C-terminal tail plays an important role in this internalization process."
https://openalex.org/W1985782864,"Abstract Immunoreceptors such as the high affinity IgE receptor, FcϵRI, and T-cell receptor-associated proteins share a common motif, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). We used the yeast tribrid system to identify downstream effectors of the phosphorylated FcϵRI ITAM-containing subunits β and γ. One novel cDNA was isolated that encodes a protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine, contains a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, inositolpolyphosphate 5-phosphatase activity, three NXXY motifs, several proline-rich regions, and is called SHIP. Mutation of the conserved tyrosine or leucine residues within the FcϵRI β or γ ITAMs eliminates SHIP binding and indicates that the SHIP-ITAM interaction is specific. SHIP also binds to ITAMs from the CD3 complex and T cell receptor ζ chain in vitro. SHIP protein possesses both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5′-phosphatase and inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5′-phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of SHIP by a protein-tyrosine kinase, Lck, results in a reduction in enzyme activity. FcϵRI activation induces the association of several tyrosine phosphoproteins with SHIP. SHIP is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Shc and Grb2. These data suggest that SHIP may serve as a multifunctional linker protein in receptor activation."

In order to maintain the integrity of the cleaved genetic material during this process, the enzyme forms a proteinaceous bridge that spans the nucleic acid break. This bridge is anchored by covalent phosphotyrosyl bonds established between the active site residues of the homodimeric enzyme and the newly created 5′-DNA termini (15Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol.

Hsiung Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 89-93Google Scholar). This drug increases topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breakage primarily by inhibiting the ability of the enzyme to religate cleaved nucleic acid molecules (37Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Google Scholar, 38Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Google Scholar). Etoposide binds to DNA in a nonintercalative manner in the absence of topoisomerase II but does so with relatively low affinity compared with many anticancer drugs targeted to the enzyme (39Chow K.C. Macdonald T.L. Ross W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 467-473Google Scholar). Although topoisomerase II cleaves DNA at preferred sequences, little is understood regarding the mechanism by which the enzyme identifies (i.e. selects) its sites of action. Furthermore, the distribution of DNA sites cleaved by topoisomerase II is altered dramatically in the presence of anticancer agents, and the levels of scission at drug-induced sites vary significantly (26Pommier Y.G. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice(,eds), , pp.2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 435-461Google Scholar). On the basis of previous sequence analysis studies, it appears that etoposide is predisposed to induce topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage at sites that are immediately 3′ to cytosine residues (26Pommier Y.G. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice(,eds), , pp.2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 435-461Google Scholar, 40Pommier Y.

However, the molecular interactions that underlie this base preference are unknown. To address the basis for cleavage site selection by topoisomerase II in the presence of drugs, a combination of kinetic and binding experiments were employed to determine the mechanism by which etoposide enhances cleavage complex formation at 22 specific sites. Results indicate that etoposide·topoisomerase II (rather than drug·DNA) interactions mediate cleavage complex formation and that maximal levels of etoposide-induced scission reflect the ability of the drug to inhibit religation at specific sequences rather than the affinity of the drug for site-specific enzyme·DNA complexes. These conclusions are consistent with the recently proposed “positional poison model” 1Kingma, P. S., and Osheroff, N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press. for the action of DNA lesions and topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer drugs. Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was purified from embryonic Kc cells as described previously by Shelton et al. (43Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II was overexpressed and purified from yeast cells as described by Elsea et al. (44Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Google Scholar) except that the initial phosphocellulose chromatography was replaced by chromatography on hydroxylapatite (43Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Google Scholar). pBR322 plasmid DNA was purified as described previously (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-1.52Google Scholar). Etoposide and ellipticine were purchased from Sigma and were stored at −20°C as a 10 or 20 mM stock, respectively, in dimethyl sulfoxide. Tris-HCl and urea were purchased from Sigma; SDS was from Merck; proteinase K was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; restriction endonucleases, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and polynucleotide kinase were from New England BioLabs; [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp.; and [3H]etoposide (∼1 Ci/mmol) was from Moravek. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. A uniquely end-labeled 564-bp 2The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). DNA substrate (residues 375-939 in pBR322) was prepared as follows. pBR322 plasmid DNA (50 μg) was digested with restriction endonuclease EagI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The DNA was then phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase using 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP, digested with restriction endonuclease BamHI, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The uniquely end-labeled 564-bp product was detected by shadowing with UV light, excised, and eluted overnight at 37°C in 2.5 M ammonium acetate. Finally, the DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in water. base pair(s). Levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage were assayed using a protocol similar to that described by Knab et al. (46Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Google Scholar). Cleavage reactions contained 1.4 nM (25 ng) labeled DNA, 3.5 nM (60 ng) Drosophila topoisomerase II, etoposide (at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μM), or a dimethyl sulfoxide solvent control (final concentration, 1% (v/v)) in a total of 50 μl of assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol (v/v)). Following a 10-min incubation at 30°C, cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of SDS (1% final concentration), and topoisomerase II was digested for 30 min at 45°C with proteinase K (final concentration, 80 μg/ml) in the presence of EDTA (final concentration, 15 mM). DNA cleavage products were ethanol precipitated twice, dried, and resuspended with 40% formamide, 8.4 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol FF. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% sequencing gels (46Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Google Scholar), fixed in 10% methanol/10% acetic acid for 30 min, and dried. Reaction products were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. DNA sequence ladders of the cleavage substrate were generated by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (47Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Order of addition cleavage experiments were performed as described above, except that etoposide was preincubated in assay buffer with either topoisomerase II or DNA in the absence of the missing component for 2 min at 30°C. During this period, the missing component was also incubated at 30°C. Cleavage was initiated by mixing the two samples, and reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 s to 10 min. Cleavage reactions were terminated and analyzed as described above. Rates of DNA religation were determined as outlined previously (38Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Google Scholar). Briefly, cleavage/religation equilibria were established for 10 min at 30°C as described above. Religation was initiated by shifting reaction mixtures to 55°C (the temperature at which the religation reaction is favored). Reactions were terminated at various times (20 s to 2 min) and analyzed as described above. Interactions between etoposide and topoisomerase II in the absence of DNA were monitored by one of two techniques. Due to the large amounts of enzyme required for these techniques, overexpressed yeast topoisomerase II (44Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Google Scholar) was utilized for these experiments. In the first technique, etoposide·topoisomerase II binding was determined by the ability of the drug to compete with the anticancer agent ellipticine for interactions with the enzyme. Competition was quantitated by monitoring the decrease in the intensity of ellipticine fluorescence. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy was performed as outlined previously (48Froelich-Ammon S.J. Patchan M.W. Osheroff N. Thompson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14998-15005Google Scholar). For all fluorescence experiments, ellipticine was excited at 326 nm, and emission light was monitored at 420 nm. The emission polarizer was fixed at the magic angle (54.7°), and a 420 nm interference band pass filter was employed to separate fluorescence from scattered light. Data were acquired at 25°C. Samples contained 1 μM ellipticine, 100 nM enzyme, and 0-500 nM etoposide in a final volume of 500 μl of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA and were incubated for 6 min prior to fluorescence measurements. All chemicals were ultrapure grade to minimize nonspecific fluorescence. The buffer background was subtracted from intensities for binding calculations. In the second technique, etoposide·topoisomerase II binding was monitored by a nitrocellulose filter assay. Assays were carried out by a modification of the method described by Higgins and Cozzarelli (49Higgins N.P. Cozzarelli N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6833-6847Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm, Millipore) were presoaked in assay buffer. Binding reactions contained 5 μM topoisomerase II and 2 μM [3H]etoposide in 80 μl of assay buffer. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 6 min and rapidly applied to the center of nitrocellulose filters at a flow rate of ∼5 ml/min. Filters were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer, dried, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer drugs greatly alter the DNA cleavage sites utilized by the enzyme (19Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Google Scholar, 40Pommier Y.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 238-249Google Scholar). Although sequence analyses of drug-induced DNA scission have identified the spectra of sites associated with different agents, the features that dictate the nucleotide specificity of topoisomerase II-targeted drugs remain an enigma. Therefore, a series of kinetic and binding experiments were utilized to determine the mechanism by which the anticancer drug, etoposide, stimulates topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex formation at specific sequences. As a first step toward elucidating the mechanistic basis for the sequence selectivity of topoisomerase II in the presence of anticancer drugs, relationships between the affinity of etoposide for specific enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes and levels of drug-induced scission in those complexes were examined. This was accomplished by analyzing the kinetics of site-specific DNA cleavage mediated by topoisomerase II in the presence of etoposide. A uniquely end-labeled 564-bp BamHI-EagI fragment of pBR322 plasmid was used as a DNA substrate and cleavage was monitored over a concentration range of etoposide that spanned 2 orders of magnitude (1-100 μM). As seen in Fig. 1, etoposide enhanced topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage at numerous sites in this nucleic acid substrate. Twenty-two sites of cleavage (numbered in order from the 5′ end of the 32P-labeled strand) were analyzed. The corresponding nucleotide sequence position in pBR322 is listed for each site in Table I. Cleavage sites located beyond (i.e. further from the labeled DNA terminus) site 22 were not included in the analysis due to decreased resolution of these reaction products, as well as an apparent decrease in cleavage complexes formed at these sites observed at high drug concentrations (presumably due to additional scission events at sites nearer to the labeled DNA terminus).Table I.Site numberCmaxaData are presented as means ± S.D. for two independent experiments.KmaData are presented as means ± S.D. for two independent experiments.Cmax/KmReligation ratebData are presented as means ± S.D. for three or four independent experiments.SequencecArrows indicate sites of cleavage.Nucleotide positiondThe nucleotide sequence number in the pBR322 plasmid that is 5′ to the site of cleavage.%μMmin−110.84 ± 0.039.0 ± 0.50.090.62 ± 0.045′-CGAAAC⇓GTTTGGTGGC-3′90220.45 ± 0.0338 ± 60.011.1 ± 0.15′-ACGTTT⇓GGTGGCGGGA-3′89830.42 ± 0.0842 ± 80.010.59 ± 0.085′-TTTGGT⇓GGCGGGACCA-3′89540.83 ± 0.0324 ± 10.030.40 ± 0.045′-TTGGTG⇓GCGGGACCAG-3′89450.24 ± 0.0629 ± 170.011.3 ± 0.45′-TGGCGG⇓GACCAGTGAC-3′89060.55 ± 0.024.0 ± 0.00.140.93 ± 0.205′-GGGACC⇓AGTGACGAAG-3′88670.22 ± 0.028.3 ± 0.10.031.0 ± 0.35′-ACCAGT⇓GACGAAGGCT-3′88380.84 ± 0.057.1 ± 0.20.120.38 ± 0.105′-AGTGAC⇓GAAGGCTTGA-3′88090.58 ± 0.023.7 ± 0.00.160.93 ± 0.225′-ACGAAG⇓GCTTGAGCGA-3′876100.66 ± 0.073.5 ± 0.10.191.0 ± 0.25′-GAAGGC⇓TTGAGCGAGG-3′874111.9 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.70.280.69 ± 0.175′-GCTTGA⇓GCGAGGGCGT-3′870125.3 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.11.10.48 ± 0.135′-CTTGAG⇓CGAGGGCGTG-3′869132.2 ± 0.44.6 ± 0.10.480.27 ± 0.085′-TTGAGC⇓GAGGGCGTGC-3′868141.5 ± 0.04.6 ± 0.20.310.28 ± 0.115′-AAGATT⇓CCGAATACCG-3′852151.1 ± 0.16.3 ± 0.00.180.25 ± 0.085′-AATACC⇓GCAAGCGACA-3′843165.3 ± 0.06.0 ± 0.10.880.14 ± 0.015′-GCAAGC⇓GACAGGCCGA-3′8371713 ± 011 ± 11.20.16 ± 0.025′-GCGACA⇓GGCCGATCAT-3′833184.6 ± 0.03.8 ± 0.31.20.04 ± 0.025′-ACAGGC⇓CGATCATCGT-3′830191.2 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.10.350.36 ± 0.075′-GCCGAT⇓CATCGTCGCG-3′826201.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.70.290.15 ± 0.025′-CCGATC⇓ATCGTCGCGC-3′825211.2 ± 0.17.6 ± 0.10.160.11 ± 0.035′-CGCGCT⇓CCAGCGAAAG-3′814220.74 ± 0.019.0 ± 0.60.080.46 ± 0.065′-GCGAAA⇓GCGGTCCTCG-3′805a Data are presented as means ± S.D. for two independent experiments.b Data are presented as means ± S.D. for three or four independent experiments.c Arrows indicate sites of cleavage.d The nucleotide sequence number in the pBR322 plasmid that is 5′ to the site of cleavage. Open table in a new tab Previous studies by Pommier et al. (26Pommier Y.G. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice(,eds), , pp.2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New York1996: 435-461Google Scholar, 40Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5973-5980Google Scholar) indicate that etoposide preferentially induces DNA cleavage mediated by murine topoisomerase II at sequences with a cytosine residue immediately 5′ to the scissile bond. Although the present data were not subjected to rigorous statistical analysis, a similar preference was observed for cleavage with the Drosophila type II enzyme (Table I). Of the 22 sites that were characterized in the present study, 17 contained a cytosine either 5′ to the point of cleavage on the strand that was analyzed or 5′ to the predicted point of cleavage four bases downstream on the complementary strand. Six of the sequences characterized contained cytosine residues 5′ to the point of cleavage on both strands. Therefore, the sequence specificity of etoposide with Drosophila topoisomerase II appears to be similar to that of the mammalian enzyme. Levels of etoposide-induced topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage at specific sites were analyzed by Eadie-Hofstee plots (the kinetic equivalent of Scatchard binding plots). Representative data for DNA scission at four sites are shown in Fig. 2. For each site, Cmax (the theoretical maximal cleavage induced by etoposide) is represented by the intercept with the x axis, and the apparent Km value (the kinetic affinity of etoposide) is represented by −1/slope of the line (56Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Cmax and apparent Km values for all DNA sites examined are given in Fig. 3 and Table I.Fig. 3Kinetic affinity, maximal cleavage, and kinetic specificity for etoposide-induced DNA cleavage at 22 sites. Histograms depicting apparent Km (top), Cmax (middle), and Cmax/Km (kinetic specificity, bottom) values versus site number are shown. Apparent Km and Cmax values are the averages ± S.D. for two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Under the conditions utilized, the Cmax values (which are expressed as the percentage of the initial DNA substrate cleaved at a given site) for etoposide-induced scission varied by more than 60-fold for the 22 sites analyzed. In contrast, apparent Km values varied by only 12-fold. Furthermore, much of this variation in drug affinity was due to sites 2-5, which appear to comprise a region on the DNA that is a poor substrate for drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage. The sites in this cluster displayed apparent Km values for etoposide that were 3-5 times higher than any other sites examined and Cmax values that were among the lowest determined. The poor ability of etoposide to induce scission within this cluster indicates that specific DNA sequences and/or structures may exert a dominant negative effect on the assembly of cleavage complexes and preclude drug action. However, for the other 18 sites examined, the apparent Km values for etoposide varied no more than 3-fold, despite the wide range (∼60-fold) of Cmax values. Moreover, no correlation existed between these two sets of kinetic constants. These results indicate that for the overwhelming majority of DNA sites examined, maximal levels of etoposide-induced scission were independent of the affinity of the drug for cleavage complexes formed at these sites. Because the nucleotide sequences of the sites examined displayed little similarity (other than the predisposition for a cytosine 5′ to the scissile bond) (Table I), this finding implies that complex formation is not driven by the affinity of etoposide for specific sequences in the duplex DNA. The above conclusion is supported by two additional lines of evidence. First, there is a strong correlation between the kinetic specificity (i.e. Cmax/Km) of etoposide and Cmax values (for all sites examined) but none with apparent Km values (Fig. 3). Second, although maximal levels of scission spanned nearly 2 orders of magnitude, the time required to achieve DNA cleavage equilibrium for every site analyzed varied less than 2-fold (not shown). The time to equilibrium value encompasses the interval required to form the noncovalent ternary topoisomerase II·drug·DNA complex followed by the time needed to induce cleavage within this complex. Because DNA cleavage equilibrium is established in less than 5 s in the absence of drugs (57Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9538-9545Google Scholar), the longer times (∼60 s) required to attain equilibrium in the presence of etoposide presumably reflect the period required to form the noncovalent ternary complex. Therefore, if the intrinsic affinity of etoposide for specific sites on the DNA substrate differed substantially, equilibrium times likely would have differed accordingly. The data presented above indicate that the specificity of cleavage complex formation is not due to interactions between etoposide and individual nucleic acid sequences. Taken together with the relatively low binding affinity of etoposide for DNA (39Chow K.C. Macdonald T.L. Ross W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 467-473Google Scholar), these data imply that etoposide enters cleavage complexes primarily through interactions with topoisomerase II. To address this possibility, two independent experimental approaches were employed to assess etoposide·enzyme binding in the absence of DNA. Due to the high levels of topoisomerase II required for the techniques discussed below, overexpressed yeast enzyme was utilized for these studies. The first approach took advantage of a fluorescence-based assay previously used to quantitate binding of the anticancer agent, ellipticine, to topoisomerase II (48Froelich-Ammon S.J. Patchan M.W. Osheroff N. Thompson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14998-15005Google Scholar, 58Froelich-Ammon S.J. Burden D.A. Patchan M.W. Elsea S.H. Thompson R.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28018-28021Google Scholar). Because the excitation spectrum of etoposide overlaps that of the enzyme (precluding a direct measurement of drug binding), etoposide· topoisomerase II interactions were monitored by the ability of the drug to displace ellipticine bound to the enzyme. The binding of ellipticine to the enzyme, even in the absence of nucleic acids, (KD≈ 160 nM) is a"
https://openalex.org/W2076649773,"The mechanisms by which stimuli that raise cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations in neurons can increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation are not known. Using rat hippocampal slices and cortical synaptosomes, we have examined the regulation of two highly related cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, pp125 focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2/cell adhesion kinase β (PYK2/CAKβ). Membrane depolarization increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2/CAKβ and pp125FAK. These effects were blocked by EGTA or by protein kinase C inhibitors (RO31-8220; GF109203X) and mimicked by ionomycin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, in the case of pp125FAK, or their combination in the case of PYK2/CAKβ. Glutamate and specific agonists of ionotropic (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate) or metabotropic (trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3,-dicarboxylate) glutamate receptors stimulated the phosphorylation of pp125FAK, but not of PYK2/CAKβ. Glutamate effects were prevented by GF109203X. Thus, in hippocampal slices, tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and PYK2/CAKβ are regulated differentially by pathways involving Ca2+ and protein kinase C. pp125FAK and PYK2/CAKβ may provide specific links between neuronal activity, increases in cytosolic Ca2+ and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which may be important for neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms by which stimuli that raise cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations in neurons can increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation are not known. Using rat hippocampal slices and cortical synaptosomes, we have examined the regulation of two highly related cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, pp125 focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2/cell adhesion kinase β (PYK2/CAKβ). Membrane depolarization increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2/CAKβ and pp125FAK. These effects were blocked by EGTA or by protein kinase C inhibitors (RO31-8220; GF109203X) and mimicked by ionomycin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, in the case of pp125FAK, or their combination in the case of PYK2/CAKβ. Glutamate and specific agonists of ionotropic (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate) or metabotropic (trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3,-dicarboxylate) glutamate receptors stimulated the phosphorylation of pp125FAK, but not of PYK2/CAKβ.

In addition to blocking sulfate assimilation by product inhibition of PAPS reductase, PAP accumulation may have other unidentified toxic effects. The progressive salinization of irrigated land compromises the future of agriculture in arid regions, and it has turned the genetic improvement of salinity tolerance into an urgent biotechnological goal (1Serrano R. Gaxiola R. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 121-138Google Scholar, 2Ashraf M. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 17-42Google Scholar). The identification of crucial metabolic reactions sensitive to salt may provide tools for the genetic engineering of salt tolerance (3Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J.11. 1992: 3157-3164Google Scholar, 4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar). High salt concentrations (>0.3-0.5 M NaCl) inhibit most enzymes because of the perturbation of the hydrophobic-electrostatic balance between the forces maintaining protein structure (5Wyn Jones R.G. Pollard A. Laüchli A. Pirson A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 15B. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 528-562Google Scholar). It seems that many metabolic reactions and membrane functions would be strongly affected by these salt concentrations (5Wyn Jones R.G. Pollard A. Laüchli A. Pirson A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 15B. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 528-562Google Scholar, 6Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar, 7Gimmler H. Kaaden R. Kirchner U. Weyand A. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1984; 114: 131-150Google Scholar). In addition to these relatively nonspecific salt effects, some enzymes may be specially sensitive to inhibition by Na+ or Cl− at much lower concentrations. The identification of these more specific targets is of crucial importance for the understanding of salt damage and for the manipulation of salt tolerance. Ribosomal protein synthesis has been considered a possible salinity target because of the salt sensitivity exhibited in vitro (5Wyn Jones R.G. Pollard A. Laüchli A. Pirson A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 15B. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 528-562Google Scholar). In addition, we could expect sodium sensitivity in the case of potassium-activated enzymes, such as some reactions of sugar metabolism (5Wyn Jones R.G. Pollard A. Laüchli A. Pirson A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 15B. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 528-562Google Scholar), and chloride sensitivity in the case of anion-utilizing enzymes (6Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar, 7Gimmler H. Kaaden R. Kirchner U. Weyand A. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1984; 114: 131-150Google Scholar). No evidence exists about the physiological relevance of any of these potential targets of salt toxicity. An approach to the identification of cellular processes most crucial to salt tolerance under in vivo conditions has been the cloning of yeast genes that by overexpression improve growth under salt stress. Three halotolerance genes have already been isolated. HAL1 (3Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J.11. 1992: 3157-3164Google Scholar) and HAL3 (8Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Ríos G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Google Scholar) modulate intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations and encode components of the regulatory machinery for ion homeostasis. HAL2, on the other hand, does not affect ion homeostasis but is required for methionine biosynthesis and is allelic to MET22 (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar). This suggested that a particular enzyme of the methionine-biosynthetic pathway was salt sensitive. The prediction that methionine supplementation should therefore improve salt tolerance could be demonstrated (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar). HAL2 corresponds to a side reaction essential for sulfate assimilation. Inorganic sulfate is activated in two steps, consuming two ATP molecules, and is accumulated in the form of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfatePAP3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphateAPSadenosine 5′-phosphosulfateAdoMetS-adenosylmethionineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. When this activated sulfate is used by either reduction to sulfite or transfer to other molecules, a nucleotide is formed, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP), which must be hydrolyzed to AMP to recycle adenosine (9Metzler D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol.Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1977: 636Google Scholar). The nucleotidase catalyzing this reaction is encoded by the yeast HAL2/MET22 gene, and it is very sensitive to inhibition by lithium (Ki = 0.1 mM) and sodium (Ki = 20 mM). Excess potassium (>0.1 M) counteracts the inhibition produced by these toxic cations (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate S-adenosylmethionine 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. In this work, we examine whether the HAL2 nucleotidase is an in vivo target of salt toxicity by measuring the accumulation of its substrates, PAP and PAPS, in salt-stressed cells. The results demonstrate a correlation between PAP accumulation and growth inhibition by salt, suggesting that the HAL2 nucleotidase is an important target of salt toxicity under physiological conditions. Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains derived from RS-16 (MATa leu2-3, 112 ura3-251, 328, 372 (3Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J.11. 1992: 3157-3164Google Scholar)) were used. Wild-type strain RS-41 corresponded to RS-16 transformed with control plasmids YCp50 (URA3) and pSB32 (LEU2) (11Rose M. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 195-230Google Scholar) to complement the uracil and leucine auxotrophies. The HAL2-overproducing strain (JRM8 or YEp-HAL2 (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar)) corresponded to strain RS-1051 (RS-16 with a hal2::URA3 disruption (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar)) transformed with expression plasmid pJRM5 (open reading frame of HAL2 in the LEU2 expression plasmid pRS-1024 (12Serrano R. Villalba J.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 481-496Google Scholar)). Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in minimal synthetic dextrose medium containing 2% glucose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), and 50 mM MES adjusted to pH 6.0 with Tris. LiCl, NaCl, or KCl was added as indicated. Salt tolerance in liquid medium was determined as described previously (3Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J.11. 1992: 3157-3164Google Scholar, 4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in sulfate-free minimal medium (13Jakubowski H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 593-598Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.15 mM [35S]sulfate (675 Ci/mol) (Amersham). LiCl (0.1 M) was added when cells reached an absorbance at 660 nm of 0.4-0.5 (exponential phase; measured with an Spectronic 20, Milton Roy Co., Rochester, NY), and the incubation was continued for 2 h. One ml of the labeled culture was centrifuged (30 s at 10,000 rpm), and the cell pellet was extracted with 200 μl of 1 M formic acid during 30 min at 0°C and frozen overnight at −70°C. The next day samples were thawed, clarified by centrifugation, lyophilized, and resuspended in 8 μl of water. Four μl were applied as spots on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (20 × 20 cm; Sigma) and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC as described (14Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Google Scholar). Standard compounds were co-chromatographed with the 35S-labeled extracts and located under UV light. 35S-labeled compounds were visualized by autoradiography, quantitated by scintillation counting, and converted to intracellular concentrations. Intracellular water content was measured as described previously (15Vallejo C.G. Serrano R. Yeast. 1989; 5: 307-319Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to an absorbance at 660 nm of 0.3-0.4 (exponential phase) and then treated with 0.1 M LiCl, 1 M NaCl, or 1 M KCl. At the indicated times, 50-ml samples were harvested by filtration and inmediately extracted with 1 ml of 2 N perchloric acid at 0°C for 15 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, neutralized with 1 ml of 1.8 N KOH and 0.4 NN KHCO3, and centrifuged again as above. Supernatants were dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant), resuspended in 100 μl of water, filtered through Millipore HV filters (0.45 μm), and stored at −70°C. From 5 to 10 μl of each extract were analyzed by HPLC in a Waters 600E liquid chromatograph. Samples were injected onto a reversed phase C18 column (LiChrosphere 100, 4 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, Merck), eluted, and detected as described (16Lim C.K. Peters T.J. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 461: 353-359Google Scholar). Nucleotide peaks were identified by co-injection with standards and, in the case of PAP, also by peak shift after treatment with purified HAL2 nucleotidase (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). Peak areas were quantified with a Waters 746 integrator and converted to millimolar concentrations by comparison with known amounts of PAP, AMP, ADP, and ATP standards. Intracellular water content was considered as described above. 3′-AMP was added routinely as an internal standard before extraction with perchloric acid. Recovery of this nucleotide was >90%. After incubation in medium containing 0.1 M LiCl as described above, samples of 10 ml were collected at the indicated times, processed, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described (8Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Ríos G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies have shown that the HAL2 nucleotidase is inhibited by sodium and lithium ions (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). Therefore, if this enzyme is actually inhibited under in vivo conditions by these toxic cations, we should be able to detect an internal accumulation of its substrate PAP in cells experiencing sodium or lithium stress. To test this hypothesis, we performed HPLC analysis of nucleotide extracts from control (Fig. 1A) and LiCl-treated (Fig. 1B) wild-type yeast cells. Nucleotide peaks corresponding to AMP, ADP, and ATP were identified in the extracts. The most significant difference after lithium treatment was the appearance of a nucleotide peak that was absent in control extracts. This peak had the same retention time as the PAP standard, and it disappeared after incubation of the extracts with purified HAL2 nucleotidase (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar), suggesting that it corresponded to intracellular PAP. Incubation with 1 M NaCl also raised intracellular PAP but to lower levels than the LiCl treatment (Table I). This correlates with the much greater inhibition of the HAL2 nucleotidase by lithium than by sodium (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). Osmotic stress by KCl (Table I) or sorbitol (not shown) did not produce PAP accumulation. Aditionally, neither oxidative stress (30 min with 0.5 mM H2O2) nor heat shock (30 min at 42°C) raised intracellular concentrations of PAP (not shown), suggesting that the accumulation of this nucleotide was specific for sodium and lithium stress.Table I.Effects of salt stress on adenine nucleotide pool sizes and ratios in wild type (A) and HAL2 overexpressing (B) yeast strainsNucleotideControl0.1 M LiCl1 M NaCl1 M KClA.

Open table in a new tab Intracellular PAP could not be detected in control yeast cells, where its concentration must be lower than 10 μM (Table I). This is in agreement with the low Km for PAP (<20 μM) of the HAL2 nucleotidase (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). Other metabolites of the sulfate assimilation pathway such as APS and PAPS have steady-state concentrations that are under normal conditions <1 μM (14Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Google Scholar). Intracellular PAP concentrations increased after salt stress in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Substantial intracellular levels of this nucleotide (>0.5 mM) could be detected as soon as 15 min after LiCl treatment and reached a plateau at 2-3 mM in 2-4 h after salt stress. Intracellular lithium reached maximal concentrations of ∼20 mM in 30-60 min of salt treatment (Fig. 2B). Intracellular potassium experienced a slight decrease (from 340 to 270 mM) during the first hour of LiCl treatment (Fig. 2B). As indicated in Table I, overexpression of HAL2 decreased PAP accumulation during salt stress. This suggests that PAP accumulation was actually due to inhibition of the HAL2 nucleotidase under in vivo conditions. The increase in PAP levels produced by lithium could result in the product inhibition of the enzymatic reactions generating PAP from PAPS, such as PAPS reduction to sulfite during sulfate assimilation, therefore producing a blockade in the pathway. We have measured the intracellular concentrations of PAPS, which is produced inmediately before the step where the HAL2 nucleotidase is operating, and AdoMet, one of the four metabolites of the activated methyl cycle (together with homocysteine, methionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine) where sulfur is first assimilated (14Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Google Scholar, 17Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3, lithium treatment raised intracellular PAPS concentrations (from 0.07 to 0.43 μM) while AdoMet concentrations experienced a 50% decrease. These results suggest an inhibition of the PAPS reductase step during lithium treatment because the concentration of one substrate of the reaction (PAPS) was increased while the concentration of one indirect product (AdoMet) was decreased. This effect can be explained by the known sensitivity of PAPS reductases from Escherichia coli (18Schwenn J.D. Schriek U. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 93-102Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae (19Schwenn J.D. Krone F.A. Husmann K. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 313-319Google Scholar) to inhibition by PAP. Although the inhibition is a mixed type, Vmax is the most affected parameter, with a Ki for PAP of 25 μM (18Schwenn J.D. Schriek U. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 93-102Google Scholar). It can be calculated that under salt stress, where PAP concentrations reach values of 0.3 (NaCl) and 2.9 (LiCl) mM (Table I), the PAPS reductase must be strongly inhibited, >90% in the case of NaCl stress and >99% in the case of LiCl stress. Intracellular PAPS concentrations during lithium treatment were 4 orders of magnitude lower than the measured concentration of PAP (Table I). A plausible explanation for this difference is based on the intrinsic chemical instability of PAPS, which is rapidly converted into PAP and sulfate in solution (20Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Google Scholar). It is likely that some of the PAP accumulated during salt stress derives not from the PAPS reductase reaction, inhibited under these conditions, but from spontaneous hydrolysis of the phosphosulfate bond of PAPS. Given the instability of PAPS and the very low concentrations of this metabolite measured under normal conditions, PAPS may exist in cells mostly bound to its producing and consuming enzymes, APS kinase and PAPS reductase, respectively (17Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Google Scholar). When it accumulates on inhibition of PAPS reductase, the free PAPS released from the enzymes could be spontaneously hydrolyzed into PAP and sulfate at high rates in the cytoplasmic environment. The in vivo inhibition of HAL2 nucleotidase by lithium and sodium implies that cells under salt stress are not able to convert PAP into AMP. This suggest that PAP could act as a sink for adenine nucleotides with dramatic consequences for cell growth. We have determined the intracellular contents of PAP, ATP, ADP, and AMP in control and salt-treated cells of wild-type yeast (Table IA) and HAL2-overexpressing yeast (YEp-HAL2) (Table IB), which exhibit different degrees of growth inhibition by salt (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar). We have repeated these salt tolerance experiments because they are crucial for the interpretation of the nucleotide measurements discussed below and because the HAL2-overexpressing plasmid utilized in this work is different from the previous one. As described previously (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar), NaCl and LiCl produced a much greater growth inhibition than KCl, which only poses osmotic stress. Overexpression of HAL2 improved growth with NaCl and LiCl but not with KCl (Fig. 4). NaCl and LiCl produced a reduction of ∼30% in the total adenine nucleotide pool (AMP, ADP, and ATP), mainly due to a drop in ATP and ADP concentrations not compensated by a small increase in AMP. This depletion of adenine nucleotides is not prevented by overexpression of HAL2, which greatly decreases PAP accumulation and which improves growth under salt stress. Therefore, it is not relevant to the growth inhibition produced by sodium and lithium and cannot be ascribed to the inhibition of HAL2 nucleotidase and concomitant PAP accumulation. It probably corresponds to some other unidentified effect of sodium and lithium on yeast cells. This effect is largely specific for the toxic ions because KCl caused a much lower decrease of the total adenine nucleotide pool. The decrease in the pool of adenine nucleotides produced by NaCl and LiCl, but not by KCl, correlates with a 10% decrease in adenylate energy charge (from 0.9 to 0.8). Again, this change in energy status occurs similarly in the wild type and in the HAL2-overproducing strain (Table I) and therefore does not correlate with either PAP accumulation or growth inhibition. NaCl produces a decrease in the energetic yield of yeast cultures because of an increased requirement of maintenance energy (21Watson T.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 64: 91-99Google Scholar). This is probably concerned with maintaining an intracellular Na+ concentration lower than the extracellular concentration. A plausible mechanism is ATP consumption by the ENA1-encoded sodium (and lithium) efflux ATPase (22Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Google Scholar). In addition, we could expect sodium and lithium inhibition of some enzymes of energy metabolism activated by potassium, such as pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase (5Wyn Jones R.G. Pollard A. Laüchli A. Pirson A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol. 15B. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 528-562Google Scholar). It must be concluded from these studies that the most significant change detected in yeast nucleotides and which correlates with growth inhibition under salt stress is PAP accumulation. This reflects an in vivo inhibition of the HAL2-encoded 3′(2′)-bisphosphate nucleotidase hydrolyzing PAP into AMP and Pi (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). PAP accumulation is specific for the presence of toxic ions and independent of the osmotic component of salt stress. Concomitant to PAP accumulation, there is a blockade of the sulfate assimilation pathway which must be detrimental for yeast growth in the absence of methionine supplementation. These results corroborate the mechanism for salt toxicity in yeast that we previously proposed on the basis of three experimental results: (a) the allelism between HAL2, a gene that on overexpression improves salt tolerance, and the methionine-biosynthetic gene MET22 (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar); (b) the fact that methionine supplementation improves salt tolerance (4Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola F. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Google Scholar); (c) the salt sensitivity exhibited by the HAL2 nucleotidase assayed in vitro (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). There is, however, one observation that still cannot be fully explained by the above mechanism of HAL2 action: hal2 (met22) mutants fail to grow with sulfite as sulfur source, while PAPS reductase mutants (met16) can utilize sulfite (17Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Google Scholar). If the HAL2 nucleotidase was required to prevent PAP accumulation and if this accumulation had as its major effect the inhibition of PAPS reductase, it cannot be understood why the requirement for HAL2 cannot be bypassed by sulfite, the product of PAPS reductase. We could explain the different growth responses of hal2 mutants to methionine (growth) and to sulfite (no growth) because methionine supplementation plays two roles: it provides a source of organic sulfur to bypass the inhibition of the PAPS reductase reaction (something that sulfite could do); but it also causes strong repression of all the genes involved in sulfate assimilation (17Thomas D.

Actually, a blockade of the production of APS and PAPS by methionine supplementation has been demonstrated (14Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Google Scholar). Therefore, methionine supplementation would prevent PAP accumulation in the absence of HAL2 nucleotidase while sulfite supplementation could not. This would lead to the proposal that PAP accumulation in the hal2 mutant has some toxic effect in yeast cells in addition to blocking sulfate assimilation. In animal tissues, enzymatic sulfate transfers from PAPS to proteins, polysaccharides, and small molecules constitute important metabolic reactions (20Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Google Scholar). PAPS sulfotranferases are very sensitive to product inhibition by PAP, to the point that no activity is detected in vitro in the absence of the nucleotidase that converts PAP into AMP (24Brunngraber E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 472-477Google Scholar, 25Ramaswamy S.G. Jacoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10044-10047Google Scholar). Sulfate transfer reactions have also been described in plants (26Schmidt A. Jäger K. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 325-349Google Scholar) although not yet in yeast. Another metabolic reaction sensitive to PAP accumulation is the transfer of a phosphopantetheine group from CoA to the acyl carrier protein. PAP is a product of the reaction, and it strongly inhibits the enzyme holoacyl carrier protein synthase (27Yang L.M. Fernandez M.D. Lamppa G.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 743-750Google Scholar). The accumulation of nonfunctional apoacyl carrier protein will inhibit lipid metabolism, especially the acylation of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (28Keating D.H. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Google Scholar). A genetic approach is currently under way to identify PAP-sensitive reactions relevant under in vivo conditions. HAL2 homologues have recently been identified in higher plants such as the SAL1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (29Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537Google Scholar) and the RHL gene of rice (30Peng Z. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29105-29110Google Scholar). These genes are true functional homologues because they complement the methionine auxotrophy of yeast hal2 mutants and they encode 3′(2′),5′-bisphosphate nucleotidases with enzymatic properties that are similar to the yeast enzyme. One important difference, however, is that the Arabidopsis SAL1 nucleotidase has some activity (one-third than with PAP as substrate) with inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate (29Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537Google Scholar), typical substrates for inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases (31York J.D. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9548-9552Google Scholar), regulatory enzymes that participate in the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway (32Nahorski S.R. Ragan C.I. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 297-303Google Scholar). 3′(2′),5′-Bisphosphate nucleotidases and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases are considered distinct enzymes, with code numbers EC 3.1.3.7 and EC 3.1.3.57, respectively (33International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, (1992) Enzyme Nomenclature, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of the Arabidopsis SAL1 phosphatase may suggest a revision of this distinction. Expression of Arabidopsis SAL1 in yeast increased lithium and sodium efflux (29Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537Google Scholar); therefore, it has been proposed that the product of the SAL1 gene has two functions; it participates both in the sulfur assimilation pathway and in the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, changes in the latter probably affecting cation transport (29Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537Google Scholar). Overexpression of HAL2 does not affect intracellular lithium and sodium concentrations, 2J. R. Murguía and R. Serrano, unpublished data. in agreement with the lack of activity of the HAL2 nucleotidase on inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (10Murguía J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Google Scholar). The activity of rice RHL nucleotidase on inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and its effects on salt tolerance and cation transport by yeast cells have not been investigated (30Peng Z. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29105-29110Google Scholar). The proposal made for E. coli (34Neuwald A.F. Krishnan B.R. Brikun I. Kulakauskas S.K. Suziedelis K. Tomcsanyi T. Leyh T.S. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 415-425Google Scholar) and for Chlorella (35Tsang M.L.S. Schiff J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 113-121Google Scholar) that the physiological substrate for 3′(2′),5′-bisphosphate nucleotidases is PAPS must be evaluated in light of our experimental results. The fact that the rice RHL nucleotidase exhibits slightly lower Km for PAPS than for PAP (Km values of 100 versus 240 μM, respectively) has been taken as evidence for this proposal (30Peng Z. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29105-29110Google Scholar). However, enzyme Km values should be related to intracellular substrate concentrations. Our measurements indicate that PAP, and not PAPS, is the metabolite that accumulates in vivo when the nucleotidase is inhibited by salt stress. As discussed above, PAPS is such an unstable molecule that it probably never reaches concentrations higher than a few micromol/liter, while the more stable PAP may reach millimolar concentrations. Therefore, we postulate that PAP is the physiologically relevant substrate for the HAL2 nucleotidase. In addition, the proposal that PAPS is a highly toxic metabolite with a concentration that must be controlled by a phosphatase (30Peng Z. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29105-29110Google Scholar, 34Neuwald A.F. Krishnan B.R. Brikun I. Kulakauskas S.K. Suziedelis K. Tomcsanyi T. Leyh T.S. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 415-425Google Scholar) does not fit the evidence that a limited accumulation of PAPS during heat shock (up to 10-20 μM) seems beneficial for yeast thermotolerance (14Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5469-5476Google Scholar). A final point of discussion is the possibility that the accumulation of PAP in cells exposed to sodium and lithium may serve a signaling role during salt stress responses. Given the multitude of cellular signaling molecules derived from nucleotides (36Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2378-2382Google Scholar), this possibility deserves investigation. We thank Dr. Avelino Corma and Ms. Maria Jesus Lacruz (Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica, Valencia, Spain) for making available their atomic absorption spectrophotometer and for assistance with ion measurements."

Consistent with this, the native (zymogen) form of Factor X did not induce Ca2+ transients. Homologous but not heterologous inhibition of FVIIa- and FXa-evoked Ca2+ signals by 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone-inactivated FVIIa and FXa suggested that each factor had its own specific cell surface anchoring receptor.

Although the mechanism of this chaperone-like activity is unknown, the affinity of α-crystallin for aggregation-prone proteins is probably based on hydrophobic interactions. α-Crystallins expose a considerable hydrophobic surface to solution, but nevertheless they are very stable and highly soluble. An explanation for this paradox may be that α-crystallin subunits have a polar and unstructured C-terminal extension that functions as a sort of solubilizer. In this paper we have described five αA-crystallins in which charged and hydrophobic residues were inserted in the C-terminal extension. Introduction of lysine, arginine, and aspartate does not substantially influence chaperone-like activity. In contrast, introduction of a hydrophobic tryptophan greatly diminishes functional activity. CD experiments indicate that this mutant has a normal secondary structure and fluorescence measurements show that the inserted tryptophan is located in a polar environment. However, NMR spectroscopy clearly demonstrates that the presence of the tryptophan residue dramatically reduces the flexibility of the C-terminal extension. Furthermore, the introduction of this tryptophan results in a considerably decreased thermostability of the protein.

Increased intracellular levels of cAMP also cause a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in REF52 fibroblasts (5Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Conti M.A. Adelstein R. Glass D.B. Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Google Scholar) and a marked alteration in the shape of epithelial cells (6Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535Google Scholar). Hormone-induced changes in cell shape often precede alterations in cell physiology and/or differentiation. An example is provided by murine Y1 cells. The cells have a flat epithelioid morphology and contain receptors for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that activate adenylate cyclase (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP content elicit a rapid morphological transition that yields rounded refractile cells with short processes (6Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535Google Scholar, 7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar). This cell shape transition is completed before other responses to cAMP are detected. Slower responses are: synthesis and secretion of corticosteroids, induction of cytochrome P-450 steroid hydroxylase genes, and withdrawal of Y1 cells from the cell cycle (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar, 9Handler J.D. Schimmer B.P. Flynn T.R. Szyf M. Seidman J.G. Parker K.L.

The cited responses to cAMP produce a phenotype in Y1 cells that mimics normal secretory cells of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Furthermore, the change in shape of Y1 cells appears to be required for the subsequent appearance of this differentiated phenotype (11Osawa S. Betz G. Hall P.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 99: 1335-1342Google Scholar).The abrupt rounding of ACTH-treated Y1 cells apparently reflects a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar, 11Osawa S. Betz G. Hall P.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 99: 1335-1342Google Scholar). Although this morphological transition facilitates subsequent cAMP signaling in Y1 cells, little is known about effector proteins and mechanisms that are involved in coupling activation of PKA to the control of cell shape. Likewise, the possibility that early downstream mediators of PKA action accumulate at specific loci within the Y1 cytoskeleton has not been investigated. Thus, PKA-regulated effector proteins may be anchored and enriched at sites along lengthy microfilaments (stress fibers) or concentrated in the F-actin-enriched cell cortex, which is contiguous with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. To begin an analysis of these topics we addressed several basic questions: Is the cortical actin cytoskeleton a proximal site of cAMP/PKA action? If so, are focal adhesion protein complexes (which anchor actin filaments in the cell cortex) early downstream targets in the cAMP signaling pathway? Are the effects of cAMP on cell shape solely the result of PKA-catalyzed Ser/Thr phosphorylation of effector proteins, or are other signaling pathways involved?We demonstrate that cAMP causes the rapid tyrosine dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin in Y1 cells. Subsequently, paxillin translocates to the cytoplasm, stress fibers vanish, and F-actin accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates and membrane ruffles. Remnants of multiple focal adhesions coalesce into large complexes that include aggregated F-actin. Pervanadate inhibits these processes, whereas genistein prevents their reversal. Thus, protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity couples activated PKA to regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization in Y1 cells.RESULTSY1 epithelial cells firmly adhere to uncoated plastic dishes or glass coverslips (Fig. 1A, a). Treatment with 0.2 mM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, alters cell morphology. Within 3 min some cells begin to retract their membranes and assume a “rounder” shape. After 6 min, ∼10% of the cells display a highly refractile central region that gives rise to short, incompletely retracted processes (Fig. 1A, b). Approximately 50% of the cells exhibit this shape after 10 min, and virtually the entire population completes the morphological transition by 30 min (Fig. 1A, c). Incubation with 20 nM ACTH or 20 μM forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, yields the same results. The speed with which Y1 cells alter their cytoskeleton suggests that post-translational modifications of proteins mediate the response to cAMP.Proteins with apparent molecular weights of 130,000 and 76,000 account for most of the PY residues in Y1 cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Treatment of Y1 cells with ACTH, forskolin or CPT-cAMP resulted in dephosphorylation of the 76-kDa polypeptide within 1 min (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). The 130-kDa protein was not markedly dephosphorylated in ACTH and forskolin-treated cells. Dephosphorylation of the 76-kDa protein precedes the cell shape transition and identifies this protein as an early downstream target of cAMP/PKA action.The size and PY content of the 76-kDa protein suggested that it might be paxillin, a focal adhesion phosphoprotein (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 17Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Google Scholar). Anti-paxillin IgG quantitatively precipitated a broad band of polypeptides with Mr values in the range of 68,000-76,000 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-7). This pattern is typical for paxillin (17Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Google Scholar). Densitometry revealed that ∼20% of the protein in the broad band was bound by anti-PY IgGs (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8 and 9). A similar percentage of paxillin molecules are phosphorylated on tyrosine during focal adhesion formation (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar). The apparent Mr of the phosphoprotein precipitated by anti-PY IgG was ∼76,000 (Fig. 2, A, lane 9, and B, lanes 3 and 9), indicating that the upper portion of the band obtained with anti-paxillin IgG (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3, 5, 9, and 10) corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylated forms of paxillin. Paxillin was dephosphorylated when cells were treated with forskolin or CPT-cAMP (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-13). Because the 76-kDa PY immunoreactivity observed in Figs. 1B (lanes 1, 2, 6, and 10) and 2 (lane 9) is quantitatively precipitated by anti-paxillin IgG, we conclude that paxillin is a downstream target for PKA-mediated signaling in Y1 cells.Fig. 2Cyclic AMP stimulates the dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the focal adhesion protein paxillin. Control Y1 cells and cells incubated for 10 min with either 20 μM forskolin or 0.1 mM CPT-cAMP were solubilized with PEMS lysis buffer. Samples of solubilized proteins were incubated with either anti-paxillin IgG (lanes 2-7) or anti-PY IgG (lanes 8-13) that was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Proteins precipitated with the beads (P), and polypeptides remaining in the supernatant solution (S) were size-fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis (9% gel) and transferred to an Immobilon P (IP) membrane. Lanes 1 and 14 received total proteins (T) from control and CPT-cAMP-treated Y1 cells, respectively. Replicate Western blots were probed with anti-paxillin (α-Pax) (A) and anti-PY (α-PY) IgGs.

Y1 cells express a low level of FAK125, and its content of PY is negligible. 2J.-D. Han and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. Neither 0.3 mM genistein (Fig. 3A, lane 7) nor 50 μM tyrphostin A25 affected cell shape or PY content of paxillin over a 7-h period. However, treatment with genistein for 8 h produced a rounded phenotype in 20% of Y1 cells; after 14 h of incubation with genistein nearly 90% of Y1 cells resembled cells treated with CPT-cAMP for 30 min (Fig. 1A, c). The PY content of paxillin was slightly diminished at 8 h (not shown), whereas the protein was predominantly dephosphorylated after incubation with genistein for 14 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 4, 7, and 8). These data suggest that PY on paxillin is hydrolyzed very slowly in unstimulated cells. Thus, a paxillin tyrosine kinase is not a likely target for rapid PKA-mediated signaling.Fig. 3PTP activity is required for the cAMP-regulated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, whereas tyrosine protein kinase is essential for the restoration of epithelial morphology and the basal state of paxillin phosphorylation. A, Y1 cells were incubated with or without 0.2 mM CPT-cAMP for 10 min. Replicate plates of CPT-cAMP-treated cells were either processed immediately after exposure to the cAMP analog or incubated for an additional 20 min in medium lacking CPT-cAMP. Cell proteins (0.1 mg) were size-fractionated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (9%) and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”). The blot was probed with anti-PY IgG. Lanes 1 and 4 received proteins from Y1 cells that were not exposed to CPT-cAMP; lanes 2 and 5 contained proteins from cells harvested immediately after exposure to CPT-cAMP; and lanes 3 and 6 received proteins from cells that were incubated in the absence of CPT-cAMP for 20 min after a 10-min exposure to the cAMP analog. Proteins analyzed in lanes 4-6 were obtained from cells that were maintained in the presence of 0.3 mM genistein (60 min of preincubation plus experimental manipulation in the presence of the drug). Proteins in lanes 7 and 8 were derived from Y1 cells that were chronically maintained in medium supplemented with 0.3 mM genistein for 7 and 14 h, respectively. B, Y1 cells were preincubated with CPT-cAMP for 30 min to generate refractile cells with neurite-like processes. The morphology of a typical cell was monitored by real time video microscopy after feeding the cells with fresh medium lacking the cAMP analog. Frames obtained at 0, 6, 10, and 20 min (a-d, respectively) after removing CPT-cAMP document the rapid restoration of epithelial morphology.

Thus, phosphorylation of paxillin may be a requisite step in the re-establishment of the epithelial phenotype of Y1 cells.Pervanadate, which potently inhibits PTPs (19Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Google Scholar), suppressed cAMP-stimulated paxillin dephosphorylation in short (Fig. 3C) and long term (tested up to 1 h) experiments. Cells did not alter their shape (Fig. 4 g-h′), and paxillin became a sharp (maximally phosphorylated) band on Western immunoblots (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). Although pervanadate may partially activate certain tyrosine kinases (19Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Google Scholar, 20Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Google Scholar), results obtained with genistein (see above) suggest that increased tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for the cAMP-controlled morphological transition. Moreover, phenylarsene oxide, a PTP inhibitor that does not activate tyrosine kinases, also blocked effects of cAMP in short term experiments.2Fig. 4Cyclic AMP induces the translocation of paxillin, aggregation of PY-containing proteins, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in Y1 cells. Upper panel, Y1 cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 0.2 mM CPT-cAMP for 0 (a, a′, b, b′, g, and g′), 10 (c, c′, d, d′, h, and h′), or 30 min (e, e′, f, and f′). Cells shown in g, g′, h, and h′ were preincubated with 0.2 mM pervanadate for 10 min, and the same concentration of pervanadate was used during a subsequent 10-min experimental incubation with CPT-cAMP. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with 3% albumin. Y1 cells in a, c, and e were incubated sequentially with anti-PY IgG and 10 μg/ml FITC-conjugated, goat IgGs directed against mouse immunoglobulins. The same cells (a′, c′, and e′) were co-stained for F-actin by using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Y1 cells in b, d, f, g, and h were incubated with anti-paxillin and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and then co-stained with rhodamine-tagged phalloidin (b′, d′, f′, g′ and h′). Fluorescence signals corresponding to antigen-antibody (green) or F-actin-phalloidin (red) complexes were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bar, 10 μM. Lower panel, Y1 cells were co-stained for proteins containing PY (green) and paxillin (red) after incubation with 0.2 mM CPT-cAMP for 10 (a and a′) or 30 min (b and b′).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Y1 cells contain actin stress fibers (Fig. 4, upper panel, a′ and b′) and focal adhesions that stain with antibodies directed against either PY or paxillin (Fig. 4, upper panel, a and b). CPT-cAMP promotes the rapid translocation of a substantial proportion of paxillin from focal adhesions to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, d and f). As paxillin redistributes, stress fibers become disorganized and F-actin is concentrated in membrane ruffles and intracellular aggregates (Fig. 4, c′ and d′), although remnants of focal adhesions are evident (Fig. 4c). After 30 min most of the paxillin is diffusely dispersed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4f). In contrast, paxillin-depleted focal adhesion complexes (which still contain protein linked PY and a low level of paxillin) coalesce in co-aggregates with actin (Fig. 4, e and e′). Double immunostaining analysis directly verified that most of the paxillin separates from focal adhesion complexes and accumulates in cytoplasm when Y1 cells are incubated with CPT-cAMP (Fig. 4, lower panel). This phenotype is stable for at least 90 min. Similar results were obtained with ACTH and forskolin. cAMP-regulated changes in cytoskeleton were prevented by pervanadate (Fig. 4, g, g′, h, and h′) or phenylarsene oxide.DISCUSSIONShape and functions of Y1 adrenal cells are controlled by hormones that activate PKA (6Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535Google Scholar, 7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell.

When the cAMP concentration is low, Y1 cells have a flat epithelial shape that receives structural support from a network of actin filaments (Fig. 4, upper panel, a′ and b′). At the cell cortex, the filaments are anchored by multi-protein complexes known as focal adhesions (Fig. 4, upper panel, a and b) (21Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar, 22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). Focal adhesions mediate bidirectional signaling between the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix by coupling with integrins. Tensin, FAK125 and paxillin are constituents of focal adhesions (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 21Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar, 22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). Ligand-activated integrins stimulate (indirectly) the phosphorylation of these proteins on Tyr. Moreover, phosphorylation of paxillin is tightly coupled to the de novo assembly of F-actin-focal adhesion-integrin complexes (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 17Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Google Scholar, 21Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar).We observed that an increase in cAMP content (and activation of PKA (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 23Gutman N.S. Rae P.A. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 97: 451-460Google Scholar)) triggers the rapid (≤1 min) and selective dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on paxillin in Y1 cells. The dephosphorylation reaction precedes depletion of paxillin from focal adhesions, disassembly of adhesion plaques, dissolution of stress fibers, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, cAMP/PKA actions appear to be initially targeted to the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in the cell cortex. Paxillin is a previously unappreciated, early downstream target in a PKA-mediated signaling pathway.Acute regulation of paxillin phosphorylation is not exerted at the level of tyrosine kinase(s). Rather, cAMP elicits an apparent increase in PTP activity. Perhaps PKA directly phosphorylates and activates a PTP. Ser39 of PTP-PEST is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and in cells (24Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3763-3771Google Scholar). However, this modification reduced PTP-PEST activity by ∼30% in cell extracts. Although the exact regulatory significance of serine phosphorylation in PTP-PEST and other PTPs remains to be determined, the data indicate that PTPs can be direct targets for PKA in intact cells. Alternatively, PKA may phosphorylate paxillin within the consensus substrate sequence 496RRGSL500 (25Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Google Scholar). If PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation alters the conformation of paxillin, its accessibility to regulated or constitutively active PTPs may be increased. More complex mechanisms involving phosphorylation of activators or inhibitors of PTPs are also possible (26Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6696-6700Google Scholar).Although exact mechanisms remain to be determined, it is evident that cAMP (PKA) regulates disassembly of focal adhesions and dissolution of actin filaments as well as the PY content of paxillin. Effects of cAMP on Y1 cells are blocked by PTP inhibitors. Moreover, tyrosine protein kinase activity is essential for reassembly of F-actin-focal adhesion complexes, regeneration and recruitment of phosphopaxillin to the cell cortex, and restoration of epithelial shape of Y1 cells when cAMP levels decline. Because injection of recombinant PTPs into Y1 cells produces the phenotype shown in Figs. 1A (c) and 4 (c-f),2 it appears that PTP activation and/or translocation is a necessary and sufficient step in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell shape. Coordinated control of paxillin dephosphorylation and cell morphology via PKA-mediated signaling is not restricted to Y1 cells. Similar results were obtained with immortalized forebrain neurons that rapidly extend long neurites in response to isoproterenol, 8-bromo-cAMP, or forskolin. 3J.-D. Han, J. Kwon, M. Downen, B. Wainer, and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. Paxillin subserves intertwined scaffolding and signaling functions in focal adhesions via distinct domains that bind ≥6 effector proteins (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 21Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar, 22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). Csk, Crk, and tensin contain SH2 domains that bind PY-containing segments of paxillin. Engagement of integrins with extracellular matrix stimulates (indirectly) tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, thereby enhancing multi-protein complex formation (16Turner C.E. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 17Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Google Scholar). cAMP-controlled tyrosine dephosphorylation of paxillin would generate incomplete (possibly unstable) focal adhesion complexes and compromise signaling between integrins and effectors in the actin cytoskeleton. A logical speculation is that changes in the quality or intensity of such signals coupled with a co-operative weakening in focal adhesion structure due to the loss of SH2 binding sites results in the displacement of stress fibers from the cell cortex and the redistribution of F-actin.In summary, our results suggest that a PTP and paxillin could be early, target/effector proteins in a cAMP-controlled signaling pathway that regulates cell shape. Y1 cells provide a system for further evaluation of this proposition.

Increased intracellular levels of cAMP also cause a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in REF52 fibroblasts (5Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Conti M.A. Adelstein R. Glass D.B. Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Google Scholar) and a marked alteration in the shape of epithelial cells (6Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535Google Scholar). Hormone-induced changes in cell shape often precede alterations in cell physiology and/or differentiation. An example is provided by murine Y1 cells. The cells have a flat epithelioid morphology and contain receptors for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that activate adenylate cyclase (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP content elicit a rapid morphological transition that yields rounded refractile cells with short processes (6Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535Google Scholar, 7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar). This cell shape transition is completed before other responses to cAMP are detected. Slower responses are: synthesis and secretion of corticosteroids, induction of cytochrome P-450 steroid hydroxylase genes, and withdrawal of Y1 cells from the cell cycle (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar, 9Handler J.D. Schimmer B.P. Flynn T.R. Szyf M. Seidman J.G. Parker K.L.

The cited responses to cAMP produce a phenotype in Y1 cells that mimics normal secretory cells of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Furthermore, the change in shape of Y1 cells appears to be required for the subsequent appearance of this differentiated phenotype (11Osawa S. Betz G. Hall P.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 99: 1335-1342Google Scholar).The abrupt rounding of ACTH-treated Y1 cells apparently reflects a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (7Schimmer B.P. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 181-214Google Scholar, 8Schimmer B.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 8: 135-145Google Scholar, 11Osawa S. Betz G. Hall P.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 99: 1335-1342Google Scholar). Although this morphological transition facilitates subsequent cAMP signaling in Y1 cells, little is known about effector proteins and mechanisms that are involved in coupling activation of PKA to the control of cell shape. Likewise, the possibility that early downstream mediators of PKA action accumulate at specific loci within the Y1 cytoskeleton has not been investigated. Thus, PKA-regulated effector proteins may be anchored and enriched at sites along lengthy microfilaments (stress fibers) or concentrated in the F-actin-enriched cell cortex, which is contiguous with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. To begin an analysis of these topics we addressed several basic questions: Is the cortical actin cytoskeleton a proximal site of cAMP/PKA action? If so, are focal adhesion protein complexes (which anchor actin filaments in the cell cortex) early downstream targets in the cAMP signaling pathway? Are the effects of cAMP on cell shape solely the result of PKA-catalyzed Ser/Thr phosphorylation of effector proteins, or are other signaling pathways involved?We demonstrate that cAMP causes the rapid tyrosine dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin in Y1 cells. Subsequently, paxillin translocates to the cytoplasm, stress fibers vanish, and F-actin accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates and membrane ruffles. Remnants of multiple focal adhesions coalesce into large complexes that include aggregated F-actin. Pervanadate inhibits these processes, whereas genistein prevents their reversal. Thus, protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity couples activated PKA to regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization in Y1 cells."

Recombinant factor XI proteins were expressed in which each of the four apple domains of the heavy chain (designated A1 through A4) were individually replaced with the corresponding domain from the homologous but functionally distinct protease prekallikrein (PK). To identify the site of factor IX binding, the chimeric proteins were activated with factor XIIa and tested for their capacity to activate factor IX in plasma coagulation and purified protein assays. The chimera with the substitution in the third apple domain (factor XI/PKA3) had <1% of the coagulant activity of wild type factor XIa in a plasma coagulation assay, whereas the chimeras with substitutions in A1, A2, and A4 demonstrated significant activity (68-140% of wild type activity). The Km for activation of factor IX by factor XIa/PKA3 (12.7 μM) is more than 30-fold higher than the Km for activation by wild type factor XIa or the other factor XI/PK chimeras (0.11-0.37 μM).

In patients with APL, treatment with RA results in differentiation of leukemic cells and temporary disease remission (15Warrell R.P. de The H. Wang Z.-Y. Degos L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 177-189Google Scholar). PML, like Sp100 and NDP52, is expressed in a wide variety of human cell lines. Immunoreactive PML was detected in myeloid precursor cells as well as erythroblasts and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (16Daniel M.T. Koken M. Romagne O. Barbey S. Bazarbachi A. Stadler M. Guillemin M.C. Degos L. Chomienne C. de The H. Blood. 1993; 82: 1858-1867Google Scholar). In addition, PML was detected in psoriatic skin lesions, hyperplastic breast and colon tissues, and in the endometrial mucosa during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (17Koken M.H.M. Linares-Cruz G. Quignon F. Viron A. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Sobczak-Thepot J. Juhlin L. Degos L. Calvo F. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1315-1324Google Scholar). In recent studies, Sternsdorf et al. (18Sternsdorf T. Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 257-268Google Scholar) demonstrated that PML, like Sp100, is a target of autoantibodies in patients with PBC. Expression of the three previously identified components of the NB is enhanced by treatment with IFNs (8Korioth F. Gieffers C. Maul G.G. Frey J. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 1-13Google Scholar, 19Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4067-4073Google Scholar, 20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar). Guldner et al. (19Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4067-4073Google Scholar) suggested that enhanced expression of Sp100 by IFNs reflects a role for Sp100 in the “anti-viral state.” Doucas et al. (20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar) demonstrated that IFN-induced expression of PML in HEp2 cells was associated with inhibition of adenovirus replication. The NB is a site of interaction between viral and host proteins. Maul et al. (21Maul G.G. Guldner H.H. Spivack J.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2679-2690Google Scholar) and Maul and Everett (22Maul G.G. Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1223-1233Google Scholar) demonstrated that infection of cells with herpes simplex virus type I resulted in disruption of the NB. Using herpes simplex virus type I deletion mutants, disruption of the nuclear body was shown to be a result of the action of the viral protein ICP0. Recent studies have demonstrated that other viral proteins, including the adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein, also interact with this nuclear organelle (20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar, 23Puvion-Dutilleul F. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M. Quignon F. Puvion E. de The H. Exp.

In this study, serum from a patient with PBC was used to identify a cDNA encoding a third autoantigen in the NB. In keeping with the nomenclature introduced for Sp100 and because the protein has an apparent molecular weight of 140 kDa, the protein was designated Sp140. High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes. As with the other components of the NB, IFN treatment enhanced expression of Sp140. In addition, high levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in myeloid precursor cell lines after chemically induced cellular differentiation. Serum was obtained from a patient with PBC. The diagnosis was based on the presence of elevated liver function enzymes and high titer antibodies directed against the mitochondrial antigen E2-pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (25Kaplan M.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 521-528Google Scholar). HL60 cells (American Type Tissue Collection, Rockville, MD) and NB4 cells (a gift of M. Lanotte, Institut National de la Sante et Recherche Medicale, Paris, France) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (200 units/ml), and streptomycin (200 μg/ml). Differentiation of HL60 cells toward monocytes was induced by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 2 × 10−4M). Differentiation of HL60 cells toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes was induced by incubation with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO; 1.2%) (26Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Google Scholar, 27Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Google Scholar). The effect of IFN on the expression of Sp140 in HL60 cells was studied by incubating these cells in the presence of IFN-γ (200 units/ml). Differentiation of NB4 cells was induced by treatment for 5 days with all-trans retinoic acid (RA; 1 μM) (28Lanotte M. Matrin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Google Scholar). Adherent cells were grown in tissue culture chambers (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 15 min. Cytospin preparation of nonadherent cells was performed with 50,000 cells at 500 rpm for 5 min followed by air drying and fixation in paraformaldehyde. Prior to incubation with antibodies, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in 60% methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Cells were immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against PML (a gift of K. van Der Kraan, E. C. Slater Instituut, Amsterdam) (29Stuurman N. de Graaf A. Floore A. Josso A. Humbel B. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 773-784Google Scholar) or rat antiserum directed against Sp140 using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complexes (ABC) (Vector ABC Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories). In some experiments, cells were stained with rat anti-Sp140 antibodies that were affinity-purified using recombinant protein (see below). Cells incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antiserum were subsequently exposed to either TruBlue peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), which resulted in blue staining or 3,3′-diaminobenzimide (DAB) which produced a brown precipitate. Similarly, cells incubated with rat anti-SP140 antiserum and biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG antiserum were treated with either TruBlue peroxidase substrate or DAB. Control studies included immunostaining with preimmune rat serum and anti-Sp140 antibodies preasbsorbed with recombinant protein (see below). Double immunostaining reactions were used to determine the cellular location of Sp140 relative to PML. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ABC and DAB (brown chromagen) were used to detect PML, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated ABC and PhThalo Blue (Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories, Inc.) were used to detect Sp140. Patient serum diluted 1:200 in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.4) was used to screen a λGT11 cDNA expression library prepared from HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells (Clontech) (30Young R.A. Davis R.W. Science. 1983; 222: 778-782Google Scholar). One clone expressing immunoreactive protein was isolated from approximately one million bacteriophages. The cDNA clone (Sp140.1) was radiolabeled and used to screen a λGT10 human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library (31Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Google Scholar). One positive clone (Sp140.2) was identified. Amplification of the 5′ end of the cDNA encoding Sp140 was performed using the 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies Inc.) (32Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) and cDNA prepared from human placenta (Clontech). The first polymerase chain reaction used an 18-nucleotide primer (GSP1: 5′-CCTGAGGCACTGCTATAT-3′) and the anchor primer supplied by the manufacturer. A second, “nested” oligonucleotide with a 5′ EcoRI site (GSP2: 5′-CGGAATTCGAAATGGCCTTGTTATTG-3′) was used with a second anchor primer (modified to include an EcoRI site) to further amplify the product. The polymerase chain reaction product was treated with EcoRI and ligated into pUC19. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs and two independent 5′-RACE products were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (33Sanger F. Science. 1981; 214: 1205-1210Google Scholar). To create a full-length cDNA encoding Sp140, a KpnI/BstYI fragment of the 5′-RACE product and a BstYI/EcoRI fragment of cDNA Sp140.2 were ligated into the KpnI and EcoRI sites in eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) to create plasmid pCDNA3-Sp140. The plasmid was used in the TnT Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to produce in vitro translated protein. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized with recombinant protein containing Sp140 amino acids 131-391 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The plasmid encoding this portion of Sp140 was prepared by ligating cDNA Sp140.1 into the EcoRI site of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli, and expression of the fusion protein was induced by treatment with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The 110-kDa fusion protein was purified from E. coli proteins as described by Smith and Johnson (34Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Primary immunization of three rats was performed using 50 μg of purified protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant for each animal. Two subsequent booster injections consisting of 50 μg of protein were given at 2-week intervals. Rat antibodies directed against Sp140 were affinity-purified using nitrocellulose-bound recombinant protein as described by Olmsted (35Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Google Scholar). The GST-Sp140-(131-391) fusion protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose as described below. The membrane was incubated in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and was then incubated with rat antiserum diluted 1:10 in blocking solution. Bound antibodies were eluted by treatment with 100 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) for 10 min at room temperature. The antibody solution was neutralized by addition of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.8). Affinity-purified antibodies were concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (W. R. Grace and Co., Beverly, MA). To confirm the specificity of anti-Sp140 antibodies, rat antiserum (or affinity-purified anti-Sp140 antibodies) were preincubated with 10 μg of purified, recombinant protein for 1 h at room temperature prior to use in immunoblot or immunohistochemistry. Me2SO-treated HL60 cells were lysed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (2 μM), and pepstatin A (1 μM). Me2SO-treated HL60 cell lysates or reticulocyte lysates containing in vitro translated protein were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10%β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were fractionated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h and were then incubated in human serum diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. Bound antibodies were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). For studies using rat antiserum, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in antiserum diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antiserum (Amersham) and chemiluminescence. The level of mRNA encoding Sp140 in human tissues was determined by hybridizing membranes contained 2.5 μg of poly(A)+-selected RNA from human tissues (multiple tissue Northern blots, Clontech Laboratories) with a 32P-radiolabeled SacI-EcoRI fragment of Sp140 (bp 2,089-2,905). Membranes were washed under stringent conditions and were exposed to autoradiography for 9 h. To confirm the presence of poly (A)+-selected RNA in each lane, the membranes were hybridized with a 32P-radiolabeled β-actin cDNA. The membranes were washed under stringent conditions and exposed to autoradiography for 30 min. RNA was extracted from human cell lines using the guanidium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (38Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , pp. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.2-7.84Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated in formaldehyde-agarose gels (10 μg/lane) and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled SacI/EcoRI restriction fragment of the Sp140 cDNA. Membranes were washed and subjected to autoradiography. To confirm comparable loading of RNA in each lane, membranes were hybridized with a 10-fold molar excess of a 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide complementary to rat 18 S RNA (39Lee R.T. Bloch K.D. Pfeffer J.M. Pfeffer M.A. Neer E.J. Seidman C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 431-434Google Scholar). Patients with the autoimmune disease PBC produce autoantibodies directed against proteins in the nuclear body. To identify novel components of this structure, serum from a patient with PBC was used to screen a λGT11 cDNA expression library prepared from HEpG2 cells. Among approximately one million bacteriophages, one clone (Sp140.1) producing immunoreactive recombinant protein was identified. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was found to contain a 781-bp open reading frame (ORF) that extended for the entire length of the fragment, suggesting that the cDNA encoded only a portion of a protein. To identify a full-length cDNA, the DNA fragment was radiolabeled and used to rescreen the HEpG2 cDNA library; no additional clones were identified. The radiolabeled fragment was then used to screen a HUVEC cDNA library, and a single hybridizing cDNA (Sp140.2) was identified among one million bacteriophages. The clone contained a 2,732-bp insert that included the entire length of Sp140.1. A 2,193-nucleotide ORF extended to the 5′ end of Sp140.2, suggesting that this clone also encoded only part of the full-length protein. The 5′-RACE technique was used to identify the 5′ end of the mRNA encoding Sp140. The RACE product contained an additional 173-bp segment. The polymerase chain reaction product and the 5′ end of Sp140.2 were joined at a BstYI site, and the full-length cDNA was ligated into eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3. To confirm that the isolated cDNA encoded a protein that reacted with autoantibodies in the patient's serum, the plasmid was used for in vitro transcription and translation of Sp140. Autoantibodies in the patient's serum reacted with the 140-kDa translation product by immunoblot (Fig. 1, panel A, + lane). In contrast, this band was not detected in a lane containing reticulocyte lysate proteins alone (Fig. 1, panel A, − lane). These results demonstrated that pCDNA3-Sp140 encoded an immunoreactive protein. The cDNA encoding Sp140 was 2,905 bp in length and contained an ORF from 107 to 2,365 (Fig. 2A). The start codon was preceded by an in-frame stop codon. Several features of the predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 were of interest. The amino-terminal portion of Sp140, between amino acids 29 and 157, was 49% identical to the amino-terminal region of Sp100, a previously identified autoantigen within the NB (Fig. 2B). The region in Sp140 between amino acids 228-317 was strongly negatively charged. Twenty-nine of the 92 amino acids in this region were either glutamic or aspartic acid. The central portion of Sp140, between amino acids 381-400, contained a potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence (40Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Google Scholar, 41Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar, 42Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Google Scholar). The carboxyl portion of Sp140 contained a cysteine-rich, zinc-finger motif (amino acids 579-639). This region was followed by a segment (amino acids 681-715) that was similar to the bromodomain in S. cerevisiae protein BDF1 (Fig. 2C) (43Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-572Google Scholar, 44Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Google Scholar, 45Lygerou Z. Conesa C. Lesage P. Swanson R.N. Ruet A. Carlson M. Sentenac A. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5332-5340Google Scholar). The presence of a strongly negatively charged region, zinc-finger motif and bromodomain suggested that Sp140 may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription. The expression of the gene encoding Sp140 in human tissues was analyzed by RNA blot hybridization. High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 3). In contrast, much lower levels of Sp140 mRNA were observed in thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and colon. Low levels of a slightly smaller transcript, possibly an alternatively spliced form of Sp140 mRNA, were detected in several tissues. In addition, a 1,200-nucleotide transcript of uncertain significance was detected in human testis. Very low levels of Sp140 mRNA were observed in human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (data not shown). To investigate the expression of Sp140 in cells of the monocyte/granulocyte lineage, RNA was prepared from the myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 before and after induction of cellular differentiation. Treatment of HL60 cells with Me2SO induces a polymorphonuclear leukocyte morphology; treatment with PMA induces a monocyte-like morphology (26Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Google Scholar, 27Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Google Scholar). Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in untreated HL60 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4). The level of mRNA was increased by treatment of HL60 cells with either PMA (lane 2) or Me2SO (lane 5). Treatment of human APL cell line NB4 with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is also associated with cellular differentiation (28Lanotte M. Matrin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Google Scholar). Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in NB4 cells prior to treatment with RA (Fig. 4, lane 7). In contrast, 5 days after addition of RA (1 μM), the level of Sp140 mRNA was markedly increased (lane 8). These results demonstrated that differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cells was associated with increased expression of Sp140. The expression of previously characterized components of the NB was enhanced by treatment of cells with IFN (8Korioth F. Gieffers C. Maul G.G. Frey J. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 1-13Google Scholar, 17Koken M.H.M. Linares-Cruz G. Quignon F. Viron A. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Sobczak-Thepot J. Juhlin L. Degos L. Calvo F. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1315-1324Google Scholar, 19Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4067-4073Google Scholar, 20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of IFN on the level of Sp140 mRNA, HL60 cells were treated with IFN-γ (200 units/ml). Increased Sp140 mRNA levels were detected 24 h after treatment and persisted for at least 4 days (Fig. 5). In addition, treatment with IFN-γ further increased Sp140 mRNA in cells treated with PMA (Fig. 4, lane 3) or Me2SO (Fig. 4, lane 6). These results demonstrated that, as with Sp100, NDP52, and PML, expression of Sp140 was enhanced by IFN-γ. To permit cellular localization of Sp140 by immunohistochemical techniques, antiserum directed against a recombinant fragment of the protein was prepared. Three rats were immunized with Sp140 amino acids 131-391 fused to GST (GST-Sp140-(131-391)). The resulting antisera reacted with the in vitro translation product of pCDNA3-Sp140 (Fig. 1B, + lane). In addition, the antisera reacted with a 140-kDa band in an immunoblot prepared from Me2SO-treated HL60 cells (Fig. 6, lane 1). Pretreatment of rat antiserum with recombinant GST-Sp140-(131-391) blocked reactivity with the 140-kDa protein (Fig. 6, lane 2). These results demonstrated that rat antiserum reacted with Sp140. Although the region of Sp140 used to immunize rats contained a short segment that was similar to Sp100 (9 of 27 amino acids identical), the rat antiserum did not react with Sp100 by immunoblot. In addition, rat antiserum did not stain NBs in HEp2 cells, a cell line that contains high levels of Sp100, but only very low levels of Sp140 (data not shown). To determine the cellular location of Sp140, affinity-purified rat anti-Sp140 antibodies were prepared and used to stain Me2SO-treated HL60 cells. Antibodies reacted with 5-20 punctate structures in the nucleus of these cells (Fig. 7, panel A). This is the same pattern as that produced by mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against PML (panel B). Pretreatment of rat anti-Sp140 antibodies with recombinant protein completely blocked the NB staining pattern (panel C). Two-color immunohistochemistry demonstrated that rat anti-Sp140 antibodies and mouse anti-PML antibodies localized to the same structures in individual cells (panel D). To investigate the cellular distribution of Sp140 in APL cell line NB4, rat antiserum was used to stain NB4 cells before and after treatment with RA. Rat antiserum directed against Sp140 stained NBs in NB4 cells that were treated for 5 days with RA (Fig. 7, panel E). Mouse monoclonal antibody directed against PML produced the same pattern of staining in RA-treated NB4 cells (panel F). Rat anti-Sp140 antiserum did not stain the nuclei of untreated NB4 cells (panel G). Patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis produce antibodies directed against components of a cellular organelle known as the nuclear body. Two proteins in the NB, Sp100 and PML, have previously been shown to be targets of autoantibodies. In this study, serum from a patient with PBC was used to identify a novel NB antigen which was designated Sp140. The amino-terminal portion of Sp140 was 49% identical to the amino-terminal region of Sp100. These portions of Sp100 and Sp140 contain potential coiled-coil motifs (data not shown). Koken et al. (14Koken M.H.M. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Guillemin M.C. Viron A. Linares-Cruz G. Stuurman N. de Jong L. Szostecki C. Calvo F. Chomienne C. Degos L. Puvion E. de The H. EMBO. 1994; 13: 1073-1083Google Scholar) hypothesized that the amino-terminal domain of Sp100 was a likely region for interactions between Sp100 and “other PBC autoantigens.” A direct interaction between Sp100 and Sp140 has not yet been demonstrated. The region in Sp140 between amino acids 579 and 619 contained a cysteine-rich, zinc-finger motif. The presence of a zinc-finger domain in Sp140 suggests that the protein is a member of a larger family of proteins that have been implicated in the control of development, cellular differentiation, and cell growth. The zinc-finger region may bind DNA directly or may interact with a second protein to form a dimer that binds DNA (46Schleif R. Science. 1988; 241: 1182-1187Google Scholar, 47Struhl K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 137-140Google Scholar, 48Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Google Scholar). The order of the cysteine/histidine residues in Sp140 (C4HC3) differed slightly from that of the previously described RING finger (C3HC4) and LIM motif (C2HC5). Koken et al. observed that the C4HC3 motif is present in a variety of proteins including Drosophila trithorax and its human homologue ALL-1 and proposed the name TTC (for trithorax consensus) for this family of proteins (49Koken M.H. Saib A. de The H. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Sci. Vie. 1995; 318: 733-739Google Scholar). The portion of Sp140 between amino acids 681 and 715 contained a bromodomain. The bromodomain is a conserved sequence that is found in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins (43Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-572Google Scholar, 44Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Google Scholar, 45Lygerou Z. Conesa C. Lesage P. Swanson R.N. Ruet A. Carlson M. Sentenac A. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5332-5340Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure of the bromodomain includes two strongly amphipathic α helices followed by reverse turns. Although the functional significance of the bromodomain is unknown, the hydrophobic surfaces of the helices may serve as sites of intramolecular protein-protein interaction. These interactions may influence the assembly or activity of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional activation (50Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 396-402Google Scholar). High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes and much lower levels were detected in all other tissues examined. The predominant expression of Sp140 in human leukocytes suggests that Sp140 may have an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells. Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in the myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4. Expression of Sp140 in HL60 cells was markedly increased during the course of differentiation of these cells toward either monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells was markedly increased following treatment with RA, which induces a polymorphonuclear leukocyte morphology. These results suggest that Sp140 may have a role in the differentiation of myeloid precursor cells. The expression of Sp140 was not limited to leukocytes belonging to the monocyte/granulocyte lineage. Sp140 mRNA was also detected in the T cell line Hut78, but not in the T cell line Jurkat. In addition, Sp140 mRNA was detected in the B cell line Raji, but not in B cell lines Ramos and HS-Sultan (data not shown). The significance of Sp140 expression in some, but not all, lymphocyte cell lines is not known. To investigate the cellular distribution of Sp140, rat antiserum directed against a recombinant fragment of Sp140 was produced. The antiserum reacted in immunoblot with Sp140 produced by in vitro transcription and translation. In addition, the antiserum reacted in immunoblot with Sp140 in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells. By immunohistochemical staining techniques, Sp140 co-localized with PML in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells. These results demonstrate that Sp140 is a component of the NB. In APL, a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 results in fusion of the NB protein PML to RAR-α. Expression of the fusion protein disrupts the NB and inhibits normal myeloid maturation. Treatment of APL cells with RA results in reformation of the NB and induces leukemic cell maturation (3Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M.

The mechanism of action of RA in these cells is unknown. The myeloid precursor cell line NB4 contains the t(15;17) translocation associated with APL (28Lanotte M. Matrin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemistry, Sp140 was not detected in untreated NB4 cells (Fig. 7G). This was not surprising in view of the low level of Sp140 mRNA in these cells (Fig. 4). However, following treatment of NB4 cells with RA, Sp140 was detected within the NBs of these cells (Fig. 7, panel E). The observations that expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells is induced by RA treatment and that Sp140 associates with the NB suggest that Sp140 may have a role in the action of RA on APL cells. The observed resistance of APL cells to RA that develops over time (51Ruchaud S. Duprez E. Gendron M.C. Houge G. Genieser H.G. Jastroff B. Doskeland S.O. Lanotte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1993; 82: 1949-1953Google Scholar) may, in part, be a result of a second event in these cells that alters the structure or function of a protein (possibly Sp140) that interacts with PML in the NB. IFN treatment increases the expression of each of the previously identified components of the NB (Sp100, PML, and NDP52). Guldner et al. (19Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4067-4073Google Scholar) suggested that Sp100 may be involved in establishing an “anti-viral state.” Recently, Doucas et al. (20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of PML in HEp2 cells dramatically decreased the ability of these cells to support adenoviral replication. The authors hypothesized that increased expression of PML may delay or block Sp100 and NDP52 recruitment to viral replication domains resulting in inhibition of viral DNA replication (20Doucas V. Ishov A.M. Romo A. Juguilon H. Weitzman M.D. Evans R.M. Maul G.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 196-207Google Scholar). The identification of a novel NB component that is expressed in cells involved in host defense raises the possibility that Sp140 may also have a role in the pathogenesis of, or the host response to, viral infection. In summary, a novel component of the NB has been identified and characterized. The predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 suggests that this protein is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. The predominant expression of Sp140 in leukocytes raises the possibility that this protein has an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells. Future studies of Sp140 may provide insight into the function of the NB and the role of this organelle in myeloproliferative disease, viral infection and autoimmune disorders. We thank D. Rabkin, G.

Using monoclonal antibodies directed against NKCC from the human crypt epithelial cell line, T84, we define its surface localization as a function of cotransporter activation. Immunoelectron microscopy, confocal localization, and selective surface biotinylation studies revealed that the 195-kDa NKCC protein is polarized to the basolateral domain. Following immunoprecipitation, several polypeptides coprecipitated with the 195-kDa cotransporter including two prominent proteins of molecular mass 160 and 130 kDa. Immunoblotting with three distinct anti-NKCC monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with deglycosylation experiments suggested that the 160- and 130-kDa bands represented novel proteins unrelated to the cotransporter. Stimulation of T84 monolayers with cAMP agonists, a condition which elicits chloride secretion and leads to microfilament-dependent NKCC activation, did not significantly increase the number of bumetanide-binding sites and only marginally increased surface expression of the 195-kDa cotransporter available for surface biotinylation. In contrast, cAMP agonist stimulation increased the surface expression of the coprecipitating 160- and 130-kDa proteins ∼6-fold. The increase in surface 160- and 130-kDa proteins was attenuated by phalloidin preloading the cells, a condition which also prevents activation of NKCC without influencing the activity of other membrane transporters participating in chloride secretion. These studies define the polarized distribution of the NKCC protein on intestinal epithelia, indicate that NKCC may be associated with two other previously unidentified membrane proteins and such association is influenced by the F-actin cytoskeleton.

Previous studies in other cells have suggested that mitochondria are a potential source of oxidant-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. In this study we have identified another potential source of hydroperoxide-releasable intracellular calcium, that bound to annexin VI on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Translocation of annexin VI from the membrane during exposure to t-butyl hydroperoxide matched elevation of [Ca2+]i as a function of time and t-butyl hydroperoxide concentration. The translocation was possibly due to a combination of ATP depletion and oxidative modification of membrane lipids and proteins.

A site-directed mutagenesis strategy was utilized to assess the contribution of individual residues in either RII isoform, RIIα or RIIβ, for interaction with various anchoring proteins. Substitution of long-chain or bulky hydrophobic groups (leucines or phenylalanines) for isoleucines at positions 3 and 5 in RIIα decreased AKAP-binding up to 24 ± 3 (n = 8)-fold, whereas introduction of valines had minimal effects. Replacement with hydrophilic residues (serine or asparigine) at both positions abolished AKAP binding.

We have developed synthetic hammerhead ribozymes that recognize and cleave c-myb RNA, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Herein, we describe a method for the selection of hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites and optimization of chemical modifications that maximize cell efficacy. In vitro assays were used to determine the relative accessibility of the ribozyme target sites for binding and cleavage. Several ribozymes thus identified showed efficacy in inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation relative to catalytically inactive controls. A combination of modifications including several phosphorothioate linkages at the 5′-end of the ribozyme and an extensively modified catalytic core resulted in substantially increased cell efficacy. A variety of different 2′-modifications at positions U4 and U7 that confer nuclease resistance gave comparable levels of cell efficacy. The lengths of the ribozyme binding arms were varied; optimal cell efficacy was observed with relatively short sequences (13-15 total nucleotides).

The chemical motifs that give optimal ribozyme activity in smooth muscle cell assays may be applicable to other cell types and other molecular targets. Since the discovery that certain naturally occurring RNA motifs were capable of catalytically cleaving other RNA molecules in a sequence-specific manner, extensive studies have defined the sequence and structural characteristics that control the in vitro specificity and kinetics of these RNA enzymes or ribozymes (1Cech T.R.

Academic Press, San Diego1995: 285-294Google Scholar). Ribozymes have a broad range of potential in vivo applications. These include the use of ribozymes as research tools for probing molecular mechanisms, the use of ribozymes to genetically engineer crops, and the use of ribozymes as therapeutics for human or animal diseases. Each of these applications requires that a ribozyme function efficiently within the intracellular environment. The sequence and structural features that promote optimal intracellular activity of ribozymes are currently under study. Several factors are likely to contribute to the intracellular efficacy of a ribozyme. A ribozyme must colocalize with its molecular target in the appropriate cellular compartment and must be present at sufficiently high concentration to promote hybridization. In addition, its catalytic cleavage rate must be fast enough, and its half-life must be long enough to allow cleavage of a substantial fraction of the target mRNA population. Finally, the cleavage site in the target mRNA must be accessible to ribozyme binding. When the ribozyme is made synthetically, a variety of modifications can be introduced to increase its half-life within the cell, to change its target sequence binding affinity, and possibly also to alter its intracellular trafficking properties. In this study, we have used chemically synthesized hammerhead ribozymes targeting the proto-oncogene c-myb to study different chemical modifications and sequence changes that affect cell efficacy. Expression of c-myb is necessary for cell-cycle progression in vascular smooth muscle cells (5Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12865-12868Google Scholar, 6Brown K.E. Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4625-4630Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells as a measure of the efficacy of the ribozymes targeting c-myb (7Jarvis T. Alby L. Beaudry A. Wincott F. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J. Usman N. Stinchcomb D. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428Google Scholar). Unmodified RNA is subject to rapid nuclease degradation upon exogenous delivery to cells or tissues. For example, the half-life of an all RNA hammerhead ribozyme in human serum is less than 0.1 min (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S.

In the literature there are several reports of exogenously delivered synthetic ribozymes showing efficacy in cell culture (9Snyder D.S. Wu Y. Wang J.L. Rossi J.J. Swiderski P. Kaplan B.E. Forman S.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 600-605Google Scholar, 10Lange W. Cantin E.M. Finke J. Dolken G. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 1786-1794Google Scholar, 11Kiehntopf M. Brach M.A. Licht T. Petschauer S. Karawajew L.

Often, these studies have utilized DNA/RNA chimeric ribozymes to enhance resistance to exonucleases, leaving large regions of unmodified RNA susceptible to endonucleolytic degradation. Extensive modification of the hammerhead ribozyme motif can give dramatic enhancement of the ribozyme half-life in biological fluids (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K.

We have previously described dose-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by select ribozymes targeting c-myb. Little inhibition was observed with catalytically inactive control RNA molecules. The active ribozymes reduced the level of the target c-myb RNA (7Jarvis T. Alby L. Beaudry A. Wincott F. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J. Usman N. Stinchcomb D. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428Google Scholar). Thus, the smooth muscle cell assay is a suitable means of measuring ribozyme efficacy in cells. Here, we report on a systematic method for determining accessible ribozyme target sites and for determining the optimal hammerhead ribozyme arm length required for cell efficacy. In addition, we explore the effect of chemical modifications such as those reported by Beigelman et al. (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S.

We have thereby identified chemical motifs that maximize the potency and specificity of synthetic ribozymes delivered exogenously to cells in culture. Ribozymes were synthesized and purified as described (15Wincott F. DiRenzo A. Shaffer C. Grimm S. Tracz D. Workman C. Sweedler D. Gonzalez C. Scaringe S. Usman N.

The cleavage site numbering is based on the human DNA sequence numbering (Genbank accession number X52125; transcription starts at nucleotide 198). The inactive ribozymes contain identical binding arms and chemical modifications except that positions G5 and A14 in the catalytic core were changed to 2′-O-methyl uridine, thereby eliminating catalytic activity while maintaining nuclease resistance. The catalytic cleavage activity of all of the ribozymes was confirmed on a matched short substrate by standard methods; inactive ribozymes did not show detectable cleavage activity (data not shown). A murine c-myb cDNA clone was obtained from Dr. Premkumar Reddy. Full-length c-myb RNA was prepared by T7 transcription. Reactions contained 40 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM spermidine, 250 μM each rATP, rGTP, and rUTP, and 50 μM rCTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Boeghringer Mannheim), 80 μCi of α-CTP (40 μCi/μl; DuPont NEN), and 20 units of T7 Polymerase (United States Biochemical Corp.) in a volume of 20 μl and were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The resulting internally labeled transcripts were purified over a G50 spin column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 15 nucleotide-long antisense DNA oligonucleotides were designed to anneal to potential hammerhead ribozyme binding sites in murine c-myb. 4-10 ng of internally labeled murine c-myb transcript was incubated with 10 μM oligonucleotide plus 0.8 units of RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) at 37°C for 60 min. For the ribozyme cleavage assay, 1.0 μM ribozyme was incubated with 4-10 ng internally labeled substrate in 75 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mM MgCl2 at 37°C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by addition of formamide gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 20 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. Gels were dried and quantified on a phosphorimager. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from aortic tissue explants from 69-84-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) and assayed through passage six. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids (0.1 mM of each amino acid), 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mML-glutamine, 20 mM Hepes (all from BioWhittaker), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.). Cell proliferation assays were performed as described previously (7Jarvis T. Alby L. Beaudry A. Wincott F. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J. Usman N. Stinchcomb D. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved, followed by addition of ribozymes complexed with 7.2 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (3.6 μM DOSPA 1The abbreviation used is: DOSPA2,3-dioleyoxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate. ). Following a 3-4-h uptake period, ribozyme-lipid complexes were washed out, and cells were stimulated with fetal bovine serum. The percentage of proliferating cells was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Control wells were treated with lipid only and stimulated with growth medium containing either 10% fetal bovine serum or 0% fetal bovine serum. Treatment with lipid alone did not affect proliferation compared to untreated wells (data not shown). All conditions were run in duplicate. Each experiment was performed two to five times, and a representative experiment is presented. 2,3-dioleyoxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate. Hammerhead ribozymes can recognize and cleave RNA sequences containing U followed by A, C, or U. This consensus sequence occurs very frequently; the murine c-myb mRNA contains nearly 500 potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites. We wished to develop a systematic method of selecting sites that were amenable to ribozyme-mediated cleavage in vivo. Several criterion must be considered in selecting sites for optimal cleavage. First, the site must be accessible to ribozyme binding. In the intracellular milieu, different cleavage sites are likely to vary significantly in their accessibility to ribozyme binding. Site accessibility is probably determined by both secondary structure in the mRNA and regions of protein binding. In addition, the ribozyme itself must fold into the correct conformation required for binding and cleaving its substrate. Sequences in the substrate binding arms of the ribozyme can affect its propensity to fold correctly and cleave its target (18Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1668-1672Google Scholar). Hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites having a high degree of homology between human (19Majello B. Kenyon L.C. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9636-9640Google Scholar) and murine (20Gonda T.J. Gough N.M. Dunn A.R. de Blaquiere J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2003-2008Google Scholar) c-myb sequences were identified. Using a computer folding algorithm, we eliminated from consideration ribozymes that showed a high probability of forming undesirable intramolecular secondary structure (21Christoffersen R.E. McSwiggen J. Konings D. J. Mol. Struct. (Theochem.). 1994; 311: 273-284Google Scholar). 26 sites were selected for testing in an oligonucleotide binding assay. We designed DNA oligonucleotides spanning the cleavage sites, annealed these to a full-length in vitro transcript of murine c-myb, and incubated in the presence of RNase H. This enzyme recognizes DNA/RNA hybrids and cleaves the RNA transcript at the site of hybridization. Sites that are single stranded and thus readily accessible to oligonucleotide binding are expected to show high levels of cleavage in this assay. Although the structure of the in vitro transcript may not mimic exactly the structure of the RNA in the cell, we hoped that this approach would at least allow us to identify and avoid regions of prominent local structure. The ribozymes are shown in Fig. 1, and the cleavage results are shown in Table I.Table I.Site accessibility to binding and cleavage in vitroCleavage sitePercent cleavedaData are expressed as percent of the full-length transcript cleaved during a 1-h assay.Relative cleavagebDate are normalized to the level of cleavage of the best site.

Open table in a new tab Ribozymes targeting the most accessible sites, as determined by the RNase H assay, were synthesized and tested for their ability to cleave the in vitro transcript under ribozyme excess (single turnover) conditions (Table I). In general, the sites that were accessible to oligonucleotide binding in the RNase H assay were also susceptible to cleavage by ribozymes. There were some exceptions, such as sites 839 and 1017, in which the ribozyme cleavage was relatively inefficient. In addition, there were sites such as 1943 and 575 that showed relatively modest RNase H accessibility yet showed highly efficient cleavage by ribozymes. To fully assess the predictive capacity of the RNase H accessibility screen, one would need to test more sites that were poorly accessible based on the RNase H criterion (e.g. 1334, 1389, etc.) as well as those that scored well in terms of accessibility. In any case, several candidate ribozymes (indicated by asterisks) were selected for testing in cell culture based on ribozyme in vitro cleavage activity. Two regions of rat c-myb cDNA, encompassing the sites of interest, were sequenced. 2T. Jarvis, unpublished experiments. A single nucleotide difference between rat and murine c-myb was found in the 575 site; the other four sites were conserved. Active and inactive forms of the ribozymes targeting the five sites within rat c-myb were synthesized with an unmodified RNA catalytic core and five 2′-O-methyl residues in each binding arm. The inactive ribozymes contained two nucleotide changes in the catalytic core that eliminate cleavage activity. The effect of the ribozymes on proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells was assessed (data not shown). Although four of the five active ribozymes did show statistically significant inhibition of proliferation, the degree of inhibition was relatively low (approximately 15-30% inhibition by the active ribozyme compared to the inactive ribozyme control). Poor performance in cell culture could be the result of rapid intracellular degradation. Beigelman et al. (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S. Matulic-Adamic J. DiRenzo A.B. Haeberli P. Sweedler D. Tracz D. Grimm S. Wincott F.E. Thackray V.G. Usman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25702-25708Google Scholar) have reported extensive modifications designed to enhance the nuclease resistance of hammerhead ribozymes while retaining catalytic activity. We decided to test such modifications, focusing on the ribozyme targeting site 575. Fig. 2 shows the site 575 with and without a nuclease-stable core and with and without phosphorothioate linkages in the binding arms. All of the modifications showed some efficacy by active ribozyme versus inactive control, suggesting that the inhibitory effect was mediated by ribozyme cleavage of c-myb RNA. For both the U4 2′-C-allyl and the U4,U7 2′-amino variants, the ribozymes containing both a “stabilized” core and phosphorothioate linkages gave the most enhanced inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. The inactive U4 2′-C-allyl phosphorothioate ribozyme control showed no inhibition. The inactive U4,U7 2′-amino phosphorothioate ribozyme did show some inhibition, although less than its active counterpart. The results in Fig. 2 indicated that both a nuclease-resistant core and phosphorothioate linkages in the binding arms were advantageous for obtaining maximum cell culture efficacy. Since phosphorothioate linkages are associated with some degree of cytotoxicity and nonspecific effects (22Sarmiento U.M. Perez J.R. Becker J.M. Narrayanan R. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 99-107Google Scholar, 23Uhlmann E. Peyman A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 544-584Google Scholar), we wished to determine the minimum number of phosphorothioates sufficient for cell efficacy. Fig. 3A shows a comparison of ribozymes containing 5 phosphorothioate linkages at the 5′-end, 5 phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′-end, or 5 phosphorothioate linkages at both the 5′- and 3′-ends. The ribozyme containing phosphorothioates only at the 3′-end showed almost no efficacy, while the ribozyme containing phosphorothioates at the 5′-end showed equivalent efficacy to that containing phosphorothioates at both the 5′- and 3′-ends. In this experiment, the inactive ribozyme showed some inhibition relative to the vehicle-treated control. A ribozyme with scrambled sequence binding arms exhibited an equivalent degree of inhibition, indicating that this effect was not mediated by ribozyme binding but was truly a “nonspecific” effect on proliferation. Next, we compared ribozymes with varying numbers of phosphorothioates at the 5′-end (Fig. 3, B and C). The degree of efficacy gradually decreased as the number of phosphorothioate linkages was reduced. From these experiments, we concluded that four to five phosphorothioate linkages at the 5′-end gives optimal efficacy in this cell culture system. The ribozymes used in this study contained either 3′-phosphorothioate linkages or a 3′-3′“inverted thymidine” modification (24Seliger H. Krist B. Rosch H. Rosch R. Ruck A. Steiner R. Gupta K.C. Ramalho Ortigao J.F. New Developments in the Field of Antisense Oligonucleotides.in: Alberghina L. Frontali L. Sensi P. Proceedings of the 6th European Congress on Biotech. Elsevier Science, 1994: 681-684Google Scholar) to protect against 3′-exonuclease activity (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S. Matulic-Adamic J. DiRenzo A.B. Haeberli P. Sweedler D. Tracz D. Grimm S. Wincott F.E. Thackray V.G. Usman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25702-25708Google Scholar). We have subsequently shown that the outcome of this assay is not particularly sensitive to the presence or absence of this 3′-protecting group. Anti-c-myb ribozymes containing various protecting groups including a 3′-3′ inverted thymidine, a 3′-3′ inverted abasic residue, a 3′-butanediol or no 3′ protecting group at all showed equivalent efficacy in inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation (data not shown). This may indicate that over the timecourse of this assay, the additional stability conferred by these modifications is not significant. Ribozymes targeting c-myb site 575 were synthesized with arm lengths ranging from 5 to 12 nucleotides. The effects of these ribozymes on cell proliferation are shown in Fig. 4. The data are presented as specific inhibition by active versus inactive ribozyme. The optimal arm length was 6 to 7 nucleotides. We confirmed in five separate experiments that there was no significant difference in efficacy between the 6/6 (StemI/StemIII) and 7/7 arm ribozymes (data not shown). We also tested ribozymes with asymmetric arm lengths (StemI/StemIII with 5/10 or 10/5 nucleotides). Both asymmetric variants performed similarly to the 7/7 symmetric ribozyme (data not shown). The symmetric ribozyme containing seven nucleotide binding arms (no. 2972) was used as a standard for comparison in the experiment that follows. We have shown previously that this ribozyme inhibits rat, pig, and human vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent fashion and that the inhibition of proliferation correlates with a reduction in c-myb RNA levels (7Jarvis T. Alby L. Beaudry A. Wincott F. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J. Usman N. Stinchcomb D. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428Google Scholar). Beigelman et al. (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S. Matulic-Adamic J. DiRenzo A.B. Haeberli P. Sweedler D. Tracz D. Grimm S. Wincott F.E. Thackray V.G. Usman N. J. Biol.

Usman N. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 907-910Google Scholar) have developed a broad spectrum of different modifications in the catalytic core of hammerhead ribozymes that enhance resistance to nuclease degradation while preserving significant catalytic activity. Differences in intracellular stability, cleavage rate, uptake, and localization properties conferred by these modifications could alter the cell culture efficacy of the ribozyme. We tested several of these modifications, as shown in Fig. 5. A number of modifications showed equivalent cell efficacy to that exhibited by the U4 2′-C-allyl modified ribozyme. Others, such as U7 2′-C-allyl and U4 2′-fluoro, showed a somewhat lower magnitude of inhibition at the 100 nM dose. Experiments performed at lower doses supported the conclusion that none of the variants differed by more than 2-fold in the dose required to achieve 50% inhibition (data not shown). The inactive ribozyme containing the U4,U7 2′-amino modification showed greater inhibition than inactive ribozymes containing any of the other modifications. 3Although the majority of experiments performed with this ribozyme chemistry showed greater inhibition by the active version compared to the inactive, we have occasionally observed that inhibition by the inactive ribozyme is equal to that of the active, especially at higher doses (K. G. Draper, L. Beigelman, J. Matulic-Adamic, J. McSwiggen, V. Thackray, D. T. Stinchcomb, T. C. Jarvis, and N. Usman, manuscript in preparation). This was seen with the related ribozyme in Fig. 2 as well. We believe that this inhibition represents a truly nonspecific effect because controls using a ribozyme containing the U4,U7 2′-amino modified chemistry and scrambled binding arm sequences showed similar levels of inhibition in side-by-side comparisons (data not shown). The results in Fig. 5 indicate that none of the modified chemistries results in an improvement in cell efficacy in the smooth muscle cell proliferation assay compared to the U4 2′-C-allyl modification. We have used a systematic method to identify c-myb ribozymes that inhibit cell proliferation when delivered exogenously to cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. The inhibition is mediated by ribozymes containing a catalytically active core, while inactive controls fail to inhibit. The degree of inhibition observed can be affected profoundly by both backbone and 2′-sugar modifications. The optimal ribozyme configuration for inhibition of cell proliferation in this system consists of four phosphorothioate linkages at the 5′-end, six or seven nucleotide binding arms, 30 2′-O-methyl residues, and any of a variety of 2′-sugar or base modifications at positions U4 and U7. The results in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 demonstrate that both a “stabilized” core and several 5′-phosphorothioate linkages are advantageous for achieving substantial ribozyme-mediated inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. Beigelman et al. (8Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Draper K.G. Gonzalez C. Jensen K. Karpeisky A.M. Modak A.S. Matulic-Adamic J. DiRenzo A.B. Haeberli P. Sweedler D. Tracz D. Grimm S. Wincott F.E. Thackray V.G. Usman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25702-25708Google Scholar) have shown that the U4-C-allyl and the U4,U7-amino ribozyme motifs increase the serum half-life of the ribozyme >16,000-fold relative to an all RNA ribozyme. Addition of 5′-phosphorothioate linkages increase the resistance to 5′-exonuclease activity. 4K. G. Draper, L. Beigelman, J. Matulic-Adamic, J. McSwiggen, V. Thackray, D. T. Stinchcomb, T. C. Jarvis, and N. Usman, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the enhanced cell efficacy observed with the combination of these two types of modifications could be attributed solely to enhanced resistance to nuclease. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the phosphorothioate moieties are advantageous for some additional reason, such as conferring altered intracellular localization or trafficking properties. 5LipofectAMINE delivery results in virtually 100% of the cells taking up ribozyme, with a fairly homogeneous distribution within the population, as demonstrated by flow cytometry using a fluorescently labeled ribozyme (26Brown S. Jarvis T. Ribozyme Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Google Scholar). In addition, uptake studies using radioactive ribozymes show that the sheer number of ribozymes delivered to each cell exceeds the c-myb mRNA copy number by many orders of magnitude (data not shown). Therefore, a very small percentage of the ribozyme that is taken up could represent the “bioactive” fraction responsible for the observed efficacy. Although ribozyme intracellular localization can be studied using confocal microscopy, or by careful fractionation, it is difficult to establish a meaningful correlation between cell efficacy and the observed localization of the bulk population. The optimal hammerhead ribozyme binding arm length for intracellular activity may be a function of the thermodynamic stability of the duplex formed upon substrate binding, the kinetics of substrate binding and release, or of competing intramolecular ribozyme structures that can compromise substrate binding or conformation of the catalytic core. We have found that there is a distinct arm length optimum of six or seven nucleotides in each arm for the ribozyme targeting c-myb site 575. Depending on the sequence of the binding arms, the optimal arm length could vary for ribozymes targeting different sites. We have shown that a variety of different chemical modifications at positions U4 and U7 can be tolerated while preserving a similar level of cell efficacy. The in vitro catalytic cleavage activities of the ribozymes were determined in single turnover assays on short substrates (data not shown). Although the ribozymes shown in Fig. 5 are all catalytically active, the kinetics of substrate cleavage in vitro varies. For example, the cleavage rate for the U4,U7-amino c-myb site 575 ribozyme is at least 10-fold higher than that of either the U4-C-allyl or the U4 6-methyl-U ribozymes. Despite the lower cleavage activity, both the U4-C-allyl and the U4 6-methyl-U ribozymes perform as well or better than the U4,U7-amino ribozyme in inhibiting cell proliferation. Thus, there does not appear to be a strict correlation between the kobs measured in vitro and the level of efficacy measured in cell culture in this system. 6In this case, the end point for judging cell efficacy is the extent of cell proliferation. Presumably, reduction beyond a certain threshold level of c-myb is required to inhibit cell cycle progression. This is not an optimal system for attempting to draw conclusions regarding the correlation between in vitro cleavage rates and cell efficacy. Ideally, one would want to measure the target RNA level as a direct end point. We have previously shown that the U4 2′-C-allyl c-myb ibozyme (no. 2972) reduces c-myb RNA by almost 80% at 12 h post-serum stimulation in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (7Jarvis T. Alby L. Beaudry A. Wincott F. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J. Usman N. Stinchcomb D. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428Google Scholar). These experiments were performed by a laborious quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction method, and the corresponding experiments have not been done for all of the modified ribozymes used in this paper. This may indicate that some other step besides cleavage is rate limiting in the cell culture assay. Alternatively, the buffer conditions used for the in vitro cleavage assays may exacerbate differences between ribozymes that are less significant within the intracellular milieu. The modified ribozymes used in this study specifically inhibit cell proliferation. The combination of efficacy and resistance to nucleolytic degradation suggests that these ribozymes could have therapeutic utility in treating diseases resulting from inappropriate overexpression of c-myb. There are several disease conditions in which the disease pathology correlates with up-regulation of c-myb. For example, in restenosis, vascular smooth muscle cells hyperproliferate to form a neointima following coronary angioplasty, causing re-occlusion of arteries in 30-40% of patients (27Landau C. Lange R.A. Hillis L.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 981-993Google Scholar, 28Jackson C. Schwartz S. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 713-736Google Scholar, 29Forrester J.S. Fishbein M. Helfant R. Fagin J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1991; 17: 758-769Google Scholar). In the rat carotid artery model of restenosis, antisense DNA oligonucleotides targeting c-myb inhibit neoinitima formation following balloon injury (30Simons M. Edelman E.R. DeKeyser J.-L. Langer R. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1992; 359: 67-70Google Scholar). In addition, c-myb has been implicated in the pathology of various cancers including melanoma (31Hijiya N. Zhang J. Ratajczak M. Kant J. DeRiel K. Herlyn M. Zon G. Gewirtz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4499-4503Google Scholar), leukemia (32Ratajczak F. Kant J.A. Lufer S.M. Hijita N. Zhang J. Zon G. Gewirtz A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11823-11827Google Scholar), and lymphosarcoma and colon carcinoma (25Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901Google Scholar). The optimized chemical modifications reported here represent general motifs that can be applied to ribozymes against other molecular targets. For example, synthetic ribozymes targeting the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin and containing both the U4 2′-C-allyl and the U4,U7 2′-amino modifications have shown activity in an animal model of arthritis (13Flory C.M. Pavco P.A. Jarvis T.C. Lesch M.E. Wincott F.E. Beigelman L. Hunt S.W. Schrier D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 754-758Google Scholar). We are continuing to explore new types of ribozyme modifications, as well as a variety of different formulations that can potentially enhance ribozyme delivery, efficacy, and residence time in cells and tissues.

It has been shown to be more closely related to DNA polymerase δ (8Boulet A. Simon M. Faye G. Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1849-1854Google Scholar, 9Knopf K.W. Strick R. Becker Y.

Frontiers of Virology. Vol. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 87-135Google Scholar, 17Downey K.M. Tan C.-K. So A.G. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 231-236Google Scholar).

Three-dimensional structural studies, together with site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses, have led to the identification of the catalytic residues responsible for polymerization and 3′-5′-exonucleolytic activity of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli Pol I (for a review, see Ref. 2Joyce J.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Google Scholar). Corresponding amino acids involved in metal binding and catalysis (Asp-355, Glu-357, Asp-424, Asp-501, Tyr-497) of the Pol I 3′-5′-exonuclease activity were first identified by sequence similarities and site-directed mutagenesis using the ϕ29 DNA polymerase (18Bernad A. Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Google Scholar), and subsequently three sequence motifs (Exo I, Exo II, and Exo III) containing the Pol I homologous residues were proposed to be important for the 3′-5′-exonuclease function in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases. Despite the low overall homology between Pol I- and α-like DNA polymerases, the Exo motifs with correspondingly arranged conserved residues were found in herpesviral and δ-polymerases (7Blanco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Google Scholar, 8Boulet A. Simon M. Faye G. Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1849-1854Google Scholar, 9Knopf K.W. Strick R. Becker Y. Darai G. Frontiers of Virology. Vol. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 87-135Google Scholar). Thus far, within the exonuclease domain of eukaryotic DNA polymerases, no homologs have been identified for the Pol I residues Leu-361 and Phe-473 which are predicted to be critical for the base positioning (19Derbyshire V.

A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Google Scholar), it is evident that the putative exonuclease domain embodies the proofreading function (for a review, see Ref. 7Blanco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Google Scholar). This function seems to be organized in a quite separate domain in prokaryotic enzymes and in yeast, since exonuclease-minus mutants are readily obtained that display fully functioning polymerase activity. In addition, the structural and functional independence of these two domains in Klenow fragment was demonstrated by the ability of the polymerase domain to retain activity when cloned separately (28Freemont P.S. Ollis D.L. Steitz T.A. Joyce C.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 66-73Google Scholar) and by antibody neutralization studies (29Ruscitti T. Polayes D.A. Karu A.E. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16806-16811Google Scholar). In the case of HSV Pol, mutational studies (30Gibbs J.S. Weisshart K. Digard P. De Bruyn-Kops A. Knipe D.M. Coen D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4786-4795Google Scholar) as well as investigations carried out by limited proteolysis of HSV Pol (31Weisshart K. Kuo A.A. Hwang C.B.C. Kumura K. Coen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22788-22796Google Scholar) provided no evidence for a similar structural independence of 3′-5′-exonuclease and polymerase domains. In order to demonstrate the possible structural and functional interrelationship of exonuclease and polymerase domains of HSV Pol more directly, in this report we have chosen to mutate directly the putative catalytic residues of the conserved motifs' Exo I, II, and III of the exonuclease domain and to examine functionally the consequences of the mutations on the enzymatic activities using recombinant baculovirus technology. The results show that in vitro it is possible to generate HSV Pol enzymes with active polymerase but with no or weak exonuclease activity by mutating the proposed catalytic residues, suggesting a functional independence for the polymerase activity. On the other hand, defined mutations in the exonuclease domain also had a strong impact on the polymerizing function of the enzyme, providing evidence for the involvement of exonuclease domain residues in essential functions of the polymerase forward reaction. Radiochemicals were obtained from Amersham Life Sciences (Braunschweig). Nucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia LKB (Freiburg). Activated calf thymus DNA was from Sigma and Aldrich (Deisenhofen). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Expedite Nucleic Acid synthesizer (Millipore, Eschborn), kindly provided by W. Weinig (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg), and purified with the USB SurePure™ Oligonucleotide Purification Kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Braunschweig). Mutagenic oligonucleotides used are presented in Table I. Oligonucleotides spanning nucleotide position 1327-1346, 1845-1831, and 1905-1919, respectively, of the HSV Pol sequence of strain ANG (32Knopf C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8225-8226Google Scholar) were used as sequencing primers. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, USB (Cleveland, OH), Life Technologies, Inc.

Phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen).Table I.Sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotidesMutationOligonucleotides (5′-3′)aIntended mutations are represented by double underlining, and silent changes to delete restriction sites are indicated by single underlining.New restriction siteD368 to AATGTGCTTCGCTATCGAGTGCAAGGCGLoss of EcoRV and BsmIE370 to AATGTGCTTCGATATCGCATGCAAGGCGGGSphI, loss of BsmID471 to ACAACTTCGCCTGGCCCLoss of BsrIY538 to SGCTGTCGAGCTCCAAGCTCAACGCCGSstI, loss of XhoIY 557 to SAGAAGGACCTGAGCTCGCGCGACATCCSstI, loss of NruIY577 to FATCGGCGAGTTCTGCATACAGGLoss of ScaID581 to AACTGCATACAGGCTTCCCTGCTGGLoss of TfiIa Intended mutations are represented by double underlining, and silent changes to delete restriction sites are indicated by single underlining. Open table in a new tab Buffer A, used during HSV Pol purification, contained 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin. Buffer B was the same as buffer A with 0.6 M NaCl. Enzyme storage buffer consisted of 20 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40% (v/v) ethyleneglycol. TE buffer (Tris-EDTA) contained 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA. African green monkey kidney monolayer cells (Rita clone, RC-37, Italdiagnostic Products, Rome) were cultivated and infected with HSV strain ANG as described previously (16Weisshart K. Knopf C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 707-716Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) comprising Autographa californica multiply enveloped nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), baculovirus transfer vectors pVL1392 and pVL1393, as well as the Sf9 cell line (Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-Sf21AE) was obtained from Max D. Summers and Gale E. Smith (Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, TX). Recombinant baculovirus POL and the corresponding pVL1393 transfer vector (pPOL) containing the large open reading frame (LORF) of a PAA-resistant (PAAr) variant of HSV-1 strain ANG (33Knopf C.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1429-1433Google Scholar) from nucleotide position 326 to 4194 (32Knopf C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8225-8226Google Scholar) were constructed following the BEVS protocol (34Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar, 35Bayer S. Expression der HSV-1 ANG DNA-Polymerase in Insektenzellen und im zellfreien System..diploma thesis, University of Heidelberg. 1990; Google Scholar, 36Strick R. Struktur- und Funktionsanalyse der Herpes Simplex-Virus DNA-Polymerase: Die Enzymefunktionen..doctoral thesis, University of Heidelberg. 1993; Google Scholar). For cloning of HSV Pol LORF subclones of the ClaI fragment h containing pH1381 (37Knopf K.W. Die Herpes Simplex-Virus DNA-Polymerase: Vom Gen zur Function. University of Heidelberg, 1988Google Scholar) were used. In separate cloning steps a BamI linker was inserted at nucleotide position 325 by Bal31 nuclease deletion cloning, and at position 4194 an XbaI linker was introduced by filling-in reaction of the Asp718 site (37Knopf K.W. Die Herpes Simplex-Virus DNA-Polymerase: Vom Gen zur Function. University of Heidelberg, 1988Google Scholar). The HSV Pol LORF could thus be transferred as a BamHI/XbaI DNA fragment to pVL1393. Recombinant pUC-8 clone pS5 was a subclone of pH1381 and contained the SalI fragment from nucleotide position 1229-3260 of the PAAr HSV Pol gene. SalI fragment from pS5 was cloned in phagemid vector pMa (38Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Google Scholar) yielding pMaS5, and its single-stranded DNA was subjected to standard site-directed mutagenesis procedure (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) using the U-DNA mutagenesis kit as instructed by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) together with the mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in Table I. Oligonucleotides were designed in order to generate restriction enzyme site polymorphisms allowing screening of mutant genes by DNA restriction endonuclease mapping. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, performing as described in the guidelines of the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg). Characterized NheI/SstI or NheI/MstII DNA subfragments of phagemid vector pMaS5 with the desired 3′-5′-exonuclease mutations were individually used to replace the corresponding fragments in recombinant baculovirus transfer vector pPOL. The presence of introduced mutations was confirmed by restriction endonuclease mapping. For generation of recombinant baculoviruses, transfer vector derivatives of pPOL containing the mutated genes as stated were individually cotransfected in Sf9 cells with modified linearized AcMNPV baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold™ DNA) following the protocol of BaculoGold™ Transfection Kit (Pharmingen, San Diego). Recombinant plaques were screened by negative β-galactosidase expression (40King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, New York1992Google Scholar), and high titer virus stock solutions were prepared after three cycles of plaque purification according to standard procedures (34Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar). For virus titration, alternative plaque assays were used (41Brown M. Faulkner P. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 361-364Google Scholar, 42Shanafelt A.B. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 330Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviral DNA was examined by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot analysis (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Growth of Sf9 monolayer cells was performed in tissue flasks (Nunc, Raskilde) at 28°C with TC100 insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein), 2 mML-glutamine (Biochrome, Berlin), and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (Biochrome, Berlin). For infection, medium was removed and monolayers inoculated under gentle rocking for 1 h with baculovirus stocks, appropriately diluted in culture medium to achieve a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. After removal of inoculum, fresh medium was added, and cells were cultivated for 48 h. Then medium was removed, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein), transferred to centrifuge tubes by up and down pipeting, and sedimented at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were kept at −70°C until used. Expression of HSV-1 DNA polymerases in recombinant baculovirus-infected cell extracts was monitored by immunoblot analysis. Confluently grown Sf9 cells (7 × 106 cells/25 cm2-flasks) were infected for 48 h with recombinant baculovirus at a m.o.i. of 5 and harvested as described above. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 150 μl of double-distilled water, disrupted by sonication, and cellular debris removed by centrifugation. One part of 4-fold concentrated sample buffer was added to three parts of supernatant, and after boiling for 5 min aliquots of cell extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (44Laemmli U.-K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes (BA-S 85; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel). Immunostaining was performed with a 1000-fold diluted polyclonal rabbit anti-(HSV Pol) serum EX3, directed against the carboxyl terminus (amino acid residues 1072-1235) of HSV-1 ANG DNA Pol, as described previously (16Weisshart K. Knopf C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 707-716Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all procedures were performed at 4°C. Frozen Sf9 cell pellets, collected from five 175-cm2 flasks (2 × 108 cells) 48 h after baculovirus infection at a m.o.i. of 10, were thawed in ice, resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A, disrupted by ultrasonication (Branson Sonifier 250, microtip, position 7; 10 times 3 s), and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. After resuspending in 5 ml of buffer A cell pellets were reextracted by ultrasonication as before, and the combined supernatants were passed through a 5-ml column of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A, and flow-through fractions (20 ml) were pooled and applied on a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column, equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg). After loading, the column was washed with buffer A at the same flow rate until the absorbance at 280 nm reached base line and eluted consecutively in 0.5-ml fractions with the following salt gradients formed with buffer A and buffer B: 5 ml of linear gradient from 0.2 M to 0.4 M NaCl, 5 ml of isocratic gradient at 0.4 M NaCl, 5 ml of linear gradient from 0.4 to 0.6 M NaCl, and 5 ml of isocratic gradient at 0.6 M NaCl. After elution, the column was routinely washed with 5 ml of 2 M NaCl. Fractions were assayed for DNA polymerase and exonuclease activities, and HSV Pol protein was detected by immunoblot analysis. DNA polymerase peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer, concentrated with a Microcon™ 100 concentrator (Amicon, Witten), and stored at −20°C until used. Reaction mixtures contained in a final volume of 100 μl 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.0125 mM dATP, 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 25 μg of activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma, Deisenhofen), and enzyme fractions as well as ammonium sulfate concentrations as stated. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, 80-μl aliquots of reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman GF/C glass filters and treated to determine acid-insoluble radioactivity as described (5Knopf K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-244Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 20 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 500 μg/ml activated calf thymus DNA, and 10 units of Klenow enzyme were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, quenched by the addition of 2.5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, and chilled in ice. DNA substrate was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and purified by gel filtration using TE buffer. Exonucleolytic activities were determined in the absence of dNTP under the conditions of the DNA polymerase assay. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) were incubated for 20 min at 37°C with 25 μg of activated calf thymus DNA containing 0.15 μg (6.7 × 105 cpm/μg) of 32P-labeled exonuclease substrate. Reactions were terminated by chilling in ice and by adding 20 μl of a mixture of 0.25 M EDTA, pH 8, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C) the radioactivity of supernatant fractions (100 μl) was determined with 3 ml of Unisolve 100 (Zinsser, Frankfurt) in a 1209 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia-LKB Wallac, Freiburg). Oligonucleotides used for the construction of primer-templates illustrated in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 were obtained and purified as described above. DNA primers were labeled at the 5′-end in reaction mixtures (20 μl) using 7 μg of oligonucleotide, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol), 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 × linker-kinase buffer for 30 min at 37°C followed by an incubation of 10 min at 68°C according to a standard procedure (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 3′-End-labeled primers were synthesized in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 7 μg of oligonucleotide, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 30 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and 1 × One-Phor-All buffer, as specified by the supplier (Biotech Pharmacia, Freiburg), for 10 min at 37°C. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by passing through Sephadex G-50 spun columns, and oligonucleotides were concentrated by precipitation with 1-butanol (45Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 674Google Scholar). Purity was examined by denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (46Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar) and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Hybridization of primer and template was achieved by heating 1-4 μg of radiolabeled primer with equimolar amounts of the complementary unlabeled 45-mer template oligonucleotide in TE buffer for 10 min at 70°C followed by slow cooling to room temperature over approximately 2 h. The primer-templates were kept at −20°C before use.Fig. 6Primer-extension and 3′-5′-exonuclease activity on mispaired 3′-32P-labeled primer termini by recombinant HSV Pol. Reactions were performed as described in Fig. 5 but with 80 ng (1.5 × 104 cpm) of the 3′-32P-labeled primer-template illustrated in A and prepared as described in the presence or absence of dNTPs as stated. B and C represent the analysis of reaction products from two independent experiments after sequencing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Reaction products of primer-extension and 3′-5′-exonucleolytic degradation are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Reaction mixtures contained in a final volume of 10 μl, 25 ng (4.5 × 104 cpm) of 5′-32P-labeled or 80 ng (1.5 × 104 cpm) of the 3′-[32P]dTMP-labeled primer-template, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM ammonium sulfate, and 0.25 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 μl of the stated enzyme preparations. After incubation for 3 min at 37°C, reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of a formamide/dye mixture, containing 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 20 mM EDTA, pH 8. Aliquots (5 μl) of each reaction mixture were boiled briefly, chilled rapidly, and then subjected to electrophoresis on 12% DNA sequencing gels, containing 8 M urea (46Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). The gels were prerun to a temperature of 55°C, and the samples were then electrophoresed for 2 h at 30 watts (constant power). Gels were covered with Saran wrap and directly autoradiographed on x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat). For site-directed mutagenesis the 2031-base pair SalI-fragment from nucleotide position 1229 to 3260 of the DNA polymerase gene of the PAAr variant of HSV-1 strain ANG, containing the complete 3′-5′-exonuclease domain, was subcloned from pH1381 into phagemid vector pMa as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant single-stranded phagemid DNA together with the mutagenic oligonucleotides, as shown in Table I, were used for in vitro mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed such that restriction endonuclease recognition sites were deleted. Recombinant phagemid clones containing the desired mutations were then screened by restriction endonuclease analysis, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The changes introduced were intended to neutralize functionally interacting side chains, e.g. carboxyl and OH groups were changed to methyl and phenyl groups, respectively. In addition, 19 residues located between the Exo II and Exo III motifs of HSV Pol (position 539-557) were deleted, and likely candidate residues for a role in base positioning, such as the tyrosines in position 538 and 557, were changed from aromatic to aliphatic side chains. Sequence analysis revealed that from seven mutations six were successfully introduced by the chosen site-directed mutagenesis protocol (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) but that one phagemid clone (Y538S) contained an extra mutation downstream from the oligonucleotide primer at nucleotide position 1937 (32Knopf C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8225-8226Google Scholar). This was a conversion of A → C that resulted in the conservative amino acid substitution, isoleucine to leucine, and yielded the amino acid sequence KLKLSSSKL. For the engineering of recombinant baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393 with mutated HSV Pol genes, the LORF of HSV Pol of strain ANG from nucleotide position 325 to 4190 (32Knopf C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8225-8226Google Scholar) was subcloned into pVL1393, yielding pPOL, cleaved with NheI and SstI or MstII, and ligated with mutation bearing NheI-SstI and NheI-MstII fragments from mutated recombinant phagemids. Presence of introduced mutations was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Deletion mutant Δ19 with a deletion of amino acids 539-557 was constructed directly from baculoviral transfer vectors pY538S and pY557S by inserting the unique SstI fragment, spanning from nucleotide position 2009-2133 (32Knopf C.W.

The multimeric CCAAT binding factor, CBF/NF-Y, binds to the most proximal CCAAT regulatory element (C1) of the grp78 promoter required for both basal level expression and stress response. Using an in vitro transcription system, we show through factor competition and immunodepletion that the grp78 C1-mediated enhancement of transcription requires primarily CBF. Correlating with the previous observation that CBF binding to the 78C1 site is enhanced by EGTA and EDTA, these divalent cation chelators specifically stimulate 78C1-directed transcription. In contrast, increasing amounts of calcium ions are inhibitory. These results provide evidence that CBF is functionally important in transactivating the grp78 C1 transcriptional activity, and suggest a possible mechanism by which grp78 transcription is stimulated by calcium depletion. We further discovered that in addition to binding CBF, both the 78C1 element and the CBF binding site of the α2(I) collagen promoter interact weakly with the multifunctional transcription factor YY1. Our studies show that the binding sites for CBF and YY1 are distinct for the two promoter sites, suggesting that YY1 and other interacting factors could exert differential effects on individual promoters bearing the same CBF site.

Performing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplifications with degenerate oligonucleotide primers homologous to the Antennapedia homeobox, cDNA clones corresponding to the caudal-related gene cdx-2/3 were predominantly obtained from glucagon-producing cells and primary non-beta cells. From RNase protection and polymerase chain reaction analyses, cdx-2/3 turned out to be the only caudal-related gene that is expressed at significant levels in cells of the endocrine pancreas. Cdx-2/3 binds with high affinity to an AT-rich motif of G1, which matches the consensus binding site of caudal-related proteins. In the glucagon-producing hamster cell line InR1G9, Cdx-2/3 is a subunit of complex B3 formed on G1. Alternative splicing generates two cdx-2/3 transcripts in islet cells, coding for a full-length protein and an amino-terminally truncated isoform. Although both isoforms bind G1 with similar affinity, only the full-length Cdx-2/3 A protein activates glucagon gene transcription in non-glucagon-producing cells, transcriptional activation being dose-dependent. We therefore conclude that the caudal-related gene cdx-2/3 is implicated in the transcriptional control of glucagon gene expression in the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans. Glucagon gene transcription in the endocrine pancreas is regulated by at least four cis-acting DNA control elements. We showed previously that G1 is critical for alpha cell-specific expression.

INTRODUCTIONGlucagon and the glucagon-like peptides are synthesized as a common precursor, preproglucagon, encoded by the glucagon gene and are involved in the control of glucose homeostasis. Expression of the glucagon gene is highly restricted to the alpha cells of the endocrine pancreas, the L cells of the intestine, and certain areas of the brain (1Drucker D.J. Asa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13475-13478Google Scholar, 2Mojsov S. Heinrich G. Wilson I.B. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11880-11889Google Scholar, 3Novak U. Wilks A. Buelln G. McEwen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 553-558Google Scholar). The factors controlling glucagon gene expression are poorly understood. In addition, they may differ depending on the tissue examined; studies in transgenic mice expressing the simian virus (SV) 1The abbreviations used are: SVsimian virusbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionntnucleotide(s)BHKbaby hamster kidneyEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseRSVRous sarcoma virus. large T antigen under the control of 1300 bp of the rat glucagon gene 5′-flanking sequences demonstrate expression in the pancreas and the brain, whereas additional upstream sequences are necessary for expression in the gut (4Efrat S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10705-10708Google Scholar).Tissue-specific expression of the glucagon gene in the pancreas is conferred in two steps by the islet-specific enhancer elements G2, G3, and G4 (6Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Google Scholar, 7Philippe J. Drucker D. Knepel W. Jepal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Google Scholar) and the alpha cell-specific proximal promoter element G1 (7Philippe J. Drucker D. Knepel W. Jepal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Google Scholar, 9Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Google Scholar, 10Philippe J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 2: 21-27Google Scholar). G1 contains three AT-rich sequences that are candidate binding sites for homeodomain transcription factors. Two of these sequences represent nearly identical 7-bp direct repeats and are important for transcriptional activity. At least four protein complexes were found to interact with G1, and the integrity of the AT-rich 7-bp direct repeats was shown to be critical for their binding (9Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Google Scholar).In a first attempt to identify the proteins implicated in the control of glucagon gene expression, we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on highly conserved sequences in the first and third helix of the Antennapedia class of homeodomain transcription factors. Recent studies indicate that homeobox genes are involved in the control of pancreatic hormone genes, such as insulin and somatostatin. Several homeodomain proteins have been isolated from islet cells by cDNA cloning or PCR amplification of reverse transcribed RNA (11Miller C. McGehee R. Habener J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 12Rudnick A. Ling T.Y. Odagiri H. Rutter W.J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12203-12207Google Scholar) and proposed to be implicated in insulin and somatostatin gene regulation (13Emens L.A. Landers D.W. Moss L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7300-7304Google Scholar, 14Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Nature. 1990; 344: 879-882Google Scholar, 15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Google Scholar).In this study, we show that the caudal-related gene cdx-3, which has been proposed to regulate insulin gene transcription through its binding to the FLAT element (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar) is expressed in glucagon-producing cells. Since cdx-3 represents the hamster homologue of the mouse cdx-2 gene (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar, 17James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15229-15237Google Scholar, 18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar), this gene will be referred to here as cdx-2/3. In cell lines of the endocrine pancreas, alternative splicing generates two cdx-2/3 mRNAs, encoding a full-length protein (termed Cdx-2/3 A) and an amino-terminally truncated isoform (Cdx-2/3 B). Cdx-2/3 binds the proximal AT-rich direct repeat motif of the glucagon promoter element G1, which matches the consensus binding site of caudal-related genes (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar, 19Margalit Y. Yarus S. Shapira E. Gruenbaum Y. Fainsod A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4915-4922Google Scholar) and is contained in complex B3 binding to G1. Interestingly, the full-length Cdx-2/3 A, but not the truncated Cdx-2/3 B isoform activates glucagon gene expression in non-glucagon-producing cells. Different transactivating properties of the two isoforms exhibiting the same affinity for G1 suggests that differential expression of cdx-2/3 A and cdx-2/3 B may regulate transcriptional activation. We conclude that the intestine-specific gene cdx-2/3 is the only caudal-related gene expressed in the endocrine pancreas and that it may be involved in the control of pancreatic glucagon gene expression.DISCUSSIONDifferentiation of multicellular organisms is based on a precise temporal and spatial pattern of cell specific gene expression. In vertebrates, as in all other metazoa analyzed today, homeotic genes are major control genes determining cell fate and function (42Gehring W. Affolter J.M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Google Scholar). Islet cells express a variety of homeobox genes, and recent data indicate that Idx-1/STF1/IPF1, a homeodomain protein of the Antennapedia class, plays a major role in the cell-specific expression of the insulin gene, its regulation by glucose, and the differentiation of the pancreas (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Google Scholar, 43Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Google Scholar, 54MacFarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 625-631Google Scholar, 55Petersen H.V. Serup P. Leonard J. Michelsen B.K. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10465-10469Google Scholar, 56Serup P. Petersen H.V. Pedersen E.E. Edlund H. Leonard J. Petersen J.S. Larsson L.-I. Madsen O.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 997-1003Google Scholar, 57Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Google Scholar).To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the islet cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene, we searched for homeotic cDNA sequences in glucagon-producing cells by reverse transcription-PCR. cdx-2/3 appears from our PCR analysis to be the predominant homeobox gene from the Antennapedia class in glucagon-producing cells, although it is also present in the intestine and in pancreatic beta cells (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar, 17James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15229-15237Google Scholar, 18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar). Quantification of cdx-2/3 by RNase protection experiments, Western blots, and EMSAs on RNA and nuclear extracts from glucagon-, insulin-, and somatostatin-producing cell lines show roughly equivalent cdx-2/3 transcript and protein levels in all cell types. In addition, the amount of PCR-amplified full-length cdx-2/3 cDNA products from primary beta and non-beta cells does not indicate major differences. The reason for the preferential amplification of Idx-1/STF1/IPF1 sequences in primary beta cells is then likely due to the relatively higher Idx-1/STF1/IPF1 mRNA levels compared with cdx-2/3. The relative distribution of Antennapedia class homeobox sequences identified in our study is slightly different from previous PCR analyses in islet cell lines and primary islets (11Miller C. McGehee R. Habener J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 12Rudnick A. Ling T.Y. Odagiri H. Rutter W.J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12203-12207Google Scholar); some homeobox genes reported to be expressed in primary islets could not be detected among the cDNA clones sequenced (Table I). Likely explanations for these differences are statistical variance, primer choice, and the source of RNA analyzed.Cdx-2/3 is a member of the family of homeodomain proteins related to the Drosophila melanogaster gene caudal (cad) (58Mlodzik M. Fjose A. Gehring W.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2961-2969Google Scholar). caudal-related genes have been found in Bombyx mori (59Xu X. Xu P.-X. Suzuki Y. Development. 1994; 120: 277-285Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (60Burglin T.R. Finney M. Coulson A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1989; 341: 239-243Google Scholar), zebrafish, Xenopus laevis, and chicken, as well as in the mammals mouse, rat, hamster, and human (50Stein S. Fritsch R. Lemaire L. Kessel M. Mech. Dev. 1996; 55: 91-108Google Scholar, 61Bonner C.A. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 206-211Google Scholar). In vertebrates, expression onset of most caudal-related genes is observed at the state of gastrulation exhibiting a gradient along the anteroposterior axis. With the exception of Chox-cad2 (62Serrano J. Scavo L. Roth J. de la Rosa E.J. de Pablo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 270-276Google Scholar) and Xcad-3 (63Northrop J.L. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 490-503Google Scholar), transcripts of caudal-related genes are detected predominantly in endodermally derived tissues, playing a major role in the development of the intestine (17James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15229-15237Google Scholar, 23Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 71-81Google Scholar, 64Frumkin A. Pillemer G. Haffner R. Tarcic N. Gruenbaum Y. Fainsod A. Development. 1994; 120: 253-263Google Scholar, 65Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Google Scholar). For cdxA, early expression pattern is reported to cover several organs of endodermal origin like liver, pancreas, lung, and the epithelial lining of the intestine, whereas later expression is restricted to the intestine. The presence of cdx-2/3 in adult cells of the endocrine pancreas (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar, 66Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Google Scholar) may indicate a wider role of cdx genes not only in the development of endodermally derived tissues but also in transcriptional control of differentiated islet cells. In contrast to the intestine, cdx-2/3 is the only caudal-related gene expressed at significant levels in the islets of Langerhans. Interestingly, alternative splicing of the cdx-2/3 mRNA leads to an amino-terminally truncated isoform protein with translational initiation at an upstream AUG normally supposed to be skipped (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar). Of note, all mammalian caudal-related genes exhibit a second AUG codon 22-33 nt upstream of the initiator AUG (17James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15229-15237Google Scholar, 23Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 71-81Google Scholar, 36Hu Y. Kazenwadel J. James R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27214-27225Google Scholar). With the exception of cdx-2/3 B, however, these upstream AUGs only imperfectly match the Kozak consensus for vertebrates, which may explain the deviation of the first AUG rule. The initiator context for cdx-2/3 B (GCGAGCAUGG) is close to the consensus sequence GCCACCAUGG, allowing translational initiation in the absence of the second AUG. Protein synthesis of Cdx-2/3 B may not be optimal, however, inasmuch it is much lower than synthesis of Cdx-2/3 A in in vitro transcription/translation assays.Our results indicate that one of the functions of cdx-2/3 may be the regulation of glucagon gene expression. Cdx-2/3 indeed binds the upstream control element G1 at the proximal AT-rich repeat motif, which corresponds to the consensus binding site for caudal-related genes (19Margalit Y. Yarus S. Shapira E. Gruenbaum Y. Fainsod A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4915-4922Google Scholar). It is also capable, although with much lower affinity, of binding the distal, imperfect repeat motif within G1. However, in contrast to the proximal motif, the distal element contains a C at position 6, where in the CdxA consensus as well as in the Cad binding sites there is a strong preference for T. When oligonucleotides used for EMSAs contain both repeat elements, Cdx-2/3 A homodimer formation (complex D) is observed with BHK 21 nuclear extracts containing high concentrations of Cdx-2/3 A and disappears when one of the repeat elements is mutated. Our data indicate that if homodimer formation occurs, this is only in the presence of large amounts of Cdx-2/3 A. With cdx-2/3 A-transfected BHK 21 extracts the intensity of complex D is less than (null)/1;10 that of the monomeric complex. Cdx-2/3 A homodimer formation is thus not favored with G1, an observation in agreement with the low affinity of the distal AT-rich motif for Cdx-2/3 A. By contrast, with InR1G9 nuclear extracts, only the slow migrating complex B3 is recognized by anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies, and a Cdx-2/3 A monomer can only be detected using small or mutated oligonucleotides that may prevent the assembly of higher molecular weight complexes. Thus, with extracts from glucagon-producing cells, formation of heterodimers is much favored over monomers. Caudal binding sites in Drosophila (67Dearolf C.R. Topol J. Parker C.S. Nature. 1989; 341: 340-343Google Scholar), the rat insulin I gene (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar), and the mouse sucrase-isomaltase gene (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar) represent direct or indirect repeats, and for the latter homodimer formation was observed. Although most dimer-forming homeodomain proteins bind to sequences with dyad symmetry, it is well established that dimerization also occurs on tandem repeats such as G1 (68Beachy P.A. Varkey J. Young K.E. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Ekker S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6941-6956Google Scholar, 69Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1090Google Scholar, 70Ruvkun G. Finney M. Cell. 1991; 64: 475-478Google Scholar, 71Galang C.K. Hauser C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4609-4617Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the redox potential-dependent dimer formation on the sucrase-isomaltase gene promoter, neither the Cdx-2/3 A homodimer nor B3 binding to G1 is influenced by the redox state (data not shown). In a recent report, Jin and Drucker (66Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Google Scholar) have observed binding of Cdx-2/3 A as a monomer to the G1 element. However, the oligonucleotides used for EMSA in their study comprised only one Cdx-2/3 binding site and thus do not enable dimer formation.Binding of Cdx-2/3 A to the glucagon promoter leads to a dose-dependent activation of transcription in non-glucagon-producing cells, and mutation of the Cdx-2/3 A binding site leads to a marked decrease in transcriptional activity, suggesting a functional relevance for Cdx-2/3 A in glucagon gene expression (9Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Google Scholar). The presence of an amino-terminally truncated Cdx-2/3 isoform in glucagon-producing cells that binds to G1 but does not activate transcription opens additional possibilities for gene regulation. The interference of Cdx-2/3 B with the transcriptional property of Cdx-2/3 A in BHK 21 and InR1G9 cells suggests a role of Cdx-2/3 B as a modulator of glucagon gene expression. This effect could be due to competition of both isoforms for binding to the glucagon promoter or to protein-protein interactions inhibiting the activation properties of Cdx-2/3 A. It will be interesting to analyze if the alternative splicing leading to both Cdx-2/3 isoforms is differentially regulated during development or in response to physiological stimuli and correlated to changes in glucagon gene expression.G1 is a large DNA control element that likely interacts with multiple transcription factors; Cdx-2/3 A may be one of them present in complex B3. We previously identified at least three additional protein complexes, B1, B2, and B6 (9Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Google Scholar), that might also be functionally important for glucagon gene expression. Recently, the LIM-domain homeobox gene isl-1 was shown to interact with oligonucleotides containing the most proximal AT-rich motif (positions −54 to −57) of the glucagon promoter element G1 (53Wang M. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12646-12652Google Scholar). However, in cotransfection experiments with 292 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat glucagon gene promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene, Isl-1 was unable to activate transcription, and no synergistic effect with Cdx-2/3 A on transcription of the glucagon gene could be observed. 2B. Laser, P. Meda, I. Constant, and J. Philippe, unpublished observations. Therefore, Cdx-2/3 A is unlikely to interact with Isl-1, which by itself does not appear to play a major role in glucagon gene transcription.Cdx-2/3 A has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in the intestine (65Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Google Scholar) as well as in the regulation of intestine-specific gene transcription, at least for the sucrase-isomaltase, carbonic anhydrase I, and lactase genes (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar, 72Drummond F. Sowden J. Morrison K. Edwards Y.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 670-681Google Scholar). Cdx-2/3 A is also able to bind and activate the rat insulin I gene promoter at the minienhancer (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar), although other homeodomain factors such as Idx-1/STF1/IPF1 are more likely physiological activators of insulin gene transcription (11Miller C. McGehee R. Habener J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Google Scholar, 54MacFarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I.

Our data and a recent report (66Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Google Scholar) indicate that Cdx-2/3 A is involved in glucagon gene expression both in the endocrine pancreas and in enteroendocrine cell lines expressing glucagon. In both cell types, Cdx-2/3 A was shown to transactivate the glucagon gene promoter (66Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the endodermal origin of both tissues and indicate that some of the mechanisms of glucagon gene regulation in the intestine and endocrine pancreas might be similar. The presence of two Cdx-2/3 isoforms with different transactivation properties not only in glucagon- but also in insulin-producing cells as well as in the intestine opens further possibilities to control gene expression in these tissues. INTRODUCTIONGlucagon and the glucagon-like peptides are synthesized as a common precursor, preproglucagon, encoded by the glucagon gene and are involved in the control of glucose homeostasis. Expression of the glucagon gene is highly restricted to the alpha cells of the endocrine pancreas, the L cells of the intestine, and certain areas of the brain (1Drucker D.J. Asa S. J. Biol.

G1 contains three AT-rich sequences that are candidate binding sites for homeodomain transcription factors. Two of these sequences represent nearly identical 7-bp direct repeats and are important for transcriptional activity. At least four protein complexes were found to interact with G1, and the integrity of the AT-rich 7-bp direct repeats was shown to be critical for their binding (9Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Google Scholar).In a first attempt to identify the proteins implicated in the control of glucagon gene expression, we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on highly conserved sequences in the first and third helix of the Antennapedia class of homeodomain transcription factors. Recent studies indicate that homeobox genes are involved in the control of pancreatic hormone genes, such as insulin and somatostatin. Several homeodomain proteins have been isolated from islet cells by cDNA cloning or PCR amplification of reverse transcribed RNA (11Miller C. McGehee R. Habener J.

Since cdx-3 represents the hamster homologue of the mouse cdx-2 gene (15German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar, 17James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J.

In cell lines of the endocrine pancreas, alternative splicing generates two cdx-2/3 mRNAs, encoding a full-length protein (termed Cdx-2/3 A) and an amino-terminally truncated isoform (Cdx-2/3 B). Cdx-2/3 binds the proximal AT-rich direct repeat motif of the glucagon promoter element G1, which matches the consensus binding site of caudal-related genes (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Google Scholar, 19Margalit Y. Yarus S. Shapira E. Gruenbaum Y. Fainsod A.

Interestingly, the full-length Cdx-2/3 A, but not the truncated Cdx-2/3 B isoform activates glucagon gene expression in non-glucagon-producing cells. Different transactivating properties of the two isoforms exhibiting the same affinity for G1 suggests that differential expression of cdx-2/3 A and cdx-2/3 B may regulate transcriptional activation. We conclude that the intestine-specific gene cdx-2/3 is the only caudal-related gene expressed in the endocrine pancreas and that it may be involved in the control of pancreatic glucagon gene expression."

Previous studies have suggested distinct cell type- and inducer-specific roles for EGR-1 protein in cellular growth inhibition. The present study was undertaken to determine the functional role of EGR-1 in growth inhibition caused by exposure of tumor cells to ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation caused induction of EGR-1 protein in human melanoma cells A375-C6. Inhibition of either the function of EGR-1 protein by stable transfection with a dominant-negative mutant or the expression of EGR-1 by transient transfection with an antisense oligomer resulted in a diminished growth-inhibitory response to ionizing radiation. Because previous studies have suggested that mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 confer radio-resistance, we examined the p53 status of A375-C6 cells. Interestingly, both the parental and the transfected A375-C6 cells showed trisomy for wild-type p53 alleles. Exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in induction of p53 protein that localized to the nucleus in A375-C6 cells. These data suggest that inhibition of EGR-1 function confers radio resistance despite the induction of wild-type nuclear p53. Thus, EGR-1 is required for the growth-inhibitory response to ionizing radiation in A375-C6 cells.

Thus, EGR-1 is required for the growth-inhibitory response to ionizing radiation in A375-C6 cells. Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to inhibition of tumor cell growth that often shows characteristic features of apoptosis (1Urmansky S.R. Tonei L.N. Cope E.O. Apoptosis: The Molecular Basis of Cell Death. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 193-208Google Scholar). The process of growth inhibition requires the coordinate expression of specific genes. Gene expression studies have documented the association of the transcription factor p53 (2Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar) with growth inhibition and apoptosis caused by ionizing radiation. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, it has also been speculated that x-ray-mediated induction of the zinc finger transcription factor EGR-1 (reviewed in Ref. 3Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Google Scholar) may cause downstream induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which may ultimately lead to growth inhibition (4Hallahan D.E. Sukhatme V.P. Sherman M.L. Virudachalam S. Kufe D. Weichselbaum R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2156-2160Google Scholar). However, the functional role of EGR-1 that is induced in response to ionizing radiation has not been elucidated. By contrast, wild-type p53 has been shown to be functionally necessary for growth inhibition and apoptosis after exposure to radiation (2Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W.

To elucidate the relevance of the induction of EGR-1 in growth inhibition caused by ionizing radiation, we chose to determine the regulation and function of EGR-1 in human melanoma cells A375-C6. We specifically chose A375-C6 cells because our previous studies (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar) had demonstrated the feasibility of defining the function of EGR-1 in growth inhibition and apoptosis in these cells, without the often confounding problems imposed by functional dedundancy owing to other closely related members of the Egr family. We present here evidence that A375-C6 cells show induction of wild-type p53 and EGR-1 proteins and that despite the wild-type p53 background, inhibition of the expression or function of EGR-1 causes a diminution in the number of cells undergoing growth inhibition. Plasmid pCMV-WT1-EGR1, which encodes a dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1, contains a WT1-EGR-1 chimera downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) 1The abbreviations used are: CMVcytomegalovirusTUNELterminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin end labelingGygrayASantisenseNSnon-sensePCR-SSCPpolymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphismFISHfluorescence in situ hybridization. promoter in vector pCB6+ (12Madden S.L.

The WT1 domain of the construct provides the transrepression function to the chimera, whereas the EGR-1 domain that contains the three zinc fingers provides the DNA binding function. Plasmid pCMV-M-EGR1, which encodes full-length mouse EGR-1 protein, contains mouse EGR-1 cDNA downstream of the CMV promoter in vector pCB6+ (12Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A.

Human melanoma cells A375-C6 and transfected cell lines A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 and A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4 expressing the chimera, A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 expressing mouse EGR-1, or A375-C6/vector.L1 and A375-C6/vector.L2 expressing the pCB6+ vector were cultured as described previously (10Sells S.F.

A 100-kV industrial x-ray machine (Phillips, Netherlands) was used to irradiate the cultures at room temperature. The dose rate with a 2-mm aluminum plus 1-mm beryllium filter was ∼1.85 Gy at a focus-surface distance of 30 cm. These experiments were performed as described previously (13Rangnekar V.V. Waheed S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6240-6248Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 2,000/200 μl in 96-well plates, and 24 h later they were left unexposed or exposed to different doses of radiation (5 or 20 Gy). The cells were cultured for 48 h and then pulsed for 8 h with [3H]thymidine (2 Ci/mmol; 0.5 μCi/well). Radioactivity incorporated into the cells was determined, and percent growth inhibition was calculated as described (13Rangnekar V.V. Waheed S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6240-6248Google Scholar). EGR-1 or p53 expression was determined by immunocytochemical analysis, as we described previously (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). Cells were left unexposed or exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation, incubated for the indicated period of time at 37°C, and then subjected to immunocytochemistry with the anti-EGR-1 antibody sc-110 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or the anti-p53 antibody DO-1 (Oncogene Science, MA) and the Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To quantify apoptosis, the ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD), which detects DNA strand breaks by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin end labeling (TUNEL) was used as described (11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). To determine the percentage of cells showing apoptosis, four experiments in total were performed, and approximately 1,000 cells were counted in each experiment. A375-C6 cells were left untreated or exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation and then incubated for various time intervals. Thereafter, total cell extracts were prepared, and 30 μg of each extract protein was electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-EGR-1 antibody sc-110, the anti-p53 antibody D0-1, or for loading control the β-actin antibody (Sigma) and 125I protein A, as described (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate-capped human Egr-1 antisense (AS) and non-sense (NS) oligodeoxynucleotides, as described previously (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar), were used in the experiments aimed at blocking endogenous EGR-1 expression in human A375-C6 cells or in A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells. The oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the cells 4 h before irradiation at a concentration of 25 nM, which has been shown to be nontoxic to the cells while still blocking EGR-1 expression (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). The cells were then exposed to the indicated dose of radiation, and after 48 h growth inhibition was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. To identify mutations in the p53 gene, PCR-SSCP was performed. Total DNA extracted from A375-C6 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells was used to amplify exons 2 through 11 by PCR, which employed 32P end-labeled primers that were specific for the human p53 gene. Mutations were detected by electrophoresis in mutation detection enhancement gel (Hydrolink, AT Biochem). To evaluate the copy number or amplification of the p53 gene, FISH was performed using a digoxigenin-labeled p53 probe (locus, p53; band assignment, 17 p13.1) obtained from Oncor, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) as described elsewhere. 2E. Tsuchida, M. Valentino, M. M. Ahmed, E. Y. Lee, and M. Mohiuddin, submitted for publication. For the analysis of each cell line, 500 nuclei were scored by using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo) equipped with a triple band-pass filter for 6′-4diamino phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/rhodamine. The criteria described by Hopman et al. (15Hopman A.H. Ramaekers F.C.S. Raap A.K. Beck J.L. Devilee P. van der Ploeg M. Vooijs G.P. Histochemistry. 1988; 89: 307-316Google Scholar) were applied for evaluation of the FISH signals. Total RNA was extracted from A375-C6 cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 μg of the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase. Further, by using this cDNA as the starting template, p53 cDNA was amplified by PCR by using specific deoxyoligonucleotide primers that were designed on the basis of the published sequence of human p53 cDNA (16Harlow E. Williamson N.M. Ralston R. Helfman D.M. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1601-1610Google Scholar). The deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized at Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (Woodland, TX). Two pairs of p53-specific primers were used to generate two overlapping DNA fragments. The first pair of p53-specific primers consisted of an upstream primer (5′-TCC GGG GAC ACT TTG CGT TCG-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 119-139 and a downstream primer (5′-GCG CCT CAC AAC CTC CGT CAT-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 719-739, and the resulting DNA fragment was 621 base pairs. The second pair of p53-specific primers consisted of an upstream primer (5′-CAC GTA CTC CCC TGC CCT CAA-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 586-606 and a downstream primer (5′-GGC TGT CAG TGG GGA ACA AGA AGT-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 1405-1428, and the resulting DNA fragment was 843 base pairs. Direct DNA sequencing of these two DNA fragments was performed in both directions (sense and antisense) by using the automated Applied Biosystems 373 A DNA sequencer and dye terminator cycle sequencing with DNA Taq polymerase at the University of Kentucky Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility (Lexington, KY). To study the consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation, a dose-response study was performed by exposing A375-C6 cells to various doses of ionizing radiation and determining growth inhibition by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As seen in Fig. 1, irradiation caused growth inhibition in A375-C6 cells, exposure to a 5-Gy dose caused growth inhibition in about 80% of the cells, and exposure to a 20-Gy dose caused growth inhibition in about 90% of the cells. These data suggest that ionizing radiation causes dose-dependent growth inhibition in A375-C6 cells. To determine whether radiation causes induction of EGR-1 in A375-C6 cells, these cells were exposed to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation and subjected to immunostaining 1 h after the exposure. In addition, to quantify EGR-1 expression levels, whole cell protein extracts were prepared from the cells at different time intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2a, fewer than 5% of the cells expressed EGR-1 when left unexposed. However, exposure to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation resulted in a marked increase in the number of cells expressing EGR-1; more than 98% of the cells expressed EGR-1 protein in the nucleus (Fig. 2a). Consistent with these data, Western blot analysis indicated that when exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation, EGR-1 protein was unaltered as compared with unexposed cells in the first 15 min but was induced within 30 min after the exposure (Fig. 2b). Peak levels of EGR-1 were attained at 45 min after the exposure; thereafter, EGR-1 levels diminished at 60 min and returned to basal levels at 120 min after the exposure (Fig. 2b). Thus, EGR-1 protein was transiently induced in response to the 5-Gy dose of radiation. We have shown previously (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar) that in A375-C6 cells, the WT1-EGR-1 chimera competes effectively with EGR-1 transactivation through the EGR-1 target binding site and thus acts as a dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1. To study the effect of the chimera on the ability of ionizing radiation to induce growth inhibition, A375-C6 cells were transfected with the WT1-EGR-1 expression construct or with the pCB6+ empty vector, and stable transfectants were selected with G418 as described previously (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). The results from 13 different transfection experiments revealed that about the same number (mean ± S.D.) of G418-resistant transfected clones were obtained in each experiment with the chimera (218 ± 38 clones) or the vector alone (206 ± 29). Next, about 200 G418-resistant clones from each transfection experiment were pooled to obtain cell lines, A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.(L1-L13), which expressed the chimera, or A375-C6/vector.(L1-L13), which contained the empty vector. To determine the functional role of EGR-1 protein that is induced in response to radiation, we used transfected cell lines, A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13, which express the dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1; and for a control, we used A375-C6/vector.L1 or A375-C6/vector.L2 cell lines that were transfected with the vector alone. The transfected cells were exposed to a 5- or 20-Gy dose of ionizing radiation, and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were used to determine growth inhibition. The results with A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells were similar as depicted in Fig. 3, a and b. A375-C6/vector.L1 cells showed about 80 or 90% growth inhibition at 5- or 20-Gy irradiation doses, respectively, whereas the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cells showed about 40 or 75% growth inhibition at the corresponding doses of radiation (Fig. 3a). A375-C6/vector.L2 cells showed about 75 or 90% growth inhibition at 5- or 20-Gy irradiation doses, respectively, whereas the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4 transfected cells showed about 40 or 60% growth inhibition at the corresponding doses of radiation (Fig. 3b). Thus, compared with the A375-C6/vector cell lines, the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1 transfected cell lines were significantly (p < 0.001 by the Student's t test) resistant to ionizing radiation-inducible growth inhibition. Because we have previously shown that the dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1 competitively inhibits the function of EGR-1 in A375-C6 cells (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar), these data suggest that EGR-1 function is required for growth inhibition induced by exposure to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation causes growth inhibition and apoptosis in diverse cell types (1Urmansky S.R. Tonei L.N. Cope E.O. Apoptosis: The Molecular Basis of Cell Death. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 193-208Google Scholar, 2Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). To determine whether ionizing radiation causes apoptosis in A375-C6 cells and whether EGR-1 function is required for apoptosis in these cells, A375-C6/vector.L1, A375-C6/vector.L2, A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4, and A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cell lines were irradiated at a 5-Gy dose and subjected to TUNEL after 48 h. A375-C6/vector.L1 or A375-C6/vector.L2 cells exposed to a 5-Gy dose showed 1.5 or 2% TUNEL-positive cells, respectively, whereas A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L4 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells exposed to this dose showed 0.4 or 0.6% TUNEL-positive cells, respectively (Fig. 3c). These differences in the apoptotic response of cells transfected with vector alone or the chimera were highly reproducible in four different experiments and were statistically significant (p < 0.001) by the Student's t test. These results suggest that A375-C6 cells show an apoptotic response to ionizing radiation and that the dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1 provides these cells protection from ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis. Since the WT1-EGR-1 chimera is expected to act as a dominant-negative mutant for all the gene members of the Egr family that share the EGR-1 binding sequence, the effects of the chimera on growth inhibition or apoptosis could be due to competitive inhibition of function of a relative of EGR-1 or of EGR-1 itself. To directly determine the specific function of EGR-1 in ionizing radiation-inducible growth inhibition, we used an AS oligomer (17Nguyen H. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Google Scholar) described previously (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar) to block radiation-inducible expression of Egr-1. A375-C6 cells were left untreated or treated with the AS oligomer or an NS oligomer for control, and 4 h later the cells were exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation. The consequences of exposure to radiation were examined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As shown in Fig. 4a, the AS oligomer protected the A375-C6 cells from ionizing radiation-inducible growth inhibition at a 5-Gy dose; cells that were not pretreated with any oligomer showed about 75% growth inhibition, whereas cells pretreated with the AS oligomer showed about 50% growth inhibition. Cells that were treated with the NS oligomer, for a control, showed about 75% growth inhibition after exposure to a 5-Gy dose of radiation (Fig. 4a). This difference in response to ionizing radiation between the AS pretreated and untreated or NS-treated A375-C6 cultures was statistically significant (p < 0.001) by the Student's t test. Our previous studies in A375-C6 cells (11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar) have suggested that the AS oligomer but not the NS oligomer inhibits the expression of human Egr-1 as judged by Western blot analysis. The AS oligomer does not inhibit the expression of other genes such as c-jun, p53, Egr-2, β-actin, or GAPDH in A375-C6 cells (data not shown). To ascertain that the AS oligomer was specifically directed against Egr-1, we examined whether the effects of the AS oligomer could be reversed by overexpression of mouse Egr-1 protein in A375-C6 cells. Because the nucleotide sequence of the AS oligomer was complementary to human Egr-1 (18Suggs S.V. Katzowitz J.L. Tsai-Morris C. Sukhatme V.P. Nucleic Acid Res. 1990; 18: 4283Google Scholar) but not mouse Egr-1 (19Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.-H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Le Beau M.M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Google Scholar), the AS oligomer was not expected to inhibit the expression of ectopically expressed mouse Egr-1 in the human A375-C6 cells. We reasoned that if the effect of the AS oligomer in A375-C6 cells was specifically owing to inhibition of expression of endogenous Egr-1, transfection of the cells with mouse Egr-1 whose expression was not expected to be inhibited by the oligomer would result in rescue of the cells from this effect. By contrast, if the effect of the AS oligomer was owing to inhibition of expression of genes other than Egr-1, transfection of the cells with mouse Egr-1 would not rescue the cells from this effect. To address this question, we first transfected A375-C6 cells with the mouse-EGR-1 expression construct, pCMV-M-EGR1, or the empty vector pCB6+ and selected transfected clones with G418-sulfate. 12 different transfection experiments were performed, and a similar number (mean ± S.D.) of transfected clones were obtained with pCMV-M-EGR1 (220 ± 35) or vector alone (255 ± 29). From these different transfection experiments, we obtained 12 different transfected cell lines (A375-C6/M-EGR1.(L1-L12)) for the mouse EGR-1 expression construct; each cell line was a pool of about 200 G418-resistant clones. The growth rate of A375-C6/M-EGR1.(L1-L12) cell lines was similar to that of A375-C6/vector.L1 or A375-C6/vector.L2 cell line (data not shown). Next, we performed Western blot analysis to ascertain that the A375-C6/M-EGR1 cell lines showed increased expression of EGR-1 protein and to study the effect of the AS-Egr-1 oligomer on the expression of ectopic mouse Egr-1. A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells were treated with the AS-Egr-1 or NS oligomer for 4 h or left untreated, and whole cell protein extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis with the EGR-1 antibody sc-110, which is expected to detect both endogenous human EGR-1 and ectopically expressed mouse EGR-1 proteins. As a control for endogenous human EGR-1 protein levels in these experiments, we used whole cell protein extract from A375-C6/vector.L1 cell line. As seen in Fig. 4b, A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells showed a 4-fold increase in expression of EGR-1 protein over that seen in A375-C6/vector.L1 cells. Treatment of A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells with the NS oligomer did not inhibit the expression of EGR-1 protein (Fig. 4b). A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells treated with the AS oligomer showed a 3-fold increase in EGR-1 expression over that seen in A375-C6/vector.L1 cells (Fig. 4b), suggesting that total EGR-1 protein levels were minimally affected in these M-EGR-1 over-expressors by the AS oligomer. Thus, A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells treated with the AS oligomer, which is directed against human Egr-1, continue to show expression of ectopic mouse Egr-1. When two other pCMV/M-EGR1 transfected cell lines, A375-C6/M-EGR1.L2 and A375-C6/M-EGR1.L3, were examined by Western blot analysis, they showed a 4-fold increase in expression of EGR-1 relative to that in parental or A375-C6/vector.L2 cells, and treatment with the AS oligomer resulted in a 0.8-fold decrease in EGR-1 expression (data not shown). Thus, the AS oligomer does not affect total EGR-1 protein much in the murine EGR-1 over-expressors (Fig. 4b), whereas it does diminish the expression of endogenous human EGR-1 in A375-C6 cells (11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar). We then determined whether the AS oligomer inhibited the ability of ionizing radiation to cause growth inhibition in A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells. The cells were treated with AS or NS oligomers or left untreated with the oligomers for 4 h and were further left unexposed or exposed to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation. The consequences of exposure to radiation were examined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As seen in Fig. 4c, the A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells showed about 85% growth inhibition when exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation. When the cells were subjected to pretreatment with the AS or NS oligomers and then exposed to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation, 80-85% growth inhibition was noticed. Thus, unlike the parental A375-C6 cells, which show protection from the growth-inhibitory effect of ionizing radiation when pretreated with the AS oligomer (Fig. 4a), A375-C6/M-EGR1.L1 cells expressing ectopic mouse EGR-1 do not show protection from the growth-inhibitory effect of ionizing radiation when pretreated with the AS oligomer (Fig. 4c). These data suggest that overexpression of mouse Egr-1 can rescue A375-C6 cells from the radio-protective effect of AS-Egr-1 oligomer, implying that the effect of the AS oligomer in A375-C6 cells is most likely caused by specific inhibition of Egr-1 expression. Together, these data suggest that EGR-1 expression is required for radiation-inducible growth inhibition in A375-C6 cells. Wild-type p53 plays a functional role in DNA repair by arresting cells in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle after irradiation (5Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Google Scholar, 6Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Google Scholar). It is also known that the cellular levels of p53 protein increase after exposure to ionizing radiation (2Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of mutant forms of p53 may confer cellular resistance to growth inhibition caused by ionizing radiation (20Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Google Scholar). We therefore examined the status of p53 in parental and transfected A375-C6 cells by using PCR-SSCP analysis. Total genomic DNA from the placenta was used as a negative control for p53 gene mutations, and the pancreatic tumor cell line CFPAC-1 was used as a positive control for mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene. Each exon was amplified by PCR using specific radiolabeled primers, and the products were denatured and then subjected to mutation detection enhancement gel electrophoresis. Variations in single strand conformation were analyzed by autoradiography. These studies indicated that the A375-C6 parental cells, the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cells, and the placenta showed similar single strand conformations for the p53 gene exons 2 through 11 (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the p53 gene in the A375-C6 cells is wild type. As expected, the CFPAC-1 DNA showed mutation in exon 7 (Fig. 5a, lane 2). These studies showed that neither the parental nor the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cells show mutation in the p53 gene. To further confirm the results of PCR-SSCP, nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on two overlapping DNA fragments that were generated by using p53-specific primers and PCR, as described under “Materials and Methods.” These DNA fragments encompassed the region from nucleotide 119 that is located upstream of the p53 translation initiation ATG sequence (nucleotides 215-217) to nucleotide 1428, which is located downstream of the p53 stop codon (TGA, nucleotides 1394-1396). The nucleotide sequence data (not shown) indicated that the two overlapping DNA fragments showed sequence that was identical to that of human wild-type p53 cDNA (16Harlow E. Williamson N.M. Ralston R. Helfman D.M. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1601-1610Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with the results of PCR-SSCP, there were no alterations in the coding region of the p53 gene in A375-C6 cells. FISH analysis, performed by using a digoxigenin-labeled p53 cosmid probe, showed that the proportion of nuclei with two signals for the p53 gene was 20-25% and that the proportion of nuclei with three signals was 75-80% (data not shown). These data imply that A375-C6 cells contain 3 alleles of the p53 gene. Western blot analysis was then performed to examine whether exposure to ionizing radiation caused induction of p53 protein. A375-C6/vector.L1 and the A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cells were either left untreated or exposed to a 5-Gy dose of ionizing radiation. At 5 or 8 h after the exposure, the cells were harvested, and whole cell protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis for p53 protein. As seen in Fig. 5c, A375-C6/vector.L1 and A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells that were left untreated showed a modest basal expression of p53 protein. Cells that were exposed to radiation showed a strong induction of p53 protein at 5 or 8 h after the exposure (Fig. 5c). Because p53 protein should be present in the nucleus if it is to be functional (21Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Google Scholar), we used immunocytochemistry to determine whether p53 protein that was induced by ionizing radiation in A375-C6/vector.L1 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells was actually present in the nucleus. The cells were left unexposed or exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation. 5 h after the exposure, the cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry for p53 protein. As seen in Fig. 5b, unexposed cultures of A375-C6/vector.L1 or A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells showed about 40-50% p53-positive cells. When these cultures were exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation and incubated for 5 h after the exposure, more than 95% of the cells were identified as p53 positive (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, p53 expression was primarily localized to the nucleus in unexposed or irradiated cultures of A375-C6/vector.L1 and A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells (Fig. 5b). Together, these data indicate that exposure to ionizing radiation results in increased expression of nuclear p53 protein in cells that are transfected with the vector alone or with the dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1. Thus, despite the induction of wild-type p53 protein, blocking EGR-1 function in A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 cells conferred resistance to ionizing radiation. The present study suggests that ionizing radiation causes growth inhibition and apoptosis in human melanoma cells A375-C6. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry studies indicated that Egr-1 is induced in the melanoma cells by ionizing radiation in a dose-dependent manner. Functional studies using A375-C6 cells expressing the Egr-1 dominant-negative mutant, whose product competes functionally with EGR-1 (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar), or an antisense Egr-1 oligomer, which blocks the expression of Egr-1 (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar, 11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar), suggested that EGR-1 function is required for the radiation-inducible growth inhibition. A previous study has indicated that EGR-1 may confer resistance to growth inhibition caused by ultraviolet radiation in the mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (22Huang R.-P. Adamson E.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 467-475Google Scholar). This apparent difference in the role of EGR-1 in A375-C6 and NIH 3T3 cells indicates that EGR-1 function is influenced by the host cell background. Recent studies (14Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Google Scholar, 23Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Google Scholar) have identified corepressor proteins that bind to EGR-1 and modulate its activity, and it is necessary to determine whether differences in the expression of specific EGR-1 binding proteins are responsible for the distinct EGR-1 functions. The inhibition of EGR-1 expression with the AS oligomer or function with the dominant-negative mutant leads to partial, but not complete, radioresistance. Because in A375-C6 cells the dominant-negative mutant abrogates EGR-1-dependent transactivation substantially, but not completely (10Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Google Scholar), and because treatment with the AS oligomer does not result in complete ablation of endogenous EGR-1 levels (11Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6262-6272Google Scholar), it is possible that incomplete radioresistance may, in part, be due to incomplete interference with endogenous EGR-1. In addition, however, there exists the possibility that the induction of other redundant growth inhibitory pathways by ionizing radiation may prevent complete radioresistance despite ablation of EGR-1. Thus, EGR-1 may control only a specific component of the radiosensitive pathways. Because p53 protein has been linked to cell cycle arrest (2Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar, 4Hallahan D.E. Sukhatme V.P. Sherman M.L. Virudachalam S. Kufe D. Weichselbaum R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Google Scholar), and because p53 mutations have been reported to increase resistance to growth inhibition by ionizing radiation (20Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Google Scholar) in diverse tumor cell types, we sought to determine the status and expression of p53 in A375-C6 cells. These studies indicated that the melanoma cells A375-C6 have an extra copy of the p53 gene with trisomy for chromosome 17 and that none of the three alleles of p53 contains mutations in exons 2 through 11. Exposure to ionizing radiation led to an induction of p53 protein in the nucleus of A375-C6/vector.L1 and A375-C6/WT1-EGR1.L13 transfected cells. It is possible that induction of p53 protein may have rendered the parental cells radiosensitive, leading to growth inhibition and apoptosis. However, despite the induction of wild-type nuclear p53 protein, the transfected cells expressing the dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1 were resistant to ionizing radiation. These data suggest that Egr-1 plays a key functional role in the growth-inhibitory response to ionizing radiation. Further studies will identify the downstream events influenced by EGR-1 that lead to growth inhibition."

Such similarities may suggest that these proteins perform redundant functions in signal peptidase activity. In the present study, we addressed this issue through analysis of the yeast homologs to SPC12 and SPC25, Spc1p and Spc2p. We show that both Spc1p and Spc2p are nonessential for signal peptidase activity and growth of yeast cells and that null mutations in the genes encoding Spc1p and Spc2p are synthetically lethal with a conditional mutation affecting Sec11p, an essential subunit of yeast signal peptidase. However, a high copy plasmid encoding Spc1p suppresses the conditional sec11 mutation, whereas the corresponding plasmid encoding Spc2p does not suppress sec11. Moreover, Spc2p, but not Spc1p, is important for signal peptidase activity and cell viability at high temperatures. These results indicate that although both Spc1p and Spc2p are noncatalytic, they are functionally distinct. Evidence is also presented that a double mutant lacking Spc1p and Spc2p grows well relative to wild type yeast cells, indicating that the signal peptidase complex missing at least two of its subunits is sufficient for signal peptidase activity in vivo.

Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 1-3Google Scholar). Signal peptidase plays an additional role in the cell through participating in the degradation of some abnormal proteins in the ER membrane (2Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Google Scholar).ER signal peptidase purified from a variety of eukaryotic cells does not exist as a monomeric enzyme as does leader peptidase, the enzyme that cleaves signal peptides in bacteria (3Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Google Scholar), but as a hetero-oligomeric protein complex (4Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Google Scholar). The signal peptidase complex (SPC) isolated from mammalian cells consists of five subunits, three of which (SPC18, SPC21, and SPC22/23) contain one transmembrane segment (5Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Google Scholar). This topology places a large COOH-terminal domain of each subunit in the lumen. The remaining subunits, SPC25 and SPC12, contain two transmembrane segments with relatively large hydrophilic NH2- and COOH-terminal domains oriented toward the cytoplasm (6Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Google Scholar). The SPC of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least four subunits (7YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Google Scholar). The genes encoding two of these subunits, Sec11p and Spc1p, have been cloned and characterized (2Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol.

Based on the essential role of Sec11p in these activities and the fact that Sec11p contains distinct regions of homology to bacterial leader peptidase (10Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem.

Spc1p is nonessential, however, for signal peptidase function and growth of yeast cells.Here we have cloned the gene encoding the yeast homolog Spc2p to mammalian SPC25.

During or soon after translocation, ER membrane-bound signal peptidase catalyzes the proteolytic removal of NH2-terminal signal peptides from newly synthesized precursor proteins (for review, see Ref. 1von Heijne G. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 1-3Google Scholar). Signal peptidase plays an additional role in the cell through participating in the degradation of some abnormal proteins in the ER membrane (2Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase complex kilobase(s) 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester polymerase chain reaction prepro-α-factor pro-α-factor temperature-sensitive carboxypeptidase Y polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ER signal peptidase purified from a variety of eukaryotic cells does not exist as a monomeric enzyme as does leader peptidase, the enzyme that cleaves signal peptides in bacteria (3Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Google Scholar), but as a hetero-oligomeric protein complex (4Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Google Scholar). The signal peptidase complex (SPC) isolated from mammalian cells consists of five subunits, three of which (SPC18, SPC21, and SPC22/23) contain one transmembrane segment (5Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Google Scholar). This topology places a large COOH-terminal domain of each subunit in the lumen. The remaining subunits, SPC25 and SPC12, contain two transmembrane segments with relatively large hydrophilic NH2- and COOH-terminal domains oriented toward the cytoplasm (6Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Google Scholar). The SPC of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least four subunits (7YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Google Scholar). The genes encoding two of these subunits, Sec11p and Spc1p, have been cloned and characterized (2Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Google Scholar, 8Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Google Scholar, 9Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Google Scholar). Sec11p is essential for signal peptide cleavage, degradation of at least a subset of abnormal membrane proteins within the ER, and yeast cell growth. Based on the essential role of Sec11p in these activities and the fact that Sec11p contains distinct regions of homology to bacterial leader peptidase (10Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Google Scholar), this yeast subunit is presumed to contain the signal peptidase catalytic site. Spc1p, which is homologous to mammalian SPC12, is important for efficient enzyme activity (9Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16460-16465Google Scholar). Spc1p is nonessential, however, for signal peptidase function and growth of yeast cells. Here we have cloned the gene encoding the yeast homolog Spc2p to mammalian SPC25. As SPC12 and SPC25 of mammalian signal peptidase share similar membrane topologies, we questioned if the yeast homologs of these subunits perform redundant functions in signal peptidase activity in vivo. Results obtained through biochemical and genetic analyses indicate that Spc1p and Spc2p of the yeast SPC are functionally distinct.

https://openalex.org/W2002114205,"The secondary and tertiary structures of the choline-dependent major pneumococcal autolysin LytA amidase and of its COOH-terminal domain, C-LytA, have been investigated by circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Deconvolution analysis shows that the far-UV CD spectrum of both proteins is governed by chiral contributions, ascribed to aromatic residue clusters contained in the COOH-terminal module. The secondary structure of LytA, determined from the FTIR spectral features of the amide I′ band, results in 19% of α-helix and tight loops, 47% of β-sheets, 23% of turns, and 11% of irregular structures. Similar values are obtained for C-LytA. The addition of choline significantly modifies the far- and near-UV CD spectra of LytA and C-LytA. These changes are attributed to alterations in the environment of their aromatic clusters, since the FTIR spectra indicate that the secondary structure is essentially unaffected. CD choline titration curves at different wavelengths show the existence of two types of binding sites/subunit. Data analysis assuming protein dimerization upon saturation of the high affinity sites reveals positive cooperativity between the low affinity sites. Thermal denaturation of both proteins occurs with the formation of unfolding intermediates and the presence of residual secondary structure in the final denatured state. The irreversibility of the thermal denaturation of LytA and C-LytA results from the collapse of the polypeptide chain into intermolecular extended structures. At saturating concentrations, choline prevents the formation of these structures in the isolated COOH-terminal module."

As a chemotherapeutic agent, dietary 10% limonene caused ∼66% of advanced DMBA- or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced carcinomas to completely regress and an additional ∼23% to partially regress (6Haag J.D. Lindstrom M.J. Gould M.N. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4021-4026PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a 2% perillyl alcohol diet resulted in 50% complete and an additional 25% partial regression of advanced DMBA-induced mammary carcinomas (7Haag J.D. Gould M.N. Cancer Chemother.

Several observations suggest that monoterpene-mediated mammary carcinoma regression may involve a differentiation/remodeling process. Histopathology of monoterpene-treated, actively regressing tumors displays regions of dense anaplastic epithelium characteristic of mammary carcinomas and regions of a remodeled epithelial compartment.

Monoterpenes inhibit enzymes in the mevalonate-lipid metabolism pathway, including a selective inhibition of isoprenylation of 21-26 kDa small G proteins (13Crowell P.L. Chang R.R. Ren Z. Elson C.E.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inhibition of isoprenylation may affect signal transduction pathways because unprocessed or non-prenylated small G proteins are not properly localized within the cell and are thus non-functional (17Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Furthermore, investigations into gene expression and protein level alterations associated with monoterpene-mediated tumor regression revealed a large increase of the mitoinhibitory transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGF2R), which both facilitates latent-TGF-β1 activation and degrades the mammary mitogen insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2; Ref. 18Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while Man-6-P/IGF2R RNA expression was significantly induced 2-fold in 10% limonene-treated carcinomas, the induced RNA expression of Man-6-P/IGF2R was not observed in the non-responsive 10% limonene-treated carcinomas (19Jirtle R.L. Haag J.D. Ariazi E.A. Gould M.N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3849-3852PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that biochemical events in the cytoplasm modify signal transduction leading to altered gene expression. Thus, in order to further elucidate the monoterpenes' mechanism of cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy, we screened for differentially expressed genes in 10% limonene-treated, DMBA-induced, advanced mammary carcinomas resected at mid-regression. Complex tissues, such as mammary carcinomas, are composed of large heterogeneous cell populations and hence require sensitive gene expression screening methods. This is because a particular gene may be induced or repressed only in a specific cell type, which would be diluted by all the other cell types. In order to achieve the required level of sensitivity, the subtraction method of Wang and Brown (20Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) was initially chosen because this approach uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to generate a renewable source of cDNA for multiple rounds of subtraction, and the method efficiently removes commonly expressed cDNA from the experimental and control cDNA pools to allow for enrichment of differentially expressed genes. However, cloning the differentially expressed cDNAs involves cycles of classical probe hybridization experiments to isolate only a few clones at a time, followed by subtraction of the newly cloned cDNAs from the library. The cloning cycle is repeated until the library is completely screened, which may take 20-30 or more cloning cycles and thus renders this methodology inefficient. A possible alternative method considered was Liang and Pardee's (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4662) Google Scholar) differential display, since it is also a PCR-based technique that selectively amplifies subsets of cDNAs based on primer design applied to two matched but non-subtracted cDNA populations. This technique clones genes quickly but only ∼10% of the genes are differentially expressed when tested (22Mou L. Miller H. Li J. Wang E. Chalifour L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 549-564Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Hadman M. Adam B.L. Wright Jr., G.L. Bos T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 383-386Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Callard D. Lescure B. Mazzolini L. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 1096-1103PubMed Google Scholar). Problems with reproducibility are probably due to the low stringency in annealing of primers, although recent modifications in primer design and experimental protocol have somewhat improved reproducibility (25Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 26Liang P. Bauer D. Averboukh L. Warthoe P. Rohrwild M. Muller H. Strauss M. Pardee A.B.

Ooi S.L. Pardee A.B. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 842-850PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, because the primers effectively anneal as 6- or 7-base oligomers of arbitrary sequence, a statistical argument is needed to determine when the libraries are sufficiently screened (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4662) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there exists a high level of background noise in differential display due to the vast majority of competing heterologous RNA. Differential display shows a strong bias toward identifying abundant mRNAs (29Bertioli D.J. Schlichter U.H. Adams M.J. Burrows P.R. Steinbiss H.H. Antoniw J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4520-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An efficient gene expression screen should identify rare transcripts, which account for ∼90% of mRNA species in most cells (29Bertioli D.J. Schlichter U.H. Adams M.J. Burrows P.R. Steinbiss H.H. Antoniw J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4520-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In order to more efficiently identify differentially expressed monoterpene target genes, we developed and characterized an alternative approach, termed subtractive display (SD), which incorporates the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of subtractive hybridization and differential display. We have applied SD to identify differentially expressed genes in limonene-treated advanced rat mammary carcinomas. A flowchart of the SD methodology is given in Fig. 1. cDNA was generated from two matched tissue sources, or for this set of experiments, monoterpene-treated, regressing, mammary carcinomas (+cDNA) and control, non-treated carcinomas (−cDNA). ±cDNA was fragmented with restriction endonucleases followed by ligation of symmetrical linkers. The sequence at the cDNA fragment ends reflects the methods used to generate the cDNA libraries and restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and hence, are non-random sequences. The subtractive process involves multiple rounds of hybridization and PCR amplification, which renews the cDNA source. +cDNA was subtracted from −cDNA, and concurrently, −cDNA was subtracted from +cDNA, to derive induced and repressed genes, respectively. Subtracted cDNA was subcloned into a trimming plasmid and subjected to three cycles of precise, unidirectional deletions. The trimming procedure serves to reconfigure the subtracted libraries such that one end of the cDNA is composed of randomized sequence and both ends of the cDNA fragment are flanked by different or asymmetric primers. The subtracted, reconfigured cDNA libraries were PCR-displayed using 16 sets of primers consisting of 1 fixed primer and 1 of 16 subpopulation primers. The subpopulation primers are designed to anneal with a 2-base overlap (3′ end of primer) of the randomized sequence end of the reconfigured cDNA. The penultimate 2-bases of the 3′ end of the subpopulation primers were a specific combination of 1 of 16 (24) possible 2-base combinations, thus selecting for PCR amplification of a subpopulation of subtracted, reconfigured cDNA. Individual cDNA bands were isolated and characterized to confirm differential expression. Regressing (monoterpene-treated) and non-regressing (control, not treated) carcinomas for all studies were generated by the following protocol. Virgin female Wistar-Furth inbred rats at 50-55 days of age were given a single dose of DMBA (50 mg/kg body weight) by gastric intubation. Developing carcinomas were followed by palpation until they grew to ≥10 mm in diameter, at which time rats were randomized to either a monoterpene diet of 10% (w/w) d-limonene or a control diet and pair-fed. Carcinomas from rats on monoterpene diet that regressed to 50% of their maximum diameter were resected. All remaining carcinomas were collected by 15 weeks after diet randomization. All animal use was in compliance with NIH guidelines for humane care and was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical Center Animal Use Committee. Total tumor RNA was isolated using RNAzol B Reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the PolyATtract System 1000 (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's directions. The Superscript Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was used for double-stranded cDNA synthesis from poly(A)+ RNA. 5 μg of cDNA synthesized from 7 regressing and 7 non-regressing carcinomas were pooled and termed +cDNA and −cDNA, respectively. A portion of the +cDNA and −cDNA was reserved for construction of non-fragmented cDNA plasmid libraries with the vector pSport1 and transformed by electroporation into Electromax Efficiency DH12S Escherichia coli host cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). We used the PCR-based subtractive hybridization method of Wang and Brown (20Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) described in detail elsewhere. In brief, the subtraction protocol operates by fragmenting the cDNA with restriction endonucleases (i.e. AluI and AluI plus RsaI) and ligating onto their termini 21-bp oligodeoxynucleotide linkers having a 5′ blunt end and a 4-base 3′ overhang. The flush end contained an EcoRI site. Following linker ligation, the fragmented cDNAs are subjected to PCR amplification using the 21-bp linkers as primers (sequences given in Ref. 20Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It is assumed that cDNA fragments common to both +cDNA and −cDNA populations were amplified equally, while different cDNA fragments within a population may be differentially amplified. Dependent on the direction of subtraction, whether up- or down-regulated cDNAs were being enriched, either +cDNA or −cDNA and their derived populations were tracer or driver cDNA. Thus in the following, driver or tracer cDNA is specified but not if +cDNA or −cDNA was used. 50 μg of driver cDNA was completely digested with EcoRI to suppress contaminating driver cDNA from being amplified. Driver cDNA was then photobiotinylated and combined with 2.5 μg of non-biotinylated tracer cDNA. The mixture was completely denatured by boiling and then cooled for a long hybridization (20 h). Addition of streptavidin led to formation of streptavidin-biotin-DNA complexes that were removed by several phenol-chloroform extractions. Subtracted tracer cDNA (termed 1cDNA) was again subtracted from 25 μg of biotinylated driver cDNA, this time for a short hybridization of 2 h to yield 2cDNA. +2cDNA and −2cDNA were PCR amplified. 2.5 μg of non-biotinylated tracer 2cDNA was subtracted against 50 μg of EcoRI treated-biotinylated driver 2cDNA for a long hybridization followed by 25 μg of driver 1cDNA for a short hybridization, resulting in 4cDNA, which was then PCR amplified. Another similar cycle was performed giving 6cDNA. The subtractive hybridization process was monitored by displaying the cDNA libraries after each round of subtraction on a sequencing gel. The cDNA libraries were amplified using a primer derived from the original linker sequence ligated onto the cDNA fragment ends but modified by deletion of the two 5′ bases and the addition of the 2 mixed bases A/T and G/C on the 3′ end that overlaps the cDNA insert (5′-CTTGCTTGAATTCGGACTA(A/T)(C/G)-3′), giving 4 possible primers and 16 possible primer pairs. This mixed primer anneals at both ends of the cDNA fragments and because of the two mixed bases at the 3′ end that overlap the cDNA insert, the sequence selectively amplifies a representative cDNA subpopulation such that individual bands are visualized (Fig. 2). The PCR temperature profile used was 94°C (5 min), hot start followed by 94°C (1 min), 50°C (1 min), 72°C (2 min) for 30 cycles. The PCR products were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to X-Omat AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The subtracted cDNA libraries were next reconfigured such that unique primer sites flank the cDNA insert. This was accomplished by cloning the libraries into the trimming plasmid pTRIM14 using the EcoRI site within the libraries' linkers and the EcoRI site located 2 bp downstream of pTRIM14's trimming cassette (30Ariazi E.A. Gould M.N. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 446-451Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in deletion of 9 bp of the cDNA libraries' linker ends, allowing 12 bp to remain. Precise unidirectional deletions were then generated on one end of the subtracted cDNA libraries by three trimming cycles of 14 bp each. We followed the trimming cycle protocol as detailed elsewhere (30Ariazi E.A. Gould M.N. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 446-451Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In brief, pTRIM14's trimming cassette contains BseRI and BsgI recognition sites configured such that stepwise digestion first with BsgI and then BseRI produces cleavage of DNA 16/14 nucleotides distal and 4/2 nucleotides proximal, respectively, relative to the 3′ end of the cassette, thus conserving the trimming cassette but cutting into the 5′ end of the cDNA fragment. The trimming cycle continues by treatment with mung bean nuclease to remove single-stranded ends of the linearized DNA and finally re-circularization of the plasmids with T4 DNA ligase. Noteworthy, cDNA fragments that may contain BsgI or BseRI are not lost from the library since a portion of the cDNA fragment is retained. Additionally, this trimming procedure was shown to produce deletions with very high efficiency on a population of plasmids (30Ariazi E.A. Gould M.N. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 446-451Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). All PCR reactions were carried out using the following conditions unless otherwise stated. In a final reaction volume of 50 μl, PCR was performed using 200 μM of each dNTP, 400 nM of each primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA). The 1 × PCR buffer was composed of 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.001% (w/v) gelatin. All primers were synthesized at the Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI) unless otherwise stated. The subtracted and reconfigured cDNA libraries were displayed using sets of a fixed primer (5′-ATTACGAATTCGGACTA-3′) and 1 of 16 possible subpopulation primers (5′-GAGGAGGTGCAGTANN-3′), as determined by the specific combination of the two variable penultimate 3′ bases designated by NN (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). An explanation of these primer sequences is given under “Results.” The nucleotide concentration for PCR used was 20 μM of each dNTP plus 10 μCi of [α-35S]dATP, and the PCR temperature profile used was 94°C (5 min) hot start followed with 94°C (1 min), 59°C (1 min), 72°C (1 min) for 30 cycles and lastly 72°C (10 min) to ensure double-stranded cDNA. Labeled PCR products were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). These experiments were also performed in parallel by omitting the radiolabel and instead silver staining the gel (31Sanguinetti C.J. Dias Neto E. Simpson A.J. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 914-921PubMed Google Scholar) to visualize the bands directly, which greatly improves efficiency of band isolation. Unique bands were excised, eluted from the gel, and reamplified using the same fixed PCR primer and a modified subpopulation primer, or pan primer, that amplifies the entire cDNA population. The pan primer has two C bases and an EcoRI site (underlined) added to the 5′ end and the two terminal variable 3′ bases removed from the subpopulation primer (5′-CCGAATTCGAGGAGGTGCAGTA-3′). Isolated cDNA fragments were digested with EcoRI, subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the pSport1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformed by electroporation into Electromax Efficiency DH12S E. coli host cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). All subcloned cDNA fragments were sequenced using the M13/pUC forward primer and the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer), following the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing reaction products were resolved on an ABI PRISM Automated DNA Sequencer (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD). The monoterpene-induced gene (MIG) and monoterpene-repressed gene (MRG) sequences were compared to a non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base that includes sequences from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, GenBank, GenBank updates, EMBL, and EMBL updates using the BLAST algorithm at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (66006) Google Scholar). Relative RNA expression levels between regressing (10% limonene-treated) and non-regressing (control, not treated) mammary carcinomas were determined by competitive RT-PCR (33Araki N. Robinson F.D.

The competitive RT-PCR assay involved PCR of a target gene (i.e. a MIG/MRG cDNA) competing for amplification with its exogenously added MIMIC, and amplification of an internal standard (i.e. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) competing for amplification with its exogenously added MIMIC, for a total of 4 PCR products per sample. A MIMIC is a piece of heterologous DNA with flanking sequences identical to the primer sequences used for the target gene, such that a known amount of MIMIC is exogenously added, which competes for simultaneous co-amplification with a target gene. In essence, the competitive RT-PCR assay normalizes the MIG/MRG cDNA to an external control (MIG/MRG MIMIC) and to an internal GAPDH control, which itself was normalized to an external control (GAPDH MIMIC). After the target MIG/MRG expression for each sample was normalized, its expression level in each sample of the control and regressing carcinoma groups was averaged and compared in order to determine fold-induction or fold-repression. Statistical significance was calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. Relative RNA expression levels for lipocortin 1 (LC1), transforming growth factor β type II receptor (TGF-βIIR), and neuroligin 1 were determined by competitive RT-PCR. RNA was prepared from five individual regressing (10% limonene-treated) and five individual non-regressing (control, not treated) mammary carcinomas as described above. cDNA was generated using the 1st-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Primers were designed using Oligo 5.0 Primer Analysis software (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN), with the exception of the GAPDH primers (Clontech Laboratories). MIMICs were generated using the PCR MIMIC Construction kit (Clontech Laboratories). Generation of MIMICs involves a 1° PCR reaction using a composite primer, consisting of target gene or gene-specific primer sequence at the 5′ end and heterologous DNA primer sequence on the 3′ end. Next, an aliquot of the 1° PCR reaction was used as template in a 2° PCR reaction using only target gene or gene-specific primers. Primers and dNTPs were removed by passing the 2° PCR reaction over a Chromaspin-100 column (Clontech Laboratories) and the MIMIC was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis. Primer sequences and product sizes are given in Table I. In a reaction volume of 50 μl, the final concentration of exogenously added PCR MIMICs were 4.0 × 10−2 amol/μl of LC1 MIMIC, 8.0 × 10−5 amol/μl of TGF-βIIR MIMIC, 4.0 × 10−6 amol/μl of neuroligin 1 MIMIC, and 4.0 × 10−5 amol/μl GAPDH MIMIC 1 or GAPDH MIMIC 2. The PCR temperature profile used for all competitive RT-PCR experiments was 94°C (5 min) hot start followed by 94°C (1 min), 60°C (1 min), 72°C (2 min) for 30 cycles, with the exception of LC1, which required an annealing temperature of 58°C. PCR products were resolved on a 2% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). Primers were 5′ end-labeled with fluorescein during their synthesis, thereby allowing PCR product quantitation using a FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). An overview of the SD methodology is presented in Fig. 1. An evaluation of each aspect of this technology is presented below. The subtractive hybridization procedure developed by Wang and Brown (20Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) served to remove commonly expressed cDNA fragments and enrich those that are differentially expressed. The subtraction process involved initial fragmentation of the cDNA libraries with restriction endonucleases and ligation of 21-bp oligodeoxynucleotide linkers onto the cDNA fragment ends, thus allowing for a renewable source of cDNA by PCR. The monoterpene-treated derived cDNA (+cDNA) was subtracted against control, non-treated derived cDNA (−cDNA) to enrich for MIG. The inverse subtraction, control, non-treated cDNA subtracted against monoterpene-treated cDNA, was also performed to enrich for MRG. The cDNA libraries were subjected to cycles of alternating long (20 h) and short (2 h) hyb"

In transgenic mice fed a normal chow diet, low levels of apoE2 (<10 mg/dl) did not significantly alter the lipid phenotype. Mice expressing intermediate levels of apoE2 (10-30 mg/dl) had a 50-60% decrease in total cholesterol compared with nontransgenic mice. The decrease was almost entirely due to a reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These hypolipidemic apoE2 transgenic mice were cross-bred with human apoB transgenic mice, which have increased total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. The apoE2/apoB double transgenics revealed that expression of apoE2 on the background of human apoB overexpression resulted in a substantial decrease in LDL and HDL cholesterol and a corresponding accumulation of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL). Thus, the double transgenics had a lipid phenotype resembling human type III HLP. In contrast to the hypolipidemic mice, mice expressing high levels of apoE2 (>50 mg/dl) were hyperlipidemic. The VLDL and IDL in these mice were significantly increased and cholesterol-enriched and had other characteristics of remnant lipoproteins. Upon agarose gel electrophoresis, the VLDL and IDL from both intermediate and high expressers migrated more slowly toward the β position compared with the pre-β-mobility of nontransgenic mouse VLDL and IDL. Thus, depending on plasma apoE2 levels, the expression of human apoE2 in the transgenic mice leads to either a hypolipidemic or hyperlipidemic phenotype.

The hyperlipidemia is caused by the accumulation in plasma of abnormal lipoproteins, namely β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL), which are cholesterol-enriched remnant lipoproteins derived from both the intestine and liver (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (, eds),, pp.7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar).

There are three common isoforms of human apoE: apoE3, apoE2, and apoE4. They differ from one another by single amino acid substitutions at two sites in the protein, residues 112 and 158 (3Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Google Scholar, 7Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Taylor J.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1990; 1: 87-95Google Scholar). Of these isoforms, apoE2, with cysteine at both residues 112 and 158, is the only one that binds defectively to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (<2% of normal apoE3 binding activity) (8Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2518-2521Google Scholar). Type III HLP is associated with homozygous carriers of the apoE2 allele (for review, see Ref. 1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (, eds),, pp.7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar). Because virtually no individuals heterozygous for apoE2 have either type III HLP or β-VLDL (9Utermann G. Hees M. Steinmetz A. Nature. 1977; 269: 604-607Google Scholar), type III HLP appears to be a recessive trait. Furthermore, although 1% of the population is homozygous for apoE2 and although all apoE2 homozygotes have β-VLDL (primary dysbetalipoproteinemia) (10Utermann G. Vogelberg K.H. Steinmetz A. Schoenborn W. Pruin N. Jaeschke M. Hees M. Canzler H. Clin. Genet. 1979; 15: 37-62Google Scholar), only about 1-10% of these individuals ever have overt hyperlipidemia (type III HLP). This extremely low degree of penetrance for type III HLP indicates that other genetic or environmental factors are necessary for expression of the hyperlipidemia, a hypothesis originally put forth by Utermann (11Utermann G. Crepaldi G. Tiengo A. Baggio G. Diabetes, Obesity and Hyperlipidemias III (, eds), pp. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1985: 1-28Google Scholar). In fact, most subjects homozygous for apoE2 have hypocholesterolemia due to low levels of LDL cholesterol (12Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Google Scholar). The high density lipoproteins (HDL) in type III HLP patients homozygous for apoE2 are also somewhat decreased (13Havel R.J. Kotite L. Vigne J.-L. Kane J.P. Tun P. Phillips N. Chen G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1351-1362Google Scholar, 14Zhao S.-P. Smelt A.H.M. Van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Van Tol A. Vroom T.F.F.P. Leuven J.A.G. Van der Laarse A. Van't Hooft F.M. Clin.

Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1705-1716Google Scholar). Although some secondary factors, including obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes, high cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, low LDL receptor activity, and estrogen status, have been implicated in exacerbation of type III HLP, the mechanisms responsible for precipitating hypo- or hyperlipidemia are not entirely clear (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (, eds),, pp.7th Ed.

In most of these cases, heterozygosity for the rare variant apoE is sufficient for expression of type III HLP, indicating a dominant mode of transmission. Two rare apoE variants, apoE(Arg112,Cys142) and apoE-Leiden, were described in families in which type III HLP occurs (18de Knijff P. van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Leuven J.A.G.

All affected family members are heterozygous for either apoE(Arg112,Cys142) or apoE-Leiden (18de Knijff P. van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Leuven J.A.G. Demacker P.N.M. Kuyt L.P.

Recently, transgenic mice expressing apoE(Arg112,Cys142) were used to demonstrate that the high expression of apoE(Arg112,Cys142) led to spontaneous hyperlipidemia, the accumulation of β-VLDL in plasma, delayed clearance of remnant lipoproteins, and increased susceptibility to high fat diet-induced atherosclerosis (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar, 22Fazio S. Sanan D.A. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 1873-1879Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing high amounts of apoE-Leiden also had the spontaneous hyperlipidemia and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (23van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Hofker M.H. Krimpenfort P.J.A. de Bruijn I. van Vlijmen B. van der Boom H. Havekes L.M. Frants R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10540-10545Google Scholar, 24van Vlijmen B.J.M. van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M.

Thus, at least at high levels of apoE expression, these transgenic mice are good animal models for type III HLP and are yielding important information for our understanding of the mechanisms of this disorder. In the present study, human apoE2 was expressed in transgenic mice against an endogenous mouse apoE background 2Mouse apoE is like human apoE4 in that it has arginine at the position equivalent to residue 112, but it behaves like apoE3 in lipoprotein distribution preference because it lacks the crucial Arg61 equivalent (43Dong L.-M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Google Scholar), instead having threonine at this position. to see if the mice would demonstrate the characteri stics of type III HLP and, if so, whether transmission of the disorder was dominant or recessive. Our results show that apoE2 expression in transgenic mice leads to a hypolipidemic response at low or intermediate plasma apoE2 levels, but at very high plasma apoE2 levels, VLDL and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) accumulate in the plasma and resemble cholesterol-enriched remnant lipoproteins seen in human type III HLP. The ICR mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Plasmid pBSSK was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The Superose 6 column, purchased from Pharmacia, was used on a Pharmacia Fast Protein Chromatography system. The Centricon concentration filters (molecular weight cutoff = 10,000) were from Amicon (Lexington, MA). Cholesterol and triglyceride standards were from Abbott (North Chicago, IL) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. The automated system for lipid analysis (Kinetic Microplate Reader) was from Molecular Devices (Menlo Park, CA). All the reagents for lipoprotein agarose gels were from Ciba Corning (Palo Alto, CA). The ECL detection kit for Western blots was purchased from Amersham Life Science. The DNA construct used to generate transgenic mice was pHEG1LEcys158. It contained the complete human apoE2 gene together with 5 kb of its 5′-flanking sequence and 1.7 kb of its 3′-flanking sequence, which was ligated to a 3.8-kb downstream fragment containing the hepatic control region for this gene (25Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Google Scholar). In both transgenic mice and rabbits, this construct has yielded high expression of apoE in the liver, with little expression in any other tissue (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar, 25Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Google Scholar, 26Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were prepared by microinjection of the above construct into ICR embryos. At 4 weeks of age, the resulting mice were weaned and maintained on a normal chow diet. Analysis for presence of the transgene was performed by Southern blotting of 10 μg of tail DNA using a human apoE cDNA probe (27McLean J.W. Elshourbagy N.A. Chang D.J. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6498-6504Google Scholar) and by immunoblotting of 1 μl of plasma using a human-specific anti-apoE polyclonal antiserum (28Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Google Scholar). Transgene copy number was estimated by densitometric comparison with a Southern blot of an equivalent amount of DNA from HepG2 cells. In the Western blot assay, mouse apoE and human apoE2 were semi-quantitated by comparing the densitometry readings of the sample bands with those of different concentrations of purified mouse or human apoE. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Animal Research. Human apoE2/human apoB double-transgenic mice were created by mating heterozygous apoE2 transgenic mice (ICR) with heterozygous human apoB transgenic mice (C57BL) (29Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Google Scholar), resulting in litters composed of four different genotypes (apoB mice were generously provided by Dr. Stephen G. Young, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease). Transgene expression was assessed by Western blotting for both apoE2 and human apoB. Blood was collected from the tails of 6-10-week-old mice that had been fasted for 5 h. EDTA was used as an anticoagulant at a final concentration of 10 mM. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (microcentrifuge) for 10 min at 4°C, and samples were stored for no more than 2 days at 4°C in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) as a protease inhibitor. Lipoproteins in 100 μl of plasma were separated by chromatography on a Superose 6 column, as described previously (28Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Google Scholar, 30Horie Y. Fazio S. Westerlund J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Google Scholar). The major lipoprotein classes eluted from the column were pooled and concentrated using Centricon filters (fractions 16-18, VLDL; 19-22, IDL; 23-27, LDL and a subclass of HDL (HDL1); 28-33, HDL). For agarose gel electrophoresis, 2-μl aliquots of concentrated lipoproteins were separated on precast agarose gels (1%) for 40 min at 90 V. The gels were dried and stained with Fat Red 7B. In some cases, the pooled samples representing different lipoprotein classes were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by detection with either Coomassie staining (apoE2/mouse apoE content) or anti-human apoE immunoblotting (apoE2 distribution among various lipoproteins). Cholesterol and triglycerides in total plasma and in chromatographic fractions were measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method adapted for use with a microplate reader (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar, 30Horie Y. Fazio S. Westerlund J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Google Scholar). The cholesteryl ester content of VLDL and IDL was determined by subtracting the free cholesterol from the total cholesterol value. The HDL cholesterol concentrations were measured after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins by heparin/manganese chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The cholesterol in apoB-containing lipoproteins was calculated by subtracting the HDL cholesterol from the total cholesterol. Transgenic mice (F1) expressing different levels of apoE2 (3-60 mg/dl) were generated from four different founders that had apoE2 plasma concentrations of 5, 16, 27, and 46 mg/dl, respectively. Table I summarizes the plasma lipid levels in the F1 apoE2 transgenic mice. Low expression of apoE2 (<10 mg/dl) in male transgenic mice did not significantly alter the lipid values compared with those in nontransgenic mice. Low expressing female mice had slightly reduced total and HDL cholesterol. However, mice of both sexes expressing intermediate levels of apoE2 (10-30 mg/dl) had a significant hypolipidemia; total cholesterol (Table I), HDL cholesterol (Table I), and plasma apoA-I concentration (data not shown), were decreased 60%, 78%, and 60%, respectively, in male transgenic mice, and total and HDL cholesterol were decreased 50% and 66%, respectively, in female transgenic mice, compared with nontransgenic mice. Furthermore, in male mice expressing apoE2 at concentrations less than 20 mg/dl, apoE2 concentrations correlated negatively with plasma cholesterol (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, at levels of apoE2 above 20 mg/dl, there was a strong positive correlation between increasing apoE2 and plasma cholesterol (Fig. 1A). The correlation of apoE2 concentrations and plasma HDL cholesterol was similar (Fig. 1B), indicating that the profound hypolipidemia in the apoE2 transgenic mice was primarily reflected by a decrease in HDL cholesterol. The same phenomenon was also observed in female transgenic mice (data not shown).Table I.Lipid levels (mg/dl ± S.D.) in human apoE2 transgenic miceNontransgenicApoE2 transgenic<10 mg/dl apoE210-30 mg/dl apoE230-50 mg/dl apoE2>50 mg/dl apoE2Male(n = 42)(n = 14)(n = 22)(n = 16)(n = 6)ApoE28 ± 121 ± 637 ± 653 ± 3TC121 ± 11112 ± 2247 ± 14ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.76 ± 31152 ± 10bp < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice.TG53 ± 2360 ± 2033 ± 1539 ± 1747 ± 17HDL-C99 ± 1293 ± 1922 ± 13ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.36 ± 21ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.94 ± 19LpB-C21 ± 322 ± 426 ± 436 ± 1255 ± 4ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.Female(n = 37)(n = 15)(n = 32)(n = 15)ApoE27 ± 223 ± 536 ± 4TC92 ± 1874 ± 1549 ± 14ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.84 ± 24TG50 ± 1549 ± 1637 ± 1548 ± 22HDL-C71 ± 1852 ± 1624 ± 11ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.47 ± 17LpB-C19 ± 421 ± 325 ± 741 ± 8ap < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.a p < 0.01 compared with nontransgenic mice.b p < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice. Open table in a new tab Male mice expressing apoE2 > 50 mg/dl were hyperlipidemic, with a 30% increase in total cholesterol and a 160% increase in apoB-containing lipoproteins, but had normal HDL cholesterol levels (Table I). For female transgenic mice expressing >30 mg/dl of apoE2, total cholesterol was nearly normal, but HDL cholesterol was still lower than in nontransgenic mice. However, four female mice with apoE2 > 40 mg/dl had total cholesterol levels of 110 ± 8 mg/dl, which were 20% higher than those in the nontransgenic female mice. In addition, female mice expressing high apoE2 levels had a significant increase in apoB-containing lipoproteins. Fig. 2 shows more clearly the apoE2 levels in male and female transgenic mice required to yield high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Male transgenic mice expressing apoE2 at concentrations up to about 35-40 mg/dl had either normal or only slightly increased levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins compared with nontransgenic mice (Fig. 2A). However, at apoE2 levels above 40 mg/dl, there was a significant and almost stepwise increase in apoB-containing lipoproteins. A similar phenomenon was also observed in female transgenic mice, except that the stepwise increase in apoB-containing lipoproteins occurred at apoE2 concentrations above about 25-30 mg/dl (Fig. 2B). Plasma lipoproteins in male transgenic mice expressing different levels of apoE2 were analyzed on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 3). In contrast to a nontransgenic littermate, in which most of the cholesterol was in the HDL fractions (Fig. 3A), a transgenic mouse with an apoE2 concentration of 21 mg/dl had dramatic decreases in both total cholesterol and HDL and a slight increase in IDL (Fig. 3B). With the elevation of apoE2 to 33 mg/dl (Fig. 3C), VLDL and IDL were significantly increased, but total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels were still significantly lower than those of the nontransgenic mouse (Fig. 3A). At an apoE2 concentration of 56 mg/dl (Fig. 3D), the total cholesterol was significantly increased, and the HDL were in the normal range compared with the levels in the nontransgenic mouse, while VLDL and IDL were further elevated. Taken together, these results indicate that the increased apoB-containing lipoproteins in the high expressing apoE2 transgenic mice are mostly VLDL and IDL, and not LDL. Column fractions representing VLDL and IDL were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The nontransgenic plasma lipoproteins showed typical pre-β-migrating VLDL and a slightly slower migrating IDL. Likewise, the VLDL fraction from the intermediate expresser was pre-β-migrating, although the IDL fraction from the same mouse migrated more slowly toward the β position. Finally, the VLDL from the high expresser migrated more closely to the β position, and the IDL were truly β-migrating. Apolipoprotein E2 distribution among the various lipoprotein classes was analyzed for both intermediate (hypolipidemic) and high (hyperlipidemic) expresser male transgenic mice (Table II). In the hypolipidemic mice (total cholesterol, 41 ± 12 mg/dl), most of the apoE2 distributed in the HDL fraction, with lesser amounts in the LDL and HDL1 fractions and very little in the VLDL and IDL fractions. In contrast, the hyperlipidemic mice (total cholesterol, 150 ± 13 mg/dl) had relatively less apoE2 in the HDL fraction but almost 3 times more apoE2 in the VLDL and IDL fractions than the hypolipidemic mice.Table IIApolipoprotein E2 distribution (percent ± S.D.) in various lipoproteins of human apoE2 transgenic male miceVLDLIDLLDL + HDL1HDLHypolipidemic4 ± 14 ± 226 ± 366 ± 3(n = 4)Hyperlipidemic12 ± 211 ± 437 ± 341 ± 3(n = 4) Open table in a new tab The VLDL and IDL from both intermediate and high expressers were characterized in more detail to see if they had properties of remnant lipoproteins (Table III). Densitometric scanning of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel indicated that the ratio of apoE2 to mouse apoE (human and mouse apoE can be distinguished by a slight difference in molecular weight; Ref. 21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar) was about 2:1 in the VLDL of the intermediate expressers and increased to 3:1 in the high expressers. Interestingly, this ratio was the same in the VLDL and IDL. In both intermediate (hypolipidemic) and high (hyperlipidemic) expressers, the cholesterol to triglyceride ratio was substantially higher than in nontransgenic mice, an indication of the presence of remnant lipoproteins. The cholesterol to triglyceride ratios in the VLDL and IDL were also significantly higher in the hyperlipidemic high expressers than in the hypolipidemic intermediate expressers (Table III). Both species of apoB, apoB100 and apoB48, were present in the IDL (VLDL apoB was not analyzed) from either normal or transgenic mice, but densitometric scanning revealed that the ratio of apoB48 to apoB100 in the IDL was significantly higher in the intermediate expressers than in nontransgenic mice, and the increase was even more pronounced in the high expressers (Table III). Although mice are different from humans in that both apoB100 and apoB48 are produced by the mouse liver (31Scott J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1990; 1: 96-103Google Scholar), the increased apoB48/apoB100 ratio in the transgenic mice suggested accumulation of apoB48-containing remnant lipoproteins, as occurs in humans with type III HLP.Table III.Chemical compositions of VLDL and IDL from apoE2 transgenic male miceVLDLIDLApoE2/mouse apoETC/TGApoE2/mouse apoETC/TGApoB48/apoB100Nontransgenic00.06 ± 0.0200.40 ± 0.040.84 ± 0.04(n = 3)Hypolipidemic2.19 ± 0.720.31 ± 0.06ap < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice.2.18 ± 0.610.50 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice.1.58 ± 0.10ap < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice.(n = 4)Hyperlipidemic3.43 ± 0.610.55 ± 0.08bp < 0.001 compared with nontransgenic mice.,cp < 0.01 compared with hypolipidemic mice.3.30 ± 0.640.72 ± 0.05b,c3.01 ± 0.55ax,dp < 0.05 compared with hypolipidemic mice.(n = 3)a p < 0.05 compared with nontransgenic mice.b p < 0.001 compared with nontransgenic mice.c p < 0.01 compared with hypolipidemic mice.d p < 0.05 compared with hypolipidemic mice. Open table in a new tab One of the characteristics of homozygous apoE2 humans is reduced LDL levels (16Mahley R.W. Angelin B. Adv. Intern. Med. 1984; 29: 385-411Google Scholar). In mice, LDL cholesterol accounts for less than 15% of total cholesterol, and the plasma apoB concentration is very low (10-15 mg/dl) (29Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Google Scholar). Therefore, we cross-bred heterozygous apoE2 intermediate-expresser (hypolipidemic) transgenic mice with heterozygous human apoB transgenic mice (whose human apoB plasma concentration was about 50 mg/dl; Ref. 29Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Google Scholar) to see whether apoE2 expression in transgenic mice would also lower LDL levels significantly. All four expected genotypes were obtained from the crosses (Table IV). As before, intermediate apoE2 expression resulted in a significant decrease in total cholesterol compared with the level in nontransgenic mice. In addition, as expected (29Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Google Scholar), total cholesterol and LDL were elevated in both male and female apoB transgenic mice (Table IV). Interestingly, the total cholesterol was significantly lower in both male and female double-transgenic mice than in the apoB transgenic mice. Triglyceride levels were significantly higher in both apoB transgenic and double-transgenic mice than in apoE2 transgenic mice.Table IV.Lipid levels (mg/dl ± S.D.) in nontransgenic (NonTg) and transgenic human apoE2 (E2 Tg), human apoB (B Tg), or double-transgenic (E2 + B Tg) miceTotal cholesterolTriglyceridesNonTgE2 TgB TgE2 + B TgNonTgE2 TgB TgE2 + B TgMale(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 3)111 ± 353 ± 4141 ± 690 ± 8a,b51 ± 536 ± 3123 ± 9bp < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice.149 ± 7bp < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice.Female(n = 4)(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 5)(n = 4)(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 5)88 ± 556 ± 7126 ± 485 ± 10ap < 0.01 compared with human apoB transgenic mice.,bp < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice.49 ± 932 ± 6120 ± 11bp < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice.122 ± 14bp < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice.a p < 0.01 compared with human apoB transgenic mice.b p < 0.01 compared with human apoE2 transgenic mice. Open table in a new tab The lipoprotein profiles of these mice were also analyzed by Superose 6 chromatography (Fig. 5). By comparison to the apoE2 transgenic mouse (Fig. 5B), apoB overexpression on the background of apoE2 resulted in a significant increase of VLDL and IDL, which were relatively cholesterol enriched (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, compared with the human apoB transgenic mouse (Fig. 5C), apoE2 expression on the background of human apoB (Fig. 5D) led to a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol, while VLDL and especially IDL increased. The HDL cholesterol was also significantly decreased. These double-transgenic mice have a lipoprotein profile very similar to that of patients with type III HLP. We have generated transgenic mice that express different levels (3-60 mg/dl) of human apoE2 (i.e. apoE2(Arg158→ Cys)). On a normal chow diet, mice expressing intermediate levels of apoE2 (10-30 mg/dl) on a background of endogenous mouse apoE (6-10 mg/dl) have a very significant hypolipidemia due to a dramatic decrease in HDL cholesterol. In contrast, mice expressing high plasma levels of apoE2 (≥50 mg/dl or about 5-8-fold higher than endogenous mouse apoE) are somewhat hyperlipidemic and have significant increases in VLDL and IDL. These lipoproteins have characteristics of remnant lipoproteins, the major metabolic abnormality in human type III HLP. The apoE2-expressing transgenic mice have characteristics of type III HLP at the highest plasma levels of apoE2 but do not accumulate VLDL and IDL at lower apoE2 levels, which indicates that the type III HLP characteristics in these mice are transmitted recessively. At the lower ratios of apoE2 to endogenous mouse apoE (3:1 and below), the mice are similar to apoE3/2 human heterozygotes. These individuals do not accumulate remnant lipoproteins (10Utermann G. Vogelberg K.H. Steinmetz A. Schoenborn W. Pruin N. Jaeschke M. Hees M. Canzler H. Clin. Genet. 1979; 15: 37-62Google Scholar, 11Utermann G. Crepaldi G. Tiengo A. Baggio G. Diabetes, Obesity and Hyperlipidemias III (, eds), pp. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1985: 1-28Google Scholar), and neither do the transgenic mice. At higher ratios (5:1 or greater), the situation is analogous (but not identical) to apoE2/2 homozygosity (i.e. a preponderance of apoE2 and accumulation of VLDL/IDL remnants in their plasma). Furthermore, when human apoB is also overexpressed, as in the apoE2/apoB double transgenics, remnant accumulation is even more pronounced, occurring at lower apoE2 levels than without apoB overexpression, and is comparable to that of the higher apoE2 expressers (compare Fig. 5D (apoE2 = 29 mg/dl) to Fig. 3C (apoE2 = 33 mg/dl) and Fig. 3D (apoE2 = 56 mg/dl)). The transgenic mice expressing human apoE2 on an endogenous mouse apoE background are similar to the apoE(Arg112,Cys142) transgenic mice produced previously (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar) in that both develop characteristics of type III HLP at the higher expression levels, but they are different in that the apoE(Arg112,Cys142) mice develop a more severe hyperlipidemia and do so at lower levels of transgene expression. This likely reflects the association of apoE(Arg112,Cys142) with dominant transmission of type III HLP in humans (19Havel R.J. Kotite L. Kane J.P. Tun P. Bersot T. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 379-387Google Scholar, 20Rall Jr., S.C. Newhouse Y.M. Clarke H.R.G. Weisgraber K.H. McCarthy B.J. Mahley R.W. Bersot T.P. J. Clin.

In addition, the β-VLDL of the apoE(Arg112,Cys142) mice were much more triglyceride-rich than the remnants in the apoE2 mice, and there were substantially fewer IDL. This may reflect the previously suggested possibility that a lipolytic processing defect is associated with apoE(Arg112,Cys142) (20Rall Jr., S.C. Newhouse Y.M. Clarke H.R.G. Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Google Scholar). The decrease and subsequent increase in HDL levels as a function of apoE2 plasma levels in the transgenic mice is intriguing. Because this phenomenon apparently does not occur in transgenic mice expressing rat apoE (32Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Shimada M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Murase T. Fukazawa C. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1750-1754Google Scholar), human apoE3 (33de Silva H.V. Lauer S.J. Wang J. Simonet W.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1542-1552Google Scholar), apoE(Arg112,Cys142) (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Google Scholar), or apoE-Leiden (23van den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M. Hofker M.H. Krimpenfort P.J.A. de Bruijn I. van Vlijmen B. van der Boom H. Havekes L.M. Frants R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10540-10545Google Scholar), it is very likely that the severe HDL-lowering effect is specific for human apoE2. It is unclear why the HDL levels decrease in the intermediate-expressing mice. One possibility is that moderate concentrations of apoE2 may interact with endogenous mouse apoE or other apolipoproteins to disrupt the formation of HDL or alter the particles in such a way that they are rapidly cleared. Precedence for such an event comes from studies of transgenic mice expressing human apoA-I, in which the transgenic human apoA-I disrupts the formation of murine apoA-I-containing HDL and alters the HDL particle size and composition (35Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y. Clift S.M. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 434-438Google Scholar, 36Golder-Novoselsky E. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20787-20790Google Scholar). If such an interaction is responsible for the hypo-HDL response in apoE2 transgenic mice, it should disappear in apoE2 mice in which the endogenous mouse apoE has been eliminated. We are currently crossing our apoE2 transgenic mice with apoE-null mice as the next step in our analysis of the effects of apoE2 expression in transgenic mice (see below). The presence of apoE2 in transgenic mouse HDL may directly or indirectly stimulate the clearance of these particles through an as yet unknown pathway. One possibility is that mouse HDL, which unlike human HDL normally contain an abundance of apoE (37de Silva H.V. Más-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Google Scholar), are utilizing the LDL receptor-related protein pathway that has up to now only been shown to catabolize apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins (38Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Google Scholar, 39Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. He D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 39-52Google Scholar). Another possibility is that enrichment of mouse HDL with apoE2 may affect lipolysis by hepatic lipase, which circulates in mice (40Peterson J. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 65-70Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E2 has less of a stimulatory effect on human hepatic lipase in vitro (41Thuren T. Wilcox R.W. Sisson P. Waite M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4853-4861Google Scholar, 42Thuren T. Weisgraber K.H. Sisson P. Waite M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2332-2338Google Scholar), which could result in abnormal metabolism/remodeling of mouse HDL. A more detailed characterization of the relationship of apoE2, mouse HDL, hepatic lipase, and the LDL receptor-related protein pathway by in vitro approaches is under way in our laboratory. Humans homozygous for apoE2 have low LDL levels (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (, eds),, pp.7th Ed.

Med. 1984; 29: 385-411Google Scholar). This phenomenon is also apparent in the double-transgenic mice expressing both apoE2 and human apoB, in which apoB-containing lipoproteins contribute significantly to cholesterol metabolism. This result indicates that the double-transgenic mice will be useful for studying factors that lead to low LDL in type III HLP (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (, eds),, pp.7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 12Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Google Scholar, 16Mahley R.W. Angelin B. Adv. Intern. Med. 1984; 29: 385-411Google Scholar). The double-transgenic mice can also be cross-bred with apoE-null mice to eliminate the endogenous background so that the low LDL effects can be studied under the conditions of “true” homozygosity. Although the transgenic mice in the current study expressing the highest apoE2 levels (about 8-fold higher than endogenous apoE) are, in effect, homozygous for apoE2, elimination of this background will allow more complete studies of the hyperlipidemia induced by apoE2 expression.

Incubation of oocytes expressing either the human or turkey P2Y1 receptor with adenine nucleotide agonists resulted in an increase in Cl− current and activation of a novel cation current with an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. Activation of either the human P2Y2 (P2U-purinergic) or M1 muscarinic receptor expressed in oocytes resulted in an increase in Cl− current similar to that observed in P2Y1 receptor-expressing oocytes but had no effect on cation current. P2 receptor agonists stimulated both the cation current and Cl− current in P2Y1 receptor-expressing oocytes with EC50 values and an order of potency (2-methylthioadenosine diphosphate > 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2MeSATP) > ATP > UTP) that were similar to those previously observed for activation of phospholipase C in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the human or turkey P2Y1 receptor. The P2Y receptor antagonists suramin and pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid both shifted to the right the concentration-response relationship for 2MeSATP for stimulation of oocyte currents. Although injection of oocytes with either GDPβS (guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate) or GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) resulted in loss of adenine nucleotide-promoted Cl− channel activation, neither guanine nucleotide altered the 2MeSATP-stimulated cation current. These data are consistent with the view that activation of the novel cation current by the P2Y1 receptor does not involve a G protein. Tail current analysis of the novel P2Y1 receptor-associated cation conductance revealed that the open channel current-voltage relationship was outwardly rectifying with a reversal potential of −38 mV for the turkey P2Y1 receptor and −36 mV for the human P2Y1 receptor. Replacement of Na+ with K+ ions in the bathing solution produced a shift in reversal potential to near zero mV, but significant outward rectification remained. The cation current was not permeable to either Ca2+ or Ba2+ and exhibited steady-state inactivation at holding potentials below −60 mV.

https://openalex.org/W2068068578,"A yeast mutant, cdg1, was isolated on the basis of an inositol excretion phenotype. This mutant exhibited pleiotropic deficiencies in phospholipid biosynthesis, including reduced levels of CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) synthase activity (Klig, L. S., Homann, M. J., Kohlwein, S. D., Kelley, M. J., Henry, S. A., and Carman, G. M. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170, 1878-1886). In this study we present evidence that the molecular basis for the inositol excretion phenotype is a G305/A305 point mutation (Cys102→ Tyr substitution) within the CDS1 gene (encodes CDP-DAG synthase) of this mutant. Expression of CDP-DAG synthase activity from a plasmid-borne copy of the CDS1 gene in the cdg1 mutant was not down-regulated, and this expression also corrected the inositol excretion phenotype.

Expression of CDS1* in a single copy in the cdg1 mutant raised CDP-DAG synthase activity from 15 to 30% of derepressed wild-type yeast levels but still did not correct the inositol excretion phenotype. CDP-DAG synthase activity was not regulated in response to precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis in the cdg1 mutant either with or without a trans copy of the CDS1* gene.

Besides being an early precursor to the formation of phosphoinositide derivatives in yeast, CDP-DAG may play a regulatory role in their formation and thereby may be important in the control of cell growth in this organism (7Nickels J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Google Scholar). In yeast, CDP-DAG synthase activity is found predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (8Kuchler K. Daum G. Paltauf F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 901-910Google Scholar, 9Kelley M.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14563-14570Google Scholar), although it has been reported in the plasma membrane and post-Golgi secretory vesicles (7Nickels J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14563-14570Google Scholar), is composed of two subunits, and has a native molecular mass of 114 kDa (9Kelley M.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

CDP-DAG synthase activity is regulated by water-soluble precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis. Inclusion of inositol in growth medium reduces synthase activity, and this repressive effect is enhanced by the addition of ethanolamine or choline (12Homann M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1265-1266Google Scholar). The CDP-DAG synthase activity also decreases as cells enter the stationary phase in inositol-containing medium (13Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Gaynor P.M.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 533-539Google Scholar). diacylglycerol phosphatidylserine phosphatidylinostol polymerase chain reaction complete synthetic medium uracil base pair kilobase inositol 1-phosphate synthase. A yeast mutant (cdg1) was isolated on the basis of an inositol excretion phenotype (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). This mutant exhibited pleiotropic deficiencies in phospholipid biosynthesis, including a reduced rate of CDP-DAG synthesis, an elevated phosphatidic acid content, constitutive levels of inositol 1-phosphate synthase, and elevated phosphatidylserine (PS) synthase protein and activity. Biochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed that the defect in in vivo CDP-DAG synthase activity in the cdg1 mutant was due to a reduced level of the 56-kDa CDP-DAG synthase subunit rather than to an alteration in the enzymological properties of the enzyme. Genetic analysis indicated that a defect in a single gene was responsible for the mutant phenotype, and this gene was not allelic to any previously described genetic locus involved in phospholipid synthesis or regulation. Since no regulatory gene products had been identified in yeast that exhibited simultaneous negative and positive regulation of different parts of the phospholipid biosynthetic machinery, as appears to be affected in the cdg1 mutant, Klig et al. (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar) argued that it is unlikely that the mutation in cdg1 is in a regulatory process. One possibility suggested was that this lesion might be in one of multiple copies of the structural gene(s) encoding CDP-DAG synthase activity, but their data were not sufficient to rule out the possibility that the mutation is in a regulatory gene the product of which controls expression of several phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes (3Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Google Scholar, 5Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Google Scholar). The CDS1 gene encoding CDP-DAG synthase has been isolated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar) based on its sequence homology with CDP-DAG synthases from Escherichia coli (16Icho T. Sparrow C.P. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12078-12083Google Scholar) and Drosophila (17Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Google Scholar). A UASINO regulatory sequence is found in the 5′-untranslated region of the CDS1 gene. This unique sequence serves as a binding site for INO2 and INO4 gene products and thus mediates coordinated regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic gene expression (1Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar, 18Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Google Scholar, 19Nikoloff D.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7402-7411Google Scholar), which may explain the decreased level of CDP-DAG synthase activity when yeast cells are supplied with inositol, choline, and ethanolamine in growth medium (12Homann M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1265-1266Google Scholar). The CDS1 gene encodes the majority, if not all, of the CDP-DAG synthase activity in yeast. A null cds1 mutant is incapable of spore germination or vegetative growth. Overexpression of CDP-DAG synthase activity results in an elevation in the apparent initial rate of synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) relative to PS. A reduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity to 10% of the wild-type yeast level has an opposite effect on the above phospholipid biosynthesis. Reduced synthase levels also result in inositol excretion, a phenotype similar to that of the cdg1 mutant. Complete repression of a single copy GAL1 promoter-driven CDS1 gene in a cds1-null background results in arrest of cell growth. Therefore, all evidence is consistent with a single gene locus in yeast encoding CDP-DAG synthase activity, making the mutated locus in the cdg1 mutant either allelic with CDS1 or a regulatory gene. Given the dramatic effect this mutation has on regulation of phospholipid metabolism in yeast, it is important to determine the molecular basis for these perturbations. In this report, we examine the relationship between CDS1 and the mutation in cdg1 cells. We present evidence that overexpression of CDP-DAG synthase activity complements the cdg1 mutant phenotype and that a G305/A305 point mutation in the CDS1 locus (CDS1*) is responsible for the cdg1 phenotype. By introducing a single copy number plasmid bearing the mutant CDS1* gene in a cds1-null background, we reconstituted a cell with the properties of the cdg1 mutant. We also report that in addition to reduction of in vivo CDP-DAG activity, overproduction of an open reading frame upstream of CDS1 also results in inositol efflux into the growth medium.

All the above media were supplemented with 2% agar (yeast) or 1.5% agar (E. coli) for preparation of agar plates.Table I.Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or PlasmidRevelant characteristicsSource or Ref.E. coliDH5αΦ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169, endA1, recA1, hsdR17 (r − k m , deoR, thi-1, supE44, λ-gyrA96, relA122YeastYPH102α ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, leu2-Δ1, his-Δ20023YSD90Aα cds1::TRP1, ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2101, his-Δ200, leu2-Δ1,15cdg1a cdg1, leu214MC13α ino1-13, lys2, can124PlasmidspBluescriptIIKSCloning vector, ampRStratageneYEp13LEU2 ampR tetR 2μ circle ColE1 origin25YEp30aContains four additional yeast open reading frames.CDS1, derivative of YEp1315pYES2PGAL1 URA3 ampR 2μ circle ColE1 originInvitrogenpSDG1PGAL1-CDS1, derivative of pYES215YEpGALLEU2 ampR 2μ circle PGAL1 PGAL10J.

Open table in a new tab Chromosomal DNA was prepared as described previously (29Ferbeyre G. Villareal A. Morales J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 386Google Scholar, 30Fujimura H. Sakuma Y. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 538-539Google Scholar). PCR was performed after optimizing conditions as described by Innis and Gelfand (31Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar). Amplification of the CDS1 gene from yeast chromosomal DNA and plasmids used the following primers: primer 1 (5′-TTGTCTAGACACCCAATCCACCGAG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-CCGGTCTAGATCAAGAGTGATTGGTCAATG-3′). They were designed according to the DNA sequence of the CDS1 open reading frame and its promoter region (GenBank number Z35898 [GenBank]); primer 1 begins 670 bp 5′ to the CDS1 start codon, and the underlined codon in primer 2 indicates the stop codon for the CDS1 open reading frame. Plasmid DNA was purified by using the Wizard 373 kit (Promega), and reactions were performed by the Taq Dye-deoxy Terminator (Applied Biosystems) method and run on an Applied Biosystems Sequenator. All plasmids were derivatives of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and were sequenced by using the t7 and t3 primers and specific primers derived from the determined sequence. Sequence analysis was carried out with the Pileup program in the Genetics Computer Group (32Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). Plasmids (LEU2) carrying the CDS1 or CDS1* gene under the regulation of its endogenous promoter were introduced into the cds1-null mutant YSD90A by plasmid shuffling (33Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Google Scholar). Briefly, strain YSD90A/pSDG1 (URA3 on plasmid but requiring leucine) was transformed with a LEU2-containing plasmid and plated on CSM-Leu plates with glucose as carbon source. Colonies formed on CSM-Leu plates were screened for loss of plasmid pSDG1 by lack of growth on CSM-URA plates with galactose as a carbon source. Preparation of the membrane fraction was modified from our previous report (15Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar). All cell fractionation procedures were carried out at 4°C. Yeast cell transformants were grown to the exponential phase of growth in the appropriate CSM nutrient dropout medium to select for the plasmid and either 2% glucose or galactose as indicated. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 20 mM Tris-maleate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same buffer. The cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of prechilled silicon beads (diameter, 0.3 mm) and disrupted in a Mini-Beadbeater™ (Biospec Products) by three 30-s bursts at 2,800 rpm with a 5-min pause between bursts. Silicon beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min. The total membrane fraction was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was suspended in 20 mM Tris-maleate, pH 7.0. CDP-DAG synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabel into CDP-DAG in 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mM [5-3H]CTP (9,000 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mM phosphatidic acid, and 50 μg membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (11Carman G.M. Kelley M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 242-247Google Scholar). PS synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabel into PS in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.6 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM CDP-DAG, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5 mML-[3-3H]serine (10,000 cpm/nmol), and 75 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (34Carman G.M. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Google Scholar). PI synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of 0.5 mM myo-[2-3H]inositol (10,000 cpm/nmol) into PI in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM CDP-DAG, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 75 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (21Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 30°C for either 5 min (CDP-DAG synthase) or 20 min (PS and PI synthases). The inositol excretion capacity of yeast strains was tested on CSM-Leu or CSM-Ura plates lacking inositol, choline, and ethanolamine as reported previously (35Janitor M. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 307-312Google Scholar) using growth of the inositol auxotrophic reporter strain MC13 (ino1) (24Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Google Scholar). The yeast strain to be tested was patched onto the tester plate lacking inositol, choline, and ethanolamine and permitted to grow for 24 h. The inositol auxotrophic reporter strain was then dilution streaked away from the patch as described previously (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar, 36McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6861-6868Google Scholar), and cross-feeding was scored after an additional 48-h incubation. Multi-copy number plasmids bearing the CDS1 gene were transformed into wild-type yeast YPH102, the cds1-null mutant YSD90A, and the cdg1 mutant (Table II). Introduction of genomic clone YEp30 (multicopy plasmid; Fig. 1), which carries two open reading frames 5′ and two open reading frames 3′ to the CDS1 gene, resulted in overproduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity in the above mutants to the same level as in the wild-type strain. Surprisingly, this plasmid did not correct the inositol excretion phenotype of the mutants. In addition, growth of YEp30 transformants of the wild-type strain on galactose resulted in low but distinct inositol excretion. Induction of PGAL1-CDS1 gene expression on pSDG1 in the cds1 null mutant and in the cdg1 mutant by growth on galactose not only brought about overproduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity to levels in excess of that in wild-type cells (strain YHP102 alone) but also corrected their inositol excretion phenotype. The pSDG1 transformant of the cds1-null mutant, when grown in a noninduction medium (in the presence of glucose) had only 10% CDP-DAG synthase activity relative to wild-type yeast. Under repressed conditions for CDS1 expression, it also excreted inositol into growth medium, as previously reported (15Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar). A correlation between inositol excretion and CDP-DAG synthase activity raised the possibility that CDS1 and the mutated gene in the cdg1 mutant are allelic, but suppression of inositol excretion by expression of CDS1 from the GAL1 promoter but apparently not from its own promoter remained unresolved.Table IIOverexpression of CDP-DAG synthase activity and correction of inositol excretion in yeastStrainPlasmidCarbon sourceCDS activityInositol excretionnmol/min/mgYPH102NoneGlucose0.43−cdg1NoneGlucose0.09+YPH102YEp30Glucose4.6−cdg1YEp30Glucose4.4+YSD90AYEp30Glucose4.2+YPH102pSDG1Galactose5.0−cdg1pSDG1Galactose5.4−YSD90ApSDG1Galactose4.8−YSD90ApSDG1Glucose0.04+YPH102pSD10Glucose4.5−cdg1pSD10Glucose4.3−YSD90ApSD10Glucose4.4−YPH102pSD20Glucose1.1−cdg1pSD20Glucose0.62−YSD90ApSD20Glucose0.50−YSD90ApSDG1, pSD30Galactose2.8+YSD90ApSD40Glucose4.5− Open table in a new tab To study the discrepancy in the results between transformants with either plasmid pSDG1 or YEp30, plasmid pSD10 was constructed, which excluded the two open reading frames on both sides of the CDS1 gene in the genomic clone (Fig. 1). The cds1 (YSD90A) and cdg1 mutants bearing pSD10 (CDS1 expressed from its own promoter) had similar levels of overexpression of the CDP-DAG synthase activities as the YEp30 transformants of both the mutants and the wild-type cells. However, the pSD10 transformants did not excrete inositol. An autonomously replicating sequence-centromere sequence plasmid (single copy plasmid), pSD20, which carries CDS1 expressed from its normal promoter, was introduced into YPH102, the cdg1 mutant, and the cds1 null strain. This single copy plasmid contributed a similar amount of additional synthase activity (0.67, 0.53, and 0.50 nmol/min/mg, respectively) to each of these three strains. Therefore, there appears to be no repression of expression in a cdg1 mutant of a single copy of the CDS1 gene expressed from its own promoter and carried in trans, and simple restoration of synthase activity to wild-type levels is sufficient to prevent inositol excretion. To understand the inositol excretion phenotype caused by YEp30, the DNA fragment in the genomic clone was further digested to yield a 3.8-kb NheI-PstI fragment and a 5.3-kb PstI-SalI fragment, which were subcloned into vector YEpGAL to yield plasmids pSD30 and pSD40, respectively (Fig. 1). Growth of the cds1-null mutant containing plasmid pSD40 on glucose resulted in overproduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity but not excretion of inositol (Table II). Plasmid pSD30 contains the two upstream open reading frames YBR0314 and YBR0315 but lacks the CDS1 gene. Gene YBR0315 encodes the ribosomal protein L2B (37Presutti C. Ciafre S.A. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2215-2221Google Scholar). The gene product of YBR0314 does not show significant homology with the known sequences in GenBank by BLAST search (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Introduction of plasmid pSD30 into strain YSD90A/pSDG1 reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity by 42%, but synthase activity was still 6-fold greater than wild-type yeast levels (Table II), yet the cells excreted inositol. The reduction of CDS1 overexpression was possibly due to a reduced copy number for plasmid pSDG1 resulting from the introduction of the 2μ plasmid pSD30, since yeast cells regulate the total number of 2μ plasmids (39Rine J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 239-251Google Scholar). The 3.8-kb DNA fragment was further digested to yield a 2-kb PvuII fragment containing the open reading frame YBR0314 and 83 bp of its 5′-region, which was subcloned into YEpGAL (Fig. 1). This plasmid, pSD50, when transformed into YSD90A/pSDG1, caused inositol excretion in the presence of galactose but qualitatively less than that from the pSD30 transformant. It is possible that the 83-bp endogenous 5′-region in this construct was not long enough for efficient YBR0314 expression. Thus, the inositol excretion phenotype of YEp30 transformants appears to be due to multiple copies of YBR0314 carried in trans. -Both a CDP-DAG synthase functional assay and correction of the inositol excretion phenotype indicated that the cdg1 phenotype was caused by a decreased level of CDP-DAG synthase activity inside the cell. However, the functional assay data clearly indicated that expression of CDS1 in the cdg1 mutant was not repressed (Table II), thereby excluding the possibility that a mutant regulatory gene caused reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity in the cdg1 mutant. Since CDS1 encodes the majority, if not all, of CDP-DAG synthase activity (15Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar), and a defect in a single gene is responsible for the mutant phenotype (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar), a reasonable explanation for the cdg1 phenotype would be a mutation either within the CDS1 gene or in its upstream regulatory region. Three independent PCR reactions were carried out to synthesize a 2-kb DNA fragment including the CDS1 gene and its 5′-promoter region by using genomic DNA from the cdg1 mutant as a template, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCR products were then subcloned into the pBluescript vector, and the constructs were amplified in E. coli. Plasmids from two individual colonies of each of the PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. A G/A point mutation located 305 bp downstream of the initiation codon was found in all six plasmids sequenced (Fig. 2). As controls, PCR reactions using genomic DNA of YPH102 wild-type cells as a template were also carried out, and their products were sequenced. None of the products showed a G305/A305 mutation. Thus, a G305/A305 mutation exists in the CDS1 gene of the cdg1 mutant. This point mutation causes a Cys102→ Tyr substitution at the interphase between a hydrophobic and hydrophilic region (40Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) of the CDP-DAG synthase. A 626-bp PstI-Nru I fragment in pSD20 was replaced with a DNA fragment from the same region in the above PCR product derived from cdg1 cells to create plasmid pSD20* containing the mutant CDS1* gene. Except for a G305/A305 mutation, the rest of the DNA in pSD20* was identical with that of pSD20 as checked by DNA sequencing. Both pSD20 and pSD20* were introduced into the cds1-null mutant YSD90A by plasmid shuffling as described under “Experimental Procedures” and into the cdg1 mutant. As controls, YPH102 and cdg1 were transformed with the YCpGAL vector. The above transformants were grown in complete synthetic medium with or without inositol and choline where indicated. Membrane extracts were prepared from the above cells, and the activities of CDP-DAG synthase, PS synthase, and PI synthase were measured. As expected, the specific activity of CDP-DAG synthase in the cdg1 mutant was 15% of the level found in YPH102 when inositol and choline were not supplied in growth medium, and inositol and choline repressed the activity in wild-type cells but had no effect on the already low synthase activity in the mutant (Fig. 3). A single copy of CDS1 in trans to the null chromosomal cds1 gene (YSD90A/pSD20) resulted in the same pattern of CDP-DAG synthase activity regulation as in YPH102, whereas placing the CDS1* gene in trans (YSD90A/pSD20*) mimicked the cdg1 mutant. When CDS1 was in trans to the chromosomal mutation in the cdg1 gene (cdg1/pSD20), the CDP-DAG synthase activities were higher than that for YPH102 under both derepressed and repressed growth conditions, consistent with a higher level of activity expressed from the combination of the wild-type CDS1 gene and the CDS1 gene in the cdg1 mutant, but there was still significant repression by inositol and choline. However, when CDS1* was trans to the mutation in the cdg1 strain (cdg1/pSD20*), the level of synthase activity was double that of the cdg1 mutant strain with no plasmid copy of CDS*, but there was no repression by inositol and choline, consistent with duplication of a mutated CDS1 gene. The total activity in the strain was still only 30% of wild-type levels, which appears to be too low to correct the phenotype brought about by reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity. PS synthase activity was also regulated by inositol and choline both in wild-type yeast and in the cdg1 mutant (Fig. 4). Overall, PS synthase activities (under both derepressed and repressed conditions) were higher than wild-type levels in all strains lacking a wild-type copy of the CDS1, including the cdg1 strain with CDS1*. Strains expressing at least one copy of the wild-type CDS1 gene resembled strain YPH102 in the levels of PS synthase activity. PI synthase-specific activity was unaffected by additions of inositol and choline to the growth medium in all of these strains, including YPH102 (data not shown), which is consistent with the mutation in the cdg1 strain having no effect on PI synthase activity (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). Functional assays showed that CDP-DAG synthase and PS synthase activities of YSD90A/pSD20 resembled wild-type yeast, whereas those of YSD90A/pSD20* resembled the cdg1 mutant. The inositol excretion phenotype also follows the level of CDP-DAG synthase activity of the various strains. Strains expressing the wild-type CDS1 gene, resulting in normal or elevated levels of CDP-DAG synthase activity (Fig. 5, B, D, and F), do not cross-feed the inositol auxotrophic tester strain. Those strains carrying only cdg1 or CDS1* or both cdg1 and CDS1* (Fig. 5, A, C, and E) cross-feed the tester strain. The common determinant in all of the strains excreting inositol is reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity. Pleiotropic deficiencies of the cdg1 mutant raised interesting questions as to the role in phospholipid biosynthesis and regulation of the mutated gene in this strain. Several lines of evidence suggested that the mutated locus might not be allelic with CDS1, and that the mutation was either in a regulatory element (3Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Google Scholar, 5Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Google Scholar), or in a second copy of the CDS gene (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). Identification of the molecular basis for the cdg1 phenotype should extend the understanding of the factors regulating phospholipid metabolism in yeast. Cloning of the CDS1 gene made it possible to determine whether a mutated locus in the cdg1 mutant is allelic with CDS1, is another structure gene, or is a novel regulator of phospholipid metabolism. The following evidence supports the first possibility. Plasmids bearing a copy of the CDS1 gene could be fully expressed in the cdg1 mutant to the same extent as in wild-type cells. The increased CDP-DAG synthase activity in the cdg1 mutant background also corrected the inositol excretion phenotype of the mutant. The CDS1 locus in the cdg1 mutant was found to contain a G305/A305 single base substitution. Introduction of this mutation into an otherwise wild-type CDS1 gene expressed from its own promoter from a single copy plasmid in a cds1-null background resulted in CDP-DAG synthase, PS synthase, and PI synthase activities with properties similar to those in the cdg1 mutant. As in the cdg1 mutant, expression of CDP-DAG synthase activity from the mutant CDS1* gene on the plasmid was no longer regulated by precursors to phospholipid biosynthesis. This transformant also excreted inositol into growth medium, a pleiotropic deficiency typical of the cdg1 mutant. The common determinant of the cdg1 phenotype is a 70% or greater reduction in the level of CDP-DAG synthase activity due to either a mutation in the CDS1 gene or reduced gene expression. The defect in CDP-DAG synthase activity in the cdg1 mutant was previously correlated with a reduced level of synthase-specific antigen rather than with an alteration in the enzymological properties of the enzyme (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). This reduction in the gene product could be due to either reduced transcription and translation of the mutant gene or reduced stability of the mutant protein product. The fact that a mutation within the CDS1 gene resulting in reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity causes pleiotropic changes in phospholipid biosynthesis brings about interesting issues as to the role of CDP-diacylglycerol and its synthase in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast. From the combined results on the cdg1 phenotype, a decrease in CDP-DAG synthase activity is sufficient to dramatically affect the regulation of the phospholipid biosynthetic system, including elevated levels of PS synthase activity, constitutive expression of inositol 1-phosphate synthase, lack of response to inositol plus choline in the growth medium, and excretion of inositol (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that PS synthase activity is inversely related to the PI/PS ratio in the membrane. An increase of the PI/PS ratio from 2:1 to 8:1 reduced PS synthase activity to 50% of its original level (41Hromy J.M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15572-15576Google Scholar). When CDS1 gene expression is regulated through a GAL1 promoter, there is a proportional relationship between the PI/PS ratio and the level of CDP-DAG synthase activity (15Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar). A 40% reduction in PI content was observed as a result of a 75% decrease of CDP-DAG synthase activity in the cdg1 mutant, whereas PS levels were barely changed compared with the wild-type yeast (14Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar). Thus, a decrease of the PI/PS ratio as a secondary effect of a reduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity may partly contribute to the elevated PS synthase activity in cells bearing a mutant CDS1* gene either in the chromosome (cdg1 mutant) or on the covering plasmid (pSD20* in the cds1-null mutant). However, PS synthase may also be regulated by posttranslational modification, since phosphorylation of the 23-kDa PS synthase subunit affects its activity (42Kinney A.J. Carman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7962-7966Google Scholar, 43Kinney A.J. Bae-Lee M. Panghaal S.S. Kelley M.J. Gaynor P.M. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1133-1136Google Scholar). Alternatively, expression of the gene encoding PS synthase may be derepressed at low cellular CDP-DAG synthase levels, as is INO1 (inositol 1-phosphate synthase) expression in some mutants of phospholipid metabolism. Constitutive expression of INO1 causes inositol excretion, the opi phenotype (44Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Google Scholar), which has been found in a series of mutants involved in synthesis of the aminophospholipids and inositol uptake (36McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6861-6868Google Scholar, 45Letts V.A. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 560-567Google Scholar, 46Henry S.A. Klig L.S. Loewy B.S. Annu. Rev.

Low cellular CDP-DAG synthase in cdg1 and CDS1* mutants may affect the biosynthesis of the aminophospholipids due to the limited amount of CDP-DAG available for de novo synthesis and consequently may result in derepression of INO1 gene expression. Preliminary results indicate that INO1 expression is enhanced at low CDP-DAG synthase levels in the cds1-null mutant, which can be reversed by CDS1 overexpression from a covering plasmid. 2H. Shen and W. Dowhan, unpublished data. Therefore, the molecular basis for the lack of down-regulation of CDP-DAG synthase and PS synthase activities by the presence of inositol and choline in the growth medium of the cdg1 and CDS1* mutants appears to be a result of interruption of aminophospholipid biosynthesis and/or constitutive INO1 expression (1Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar, 46Henry S.A. Klig L.S. Loewy B.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 207-231Google Scholar). The initial observation that genomic clone YEp30 resulted in overexpression of CDP-DAG synthase in all strains but did not correct the inositol excretion phenotype in the cdg1 mutant and caused excretion in wild-type cells grown on galactose lead to the identification of an open reading frame 5′ to the CDS1 locus YBR0314, which results in inositol excretion when present in multiple copies. No information is available as to the possible functions of this gene locus. The inositol excretion phenotype has been associated with mutations in inositol and phospholipid metabolism but never with multiple copies of normal yeast genes (36McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6861-6868Google Scholar, 44Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Google Scholar, 45Letts V.A. Henry S.A. J.

Deletion of a gene fragment between −1000 and −600 with respect to the start of transcription resulted in a 60% decrease in luciferase activity. Further reduction, close to background level, occurred upon deletion of a 90-base pair sequence between −123 and −34. Reporter plasmids with the liver glucokinase promoter and any length of flanking sequence were minimally active in INS-1 insulinoma cells, and conversely reporters with the β-cell-specific promoter were ineffective in primary hepatocytes. In FTO-2B hepatoma cells, a differentiated line expressing many liver-specific traits but not the endogenous glucokinase gene, the promoter proximal region between −123 and −34 markedly stimulated the expression of transfected plasmids above background. However, addition of the flanking region up to −1000 inhibited luciferase expression. The gene fragment from −1003 to −707 was shown to be a bona fide, hepatocyte-specific enhancer by the following criteria: 1) it stimulated reporter expression by more than 10- and 5-fold when inserted directly upstream of the glucokinase TATA box or complete promoter, respectively, regardless of orientation; 2) it stimulated gene expression from the heterologous SV 40 promoter 4-fold; 3) it was also effective from a downstream position; and 4) in contrast to the enhancer effect in primary hepatocytes, the sequence acted as a silencer in FTO-2B cells and was neutral in INS-1 cells. Both the promoter proximal and the enhancer regions were marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites in the chromatin of primary hepatocytes but not hepatoma or insulinoma cells. Seven footprinted elements termed A through G were mapped in the enhancer by the in vitro DNase I protection assay. Elements A-C may bind liver enriched factors, because they were not protected by spleen nuclear extract. In hepatocyte transfection, the downstream half of the enhancer containing elements A-C was about half as effective as the complete enhancer in stimulating glucokinase promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of element A virtually abrogated the activity of the half-enhancer, whereas mutation of element C had a more moderate effect. The sequence between −732 and −578 upstream of the liver start of transcription in the human glucokinase gene displays 79% sequence identity with the downstream half of the rat enhancer. The human gene fragment ligated to the minimal rat liver glucokinase promoter was shown to work as an enhancer in the hepatocyte transfection system. Glucokinase gene regions that are important for liver specific expression of the enzyme have been functionally identified using transient transfection of rat hepatocytes. Maximal luciferase activity was elicited by a reporter plasmid with 3.4 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA flanking the liver glucokinase promoter.

The human gene fragment ligated to the minimal rat liver glucokinase promoter was shown to work as an enhancer in the hepatocyte transfection system. The mammalian glucokinase gene is a dual promoter transcription unit. Transcription can initiate at either one of two widely separated start sites, which are used in a mutually exclusive fashion in different cell types (1Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15936-15942Google Scholar). The upstream promoter, termed the β-cell promoter, is active primarily in β-cells of the pancreatic islets and in rare cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, thyroid, and central nervous system. Short term transfection and transgenic mice experiments have indicated that a promoter proximal region of 300 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kpbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. of DNA upstream of the start site is necessary and sufficient for directing glucokinase gene expression in the above cell types (2Shelton K.D. Franklin A.J. Khoor A. Beechem J. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4578-4589Google Scholar, 3Jetton T.L. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Google Scholar). The downstream promoter, designated the liver promoter, is known to be active only in hepatocytes (4Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.-R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7838-7842Google Scholar). The genomic elements governing the function of the liver promoter have not been identified. base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. Several genes referred to as “liver-specific” are transcribed exclusively or preferentially in the liver (5Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 256-259Google Scholar). However, the hepatic expression of the glucokinase gene incorporates a number of added features not generally found in the liver-specific genes taken as a group, suggesting that particularly complex regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription might operate (6Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 1-13Google Scholar). The glucokinase gene is not transcribed in the fetal or neonatal liver, mRNA and enzyme appearing only at weaning time (7Iynedjian P.B. Ucla C. Mach B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6032-6038Google Scholar). Glucokinase is also known to be lost in the process of liver carcinogenesis (8Klimek F. Bannasch P. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1857-1861Google Scholar). Glucokinase expression is thus restricted to mature, fully differentiated hepatocytes. In addition, liver transcription of the gene is dependent on the hormonal status of the animal, as shown by its complete repression in the insulin-deprived diabetic animal or in primary hepatocytes cultured without insulin, and its induction upon insulin treatment or addition to the culture medium (9Iynedjian P.B. Gjinovci A. Renold A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 740-744Google Scholar, 10Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21824-21829Google Scholar, 11Iynedjian P.B. Marie S. Gjinovci A. Genin B. Deng S.-P. Buhler L. Morel P. Mentha G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1966-1973Google Scholar). In order to understand these properties, it is necessary to identify gene regions harboring regulatory cis-acting DNA elements and subsequently the trans-acting factors binding to such elements. The purpose of this work was to identify DNA elements responsible for the cell type specificity of the liver glucokinase promoter. A systematic transfection study of the promoter and flanking DNA is presented. Transient expression of reporter gene plasmids was monitored in primary rat hepatocytes and hepatoma and insulinoma cells. The functional data from the transfection system were correlated with the mapping of cell type-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in chromatin and the identification of cis-acting elements using the in vitro DNase I footprinting assay. Two rat genomic libraries in the EMBL 3 and Charon 4A vectors respectively (Clontech) were the source of DNA for the entire glucokinase gene including regions flanking the two promoters and the 3′ end of the gene. Four clones were isolated in our laboratory, and another was the generous gift of Dr. Christopher B. Newgard, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Restriction fragments were subcloned in the pBluescript or pUC vectors, and subfragments were used for the construction of reporter plasmids and as probes. An approximately 400-bp BamHI-HinfI (blunted) genomic fragment containing the liver promoter was initially ligated to the BamHI and BglII (blunted) sites of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid pBLCAT3 (12Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar) to generate pGK-400-CAT. This plasmid was digested with BamHI, and a 1-kbp BglII-BamHI genomic fragment was inserted in the sense orientation to obtain pGK-1400-CAT. Fragments XbaI (blunted)-XhoI from pGK-1400-CAT and pGK-400-CAT were subsequently transferred to the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2 Basic (Promega) cut with SmaI and XhoI, yielding plasmids pGK-1400-Luc and pGK-400-Luc. Plasmid pGK-1100-Luc was constructed by cloning a 1100-bp BstXI (blunted)-XhoI fragment from pGK-1400-Luc in the pGL2 vector cut with SmaI and XhoI. Similarly, a 1000-bp NdeI (blunted)-XhoI fragment from pGK-1400 Luc and a 700 bp fragment AflII (blunted)- XhoI fragment from pGK-1400-Luc were ligated in the pGL2 Basic vector digested with SmaI plus XhoI to yield plasmid pGK-1000-Luc and pGK-700-Luc, respectively. Plasmids pGK-230-Luc and pGK-200-Luc were generated from pGK-400-Luc using Exonuclease III digestion. Plasmid pGK-120-Luc was constructed by inserting a 132-bp DNA fragment synthesized by PCR and digested with BglII and KpnI in the corresponding sites of pGL2 Basic. The 5′ end points of the glucokinase gene sequence were nucleotides −1447 in pGK-1400-Luc, −1017 in pGK-1100-Luc, −915 in pGK-1000-Luc, −586 in pGK-700-Luc, −310 in pGK-400-Luc, −147 in pGK-230-Luc, −123 in pGK-200-Luc, and −34 in pGK-120-Luc, position −1 being the nucleotide preceding the liver start of transcription. The 3′ end point in all plasmids was position +79. An additional set of three deletion plasmids was constructed using another firefly luciferase vector called p0-Luc (13Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Plasmid p0-GK-3400-Luc was obtained by subcloning a 3.4-kbp fragment of the glucokinase gene extending from a genomic HindIII site at approximately −3300 to the HinfI site at +79 upstream of the luciferase gene. Except for the vector backbone, plasmids p0-GK-1400-Luc and p0-GK-400-Luc were otherwise similar to pGK-1400-Luc and pGK-400-Luc. The glucokinase enhancer genomic sequence from nucleotides −1003 to −707 with SmaI sites added at both ends was synthesized by PCR, digested with SmaI, and ligated in both orientations into the SmaI site upstream of the glucokinase promoter in pGK-120-Luc to generate p-enhancer-GK-120-Luc and p-(r)enhancer-GK-120-Luc. The fragment was similarly inserted upstream of the simian virus 40 early promoter in plasmid pGL2 Promoter (Promega) to generate p-enhancer-SV-Luc and p-(r)enhancer-SV-Luc. The enhancer fragment was also subcloned in the SmaI site of the vector pBluescript KS+, providing pB-enhancer. A BamHI-SalI fragment from pB-enhancer was inserted in the cognate sites of pGK-120-Luc and p-SV-Luc downstream of the luciferase gene to construct pGK-120-Luc-enhancer and p-SV-Luc-enhancer, respectively. The glucokinase promoter from −123 to +79 was ligated as a HindIII- XhoI fragment in pB-enhancer; the complete enhancer-promoter fragment was excised by digestion with SacI plus XhoI and was transferred to pGL2 Basic, yielding p-enhancer-GK-200-Luc. The 3′ half of the enhancer was obtained from the above plasmid as a BstEII-SmaI fragment. After blunting the BstEII end, the approximately 150-bp fragment was subcloned in the SmaI site of GK-120-Luc to obtain plasmids CBA-GK-120-Luc. A plasmid with the homologous human sequence was constructed with a DNA fragment generated by PCR, followed by SmaI digestion. The primers were 5′-TTCCCCGGGAGTGATCACTCTGGCCATTG-3′ and 5′-TTCCCCGGGCTCACCTGGGAGTGACATCC-3′, and the template was blood genomic DNA from a nondiabetic subject. The 3′ part of the rat enhancer from nucleotides −812 to −708 with added XbaI and EcoRI sites was synthesized by PCR and inserted in a Bluescript KS+ plasmid in which the glucokinase promoter sequence from −123 to +79 had been subcloned between the HindIII and XhoI sites. The SacI-XhoI fragment from the above plasmid was transferred to the pGL2 Basic to generate p-CBA-GK-200-Luc. Plasmids with block mutations in elements A and C were constructed in similar fashion using mutagenic primers. The DNA fragment with block mutation in the internal element B was synthesized with a single mutagenic primer by a two-step PCR procedure, the product from the first reaction serving as “megaprimer” in the second reaction, essentially as described (14Perrin S. Gilliland G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7433-7438Google Scholar, 15Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Google Scholar). Sequence details on the block mutations are given in Fig. 5. The nucleotide sequence of all DNA inserts generated by PCR or exonuclease III digestion was verified by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase polymerase. Molecular cloning methods were performed according to Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For isolation of hepatocytes, the livers of adult male Wistar rats fasted for 48 h before the experiments were perfused with collagenase as specified previously (17Salavert A. Iynedjian P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13404-13412Google Scholar). Cells were dispersed in 80 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% newborn calf serum. The cells were centrifuged at 23 × gmax and 2°C for 3 min and washed twice in 100 ml of the same medium and once in 50 ml of a solution termed electroporation buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.15, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM glucose, and 20 amino acids at concentrations similar to the rat plasma concentrations. The final cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold electroporation buffer supplemented with 300 μg/μl sonicated salmon testes DNA to provide a cell density of 15 × 106 viable cells/ml and 0.8-ml samples of cell suspension were pipetted into electroporation cuvettes with an electrode gap of 4 mm. Plasmids were added in amounts of 20 μg of pGL2 Basic or equimolar amounts of GK-Luc plasmids. For co-transfection, 3 μg of plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (pCMVβ, Clontech) were added, and the cuvettes were placed in ice for 5 min. The cells were carefully resuspended by manual shaking and electroporated with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at a capacitance of 960 μF and voltage of 250 V. The cuvettes were returned to ice for 10 min. Cells from the cuvettes were then transferred to tubes containing 4.3 ml of RPMI 1640 plus antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum and samples of 0.510 ml of cell suspension (1.5 × 106 cells) were pipetted into wells of 6-well culture dishes (Falcon Primaria) containing 3 ml of the above medium. After 3 h of culture in a CO2 incubator, the medium was replaced by a medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 10−8M dexamethasone. Culture was continued for 20 h before cell harvest for measurements of luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities. Rat hepatoma cells of the FTO-2B line (18Killary A.M. Fournier R.E.K. Cell. 1984; 38: 523-534Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum in T75 culture flasks (Falcon). When cells reached 50-60% confluence, they were fed fresh medium and harvested by trypsinization 20 h later. The cells were washed once in culture medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and once in 50 ml of ice-cold electroporation buffer with centrifugations at 90 × gmax for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 300 μg/μl salmon testes DNA. The cells were electroporated as described above, except that voltage was 260 V. The electroporated cells were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 3 × 106 cells/well and allowed to attach for 3 h. The culture medium was then replaced by fresh medium, and culture continued for 20 h prior to harvest for reporter enzyme assays. Rat insulinoma cells of the INS-1 line (19Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar) were cultured as described (20Marie S. Diaz-Guerra M.-J. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Iynedjian P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23881-23890Google Scholar). One day after being fed fresh medium, cells at 50-60% confluence were harvested from T75 flasks by trypsinization, washed twice in culture medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, and suspended in culture medium at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Samples of 3 ml of cell suspension were transferred to tubes containing calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates formed with 10 μg of plasmid essentially as described by Kingston et al. (21Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). The tube contents were mixed by inversion and plated into 6-well culture dishes. Extracts of nontransfected INS-1 cells were found to have a high background in the β-galactosidase assay, making the co-transfection of pCMVβ impracticable as a test of transfection efficiency. In each experiment, duplicate transfection mixtures were formed with each individual plasmid and plated in duplicate wells. The cells were cultured for 5 h in presence of the precipitate, washed twice with serum-free medium, fed 3 ml of medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and cultured for 20 h prior to harvest for assay of luciferase activity. Separate cell extracts were obtained from duplicate wells to monitor the reproducibility of the transfection efficiency. Replicates generally varied by less than 10%. For reporter enzyme assays, cell monolayers were washed twice with 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 0.16 ml of a lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris/phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM diaminocyclohexane-tetraacetic acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged in a microfuge for 5 s, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was assayed using the Bio-Rad reagent. The extracts were then adjusted to a fixed protein concentration and stored in ice until assayed for enzyme activities. The luciferase assay was performed by adding to 30 μl of cell extract, 150 μl of a reagent containing 20 mM Tricine, pH 7.8, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33 mM dithiothreitol, 530 μM ATP, 270 μM CoA, and 300 μM firefly luciferin (22Promega Corporation, (1993) Technical Bulletin 101: Luciferase Assay System, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). The sample was immediately mixed by inversion and introduced in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 8100 or LS 6500), and light emission was measured in the single photon mode for 1 min. Cell extracts were used undiluted or diluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin to provide an input of 20-60 μg of protein/30 μl. The background recorded with extracts from nontransfected cells was subtracted from measurements with transfected samples. The same extracts were used for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity by a chemiluminescent assay (23Jain V. Magrath I. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Google Scholar) using commercially available reagents (Galacto-Light, Tropix). The assay was performed using 0.15-1 μg of protein from primary hepatocytes and 0.1 μg of protein from FTO-2B cells. The incubation time was comprised between 40 and 60 min. Light emission was measured as above and a blank with nontransfected extracts was subtracted from gross counts. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from rat liver and spleen as described by Gorski et al. (24Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Google Scholar) and Maire et al. (25Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Google Scholar). Because transcription of the glucokinase gene is markedly stimulated by glucose refeeding after a fast, nuclei were isolated from animals that had been deprived of food for 40 h and given an oral glucose load 2 h before killing. Probes were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and aliquots containing 16,000-30,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA were added to reaction mixes containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.7, 48 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 0.08 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 5-15 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 24 μl. The mixtures were allowed to stand in ice for 30 min before addition of 0.1-0.3 unit DNase I depending on the nuclear protein input. Digestion with this enzyme was carried out at 4°C for 3 min and terminated by adding 80 μl of a solution containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 6 μg of sonicated salmon testes DNA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K. After a 45-min incubation at 50°C, DNA was phenol extracted and ethanol was precipitated. Products were analyzed on 6% acrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gels. The protected elements were mapped by reference to the migration of Maxam-Gilbert sequencing products. Cultured rat hepatocytes, hepatoma FTO-2B cells, and insulinoma INS-1 cells were analyzed for DNase I hypersensitive sites in the glucokinase gene using the method of Stewart et al. (26Stewart A.F. Reik A. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3157Google Scholar). Cell monolayers in 10-cm culture dishes were washed at room temperature with PBS and overlayered with 4 ml of a solution containing 15 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 M sucrose, DNase I (Boehringer, Grade I) at concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 units/ml as specified in the figure legends and Nonidet Nonidet P-40 at 0.3% for primary hepatocytes and 0.2% for the cell lines. Two dishes were used for each DNase I concentration. The DNase I solution was aspirated after 3.5-min incubation at room temperature, and digestion was terminated at 4 min by the addition of 3 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.2 μg/ml proteinase K. Digestion with this enzyme was done at 50°C for 5 h with intermittent agitation. The lysates from duplicate dishes were pooled and extracted with phenol-chloroform and the nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol in presence of 2.5 M NH4 acetate. The samples were digested with RNase A, extracted once with phenol-chloroform and once with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was digested with a restriction enzyme for 5 h, phenol extracted, and precipitated. The DNA was dissolved in TE buffer, its concentration was measured, and samples of 25 μg of DNA were electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels 20 cm in length. Southern transfer to nylon membranes by electroblotting and hybridization to short DNA probes for indirect end-labeling were performed by standard techniques. The size of DNA fragments was calibrated with HindIII and EcoRI-digested λ DNA Mr markers. For accurate mapping of the hypersensitive sites with respect to internal restriction sites, samples of DNase I-digested DNA that had been cut with two endonucleases were run alongside the test samples. Outside of the gene regions described under “Results,” the following restriction fragments, with their position relative to the liver promoter, were analyzed and found to harbor no hypersensitive sites: HindIII from −14 to −7 kbp, BamHI from +3 to +13 kbp, and EcoRI from +12 to +17.5 kbp. Hepatoma cell lines that have generally been used for transfection studies of genes transcribed in liver do not express the endogenous glucokinase gene. We therefore decided to use primary hepatocytes as target cells for transient transfection studies. Preliminary experiments using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene showed that the glucokinase promoter and 5′ flanking DNA did not consistently elicit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity above background after transfection by either calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation or lipofection. In our hands, the only method allowing to quantify glucokinase promoter activity in a reliable manner has been the electroporation procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” combined with the use of firefly luciferase reporter plasmids. Luciferase activity after transfection of reporter plasmids driven by the liver glucokinase promoter and upstream sequence is shown in Fig. 1. Maximal luciferase activity was observed with a construct including 3.4 kbp of flanking sequence and was maintained at similar levels in constructs comprising 1.4 and 1.1 kbp of sequence upstream of the promoter. Deletion of the next 400 bp resulted in a 3-fold decrease in luciferase expression, delineating the region between −1017 (5′ end point in plasmid GK-1100-Luc) and −586 (5′ end point in plasmid GK-700-Luc) as a potential enhancer. Reporter activity was little affected by further sequence deletion down to position −123 (plasmid GK-200-Luc). Deletion of the next 90 bp to position −34 (plasmid GK-120-Luc) was accompanied by a pronounced drop of expression, residual luciferase activity being only marginally above the background level noted with the promoterless luciferase vector (GL2 Basic plasmid). Thus, the 100-bp region directly upstream of the TATA box homology (TATTT from nucleotides −29 to −25) is essential for liver glucokinase promoter activity. In order to test the cell type specificity of the effects described above, comparative transfection experiments were performed with primary rat hepatocytes, INS-1 insulinoma cells, and FTO-2B hepatoma cells. Experiments in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2A) demonstrated that the expected drop in luciferase activity when plasmid GK-400-Luc was compared with GK-1400-Luc and the sharp decrease in activity between GK-200-Luc and GK-120-Luc. Moreover, a plasmid with the β-cell glucokinase promoter, plasmid βGK-400-Luc, was unable to elicit luciferase expression in the hepatocytes. Conversely, this plasmid was active when transfected in INS-1 cells, whereas all the constructs driven by the liver promoter and flanking sequence displayed only marginal luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). In FTO-2B hepatoma cells, luciferase activity was background with the minimal liver promoter construct GK-120-Luc and maximal with plasmid GK-200-Luc. Inclusion of the genomic sequence containing the putative enhancer identified in primary hepatocytes did not further augment but on the contrary resulted in a significant 2-fold decrease in reporter gene expression (compare plasmid GK-400-Luc with GK 1400-Luc) (Fig. 2C). Thus, both the promoter proximal region and the upstream putative enhancer contribute to the cell type-dependent activity of the liver glucokinase promoter, but the upstream enhancer appears more specific in that its function is restricted to normal hepatocytes. The remainder of this work focuses on the function of the upstream regulatory region. The ability of the upstream region to function as a enhancer was further tested by ligating a DNA fragment spanning positions −1003 to −707 upstream of the homologous glucokinase promoter or a heterologous promoter, namely the viral SV40 196-bp early promoter. With respect to the homologous promoter, plasmids were constructed both with the complete promoter in GK-200-Luc and the minimal promoter in GK-120-Luc. For some of the constructs, the test fragment was investigated in both orientations and also in a 3′ position downstream of the luciferase coding region.

https://openalex.org/W2006491932,"Rek (retina-expressed kinase) has been identified as a putative novel receptor-type tyrosine kinase of the Axl/Tyro3 family with a potential role in neural cell development. rek clones were isolated from a chick embryonic brain cDNA library with a DNA probe obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of mRNA from Müller glia-like cells cultured from chick embryonic retina. Sequence analysis indicated that Rek is a protein of 873 amino acids with an extracellular region composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two fibronectin type III domains with eight predicted N-glycosylation sites. Two consensus src homology 2 domain binding sites are present in the cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that Rek activates several signal transduction pathways. Northern analysis of rek mRNA revealed a 5.5-kilobase transcript in chick brain, retina, and kidney and in primary cultures of retinal Müller glia-like cells. Rek protein was identified by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as a 140-kDa protein expressed in the chick retina at embryonic days 6-13, which corresponded to the major period of neuronal and glial differentiation. Transfection of rek cDNA into COS cells resulted in transient expression of a putative precursor of 106 kDa that autophosphorylated in immune complex protein kinase assays. Overexpression of rek cDNA in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts resulted in activation of the 140-kDa rek kinase and induction of morphologically transformed foci. These properties indicated that Rek has oncogenic potential when overexpressed, but its normal function is likely to be related to cell-cell recognition events governing the differentiation or proliferation of neural cells.

Receptor tyrosine kinases are widely expressed in the developing nervous system, where they play important roles in development of neurons and glia (1Maness P.F. Cox M.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 117-126Google Scholar). Upon binding of membrane-bound or diffusable ligands to their extracellular domains, these enzymes autophosphorylate on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2src homology 2Igimmunoglobulin-likeFNfibronectinPCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRIPAradioimmune precipitation assayRLBRek lysis bufferEGFepidermal growth factor. domain-containing signal transduction proteins. In the developing fly eye, the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the sevenless gene is activated by a neighboring cell surface protein encoded by the boss gene (2Kramer H. Cagan R.L. Zipursky S.L. Nature. 1991; 352: 207-212Google Scholar), causing precursor cells to differentiate into photoreceptors (3Hafen E. Basler K. Edstrom J.-E. Rubin G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 55-63Google Scholar, 4Tomlinson, A., Ready, D. F., (1987) 123, 264–275.Google Scholar). In vertebrates, activation of receptor tyrosine kinases of the trk family by nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4/5 induces differentiation and survival of different neuronal populations (5Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 262-268Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, glial growth factor/heregulin causes multipotent neural crest progenitors to differentiate into glia rather than neurons (6Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M. McBurney R.N. Waterfield M.D. Stroobant P. Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Google Scholar) by activating the erbB2/c-neu/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase in the presence of the erbB4/HER4 tyrosine kinase (7Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S.

Receptor tyrosine kinases were initially identified as homologs of retroviral oncogene products (8Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 521-527Google Scholar); thus, it is not surprising that mutations in proto-oncogenes that result in constitutive activation of normal receptor tyrosine kinases render these proteins oncogenic. Such activating mutations can occur within the coding region of the extracellular domain, for example in the retroviral oncogene v-erbB (8Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 521-527Google Scholar) and trk/nerve growth factor receptor gene (9Martin-Zanca D. Hughes S.H. Barbacid M. Nature. 1986; 319: 743-748Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mutation can be an amino acid substitution in the transmembrane region, as shown for the erbB/c-neu/HER2 gene in chemically induced rat glioblastomas (10Bargmann C.I. Hung M.-C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Google Scholar). Another means by which a receptor tyrosine kinase can become constitutively activated is by overexpression, which may result in forced receptor dimerization within the plasma membrane (11Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar). This is one mechanism that may contribute to the deregulation of growth in glial cell tumors. For example, the erbB2/c-neu/HER2 gene is overexpressed in certain human glioblastomas (12Schwechheimer K. Laufle R.M. Schmahl W. Knodlseder M. Fisher H. Hofler H. Hum. Pathol. 1994; 25: 772-780Google Scholar), while the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, c-erbB, is amplified to various degrees in human glioblastomas with the highest levels of expression correlating with poor prognosis (13Libermann T.A. Nusbaum H.R. Razon N. Kris R. Lax I. Soreq H. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1985; 313: 144-147Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the developing neural retina is unusually active in Müller glia (14Sorge L.K. Levy B.T. Maness P.F. Cell. 1984; 36: 249-257Google Scholar, 15Ingraham C.A. Cooke M.P. Chuang Y.-N. Perlmutter R.M. Maness P.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 95-100Google Scholar, 16Shores C.G. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 59-66Google Scholar, 17Biscardi J.S. Shores C.G. Maness P.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 1121-1128Google Scholar). The Müller glial cell is the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate eye, where its chief function is to buffer the microenvironment following neuronal firing (18Newman E.A. Federoff S. Vernadakis A. The Müller Cell in Astrocytes. Vol. 1. Academic Press, London1986: 149-171Google Scholar). The normally quiescent Müller cell proliferates in an unregulated manner in several pathological situations, including retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and macular pucker (19Wiedemann P. Survey Opthalmol. 1992; 36: 373-384Google Scholar). At least one receptor tyrosine kinase, the basic fibroblast growth factor receptor, is up-regulated in Müller glia that have been induced to proliferate in animal models of injury (20Lewis G.P. Erickson P.A. Guerin C.J. Anderson D.H. Fisher S.K. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3968-3978Google Scholar). Müller glia and all types of retinal neurons differentiate from a common progenitor by a poorly understood process that depends on growth factors and other local environmental cues such as cell-cell contact (21Turner D.L. Cepko C.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 131-136Google Scholar, 22Wetts R. Fraser S.E. Science. 1988; 239: 1142-1145Google Scholar, 23Anchan R.M. Reh T.A. Angello J. Balliet A. Walker M. Neuron. 1991; 6: 923-936Google Scholar). Because receptor tyrosine kinases are important in growth factor and cell contact recognition, it is likely that they regulate retinal cell differentiation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the developing chick retina increases strikingly during the period of differentiation of retinal neurons and Müller glia and is most abundant in regions where Müller glial processes contact their neighbors (16Shores C.G. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 59-66Google Scholar, 17Biscardi J.S. Shores C.G. Maness P.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 1121-1128Google Scholar, 24Biscardi J.S. Cooper N.G.F. Maness P.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 281-289Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy of the outer chick retina with phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that phosphotyrosine-modified proteins accumulate predominantly in Müller glia and that they are located in the Müller glial plasma membrane at sites of contact with adjacent Müller glial processes and photoreceptors (24Biscardi J.S. Cooper N.G.F. Maness P.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 281-289Google Scholar). To identify protein-tyrosine kinases that might be responsible for the elevated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in developing Müller cells, we used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific to highly conserved regions shared within the catalytic domain of receptor and nonreceptor-class protein-tyrosine kinases to amplify partial cDNAs encoding tyrosine kinases expressed in Müller glia-enriched cultures from embryonic chick retina. Such an approach has been used with success to identify novel tyrosine kinase genes expressed in nonneural as well as neural cells (25Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Google Scholar, 26Lai C. Lemke G. Neuron. 1991; 6: 691-704Google Scholar). Here we describe the discovery of a novel receptor-type tyrosine kinase, termed Rek (retina-expressed kinase), a new member of the Axl/Tyro3 family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The Axl/Tyro 3 family includes receptor tyrosine kinases encoded by axl (ufo, ark) (27O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prodop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S.

Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10720-10728Google Scholar), c-eyk (34Jia R. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1839-1844Google Scholar), and c-mer (35Graham D.K. Dawson T.L. Mullaney D.L. Snodgrass H.R. Earp H.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657Google Scholar). There is evidence that these kinases have transforming potential. Axl was originally identified as a protein encoded by a transforming gene from primary human myeloid leukemia cells (27O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prodop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Google Scholar). Axl is overexpressed in a number of different tumor cell types and transforms mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (27O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prodop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Google Scholar). Experimental overexpression of Tyro3 causes anchorage-independent growth of Rat-2 fibroblasts (36Lai C. Gore M. Lemke G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2567-2578Google Scholar). Also, the murine homolog of sky has been shown to be expressed at elevated levels in mouse mammary tumors (37Taylor I.C.A. Roy S. Yaswen P. Stampfer M.R. Varmus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6872-6880Google Scholar). c-eyk is a chicken proto-oncogene that was first identified as the retroviral transforming gene v-ryk (34Jia R. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1839-1844Google Scholar). A close relative, c-mer, is a human proto-oncogene expressed in malignant B- and T-lymphocytic cell lines (35Graham D.K. Dawson T.L. Mullaney D.L. Snodgrass H.R. Earp H.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657Google Scholar). The hallmark of the Axl/Tyro3 family is an extracellular region consisting of two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and two fibronectin III (FN) domains. These domains are found in cell recognition molecules such as the neural cell adhesion molecules L1 and NCAM (38Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Google Scholar) and certain receptor tyrosine phosphatases (39Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Google Scholar, 40Sap J. Jiang Y.-P. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1-9Google Scholar). Homotypic and heterotypic binding involving extracellular determinants have been demonstrated for some Axl/Tyro3 family members. Homotypic binding has been shown to activate the Axl tyrosine kinase (41Bellosta P. Costa M. Lin D.A. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 614-625Google Scholar), an event that may be important in signaling cell adhesion. Axl (42Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliot G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.-H. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Yanagihara D. Bennett L. Sylber M. Merewether L.A. Tseng A. Escobar E. Liu E.T. Yamane H.K. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, Tyro3 (43Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 355-358Google Scholar) are also activated by a heterophilic ligand, Gas6, a vitamin K-dependent protein that is up-regulated during growth arrest in confluent fibroblast cultures. Protein S, which bears significant homology to Gas6, was found to be a heterophilic ligand for Tyro3 (44Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar). Protein S is an anticoagulant in serum and a mitogen for smooth muscle cells (45Gasic G.P. Arenas C.P. Gasic T.B. Gasic G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2317-2320Google Scholar), but its up-regulation in Schwann cells following nerve injury suggests that it may also serve as a neural growth or differentiation factor (44Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar). The molecular cloning, structural analysis, and expression of the Rek receptor tyrosine kinase in developing chick neural tissues is described here. It is also demonstrated that overexpression and activation of Rek in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts leads to cell transformation, indicating that the rek gene has oncogenic potential that might contribute to malignant growth of nervous system tumors. Primary cultures enriched for Müller glia were prepared from embryonic day 10 chicken retinas as described previously (17Biscardi J.S. Shores C.G. Maness P.F. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 1121-1128Google Scholar, 46Adler R. Methods Neurosci. 1990; 2: 134-150Google Scholar). Retinas were dissected free of sclera-choroid-pigmented epithelium and cells seeded on tissue culture dishes in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum. By 7-10 days, a mixed culture developed consisting of a monolayer of flat cells underlying a network of neuronal fascicles and cell clumps, which were removed by gentle mechanical agitation. As described previously, the identification of the flat cells as Müller glia is supported by abundant intermediate filaments (47Li H.P. Sheffield J.B. Tissue Cell Res. 1984; 16: 843-857Google Scholar), staining with vimentin antibodies (48Lemmon V. Rieser B. Brain Res. 1983; 313: 191-197Google Scholar), lack of binding to tetanus toxin, [3H]thymidine incorporation, GABA and glutamate uptake (49dePomerai D.I. Carr A. Exp. Eye. Res. 1982; 34: 553-563Google Scholar, 50dePomerai D.I. Carr A. Hyndman A.G. Adler R. Dev. Brain Res. 1982; 2: 303-314Google Scholar), expression of a filamin-related protein (51Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 43-51Google Scholar), and the presence of carbonic anhydrase and glutamine synthetase (52Linser J.D. Moscona A.A. Dev. Biol. 1983; 96: 529-534Google Scholar). The glial-like cells do not show induction of glutamine synthetase by hydrocortisone, a response characteristic of Müller cells in vivo (52Linser J.D. Moscona A.A. Dev. Biol. 1983; 96: 529-534Google Scholar), and are negative for expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, perhaps due to the absence of necessary intercellular interactions in the monolayers. They will be referred to as Müller glia-like cultures, but they may not represent fully differentiated Müller cells or their precursors. Hatchling chicks (White Leghorn, NC State) were anesthetized with Ketamine and sacrificed by decapitation. Staging of chick embryos was done according to the guidelines of Hamilton and Hamburger (53Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Google Scholar). For RNA, tissues were rapidly excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until use. Poly(A)+-selected RNA was isolated using the FastTrack RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Poly(A)-selected RNA (1 μg) from Müller glial cell cultures was reverse transcribed using random hexamers as described by O'Bryan et al. (27O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prodop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Google Scholar) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 625 μM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 20 units of RNAsin (Promega), 10 mM of dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (final volume, 20 μl). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then for 45 min at 45°C. This first strand cDNA (1 μl) was amplified in a 100-μl reaction containing 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM each dNTP, 0.001% gelatin, 1 μg each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The degenerate oligonucleotide primer sequences of Wilks (25Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Google Scholar) were used corresponding to the following amino acid sequences: PTK1, CGG ATC CAC (A/C)GN GA(C/T) (C/T)T; PTK2, CT(G/A)CA(G/C) ACC AGG A(A/T)A CCT TAA GG. Reaction conditions were as follows: 1.5 min at 95°C (denaturing), 2 min at 37°C (annealing), and 3 min at 63°C (elongation). The PCR products were ligated into the plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene) and transfected into DH5 Escherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and colonies were selected after induction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. To produce a DNA fragment of suitable length for a hybridization probe, a modification of the 3′-RACE method (54Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) was used to generate a 1.4-kb fragment representing the 3′-end of rek cDNA extending from the sequence encoding the IHRDL motif in the catalytic domain to the poly(A) tail. For this purpose, an oligo(dT)-primed λZAPII cDNA library was generated from Müller glia-enriched cultures using a cDNA cloning kit (Stratagene). A nondegenerate primer specific to rek (seal-1, ATG CTG GAT GAG AAC ATG AAT; corresponding to amino acids MLDENMN; residues 649-655) was used as the sense primer, and an oligonucleotide (pBlu5) specific to the pBluescript phagemid between the XhoI site and the T7 promoter (ATA GGG CGA ATT GGG TAC) was the antisense primer. PCR was carried out as above with 0.75 mM MgCl2, using the following reaction conditions: 5 min at 94°C (denaturing), 5 min at 60°C (annealing), and 4 min at 72°C (extending) for 1 cycle, followed by 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 60°C, and 4 min at 72°C for 35 cycles. The PCR product was directly ligated into the pCR plasmid (TA cloning vector, Stratagene), DH10 E. coli cells were transformed, and colonies were selected. The insert sequence from one of the 3′-RACE clones was sequenced, verifying that it specified the Rek catalytic domain. An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library in λ gt10 from chick embryonic brain (day 13) (Barbara Ranscht, Burnham Cancer Research Foundation) was screened at high stringency using the 32P-radiolabeled 3′-RACE clone (1.4 kb) as probe. Out of the 28 positive primary clones obtained, 15 clones survived plaque purification through secondary and tertiary screening. Subclones of the longest clone (approximately 4 kb) were generated by exonuclease III digestion, and DNA sequencing was completed for both strands. This clone contained a long open reading frame, a 3′-untranslated region containing an internal A-rich sequence, and a poly(A) addition site, but it lacked a start codon and signal peptide. The additional 5′-sequence was obtained by rescreening the brain library using as probe a PCR fragment amplified from the 5′-region of the 4-kb clone. Twelve clones were plaque-purified through tertiary screening, and their 5′-regions were sized by PCR. The clone with the longest 5′-region was sequenced and found to contain the full rek coding sequence, including a putative start codon and signal peptide sequence. The remainder of the sequence was identical to the 4-kb cDNA clone. Interestingly, the clone specifying the entire protein sequence (3.3 kb) represented a cDNA that had been internally primed at an A-rich sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA. Two methods of DNA sequence analysis were used. Manual DNA sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method was carried out using Sequenase T7 polymerase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) with T3 and T7 primers. Automated sequencing was performed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Automated DNA Sequencing Facility (Dr. Laura Livingstone, Director), which employs a model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Both sense and antisense strands were sequenced. Sequences were compared by the FASTA program to the GenBank™/EMBL and SwissProt data bases using the GCG software package. Contiguous clones were aligned using the GAP program and then merged using the ASSEMBLE program. The PILEUP program was used to compare the Rek amino acid sequence with other members of the Axl/Tyro3 family. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the computer program Phylogenetic Analogy Using Parsimony (PAUP)(55). RNA was separated on denaturing 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gels and subjected to blot hybridization on Hybond N membranes at high stringency (83Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Borgman C.A. Lansing T.J. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6140-6144Google Scholar). Hybridization using a 32P-radiolabeled DNA probe generated by PCR amplification of the 1.4-kb 3′-RACE clone was carried out at 42°C overnight in 5 × SSC, 40% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaH2PO4, and 200 μg/ml boiled salmon sperm DNA. Washes were as follows: 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42°C, 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42°C, and 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 55°C. The filters were exposed to film at −80°C for 6 days with intensifying screens. Normalization of the amount of RNA loaded was confirmed by hybridizing to an actin probe, which was generated by PCR amplification of Müller glial cDNA with actin specific primers as described in O'Bryan et al. (27O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prodop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Google Scholar). Chicken genomic DNA was partially digested with EcoRI or HindIII, and fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose. Filters were hybridized to two EcoRI/BamHI fragments (0.4 and 0.9 kb) encoding the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains (nucleotides 1-1602), which were 32P-labeled by random priming. Filters were hybridized overnight in 50% (v/v) formamide, 4 × SSC, 5% (w/v) Denhardt's solution, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 42°C and washed two times for 20 min each in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature, once in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature, and once in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50°C. Filters were exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. Two different BamHI-HindIII fragments of the 3.3-kb rek cDNA clone were used to express Rek fusion proteins as antigens. One (for antibody A) encoded 305 amino acids of the kinase domain (residues 459-764), and the other (for antibody B) encoded the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues. The fragments were subcloned into the pLC24 vector (56Derynck R. Remaut E. Saman E. Stanssens P. De Clercq B. Content J. Fiers W. Nature. 1980; 287: 193-197Google Scholar), and fusion proteins with 98 amino acids of the MS2 polymerase protein were expressed in E. coli upon temperature shift from 28 to 42°C. The proteins were purified by preparative SDS-PAGE and used to inoculate rabbits. Rek fusion proteins (150 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant were used for the primary injection and for each of three boosts in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antisera were screened by Western blotting against the fusion proteins. Where indicated, antibodies were purified from IgG preparations by immunoaffinity on an Affi-Gel column (Bio-Rad) to which the fusion proteins were covalently coupled. Antibodies were eluted with 50 mM diethylamine and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The entire 3.3-kb cDNA encoding the complete Rek protein was cloned into the EcoRI site of the vector pSG5 (57Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369-373Google Scholar) and transfected into bacteria. Clones were selected with rek cDNA in either the sense or antisense orientation with respect to the SV40 promoter of pSG5. COS-7 cells (in 100-mm dishes) were transfected for 6 h in OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the sense or antisense construct (5 μg) using lipofectamine (36 μl; Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium and then passaged 24 h later onto new 100-mm dishes. Metabolic labeling was carried out for 14 h with an 35S-protein labeling solution (EXPRE35S35S, DuPont NEN) containing radiolabeled L-methionine and L-cysteine in DMEM (without methionine and cysteine), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum or rek antiserum (350 μl of lysate, 12 μl of serum) or Rek antiserum preadsorbed of Rek-specific antibodies by passing IgG through an Affi-Gel column to which the antigen-fusion protein was coupled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography on x-ray film (1-week exposure). Rek was immunoprecipitated from either RIPA (24Biscardi J.S. Cooper N.G.F. Maness P.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 281-289Google Scholar) or Brij 97 detergent extracts of transfected COS cells or Rek lysis buffer (RLB) extracts of transfected NIH3T3 cells using antibodies prepared as described above and protein A-Sepharose. The composition of Brij 87 buffer was 1% Brij-97, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaEDTA, 1 mM NaEGTA, 10 mM NaF, 200 μM Na3VO4, 500 μg/ml Pefabloc, 0.01% leupeptin, 0.11 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin.

E., Mosbaugh, D. W., and Tainer, J. A. (1995) Cell 82, 701-708). The role of specific carboxylic amino acid residues in forming the Ung·Ugi complex was investigated using selective chemical modification techniques. Ugi treated with carbodiimide and glycine ethyl ester produced five discrete protein species (forms I-V) that were purified and characterized. Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Ugi form I escaped protein modification, and forms II-V showed increasing incremental amounts of acyl-glycine ethyl ester adduction. Ugi forms II-V retained their ability to form a Ung·Ugi complex but exhibited a reduced ability to inactivate Escherichia coli Ung, directly reflecting the extent of modification. Competition experiments using modified forms II-V with unmodified Ugi as a competitor protein revealed that unmodified Ugi preferentially formed complex. Furthermore, unmodified Ugi and poly(U) were capable of displacing forms II-V from a preformed Ung·Ugi complex but were unable to displace Ugi form I. The primary sites of acyl-glycine ethyl ester adduction were located in the α2-helix of Ugi at Glu-28 and Glu-31. We infer that these two negatively charged amino acids play an important role in mediating a conformational change in Ugi that precipitates the essentially irreversible Ung/Ugi interaction.

Uracil-DNA glycosylase initiates the uracil excision DNA repair pathway by removing uracil residues that accumulate in cellular DNA following dUMP incorporation or deamination of cytosine (1Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 48: 315-370Google Scholar). The enzyme cleaves the N-glycosylic bond linking uracil to the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of DNA to produce free uracil and an apyrimidinic site (2Lindahl T. Ljungquist S. Siegert W. Nyberg B. Sperens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3286-3294Google Scholar). Uracil-DNA glycosylase is a ubiquitous and highly conserved enzyme that shares ∼56% amino acid sequence homology between the proteins isolated from Escherichia coli and humans (3Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Wittwer C.U. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3121-3125Google Scholar). Molecular modeling studies using the 1.9-Å crystal structure of human uracil-DNA glycosylase revealed that uracil residues in duplex DNA must enter the catalytic pocket of the enzyme through an extrahelical rotation, termed “base flipping” (4Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Krokan H.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 701-708Google Scholar, 5Roberts R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 9-12Google Scholar). Following uracil release, successive uracil residues may be located by a processive search mechanism (6Higley M. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 109-116Google Scholar, 7Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Google Scholar), and humans (8Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Google Scholar) involves the coordinated action of uracil-DNA glycosylase, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, deoxyribophosphodiesterase, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase to produce a one-nucleotide repair patch. Unlike most organisms that exclude uracil residues from DNA, the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 naturally exhibit ∼72% base composition of U:A base pairs (11Takahashi I. Marmur J. Nature. 1963; 197: 794-795Google Scholar). These bacteriophage achieve stable incorporation of dUMP as a consequence of the ugi 1The abbreviations used are: ugi and Ugibacteriophage PBS1 or 2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor gene and protein, respectivelyUngE. coli uracil-DNA glycosylaseEDC1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimideGEEglycine ethyl esterMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionizationFITCfluorescein 5-isothiocyanateF-Ungfluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated uracil-DNA glycosylasePTHphenylthiohydantoin. gene product, and both related phage share an identical ugi nucleotide sequence (12Wang Z.

In vivo, the ugi gene is expressed immediately upon phage infection of the host and inactivates uracil-DNA glycosylase within 4 min postinfection, thus blocking the uracil excision DNA repair pathway (14Friedberg E.C.

The PBS2 Ugi protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity and extensively characterized as a small (9,474-dalton), monomeric, heat-stable, acidic protein of 84 amino acid residues (15Wang Z. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 31-37Google Scholar, 16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). The inhibitor protein contains 12 Glu and 6 Asp residues, which help to establish an acidic isoelectric point (pI = 4.2) (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicate that Ugi inactivates uracil-DNA glycosylases isolated from a wide variety of biological sources (12Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Google Scholar, 17Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Google Scholar, 18Caradonna S. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Google Scholar). E. coli Ung forms an extremely stable Ung·Ugi complex with 1:1 stoichiometry, which is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar, 19Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Google Scholar). Association of Ugi with Ung involves a two-step kinetic mechanism (19Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Google Scholar). The first step is initiated by an Ung/Ugi interaction to form a precomplex, distinguished by the dissociation constant Kd = 1.3 μM. The second step results in the formation of the final Ung·Ugi complex characterized by the rate constant k = 195 s−1. Thus, complex formation involves a preliminary “docking” step followed by a “locking” reaction through which the two proteins achieve optimal alignment and become very tightly bound. Inhibition of Ung occurs, since the Ung·Ugi complex fails to recognize the DNA substrate (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar, 19Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that Ugi binds to Ung at or near the DNA binding site. (i) Photochemical cross-linking of Ung to single-stranded oligonucleotide dT20, at the DNA-binding pocket, prevented Ugi binding to Ung (20Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21870-21879Google Scholar). (ii) Inclusion of Ugi in UV-induced cross-linking reactions prevented formation of the Ung × dT20 cross-link (20Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21870-21879Google Scholar). (iii) X-ray crystallographic studies of Ugi complexed to the human (4Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G.

Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Google Scholar) and herpes simplex virus type I (22Savva R. Pearl L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 752-757Google Scholar) uracil-DNA glycosylases revealed interactions between Ugi and conserved amino acids near the active site of the enzyme, suggesting protein mimicry of DNA. Recently, the secondary and tertiary structures of Ugi were determined by solution state multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (23Balasubramanian S. Beger R.D. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 296-303Google Scholar, 24Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Google Scholar). Secondary structural features include two α-helices and five β-strands arranged contiguously as α1-β1-α2-β2-β3-β4-β5 to form an antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). Seven acidic amino acid residues (Glu-38, Asp-40, Glu-49, Asp-52, Asp-61, Glu-64, and Glu-78), not directly involved in secondary structural elements, appear in small loop or turn regions that sequentially connect the β-strands. In addition, four of the β-strands contain terminal acidic residues (Glu-20, Asp-48, Glu-53, Asp-74). The remaining seven negatively charged residues are located in either the α1-helix (Asp-6, Glu-9, Glu-11) or α2-helix (Glu-27, Glu-28, Glu-30, Glu-31). Interestingly, the α2-helix is partitioned into a hydrophobic face and charged face where the four glutamic acid residues project (24Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Google Scholar). Several unique features of Ugi suggest that the negatively charged amino acids of the Ugi protein play an important role in mediating the Ung/Ugi interaction. First, the overall electronegative potential of the Ugi protein, engendered by its high (21%) Glu and Asp content, is quite unusual (12Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Google Scholar, 16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). Second, the NMR structure (Fig. 1) shows that 11 of the 18 Glu and Asp residues terminate the β-strands or are located in the more flexible loops, in a nonrandom distribution (23Balasubramanian S. Beger R.D. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 296-303Google Scholar). Third, the tertiary structure brings together seven of these residues (Glu-20, Asp-48, Glu-49, Asp-52, Glu-53, Asp-74, Glu-78) into close proximity on one surface of the Ugi protein, forming a unique structural element (24Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Google Scholar). The negative electrostatic potential of this region is >6.6 kcal, similar to that generated by the phosphate backbone of DNA (24Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Google Scholar). Fourth, both the α1 and α2 helices contain regions with similar high electronegative potential (24Beger R.D. Balasubramanian S. Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16840-16847Google Scholar). Although reasons to suspect a functional role for these residues exist, the specific involvement of these negatively charged amino acids in Ung·Ugi complex formation remains to be elucidated. In the present report, we chemically modify the carboxylic acid residues of Ugi to determine their role in forming the Ung·Ugi complex. Specifically, the approach involved (i) chemical modification of Ugi with the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and the nucleophile glycine ethyl ester (GEE); (ii) purification of five modified forms of Ugi; (iii) characterization of each form concerning the effect of modification on Ugi specific activity, Ung·Ugi complex stability, and reversibility; and (iv) identification of specific sites of Ugi adduction using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing techniques. The findings establish the importance of two Glu residues in the α2-helix for achieving stable Ung·Ugi complex formation. Fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC isomer I) was purchased from Molecular Probes, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and glycine ethyl ester were from Sigma. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside came from Life Technologies, Inc., cyanogen bromide was obtained from Aldrich, and endoproteinase Asp-N was from Boehringer Mannheim. [35S]Methionine was purchased from DuPont-NEN and [3H]dUTP from Amersham Corp. Calf thymus [uracil-3H]DNA (specific activity, 195 cpm/pmol of uracil) was prepared as described previously (12Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Google Scholar), as was single-stranded DNA-agarose (25Domena J.D. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7320-7328Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM105 (Δ(lac-proAB), thi, rpsL, endA, sbcB15, sbcC, hsdR4/F, traD36, proAB, lacIQZΔM15) was provided by W. Ream (Oregon State University). pZWtac1 (15Wang Z. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W.

Nonradioactive Ugi (fraction IV) and [methionine-35S]Ugi (196 cpm/pmol) were purified as described by Bennett and Mosbaugh (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (fraction V) was purified as described previously (19Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) E. coli JM105 cells transformed with pSB1051 were grown at 37°C in 9 liters of TYN-ampicillin medium (1% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.01% ampicillin); (ii) after isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced Ung overproduction, harvested bacteria were resuspended in 360 ml of TED buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) and lysed in 40-ml aliquots in a French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i.; (iii) hydroxyapatite chromatography (fraction IV) was performed using a 19.6-cm2× 3.6-cm column; and (iv) a single-stranded DNA-agarose column (19.6-cm2× 44-cm) was step-eluted with 1,600 ml of DAB buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% (w/v) glycerol) containing 150 mM NaCl. Fractions containing enzymatic activity were pooled (680 ml) and concentrated (8-fold) under 55 p.s.i. of N2 gas in an Amicon stirred cell (62-mm YM10 membrane) attached to a 4-liter Amicon reservoir. Following the concentration step, diafiltration was performed using 700 ml of DAB buffer lacking NaCl, which produced fraction V uracil-DNA glycosylase. E. coli JM105 cells transformed with pZWtac1 were grown at 37°C in 2.5 liters of M9 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamine and 0.01% ampicillin. Upon reaching a cell density of 6.5 × 108 cells/ml (1 A600 = 8 × 108 cells/ml), 9.4 nmol of [35S]methionine (specific activity, 1,175 Ci/mmol) was added, and 35 min later 25 ml of 100 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to induce ugi gene expression. Following 3 h of additional growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and [35S]Ugi purification was carried out as described previously (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) DEAE-cellulose chromatography (fraction II) was performed using a 4.9-cm2× 10.2-cm column, and the inhibitor was eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient from 0 to 650 mM NaCl in TED buffer; (ii) fractions containing peak inhibitor activity and an A280:A260 ratio of >0.5 were pooled; and (iii) following Sephadex G-75 chromatography, fractions containing inhibitor activity (fraction IV) were pooled (80 ml) and concentrated (4-fold) in an Amicon stirred cell as described above. [35S]Ugi was then extensively dialyzed into 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0). Purification of unlabeled uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein was similarly performed with the following modifications: (i) E. coli JM105 cells transformed with pZWtac1 were grown at 37°C in 9 liters of TYN-ampicillin medium; (ii) following Ugi overproduction, harvested bacteria were resuspended in 360 ml of TED buffer and lysed in a French pressure cell as described above; (iii) DEAE-cellulose chromatography (fraction II) was performed using a 19.6-cm2× 10.2-cm column, and the inhibitor was eluted with a 1,100-ml linear gradient from 0 to 650 mM NaCl in TED buffer; (iv) a final concentration step was unnecessary, and Ugi (fraction IV) was stored in buffer EB containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 100 mM NaCl. An EDC/GEE modification reaction mixture (16.9 ml) containing 1,050 nmol of [35S]Ugi (fraction IV), 228 μmol of GEE, and 45.6 μmol of EDC in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 25°C for 30 min. GEE was introduced into the reaction mixture with [35S]Ugi prior to the addition of EDC. The reaction was terminated by adding 16.9 ml of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.75). Excess EDC and GEE were removed from EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi by processing 250-μl aliquots through 1.4-ml spun columns containing P-4 resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) (26Mosbaugh D.W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 108-118Google Scholar). After processing, all aliquots were pooled and dialyzed extensively against buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 50 mM NaCl. In order to isolate individual forms of EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi protein, a sample containing 486 nmol of the EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi mixture was applied to a DE-52 cellulose column (0.6 cm2× 7.9 cm) equilibrated at 4°C in buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 15 ml of equilibration buffer, and [35S]Ugi was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 50-300 mM NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected in Eppendorf tubes, and samples (10 μl) were monitored for 35S radioactivity using 5 ml of Formula 989 fluor. Fractions containing EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi forms I-V were analyzed by 18% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each form (I-V) was separately pooled and evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant), resuspended with 1 ml of buffer A, and then dialyzed extensively against buffer EB. Ung·[35S]Ugi complexes were formed by mixing Ung with either unmodified or EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi forms I-V and were incubated at 25°C for 10 min and then at 4°C for 20 min. Following complex formation, each Ung·[35S]Ugi sample was loaded onto a DE-52 cellulose column (0.8 cm2× 1.9 cm) to resolve the complex from its component proteins. The column was equilibrated in DAB buffer containing 50 mM NaCl. After sample application, the column was shut off for 5 min and then washed with 30 ml of equilibration buffer. Proteins were eluted with a two-step gradient consisting of 25 and 10 ml of DAB buffer containing 150 and 250 mM NaCl, respectively. Fractions were collected, and samples were analyzed for Ung activity and 35S radioactivity. Fractions containing Ung·[35S]Ugi complex were pooled and concentrated using a Centriplus-10 (Amicon) concentrator. Catalytic activity of uracil-DNA glycosylase and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-labeled Ung were measured under previously described standard reaction conditions (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). One unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase is defined as the amount that releases 1 nmol of uracil/h under standard conditions. Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor activity was measured under previously described conditions (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). One unit of inhibitor inactivates one unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase when 0.05-0.15 units of endogenous enzyme were introduced into the assay. Inhibitor activity was measured in reactions where no more than 80% of the glycosylase activity was inhibited. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficients ϵ280 nm = 4.2 × 104 liters/mol·cm (Ung) and ϵ280 nm = 1.2 × 104 (Ugi). The concentration of complex was determined from [35S]Ugi radioactivity, since the complex exhibits 1:1 stoichiometry (16Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Google Scholar). Nondenaturing polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed by a modification of that described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Slab gels contained a resolving gel (13 cm) composed of 18% acrylamide, 0.48% N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide), and 375 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and a stacking gel (1 cm) containing 3% acrylamide, 0.08% N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide), and 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Protein samples (30-60 μl) were adjusted to final concentrations of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue before being loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C and 100 V until the tracking dye migrated through the stacking gel, at which point the potential was increased to 200 V. Electrophoresis continued until the tracking dye migrated within ∼2 cm from the bottom of the gel. Protein bands were detected by rapid protein staining as described by Reisner (28Reisner A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 439-441Google Scholar). Briefly, slab gels were placed in dye solution containing 0.04% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and 3.5% (v/v) HClO4 immediately after electrophoresis. Complete staining required gentle agitation at 25°C for 12 h. Gels were destained with 5% (v/v) acetic acid, and the gel was photographed with Polaroid-55 film using an orange filter (Eastman Kodak Co.; 23A). Nondenaturing polyacrylamide tube gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Davis (29Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Google Scholar) with some modifications. Tube gels (0.6-cm diameter) contained a resolving gel (9 cm) and stacking gel (1 cm). Protein samples were prepared, and electrophoresis was performed at 4°C as described above. To detect [35S]Ugi and Ung·[35S]Ugi, gels were sliced horizontally into 3.1-mm sections, placed into scintillation vials (7 ml), and dehydrated overnight at room temperature. Following the addition of 30% H2O2 (500 μl), vials were capped and incubated at 55°C for 36-48 h. Once solubilized, 5 ml of Formula 989 (DuPont) fluor was added, and 35S radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS 6800 liquid scintillation counter. Ung (fraction V) was extensively dialyzed against buffer KEG containing 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 9.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 5% (w/v) glycerol at 4°C. Fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate stock (810 μM) was freshly prepared in dimethylformamide, and 1.5 ml was added to 14 ml of Ung (2.9 mg) with thorough mixing. After 2.5 h at 25°C in the dark, the mixture was placed on ice and then loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (4.9 cm2× 13.5 cm) equilibrated in buffer KEG. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and samples were monitored at 260, 280, and 496 nm for absorbance. After the FITC-Ung (F-Ung) containing fractions were pooled, the concentration of F-Ung was determined based on absorbance at 280 and 496 nm. The concentration of FITC in the dye-protein conjugate (2.3 fluorophores/enzyme molecule) was determined by the absorbance, where ϵ496 nm = 7.8 × 104 liters/mol·cm (30Haugland R.P. Larson K.D. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals(, ed), , p.5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992: 22Google Scholar). It was experimentally determined that 1 μM FITC contributed 0.025 A280. Thus, the concentration of F-Ung was determined by subtracting the A280 contributed by FITC from the overall A280 of the dye-protein conjugate and dividing by the molar extinction coefficient of Ung. No significant alteration of Ung activity was detected following production of F-Ung (19Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were conducted at 25°C using an LS50 luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a xenon flash tube and a thermostatted minicell (4 mm). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 496 and 520 nm, respectively; both slit widths were set at 5 mm. Cyanogen bromide cleavage reaction mixtures (200-650 μl) contained 20 mM CNBr, 0.1 N HCl, and 25 μM of [35S]Ugi or EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi forms I-V. After incubation at 25°C for 24 h, samples were evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 65 μl of distilled water, and analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometric methods. Samples utilized for peptide C3 purification were resuspended in 600 μl of buffer A and applied to individual DE-52 cellulose columns (0.79 cm2× 1.3 cm) equilibrated in buffer A at 4°C. After sample loading, the flow rate was stopped for 5 min, and then the column was washed with 2.5 ml of buffer A. Peptide fragments were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0-250 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions (500 μl) were collected in Eppendorf tubes, and samples (1 μl) were analyzed for CNBr-cleaved peptide fragments by MALDI mass spectrometry. Fractions containing peptide C3 were pooled and concentrated to ∼300 μl using a Centricon-3 (Amicon) concentrator, buffer was exchanged with distilled water, and fractions were submitted for amino acid sequence analysis. Proteolysis reaction mixtures contained Asp-N (0.04 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and [35S]Ugi or EDC/GEE-modified [35S]Ugi forms II-III (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) in a 1:100 (w/w) ratio. Incubation was carried out for 3 h at 25°C, and the extent of proteolysis was monitored by MALDI mass spectrometry. MALDI mass spectrometry was performed by the Mass Spectrometry Facilities and Service Core Unit (Environmental Health Science Center, Oregon State University) using a custom-built time of flight instrument (31Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Swenson S. Seifried S.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 496-501Google Scholar). Two different matrices were used in the sample preparation: (i) 10 mg/ml of sinapinic acid dissolved in 33% acetonitrile and 67% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% solution) was mixed (3:1) with samples (0.5 μl) containing 10 μM modified or unmodified Ugi protein; and (ii) a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% acetonitrile and 67% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% solution) was mixed (10:1) with samples (0.5 μl) containing CNBr-treated Ugi, purified peptide C3, and Asp-N-digested Ugi protein. Each matrix solution was applied to a mass spectrometric probe and allowed to dry as described previously by Bennett et al. (20Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21870-21879Google Scholar). A mass spectrum was generated from 30 individual laser pulses (+24 kV), and the summed signals were calibrated using standard ion signals from the matrix. Samples (30 μl in H2O) containing purified peptide C3 from Ugi or modified Ugi forms I-IV were applied to a cartridge filter precycled with Biobrene (Applied Biosystems). Amino acid sequencing was conducted using an Applied Biosystems model 475A gas phase protein sequencer by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (Oregon State University). To assess the importance of Glu and Asp residues in mediating the Ung/Ugi interaction, chemical modification of Ugi was conducted, and the effect on inhibitor activity was investigated. The water-soluble carbodiimide, EDC, was used in a two-stage modification reaction with GEE t"

We report here the expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of a native form of rat aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and of two truncated derivatives lacking 20 or 36 amino acid residues from their amino-terminal polypeptide extension. The three recombinant enzyme species were purified to homogeneity. They behave as α2 dimers and display catalytic parameters in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction identical to those determined for the native, complex-associated form of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase isolated from rat liver. Because the dimer dissociation constant of rat AspRS is much higher than that of its bacterial and yeast counterparts, we could establish a direct correlation between dissociation of the dimer and inactivation of the enzyme. Our results clearly show that the monomer is devoid of amino acid activation and tRNA aminoacylation activities, indicating that dimerization is essential to confer an active conformation on the catalytic site. The two NH2-terminal truncated derivatives were fully active, but proved to be more unstable than the recombinant native enzyme, suggesting that the polypeptide extension fulfills structural rather than catalytic requirements.

In the present study we examined the interdependence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> mobilization on intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> by monitoring the intracellular free concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), Mg<sup>2+</sup> ([Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) using ion-sensitive fluorescent indicators. Gramicidin increased the intracellular concentrations of all three ions. Comparable to agonist-stimulated mobilization of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the gramicidin-induced [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was independent of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicating release of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from an intracellular pool. Clamping the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> near 30 nM with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective chelator BAPTA failed to alter the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases generated by gramicidin. In contrast, depletion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> markedly suppressed the muscarinic-stimulated [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase, whereas the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was similar to that seen in physiological extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. These results revealed that intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> mobilization did not directly relate to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but required an increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Consistent with this hypothesis, increasing [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by activating Na<sup>+</sup> influx via the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger also increased the [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The Na<sup>+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchange inhibitor quinidine suppressed both the gramicidin- and muscarinic-induced discharge of internal Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

https://openalex.org/W1968302214,"We have shown previously that hydroxylation played a critical role in the trimer assembly and disulfide bonding of the three constituent α chains of a minicollagen composed of the extreme C-terminal collagenous (COL1) and noncollagenous (NC1) domains of type XII collagen in HeLa cells (Mazzorana, M., Gruffat, H., Sergeant, A., and van der Rest, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3029-3032). We have further characterized the involvement of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the assembly of the three α chains to form trimeric disulfide-bonded type XII minicollagen in an insect cell expression system. For this purpose, type XII minicollagen was produced in insect cells from baculovirus vectors, alone or together with wild-type human prolyl 4-hydroxylase or with the human enzyme mutated in the catalytic site of its α or β subunits or with the individual α or β subunits. When type XII minicollagen was produced alone, negligible amounts of disulfide-bonded trimers were found to be produced by the cells. However, coproduction of the collagen with the two subunits of the wild-type human enzyme dramatically increased the amount of disulfide-bonded trimeric type XII minicollagen molecules. In contrast, coproduction of the collagen with α subunits that had a mutation completely inactivating the human enzyme failed to enhance the trimer assembly. These results directly show that an active prolyl 4-hydroxylase is required for the assembly of disulfide-bonded trimers of type XII minicollagen.

The most abundant components of the extracellular matrices are the collagens. Owing to their diverse structural and functional properties, these multidomain proteins contribute significantly to the high diversity of these matrices. The collagens are defined as proteins that contain one or more characteristic triple-helical domains. In these regions, the three constituent polypeptides, termed α chains, are composed of repeated Gly-X-Y amino acid triplets (1van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Google Scholar, 2van der Rest M. Garrone R. Herbage D. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 6: 1-67Google Scholar, 3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Google Scholar). During their biosynthesis, they undergo various post-translational modifications (1van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Google Scholar, 2van der Rest M. Garrone R. Herbage D. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 6: 1-67Google Scholar, 3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Google Scholar). One of these reactions, hydroxylation of many of the proline residues located in the Y positions of the repeating Gly-X-Y triplets into 4-hydroxyprolines, is an absolute requirement for the formation of stable triple helices. It has been suggested that 4-hydroxyprolines contribute to the stability of the collagen triple helix by providing additional interchain water bridges (4Bella S. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzing this modification is prolyl 4-hydroxylase (3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev.

Fibril-Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices (FACITs, 1The abbreviations used are: FACITFibril-Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple helicesPDIprotein-disulfide isomerasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. types IX, XII, XIV, and XVI) are nonfibrillar collagens characterized by the presence of triple-helical (COL) domains interspersed with non-triple-helical (NC) domains (6Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 883-890Google Scholar, 7Fukai N. Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 3-28Google Scholar). They do not form the quarter-staggered fibrils characteristic of the so-called fibril-forming collagens (types I-III, V, and XI), but they are associated with these fibrils (8Keene D.R. Lunstrum G.P.

The precise biological functions of the FACIT collagens are still unknown, but recent data suggest that they participate in bridging processes that allow the binding of the fibrils formed by the fibril-forming collagens to each other (10Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Google Scholar) and they promote interactions of the fibrils with other components of the extracellular network such as proteoglycans (11Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H.

Type XII collagen molecules are homotrimers consisting of three identical α1(XII) chains with two triple-helical (COL1 and COL2) domains and three non-triple-helical (NC1, NC2, and NC3) domains (6Mayne R.

In contrast to fibril-forming collagens, FACITs are not synthesized as procollagens and they are devoid of classical C-propeptides present in fibrillar collagens. In the case of the fibrillar collagens, the C-propeptides play an important role in the selection and correct registration of the three constituent α chains (18Bächinger H.P. Fessler L.L. Timpl R.

In their absence and assuming that the triple helix of FACITs propagates from the C terminus to the N terminus of these molecules as in fibrillar collagens, we have postulated that their C-terminal domains (COL1 and/or NC1) contain the information required for assembly of the molecules (21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar).

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) from vertebrates is an α2β2 tetramer built up of two different types of subunits (5Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C.

The α subunits (∼63 kDa) contain most of the catalytic sites but are inactive in the absence of the β subunits (5Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C.

The β subunits (∼55 kDa) were found to be identical to the enzyme protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1; see Refs. 23Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J.

Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar). The β subunits retain 50% of their protein-disulfide isomerase activity when participating in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer (26Koivu J. Myllylä R. Helaakoski T. Pihlajaniemi T. Tasanen K. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6447-6449Google Scholar). Recently, a fully active human prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer was produced in insect cells by coinfection with two recombinant baculoviruses, one of them coding for the α subunit and the other for the β subunit (27Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinant human type III collagen with a 4-hydroxyproline content and Tm very similar to those of the nonrecombinant collagen was produced in insect cells by coexpressing the type III procollagen chains with the human prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits (28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar). To better understand the contributions of the various cellular post-translational modifications to the assembly of trimeric type XII minicollagen, we have studied the conditions required for the production of disulfide-bonded type XII minicollagen in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. For this purpose we have infected the cells with recombinant viruses encoding type XII minicollagen together with various combinations of recombinant viruses encoding the wild-type or mutant human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The baculovirus transfer vector coding for the recombinant minigene for type XII collagen was constructed using the transfer vector pVL1392 (29Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Google Scholar) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and our previously described construct pRc/CMV COL XII 23 (30Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV COL XII 23 contains the sequences coding for the signal peptide of the α1 chain of the human type I collagen (COL1A1), a tagging sequence corresponding to a twice-repeated short epitope of the human c-myc protein, and the five last amino acid residues of the NC2 domain and the entire COL1 and NC1 domains of chicken type XII collagen (30Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Google Scholar). pRc/CMV COL XII 23 and pVL 1392 were digested with HindIII and NotI, respectively. Both linearized DNAs were submitted to filling with Klenow and subsequently digested with XbaI. The HindIII-filled/XbaI fragment of pRc/CMV COL XII 23 encompassing the type XII collagen-coding sequences was ligated to pVL1392 containing a NotI-filled and a cohesive XbaI extremity. The recombinant pVL construct was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen) and the calcium phosphate method (31Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar, 32Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Vector Expression System: Procedures and Methods Manual. PharMingen, San Diego1993: 1-62Google Scholar). The resultant viral pool was collected, amplified, and plaque-purified (33Brown M. Faulkner P. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 361-364Google Scholar). The ensuing recombinant virus, termed COL XII 23, was checked by a polymerase chain reaction-based method (34Malitschek B. Schartl M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 177-178Google Scholar). Sf9 cells or Trichoplusia ni Tn-5B1-4 cells (marketed by Invitrogen as High Five cells) were infected with COL XII 23 viruses either alone or together with different combinations of COL XII 23 viruses and recombinant viruses encoding the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (designated as α59 viruses and β viruses, respectively; see Ref. 27Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Google Scholar), as well as recombinant viruses encoding mutant α and β subunits of the human enzyme (designated as α-H412S and PDI/βNC in Refs. 35Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Google Scholar and 36Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Google Scholar). In the DNA of the α-H412S viruses, the codon for His-412 was altered to a codon for Ser by site-directed mutagenesis. The corresponding mutant α subunits are able to form tetramers with the wild type β subunits, but the prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity is completely lost (35Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Google Scholar). The His is thought to be needed for the iron binding of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (35Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Google Scholar, 37Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Google Scholar). In the DNA of the PDI/βNC viruses, the codons of two cysteines (one located at the N-terminal catalytic site of the β subunit and the other at the C-terminal catalytic site) were replaced by two codons for serine (36Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Google Scholar). The corresponding mutated subunits have no PDI activity but are able to form tetramers with the wild-type α subunits. In these conditions the tetramers retain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity (36Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Google Scholar). A recently described baculovirus expression system for efficient expression of triple-helical collagen was used (28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar). The insect cells were cultured in a mixture (50:50) of two culture media, IPL 41 (Sigma) and Sf900 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.05% pluronic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 27°C in culture dishes (diameter 10 cm). To produce recombinant proteins, 107 cells/dish were seeded and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 when the cells were infected with COL XII 23 viruses alone, 5:1 when cells were infected with COL XII 23 and α or β viruses, and 5:1:1 when cells were infected with the three viruses (COL XII 23, α, and β). The same ratios of multiplicity were used when infection was performed with the mutant viruses α-H412S and PDI/βNC in the different combinations described above. Sodium ascorbate, when present, was added at 50 μg/ml immediately after the replacement of the viral inocula with fresh media (7 ml/dish). Cells and media were collected 65 h after infection. The minicollagen XII produced by Sf9 cells was recovered from the culture media by immunoprecipitation using protein G-Sepharose. The protocol essentially followed that described by Sugrue (38Sugrue S.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 32: 1876-1882Google Scholar) except that 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide were added to the samples before dialysis. We have used a mouse monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cells Myc-9E10.2 (ATCC CRL 1729) designated in this report as 9E10. This antibody is directed against the tagging sequences derived from the human c-myc protein (39Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar) present at the N terminus of the minicollagen XII construct (30Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Google Scholar). Ascite fluid was used for immunoprecipitation at 1:500 dilution. The protein G-Sepharose-antibody-antigen complexes were dissolved in sample buffer containing 1% SDS in presence or absence of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by a 7.5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with antibody 9E10 (hybridoma supernatant 1:100 dilution). To recover the minicollagen from cell homogenates, Sf9 cells were gently suspended in 7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or in a 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 buffer, containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 5.5 mM glucose, and 0.5 mM EDTA). They were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in 160 μl of 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2 mM CaCl2 in ice and transferred in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Protease inhibitors were added at the concentrations described for the media. Samples were treated with 0.3% SDS in the absence of a reducing agent and boiled for 5 min in a water bath. After cooling in ice, they were digested with 3.3 μg of DNase (stock solution, 1 mg/1.5 ml of 500 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7, containing 50 mM MgCl2) in order to decrease their viscosity (40Garrels J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 411-423Google Scholar). Finally, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. When utilized, they were thawed and 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA were added to complete the volume to 1 ml. After centrifugation (11,200 × g for 5 min at 4°C) to eliminate cell debris, supernatants were treated for immunoprecipitation under conditions described above. The conditions and the products used for the digestion are the same as those described in a previous paper (21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 9E10 was used for the immunoprecipitation of the tagged minicollagen XII with protein-G-Sepharose before elution with glycine and enzymatic digestion. SDS-PAGE and analysis of the digested samples by Western blotting were carried out under conditions described above. However, the blotted protein was revealed with the mouse monoclonal antibody 75d7 kindly provided by Dr. S. P. Sugrue (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (15Sugrue S.P. Gordon M.K. Seyer J. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 939-945Google Scholar), since trypsin eliminates the epitopes of the antibody 9E10 but not the epitope of 75d7 (a short peptide of the NC1 domain) (30Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Google Scholar). Insect cells (Sf9 or High Five) were infected as described above, and 60 ml of the resulting culture medium were used. The affinity column was prepared by immobilizing the monoclonal antibody 9E10 on Avidgel (Avidchrom, Hydrazide Avidgel, Unisyn Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The beads of the gel were first equilibrated in PBS and then batch-incubated (1 h at 4°C) with the medium of infected Sf9 or High Five cells. The column was packed and washed first with PBS alone (two volumes), this being followed by 20 volumes of PBS containing 0.5 M NaCl at 4°C. The antigen was eluted from the column with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.3, and the corresponding fractions immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8. Then, 300 μl of these fractions were precipitated with 8% trichloracetic acid, dried, washed with acetone, dissolved in nonreducing sample buffer containing 1% SDS, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The fractions containing the minicollagen XII were pooled, and 500 μl were used for the enzymatic digestion. The dry trichloracetic acid-precipitate was dissolved in collagenase buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 6 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide). The suspension was digested with 0.6 unit of collagenase (clostridiopeptidase A, form III, Advance Biofactures Corp.) for 90 min at 33°C, and then treated with five volumes of acetone for 1 h at −20°C to stop the reaction. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. In HeLa cells, we have shown that the assembly of disulfide-bonded trimers of minicollagen XII did not occur under conditions preventing hydroxylation of proline residues (absence of ascorbate or presence of α,α′-dipyridyl, see Ref. 21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar). In contrast to HeLa cells, insect cells contain a low prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, which can be markedly increased by infecting the cells with recombinant baculoviruses directing the synthesis of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar, 42Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Google Scholar). The insect cells thus represent a useful tool to determine the essential parameters required for the synthesis of this protein by comparison with the data obtained in HeLa cells (21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar). For this purpose, Sf9 cells were infected with COL XII 23 viruses alone (under these conditions recombinant human type III collagen has been shown to be underhydroxylated; see Ref. 28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar) or with COL XII 23 viruses together with α and β viruses encoding the two types of subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (co-expression of recombinant human type III collagen and the human prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits has been shown to result in full hydroxylation; see Ref. 28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar). In the culture medium, at 65 h post-infection, negligible amounts of trimeric molecules of minicollagen XII were observed when cells were infected with the COL XII 23 viruses alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), whereas trimers were clearly visible when the cells were simultaneously infected with the three types of viruses, as shown after Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated minicollagen XII (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5; T, 105 kDa). These results show that hydroxylation of the COL XII 23 chains, arising from the presence of an active human prolyl hydroxylase, is essential for the assembly of disulfide-bonded trimeric type XII minicollagen molecules. At least three bands corresponding to individual COL XII 23 α chains (based on their apparent molecular masses) were visible (Fig. 1A; M1, 44 kDa; M2, 42.5 kDa; M3, 37 kDa). The presence of the exogenous human enzyme modified the migration of the polypeptides corresponding to M2 and M3 promoting their shift toward the higher molecular mass M1 form. This suggests that the M1 chains contained more hydroxylated proline residues. However, the shift was too marked to be due only to the change in molecular mass rendered by a more extensive hydroxylation, and it may reflect in addition a change in conformation. Dimeric assemblies of the previously described isolated chains were also visible in variable amounts, particularly in the absence of hydroxylation (Fig. 1A; D1, 91 kDa; D2, 83 kDa; D3, 74 kDa). Reduction of the minicollagen XII produced in the presence of the active human enzyme showed that the trimers obtained in these conditions were indeed reducible. As reduction did not promote a real increase in the amount of a particular monomer, it could not be determined in our experimental conditions from which monomers the trimers were constituted. Furthermore, reduction induced a shift toward higher apparent molecular masses for the three bands of monomers, showing that intrachain oxidation occurred. However, reduction did not promote the transformation of one monomer to an other, indicating that cyclization due to the formation of intrachain disulfide bridges did not account for the different apparent molecular masses observed between the monomers (data not shown). The presence of sodium ascorbate in the culture medium did not improve the formation of trimers (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). These results are different from those observed in HeLa cells. In these cells, in the absence of sodium ascorbate, the amounts of disulfide-bonded trimers present in the culture medium were very low (21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar). These data suggest that the amount of the overproduced exogenous enzyme present in the insect cells was sufficient to hydroxylate the available substrate (α minicollagen XII chains), even in the absence of sodium ascorbate. The high amount of the enzyme probably compensated for the loss of its activity, and the substrate concentration was the limiting factor with respect to the enzymatic reaction. However, in insect cells, the effect of ascorbate on the formation of disulfide-bonded trimers may be masked by its partial degradation due to its instability in solution (sodium ascorbate was added only once at the beginning of the experiments, and media were collected 65 h after infection of the insect cells and only 24 h after transfection of HeLa cells). The results were almost identical for the corresponding cell homogenates (Fig. 1B). Only minor amounts of trimeric molecules were observable in cells infected with COL XII 23 viruses alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Dimeric assemblies are not visible in the cell extract shown in Fig. 1B, but they were observed in the cell extracts of other experiments, indicating that these associations were not artifactual assemblies restricted to the culture medium. In the cells infected with the three types of viruses, the amount of the trimeric protein present in the cell homogenates was similar to the amount of the protein secreted in the culture medium (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Previously, we had never observed trimers in HeLa cell homogenates (21Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Google Scholar), suggesting that the rate of secretion of the recombinant minicollagen XII is slower in insect cells than in HeLa cells. The low rate of secretion of secretory proteins is considered a characteristic of insect cells, and we have previously observed that also recombinant type III collagen molecules are secreted at a lower rate from insect cells than from mammalian cells (28Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Google Scholar). All in all, the data reported here clearly show that the addition of the exogenous human enzyme promotes the formation of trimers of minicollagen XII. The data thus provide direct evidence for the involvement of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the formation of trimeric molecules of type XII minicollagen. The triple-helical conformation of the COL1 domain of the type XII minicollagen produced and secreted by insect cells infected with the three types of viruses is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The digestion of the immunoprecipitated minicollagen XII with trypsin (Fig. 2, lane 2) resulted in the disappearance of the bands corresponding to the previously described monomers, which, in contrast to COL1, are not protected from the trypsin by the triple-helical conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2019555668,"The gene for the second chain of the human interferon-gamma receptor was analyzed from cosmid DNA clones. The gene spans over 33 kilobases of DNA and contains seven exons. The signal peptide is encoded by exons 1 and 2, the extracellular domain by exons 2, 3, 4, 5, and by part of 6. Exon 6 also encodes the whole transmembrane domain and part of the intracellular domain. Exon 7 encodes the remainder of the intracellular domain and contains the 3'-untranslated region. The sequences at the exon/intron boundaries are well conserved with respect to canonical acceptor/donor sites (AG/GT). The 5'-flanking region was sequenced and analyzed for transcription factor binding sites. No TATA or CAAT boxes in the promoter region were identified. Consistent with the lack of a TATA box, analysis of the mRNAs by primer extension showed multiple transcription start sites. Promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region was investigated with a luciferase reporter gene and the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter. Segments of the 5' region with promoter activity were identified."
https://openalex.org/W1988402185,"The rate at which HepG2 cells secrete apoB100 lipoproteins is inversely related to the concentration of amino acids in the medium (Zhang, Z., Sniderman, A. D., Kalant, D., Vu, H., Monge, J. C., Tao, Y., and Cianflone, K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26920-26926). The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of individual amino acids on apoB100 and lipoprotein secretion.Asparagine was associated with modestly increased secretion. The branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and lysine had minor inhibitory effects. The other amino acids, by contrast, decreased apoB secretion, although the magnitude of the effect varied considerably, the most potent being tyrosine, cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, and glutamine. Although the effect on Lp(a) generally paralleled that on apoB100, it was usually much less pronounced. No amino acid caused a marked decrease in albumin, apoAI, or total protein secreted from the HepG2 cells. The amino acid effect on apoB was paralleled by similar decreases in secreted cholesterol ester (CE) primarily in the low density lipoprotein density range (d < 1.006-1.063 g/ml), although there was no significant change in intracellular CE. Neither intracellular nor secreted triglycerides (TG) or free cholesterol changed, resulting in a slightly larger TG-enriched particle being secreted. The effect was confirmed in cultured primary hamster hepatocytes, where a mixture of amino acids also caused a decrease in apoB secretion (up to 40%). ApoAI appeared to increase as with the HepG2 cells. Secreted CE paralleled apoB. There was no change in intracellular or secreted TG or free cholesterol, resulting in a substantially larger TG-rich particle being secreted. mRNA for apoB100 increased with asparagine, decreased moderately with branched chain amino acids, and decreased further with glutamine, as shown by dot blot and Northern blotting. Pulse-chase studies indicated that there was no change in apoB secretion efficiency under any condition.These results extend our previous observations by demonstrating specificity of the amino acid effect on apoB100 secretion. Although an effect on transcription is the likely mechanism, the exact basis for this remains to be determined. The rate at which HepG2 cells secrete apoB100 lipoproteins is inversely related to the concentration of amino acids in the medium (Zhang, Z., Sniderman, A. D., Kalant, D., Vu, H., Monge, J.

Although an effect on transcription is the likely mechanism, the exact basis for this remains to be determined. Assembly and secretion of apoB100 lipoprotein particles by hepatocytes is a complex process. Regulation occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (1Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Google Scholar). Only a portion of the apoB100 molecules that are synthesized are eventually secreted from the cell as lipoprotein particles, the rest being hydrolyzed intracellularly shortly after they are synthesized (for review see Refs. 1Sniderman A.D.

Although the most important effects of lipids on apoB100 secretion are exerted at this level, it should be noted that smaller influences have also been demonstrated on the transcriptional process (5Murthy S.

Sparks C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 177-186Google Scholar). Albumin also affects secretion of apoB100 particles, with lower concentrations in the medium being associated with higher rates of apoB100 secretion. This effect may relate to concurrent changes in intracellular CE synthesis (8Cianflone K. Vu H. Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 107: 125-135Google Scholar, 9Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C.

By contrast, amino acids alter the rate of apoB100 synthesis but do not alter the secretion efficiency from HepG2 cells (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar); i.e. as amino acid concentration in the medium is increased, apoB100 synthetic rates decrease without any change in the proportion of molecules that are degraded intracellularly. In addition, parallel changes between the apoB100 mRNA levels and changes in apoB100 secretion were demonstrated as amino acid delivery to the hepatocyte was altered (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). In our previous studies of the effects of amino acids on apoB100 synthesis and secretion, only the effects of a standard amino acid mixture were studied (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). The present studies were designed, therefore, to determine whether all amino acids had a similar effect. We also took advantage of the opportunity to examine the effects of these amino acids on the secretion of Lp(a) lipoprotein particles, apoAI, albumin, and total secreted protein. We have previously reported in abstract form that Lp(a) particles are secreted by HepG2 cells and that there is an inverse relation between their secretion and ambient amino acid concentration as there is with apoB100 lipoproteins (11Sniderman A.D. Zhang Z. Vu H. Kalant D. Cianflone K. Circulation. 1993; 88 (abstr.): I-176Google Scholar). The present data indicate that the amino acid effect on secretion of these two lipoproteins is not general but varies depending on the specific amino acid being examined. Moreover, although there is considerable similarity, the effects of individual amino acids on apoB100 and Lp(a) secretion are not identical. Finally, this effect was not confined to HepG2 cells. Studies in cultured primary hamster hepatocytes confirmed that amino acids decrease apoB secretion in this model as well. Tissue culture medium, fetal calf serum, and other tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., including a concentrated amino acid solution at 50 times the concentration in minimum essential medium (MEM) (12Eagle H. Science. 1959; 130: 432Google Scholar). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and each of the individual amino acids (tissue culture grade) were from Sigma. L-[4,5-3H]leucine (specific activity 40 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Hamster plasma was obtained from BioProducts for Science (Indianapolis, Indiana). HepG2 cells obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Flasks were subcultured every 7 days with a split ratio of 1:3 using 0.25% trypsin in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For experiments, cells were plated out at a density of 1.3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 17-mm dishes (24-well plates). Male Syrian golden hamsters weighing 100-120 g were used for hamster hepatocyte isolation. The liver was perfused with 10 mM HEPES in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 37°C, 4 ml/min for 20 min and then with 0.025% collagenase A (Sigma) dissolved in Hanks' buffer (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) at 37°C, 4 ml/min for 20 min. The liver was placed in a sterile Petri dish with 20 ml of digestion solution (0.1% collagenase A, 0.05% hyaluronase, Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma) dissolved in DMEM/F-12 medium at 37°C. Following digestion, cells were filtered through sterile cotton gauze, washed two times (by centrifugation) with DMEM/F-12 containing 20% fetal calf serum and penicillin G/streptomycin and resuspended in culture medium (20% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml of insulin, penicillin G/streptomycin in DMEM/F-12 medium). The cells were plated out at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml into tissue culture dishes that had previously been coated with a solution of 3 μg/ml collagen type IV (Becton Dickinson Labware). Cells were incubated overnight and then used for experimentation. Before the experiments were performed, cells were preincubated for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA and the indicated amino acid concentrations. Cells were then changed to fresh serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA and the indicated amino acid concentrations and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were placed on ice, and the medium was removed and set aside for analysis. The cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and soluble cell protein was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and collected. Cell protein was measured by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Human apoAI concentration in the medium was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) by the method of Young et al. (14Young S.G. Smith R.S. Hogle D.M. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 1484-1490Google Scholar) as modified by Ortho Diagnostics (La Jolla, CA) using a standard curve of 0.025-0.400 μg/ml of apoAI. These medium proteins were measured by competitive ELISA using standard curves of 0.125-4.0 μg/ml for human and hamster apoB100 or human albumin. For hamster apoAI, a standard curve of 0.04-1.25 μg/ml was used. There was no effect of medium BSA concentration or medium amino acid concentration on the assays. Antigen was coated (3 μg/ml hamster or human LDL, 2 μg/ml human albumin or 3 μg/ml hamster apoAI in PBS, 100 μl/well) overnight at 4°C, and the plate was blocked for 2 h with 250 μl of 1.5% BSA. Plates were washed in 0.9% saline five or six times between each step. Standards, blanks, controls, and samples were diluted appropriately in 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, and 150 μl was added to 150 μl of diluted primary antibody and incubated overnight at 4°C. For apoB100 antibody, LDL was isolated from normal human plasma or hamster plasma (15Havel R. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1245-1353Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and the band corresponding to apoB100 was cut out, emulsified, and injected subcutaneously in a rabbit to generate polyclonal anti-human apoB100 antiserum. Anti-hamster apoAI was produced in the same manner. After several injections, antibody titration was assessed and used at the appropriate dilution in 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. Rabbit anti-human albumin antibody was obtained commercially and diluted according to the manufacturer's suggestion at 1:500,000 to 1:1,000,000 (Sigma). This antibody did not cross-react with BSA. The mixture of sample/antibody was added to the microtiter plate (100 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h in a shaking water bath. After washing, 100 μl/well goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in 4% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. For color development, 100 μl/well of o-phenylamine diamine (1 mg/ml), 0.018% H2O2, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, was added to each well. The color developed over 5-15 min, the reaction was quenched with the addition of 50 μl of 4 N H2SO4, and the optical density was read at 490 nm. Results are calculated from the linear portion of the curve calculated by regression analysis of log(concentration of antigen) versus log(optical density). Lp(a) was measured by a sandwich ELISA assay as described by Fless (17Fless G. Snyder M. Scanu A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to apo(a) (Boehringer Mannheim) was coated at a concentration of 3 μg/ml and then blocked with BSA as described above. Then 100 μl of samples, standards (0.0313-1 μg/ml from Boehringer Mannheim), blanks, and controls diluted appropriately were added to the well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Subsequently, 100 μl of primary polyclonal anti-human apoB100 antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Incubation with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, substrate (o-phenylamine diamine) solution, and quenching H2SO4 solution were as described above. Using this method, only Lp(a) lipoprotein particles are detected, not free apo(a). Western analysis confirmed the supplier's indication that there was no cross-reaction of the monoclonal antibody with plasminogen. Increasing amounts of LDL did not interfere with the assay. Cells were incubated as described under “Experimental Conditions.” The medium was then removed and replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing 1% BSA and the same concentration of the indicated amino acids (27 mM) supplemented with [3H]leucine. Total radiolabeled protein synthesis and secretion was determined as described previously (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). Following experimental incubation and removal of the medium, cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, the intracellular lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of 3:2 (v/v) heptane/isopropyl alcohol at room temperature for 30 min, and the extracts were pooled. Cell lipid extracts were separated, and the mass was quantified as described previously (18Kohen-Avramoglu R. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2513-2528Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was fractionated into lipoprotein fractions as described previously (18Kohen-Avramoglu R. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2513-2528Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were preincubated for 18 h in MEM with 1% BSA with or without supplementation with a 5.0 mg/ml amino acid mixture. Cells were then pulsed 10 min with [3H]leucine in leucine-free medium (specific activity, 0.01 mCi/ml) and chased in the same medium for 0-180 min. At the indicated times, the medium was collected, and labeled apoB and albumin were quantified as described previously (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were incubated as described under “Experimental Conditions.” Cells were then rapidly washed, and RNA was extracted as described previously (18Kohen-Avramoglu R. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2513-2528Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, RNA was separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane for Northern blot. For slot blot, aliquots of RNA were applied directly to the membrane. Biotinylated cDNA probes were prepared, and membranes were probed using an enzymatic chemiluminescent method as described previously (18Kohen-Avramoglu R. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2513-2528Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each point in each experiment is the average of triplicate determinations and is expressed per mg of cell protein ± S.D., and the number of experiments is indicated in the figure legends. Significance was measured by paired Student's t test or t test of two means and indicated accordingly. Based on our previous results of suppression of apoB100 synthesis and secretion by a mixture of amino acids, we tested each of the amino acids individually. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid were not tested; only asparagine and glutamine were. The general protocol for the experiments was as follows. HepG2 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA and the indicated concentrations of the individual amino acids. The cells were then changed to fresh serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA and the individual amino acids and incubated for 24 h. The serum-free incubation medium (MEM) contained 3.46 mM essential amino acids, and this was the lowest concentration of amino acids tested. To this were added the individual amino acids in the concentrations indicated. The data on the effect of the individual amino acids on apoB100 secretion is shown in Fig. 1 (three panels). Basal levels of apoB100 secretion (at 3.46 mM amino acid concentration) are indicated as 100% where the average apoB100 was 8.0 ± 1.5 μg/mg of cell protein for eight experiments. In these panels, the amino acids have been grouped into those that have little inhibitory effect or minor effects (Fig. 1, left panel), those in which a consistent but moderate dose-dependent decrease in apoB100 secretion with increasing amino acid concentration was demonstrated (Fig. 1, center panel), and those that had the largest inhibitory effect on apoB100 secretion by the HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, right panel). Asn (Fig. 1, left panel) was the only amino acid in which there was a consistent positive relation between its concentration and apoB100 secretion. However, the absolute mass increases in apoB100 were small. Ser, His, and Pro (Fig. 1, left panel) had negative effects only at the lower concentrations tested. The branched chain amino acids, Leu, Ile (Fig. 1, left panel), and Val (Fig. 1, center panel), and Lys (Fig. 1, center panel) had minor but consistent inhibitory effects on apoB100. In contrast, the other amino acids all caused apoB100 secretion to decrease as their concentration in the medium was increased, but the extent to which they caused apoB100 secretion to be reduced differed. Ala, Gly, Arg, and Thr (Fig. 1, center panel) had moderate inhibitory effects within this group. The most potent inhibitory amino acids appeared to be Tyr, Cys, Phe, Trp, Met, and Gln (Fig. 1, right panel). For comparison, a mixture of amino acids present in the same proportions as in the MEM, added at the same concentrations as shown in Fig. 1, produced an inhibition of 60 ± 7% at the highest concentration tested (27.7 mM), a result that is consistent with our previous study (10Zhang Z. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Vu H. Monge J.C. Tao Y. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26920-26926Google Scholar). It should be noted that the L-form of amino acids was used in all cases; when the D-form (nonmetabolizable) amino acids were used, no effect was obtained. The effects of a single high concentration of the individual amino acids (27.7 mM) was tested on albumin secretion, apoAI secretion, total protein secretion, and apoB100 secretion by the HepG2 cells, and these results are shown in Fig. 2. On the left are shown the results for the effect of individual amino acids on apoB100 secretion. The results are shown in the same order as in Fig. 1 with the control (basal) shown at the top followed by those amino acids having the least to the most effect on inhibition of apoB100 secretion at the bottom. In the other three panels are shown the effects of individual amino acids on secreted protein (measured as radiolabeled leucine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein), apoAI, and albumin (both measured by immunoassay). Basal levels for [3H]leucine incorporation into protein were 2.3 ± 0.9 × 105 cpm/mg of cell protein, and for apoAI and albumin they were 1.38 ± 0.2 and 16.1 ± 2.6 μg/mg of cell protein, respectively. Basal levels for apoB secretion were 6.6 ± 0.7 μg/mg of cell protein. Inhibitory effects are shown in solid bars, stimulatory effects in hatched bars. In no instance was a major inhibitory effect demonstrated on apoAI, albumin, or total secreted protein. On the contrary, increased concentrations of individual amino acids tended to be associated with an overall increase in total secreted protein (average 25 ± 7% increase over basal amino acid levels in MEM). ApoAI secretion changed moderately (average 28 ± 15% increase), whereas there was a larger increase in albumin secretion (average 56 ± 35% increase). All these data stand in contrast to the results observed for apoB100. There was no significant effect of the individual amino acids on overall cell protein synthesis (data not shown). Lipoprotein Lp(a) mass in a medium of HepG2 cells was also measured. The effect of the individual amino acids on Lp(a) is shown in Fig. 3. Again, the results of the individual amino acids are shown in the same pattern as in Fig. 1. Average basal Lp(a) levels were 1.1 ± 0.25 μg/mg of cell protein at 3.46 mM amino acid concentration in MEM and were taken as 100%. Note that those amino acids that had no effect or little effect on apoB100 also had no or little effect on Lp(a) (Fig. 3, left and center panels). The same pattern did not hold true for the individual amino acids that had the most effect on apoB100. In some cases, those amino acids that had a profound inhibitory effect on apoB100 also decreased Lp(a). This was the case for Tyr, Cys, and Gln. In the presence of tryptophan Trp, which markedly decreased apoB100 levels, Lp(a) was undetectable at concentrations greater than 13 mM. In contrast, Met and Phe, which decreased apoB100 levels 63-88%, had little inhibitory effect on Lp(a) secretion. It has been suggested that a heparin or proline wash can release cell membrane bound apo(a) (19White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ELISA was modified to detect free apo(a) by using a polyclonal antibody to apo(a) as detecting antibody; however, even under these conditions, no free apo(a) was detected. The comparison between the effect of individual amino acids on apoB100 and Lp(a) secretion from the HepG2 cells is shown in Fig. 4. For each concentration curve of amino acids (shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3), a slope was calculated representing the average percentage change in apoB100/mM amino acid or Lp(a)/mM amino acid. An overall decrease in either apoB100 or Lp(a) results in a negative slope, where the slopes for apoB100 are plotted on the x axis and those for Lp(a) on the y axis. Taken together, there appears to be less effect of amino acids on Lp(a) than there is on apoB100. Note that substantial effects on Lp(a) secretion are only present where there is also a major inhibition of apoB100. In order to determine the mechanism of the effect of the specific amino acids on apoB secretion we looked at intracellular lipid mass and lipoprotein lipid secretion in the HepG2 cells. Two individual amino acids (Asn and Gln) and a combination of three branched chain amino acids (BCAA; Leu, Ile, and Val at a 1:1:1 ratio) were chosen, which corresponded to amino acids that had a stimulatory effect (Asn), a minor inhibitory effect (BCAA), or a more pronounced inhibitory effect (Gln), as shown in the three panels in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 5, top panel, supplementation with Asn (27.7 mM) increased medium apoB slightly as compared with the control. A high concentration of branched chain amino acids or of glutamine (27.7 mM) resulted in substantial and significant decreases in media apoB (−52%, p < 0.05, and −76%, p < 0.025, respectively). This effect was primarily seen in the d 1.006-1.063 g/ml lipoprotein fraction (intermediate density lipoprotein + LDL), which represented the majority of apoB lipoproteins as shown in Fig. 5, top panel. By contrast, there was little effect on the d < 1.006 g/ml very low density lipoproteins, although this fraction constituted a much smaller percentage of the overall apoB secreted. The effects of selected amino acids on secreted lipids are shown in the remaining three panels of Fig. 5 for CE (second panel), TG (third panel), and cholesterol (CHOL) (bottom panel). Incubation with asparagine had no effect on secreted CE mass, either the total d < 1.006 g/ml lipoprotein fraction or the d 1.006-1.063 g/ml lipoprotein fraction. However, incubation with BCAA and Gln does result in a significant decrease in both total medium CE mass and in d 1.006-1.063 g/ml lipoprotein CE mass. Although the decrease in the 1.006-1.063 fraction is small, it is significant (p < 0.05 for branched chain amino acids; p < 0.025 for glutamine). By contrast, although there is a proportion of the total medium CE that is secreted in the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction, there is no significant change with any of the amino acid incubations. With respect to both TG and CHOL, there is no significant change in the amount of lipid mass secreted with any of the amino acids in either total medium or lipoprotein fractions. As a result of the decrease in the apoB secretion into the media, the lipid/apoB ratio increased. Thus, the TG/apoB ratio increased in both the medium (4.3-fold, p < 0.01) and in the d 1.006-1.063 g/ml lipoproteins (6.5-fold, p < 0.01) following glutamine supplementation. CE mass appeared to follow that of apoB, however, and overall there was no significant change in the CE/apoB ratio. The intracellular lipid mass under the same conditions is shown in Table I. There was no change in intracellular CE mass, CHOL mass, or TG mass following incubation with any of the specific amino acids: asparagine, branched chain amino acids, and glutamine. Although the secretion of apoB is clearly decreased, consequently affecting secretion of lipid, the specific amino acids do not appear to affect intracellular lipid mass.Table IEffect of specific amino acids on intracellular lipid mass in HepG2 cellsCETGCHOLμg/mg cell proteinControl5.9 ± 1.482 ± 1518.0 ± 0.9Asn5.5 ± 1.064 ± 1219.0 ± 1.6BCAA6.3 ± 0.884 ± 1119.0 ± 0.5Gln5.6 ± 0.169 ± 618.6 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab In order to verify these observations in HepG2 cells, we also investigated the effect of a mixture of amino acids on lipid and lipoprotein secretion in a primary hepatocyte model. Primary hamster hepatocytes were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then exposed to basal control media with and without supplementation of amino acids (27.7 mM), as shown in Fig. 6. The cells were cultured for 24 h immediately after plating and also for an additional 24 h (48 h total). Primary hepatocytes are routinely cultured in an enriched medium (DMEM) containing 3 mg/ml glucose to increase viability and durability of the cells. However, we also conducted these experiments in a standard glucose medium (MEM containing 1 g/liter of glucose) in order to mimic the same conditions as those that were used in the HepG2 cells (MEM, 48 h total in amino acid-supplemented media). As shown in Fig. 6 (top panel), apoB secretion was greater in the DMEM as compared with the MEM. In addition,"
https://openalex.org/W2099256558,"To characterize the conformational transitions that lead to activation of catalysis by the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex, we have determined the solvent effects of a co-substrate, β-mercaptoethanol, and of a model nonsubstrate, ethanol, on the catalytic and spectroscopic properties of the enzyme. Our results show that ethanol and β-mercaptoethanol both alter the equilibrium distribution of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate intermediates formed in the reactions of L-serine at the β site in the α2β2 complex. Addition of increasing concentrations of ethanol increases the proportion of the external aldimine of L-serine and decreases the proportion of the external aldimine of aminoacrylate. Low concentrations of the co-substrate β-mercaptoethanol (Kd = ∼13 mM) decrease the proportion of the external aldimine of aminoacrylate and induce formation of the quinonoid of S-hydroxyethyl-L-cysteine. Higher concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol decrease the concentration of the quinonoid intermediate and increase the proportion of the external aldimine of L-serine. Data analysis shows that β-mercaptoethanol and ethanol both interact or bind preferentially with the conformer of the enzyme that predominates when the aldimine of L-serine is formed and shift the equilibrium in favor of this conformer. We propose that a nonpolar region of the β subunit, possibly the hydrophobic indole tunnel, becomes less exposed to solvent in the conformational transition that activates the α2β2 complex.

To fully understand the relationships between enzyme structure and function, it is important to determine how enzyme activity is regulated by protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand interaction. Investigations employing spectroscopic techniques can furnish valuable insight into the regulation of catalytic intermediates and of conformational states.

The crystal structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium (7Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar) revealed that the active sites of the α and β subunits are ∼25 Å apart and are connected by a hydrophobic tunnel. This tunnel provides a plausible structural route for transfer of indole, which is produced by cleavage of indole 3-glycerol phosphate at the active site of the α subunit, to the active site of the β subunit in the α2β2 complex. The isolated β2 subunit and the α2β2 complex contain one PLP coenzyme at each β active site and catalyze a number of PLP-dependent reactions including the β-replacement reactions with L-serine and indole (Equation 2) and with L-serine and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (Equation 3).

Formation of the external aldimine of aminoacrylate (E-AA) is thought to be accompanied by a conformational transition that activates the enzyme (see “Discussion”). The present work investigates the effects of β-mercaptoethanol, which is a co-substrate for the β2 subunit and the α2β2 complex in Equation 3, and of ethanol, which is not a substrate, on the absorption and fluorescence properties of catalytic intermediates formed by the α2β2 complex and β2 subunit. We find that β-mercaptoethanol and ethanol both bind or interact preferentially with the conformer of the enzyme that predominates when the aldimine of L-serine is formed (E-Ser) and shift the equilibrium in favor of this conformer. We propose that a nonpolar region of the β subunit, possibly the hydrophobic indole tunnel, becomes less exposed to solvent in the conformational transition that accompanies formation of E-AA and activates the α2β2 complex. Indole-3-propanol phosphate (IPP) was a generous gift of Kasper Kirschner. Buffer B (50 mM sodium N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine containing 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.8) was used throughout. The S. typhimurium tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex (8Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Google Scholar) and α and β2 subunits (9Yang X.-J. Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 347-354Google Scholar) were purified to homogeneity by the cited methods. Protein concentrations were determined from the specific absorbance at 278 nm of the holo β2 subunit (E1% = 6.5), the holo α2β2 complex (E1% = 6.0), and the α subunit (E1% = 4.4) (10Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were made using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer at 23°C. Fluorescence emission of the L-serine external aldimine was determined at 510 nm with excitation at 420 nm using a Perkin-Elmer model MPF-44B fluorimeter. Circular dichroism measurements (mean residue ellipticity in degrees cm2/dmol) of the β2 subunit and α2β2 complex were made in a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter, equipped with a DP-500N data processor (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Easton MD) and thermostated by a circulating water bath. Gel filtration chromatography used a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in a LCC-501 Plus fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia-LKB) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCl in the presence or absence of 0.5 Mβ-mercaptoethanol. The α2β2 complex (0.6-1.0 mg/ml) in the equilibration buffer was injected and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with the same buffer. The α2β2 complex eluted as a single peak under both conditions. Ultrafiltration of the α2β2 complex (0.6-1.0 mg/ml in buffer B containing 0.5 Mβ-mercaptoethanol) utilized Centricon-100 (Amicon) filters with molecular weight cutoff = 100,000. In the presence or absence of 0.5 Mβ-mercaptoethanol, less than 5% of the protein was detected in the filtrate, whereas the isolated α subunit passes freely through the filter (11Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Google Scholar). The data for the reactions of the α2β2 complex with L-serine in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol or ethanol were fit to the models in Schemes II and III (see “Results”). For reactions in the presence of ethanol, k2 = 0 and thus E-Q = 0.

Open table in a new tab We have first investigated the solvent effects of a model nonsubstrate, ethanol, on the enzymatic reactions with L-serine (Fig. 1). 3Ethanol and β-mercaptoethanol have very small effects on the spectroscopic properties of the α2β2 complex alone in the absence of serine which do not contribute to the effects seen in the presence of L-serine. The highest concentrations of alcohols used in this work (4 M ethanol and 1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol) reduced the absorbance of the α2β2 complex at λmax = 412 nm by about 5%. The reaction of L-serine with PLP at the active sites of the β2 subunit and α2β2 complex proceeds through the external aldimines of L-serine (E-Ser) and aminoacrylate (E-AA) (see structures in Scheme I) (12Drewe W.J. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Google Scholar, 13Drewe W.J. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2494-2501Google Scholar, 14Miles E.W. Dolphin D. Poulson D. Avramovic O. Pyridoxal Phosphate and Derivatives. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 253-310Google Scholar). In the absence of a co-substrate (e.g. indole or β-mercaptoethanol), the reaction cannot proceed beyond the E-AA and the catalytic steps are reversible (15Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Google Scholar, 16Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 561-570Google Scholar). E-Ser exhibits maximum absorbance at 424 nm and strong fluorescence emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 410 nm (17Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Google Scholar). E-Ser is the predominant intermediate that accumulates upon addition of L-serine to the β2 subunit (17Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Google Scholar, 18Miles E.W. Hatanaka M. Crawford I.P. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2742-2753Google Scholar). The spectrum observed upon addition of L-serine to the α2β2 complex in aqueous solution (Fig. 1A, spectrum 0) exhibits an absorption maximum near 350 nm and a broad envelope of absorbance that extends out to ∼525 nm as described previously (17Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Google Scholar). The band at 350 nm has been attributed to E-AA (see “Discussion”) (12Drewe W.J. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Google Scholar, 19Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Google Scholar). Addition of increasing ethanol concentrations decreases the absorbance at 350 nm and increases the absorbance at 424 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). The presence of an isosbestic point in the spectra in Fig. 1A indicates that ethanol shifts the equilibrium distribution of the two species from E-AA to E-Ser. The fluorescence data in Fig. 1C show that the E-Ser intermediate formed by the β2 subunit is not affected by low concentrations of ethanol, whereas the E-AA intermediate formed by the α2β2 complex is converted to E-Ser under the same conditions. To account for the results in Fig. 1, we postulate a simple model (Scheme II) E−Ser↔k0E−AAk1∫∫k1E−Ser↔E−AA(ROH)N(ROH)M in which both forms of the enzyme (E-Ser and E-AA) show weak “binding” 4See “Discussion” for consideration of the mechanism of solvent interaction or binding to tryptophan synthase. of ethanol (ROH), up to N moles/mol to E-Ser and up to M moles/mol to E-AA; k0 is the intrinsic equilibrium constant for the interconversion of E-Ser and E-AA and k1 is the apparent average binding constant of ethanol (ROH) to the protein as cosolvent. If N > M, then the theory of linked functions (20Wyman J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1968; 1: 35-80Google Scholar) predicts that increasing concentrations of alcohol will shift the equilibrium from E-AA toward E-Ser, as observed. The curves in Fig. 1, B and C, for the effects of ethanol on the reaction with L-serine were obtained by separate fits of the data to Equation 6 (see “Data Analysis” under “Materials and Methods”), assuming that the changes in absorbance and fluorescence parallel the conversion of E-AA to E-Ser by increasing concentration of ethanol and that k2 = 0. Derived values of k0, k1, and N − M are shown in Table I. The good fits of the data for the α2β2 complex to this model in Fig. 1, B and C, shows that the main effect of ethanol on the enzyme structure is to shift the equilibrium from E-AA toward E-Ser. The β-replacement reaction of L-serine with the co-substrate β-mercaptoethanol (Equation 3) proceeds through the intermediates shown in Scheme I. Fig. 2A shows that the reaction of the α2β2 complex with L-serine and low concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol leads to disappearance of absorbance at 350 nm (E-AA) and appearance of absorbance at 470 nm (E-Q).3 Addition of higher concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2B) results in decrease in absorbance at 470 nm (E-Q) and an increase in absorbance at 424 nm (E-Ser). The effects of β-mercaptoethanol concentration on the distribution of E-Ser, E-AA, and E-Q were measured by absorbance (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, B and C) and fluorescence (Fig. 3D) spectroscopy. To account for the results in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, we postulate the model in Scheme III where N = the moles of β-mercaptoethanol/mole bound3 to E-Ser, M = moles of β-mercaptoethanol/mol bound to E-AA and E-Q, and N > M; k0 is the intrinsic equilibrium constant for the interconversion of E-Ser and E-AA, k1 is the apparent average binding constant of β-mercaptoethanol (ROH) to the protein as cosolvent, and k2 is the binding constant of β-mercaptoethanol to the protein as a substrate. The model in Scheme III E−Ser↔k0E−AA↔E−Qk2ROHk1∫∫k1E−Ser↔E−AA↔E-Q (ROH)M(ROH)N(ROH)M∫k1SCHEME3 shows two competing equilibria: 1) specific binding of β-mercaptoethanol as a co-substrate to E-AA and 2) a cosolvent effect on the equilibrium between E-Ser and E-AA similar to that observed with ethanol in Scheme II. Thus, preferential binding of β-mercaptoethanol (ROH) to E-Ser shifts the equilibrium from E-Q to E-Ser. The good fits of the data in Fig. 3, B-D, to this model indicate that the equilibrium between E-AA and E-Q is not affected by the concentration of β-mercaptoethanol. The curves in Fig. 3, B and C, for the effects of β-mercaptoethanol on the reaction with L-serine were obtained by simultaneous fits of the data to Equations 4 and 5, assuming that the loss in absorbance at 350 nm measures the disappearance of E-AA and the changes in absorbance at 470 nm follow the variation in E-Q. Derived values of k0, k1, and N − M are shown in Table I. Curves in Fig. 3A showing the predicted variation of E-Ser, E-AA, and E-Q as a function of β-mercaptoethanol concentration were calculated using constants (see Table I) derived from data in Fig. 3, B-D, to fit the model in Scheme III. Although it was anticipated that analysis of the two experiments with ethanol and β-mercaptoethanol would give similar values of k0, the equilibrium constant for the interconversion of E-Ser and E-AA in the absence of cosolvent, the values obtained differ by 50-fold (Table I). Two factors may be responsible for this disagreement. First, the E-Ser ⇆ E-AA equilibrium is modulated by the ionization of two groups with apparent pK values of 7.8 and 10.3 (21Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Bettati S. Rossi G.L. Fukui T. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. Wada H. Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon, New York1991: 273-275Google Scholar, 22Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Google Scholar). Protonation of these groups stabilizes E-AA about 100-fold with respect to E-Ser. Unlike ethanol, β-mercaptoethanol is a weak acid (-SH pK = 9.5). We calculated that addition of 1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol to Buffer B would lower the pH by ∼0.1 and result in a shift in the equilibrium toward E-AA, as observed. Second, rigorous analysis using the theory of linked functions over wide cosolvent concentrations requires use of cosolvent activities rather than concentration. Such data are available for aliphatic alcohols and show their dilute solutions to be extremely nonideal (23Butler J.A.V. Thomson D.W. Maclennan W.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1933; 129: 674-686Google Scholar). Because similar data are not available for β-mercaptoethanol, we have fit both sets of data as functions of concentration, not activity. We expect that solutions of β-mercaptoethanol may show similar nonideality and that nonideality may distort extrapolations of our results to the absence of cosolvent in both cases. Ligands that bind to the active site of the α subunit (indole-3-glycerol phosphate, indole-3-propanol phosphate (IPP), D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and α-glycerol 3-phosphate) are known to alter the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates at the active site of the β subunit 25 Å distant (21Mozzarelli A.

Addition of IPP results in a small increase in the Kd for β-mercaptoethanol as a substrate and in a much larger increase in the concentration of β-mercaptoethanol needed to shift the equilibrium from E-Q to E-Ser (Fig. 3C and Table I). The α2β2 complex does not dissociate into α subunit and β2 subunit when subjected to ultrafiltration on a Centricon-100 (Amicon) membrane or to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose column in the presence of 0.5 Mβ-mercaptoethanol (see “Materials and Methods”) or 5 M ethanol (11Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Google Scholar). Although ethanol (2.5 M) has no effect on the near UV/visible circular dichroism spectrum of the α2β2 complex (Fig. 4A), ethanol does decrease the ellipticity of the PLP coenzyme of the β2 subunit at 412 nm. These results indicate that the α2β2 complex is more stable than the β2 subunit in 2.5 M ethanol and does not dissociate under these conditions. The good fits of our data (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Table I) to the models in Schemes II and III provide evidence that ethanol and β-mercaptoethanol interact preferentially with the conformer of the enzyme that predominates when E-Ser is formed and that this interaction shifts the equilibrium from E-AA and E-Q to E-Ser. We now ask what is the mechanism of interaction of these cosolvents with tryptophan synthase? Cosolvents affect the stability of proteins either by direct binding or by preferential exclusion (32Arakawa T. Carpenter J.F. Kita Y.A. Crowe J.H. Cryobiology. 1990; 27: 401-415Google Scholar, 33Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Google Scholar, 34Timasheff S.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 253-269Google Scholar). Preferential exclusion of the cosolvent results in preferential hydration and in stabilization of the protein, whereas preferential binding can result in protein denaturation. Certain compounds including ethanol stabilize proteins at low temperatures (i.e. are cryoprotectants), yet can also induce protein denaturation at higher temperatures. Arakawa et al. (32Arakawa T. Carpenter J.F. Kita Y.A. Crowe J.H. Cryobiology. 1990; 27: 401-415Google Scholar) have proposed that at higher temperatures, which favor hydrophobic interactions, the hydrophobic character of compounds such as ethanol predominates, leading to direct interaction with hydrophobic residues in the protein. Recent 13C NMR studies have demonstrated the direct binding of the methyl group of ethanol to a hydrophobic pocket(s) in bovine serum albumin (35Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Daragan V.A. Schroeder F. Mayo K.H. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 340-347Google Scholar). Although our experimental results do not distinguish between preferential exclusion and preferential binding of alcohols, we have used the site binding models described in Schemes II and III because it is more amenable to a mathematical description of the results (Table I). However, a mechanism of direct hydrophobic interaction of alcohols with tryptophan synthase is supported by our earlier finding that inhibition of tryptophan synthase by straight chain monofunctional alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol) is proportional to the hydrophobicity and to the chain length of the alcohols (11Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Google Scholar). The apparent concentration of ethanol that inhibits half of the activity of the α2β2 complex in the reaction of L-serine and indole (Ki′ = 0.55 M) (11Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Google Scholar) is quite similar to the concentration of ethanol (C0.5 = ∼0.8 M) that induces half maximal change in absorbance at 424 nm (Fig. 1B) and of fluorescence emission at 510 nm (Fig. 1C). The combined results of the two studies indicate that ethanol binds directly to hydrophobic sites on tryptophan synthase. We were initially surprised to find that β-mercaptoethanol was a stronger perturbant of the conformational equilibrium (C0.5 = ∼0.5, Fig. 3C) than ethanol since ethylene glycol had no inhibitory effect (11Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Google Scholar). However, using the method of Rekker and de Kort (36Reeker R.F. de Kort H.M. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1979; 14: 479-488Google Scholar), we calculated log P values (a measure of hydrophobicity) for ethanol (−0.20) and β-mercaptoethanol (−0.16). Thus, β-mercaptoethanol is more hydrophobic than ethanol, consistent with the greater potency of β-mercaptoethanol. In agreement with our analysis, numerous hydrophobicity scales used in discussions of protein structures all assign cysteine (−CH2SH side chain) as significantly more hydrophobic than serine (−CH2OH side chain) (reviewed in Ref. 37Eisenberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-623Google Scholar). What do our results tell us about the mechanism of catalysis and the mechanism of activation of tryptophan synthase? Our most important conclusion is that the conformer of the enzyme that predominates when the aldimine of L-serine (E-Ser) is formed binds more ethanol or β-mercaptoethanol and therefore has more hydrophobic character than the conformer of the enzyme that predominates when the aldimine of aminoacrylate (E-AA) is formed. What else is known about the transition between these two conformers? Our group (38Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Google Scholar, 39Ruvinov S.B. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17333-17338Google Scholar) and Dunn's group (30Houben K.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2421-2429Google Scholar, 31Brzovic' P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Google Scholar, 40Leja C.A. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6552-6561Google Scholar, 41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar) have developed models which propose that formation of E-AA triggers the change in conformation from an “open” to a “closed” form (Scheme IV; H2O β−ME H+E+Ser↔E−Ser↔E−AA↔E−Q↔E−S−HEC↔E+S−HECopen closed closed open SCHEME IV for abbreviations, see Scheme I legend). Recent evidence indicates that the conformer that predominates when the quinonoid intermediate E-Q is formed is also in the closed form and the conformer that predominates when the aldimine intermediate E-S-hydroxyethyl-L-cysteine is formed is in the open form (Scheme IV) (41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar). Formation of E-AA is associated with activation of the β site for reaction with nucleophiles and of the α site for reaction with indole-3-glycerol phosphate (31Brzovic' P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Google Scholar, 42Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Google Scholar, 43Banik U. Zhu D.-M. Chock P.B. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12704-12711Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that activation of the β subunit, which accompanies conversion of E-Ser to E-AA, must be associated with a conformational transition that removes some nonpolar region of the β subunit from exposure to solvent (i.e. N > M, Table I). What is the location of the nonpolar region removed from contact with solvent in the conformational transition? A possible location is in the hydrophobic indole tunnel that connects the active sites of the α and β subunits. This possibility is attractive because it would help to explain other results with tryptophan synthase. Several mutant forms of the α2β2 complex have much faster rates than the wild type α2β2 complex in β-elimination reactions of L-serine or β-chloro-L-alanine (38Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Google Scholar). To account for this observation, we proposed that hydrolysis of the E-AA intermediate occurs in each mutant complex because the β subunit is unable to undergo the transition from open, solvent accessible conformer to a closed, less solvent accessible conformer (Scheme II) (38Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Google Scholar). Our new results provide direct chemical data to support this hypothesis. Indirect evidence for a solvent-excluded active site in E-AA has come from recent studies that demonstrate slow exchange of the enzyme-bound 2H abstracted from the α-carbon of E-Ser with 1H from solvent water (44Hur O.

This work also provides evidence for a low barrier hydrogen bond in the E-AA intermediate and suggests that this bond may play an important role in catalysis. Low barrier hydrogen bonds are stabilized by the absence of solvent. The presence of the E-AA intermediate in a solvent-excluded active site would also explain why this intermediate has an absorption maximum at 350 nm (Fig. 2A), whereas aminoacrylate aldimines in model and enzymatic systems absorb maximally at 450-480 nm (45Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2023-2029Google Scholar, 46Schnackerz K.D. Ehrlich J.H. Giesemann W. Reed T.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3557-3563Google Scholar). Investigations of the solvent-dependent equilibria between tautomers of Schiff bases (aldimines) of amines with salicylaldehyde and with PLP (see (47Kallen R.G. Korpela R. Martell A.E. Matsushima Y.

Cahill A. Metzler D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 6075-6082Google Scholar) and references therein) have demonstrated that enolimine tautomers, which are neutral species that are favored by nonpolar environments, absorb at much lower wavelengths than ketoenamine tautomers, which are dipolar, resonance stabilized species that are favored by more polar environments. It follows that the observed absorption peak at 350 nm (Fig. 2A) is appropriate for that of the enolimine tautomer of the aminoacrylate aldimine in a nonpolar environment. The ligand-induced conformational transitions depicted in Scheme IV have also been investigated by use of two fluorescent probes, Nile Red (49Ruvinov S.B. Yang X.-J. Parris K. Banik U. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Sackett D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6357-6369Google Scholar) and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) (41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar). The former studies provide evidence that active site and allosteric ligands prevent Nile Red binding to a hydrophobic site in the indole tunnel (49Ruvinov S.B. Yang X.-J. Parris K. Banik U. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Sackett D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6357-6369Google Scholar). The latter studies demonstrate that the transition from the open to closed conformation prevents ANS binding. Although the location and mode of ANS binding to tryptophan synthase are unknown, ANS may bind in the hydrophobic tunnel or to disordered surface loop structures (41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar). The ANS results might indicate that the open conformation of tryptophan synthase has more hydrophobic binding sites than the closed form, as we propose on the basis of the cosolvent binding studies presented in the present work. However, the interaction of ANS with proteins may be due not only to hydrophobic forces, but also to electrostatic forces, as ANS has a water-soluble sulfonyl group (50Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar). ANS can also bind with β structural polypeptides even in the absence of hydrophobic side chains (50Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar). Thus our results give more direct evidence than the ANS results on the hydrophobic properties of the open and closed conformations. Does tunnel closure play a role in catalysis by tryptophan synthase? Dunn and co-workers have argued that tunnel closure would be counterproductive for channeling of indole between the α and β sites (41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar). However, tunnel closure may be a dynamic, fluctuating process. Because the rate of indole diffusion through the tunnel (>1000 s−1) is much faster than the rate-limiting step in the αβ reaction (8 s−1) (42Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Google Scholar, 43Banik U. Zhu D.-M. Chock P.B. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12704-12711Google Scholar, 51Anderson K.S. Kim A.Y. Quillen J.M. Sayers E. Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29936-29944Google Scholar), the tunnel could be closed most of the time without impeding the rate of indole transfer. The combined results from the cited studies (38Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Google Scholar, 44Hur O. Leja C. Dunn M.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6357-6369Google Scholar) and the solvent studies presented here suggest that ligand-mediated tunnel closure results in exclusion of solvent from the active site of the β subunit in the active conformer. Solvent exclusion from the β site may prevent the unwanted side reaction, hydrolysis of E-AA to form pyruvate and ammonia (38Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Google Scholar), and stabilize an activated form of the enzyme (44Hur O. Leja C. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7378-7386Google Scholar). Our results also provide conditions for trapping an alternative conformational state of the α2β2 complex. The ability to preferentially accumulate the E-Ser intermediate in the presence of low concentrations of ethanol may be useful for future crystallographic studies, kinetic studies, and analysis by NMR. Several PLP enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (52Metzler D.E. Metzler C.M. Mollova E.T. Scott R.D. Tanase S. Kogo K. Higaki T. Morino Y. J. Biol.

Metzler, and E. W. Miles, unpublished results. display a series of distinct 1H NMR resonances in the downfield 10-18 ppm region. 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate-CoA ligase in the presence of different substrates have been interpreted as giving evidence for low-barrier hydrogen bonds (54Tong H. Davis L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3362-3367Google Scholar). Since the discovery that β-mercaptoethanol is a co-substrate for tryptophan synthase in a β-replacement reaction (Equation 3) (17Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Google Scholar) and in a thiol-dependent transamination reaction (18Miles E.W. Hatanaka M. Crawford I.P. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2742-2753Google Scholar), several investigations of these reactions have used β-mercaptoethanol in the concentration range of 10-140 mM (8Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Google Scholar, 15Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Google Scholar, 40Leja C.A. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6552-6561Google Scholar, 41Pan P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5002-5013Google Scholar). These high concentrations were used to avoid depletion of β-mercaptoethanol due to turnover and to increase the binding of β-mercaptoethanol. Our model predicts that solvent effects of β-mercaptoethanol would be observable at concentrations as low as 10 mM, a concentration frequently used in buffers as a reducing agent in enzyme studies. For example, an investigation of the effects of a disulfide engineered into T4 lysozyme, compared thermal inactivation of the oxidized mutant enzyme with that of the reduced enzyme in the presence of 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol (55Perry L.J. Wetzel R. Science. 1984; 226: 555-557Google Scholar). A later study reported that T4 lysozyme crystals are very difficult to grow in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol and utilized 60 mMβ-mercaptoethanol in the crystallization of the reduced form of T4 lysozyme having an engineered disulfide (56Jacobson R.H. Matsumura M. Faber H.R. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 46-57Google Scholar). An investigation of the thermal inactivation of α-mannosidase, an enzyme devoid of cysteine or cystine, demonstrated that a higher concentration of β-mercaptoethanol (0.26 M) reduced the TI from 68 to 58°C and facilitated subunit dissociation (57Einhoff W. Kummer H. Rudiger H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 405-407Google Scholar). These authors proposed that β-mercaptoethanol may act as an organic solvent. In another study, β-mercaptoethanol was suggested to cause the inactivation of (Na+K+)-ATPase by dual functions as a reducing agent and as an organic solvent via a delocalized protein denaturation mechanism (58Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4227-4232Google Scholar). Our present investigation is the first thorough analysis of the effect of β-mercaptoethanol concentration on properties of an enzyme lacking disulfides and comparison of the solvent effects of β-mercaptoethanol with those of ethanol. The results serve as a practical warning of the possible solvent effects of β-mercaptoethanol at concentrations as low as 10 mM."
https://openalex.org/W2074782625,"Insulin signaling results in rapid changes to the cell cytoskeleton, and it has recently been shown that insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of the cytoskeletal-associated tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK). We report here that mutation of two tryptic cleavage sites (Lys164 and Lys582→ Asn; 2N) in the insulin receptor α-subunit results in a cell-line (CHO.2N-10) with altered morphology associated with an increase in cell size, a decrease in cell adhesiveness, and a decrease in pp125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of insulin (45.2 ± 9.7% compared to nontransfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells). In contrast to pp125FAK, paxillin phosphorylation was similar in all cell lines despite lower levels (61.0 ± 10.4% compared to CHO cells) of paxillin protein in CHO.2N-10 cells. We observed comparable protein levels of pp125FAK and the structural focal adhesion protein, vinculin, in all cell lines. Despite underphosphorylation of pp125FAK in the basal state, insulin stimulation of CHO.2N-10 cells still resulted in dephosphorylation of pp125FAK. CHO.2N-10 and CHO.T (overexpress wild-type insulin receptor) cells have similar insulin binding characteristics, insulin-stimulated autokinase and peptide phosphorylation, and insulin-stimulated pp185/IRS-1 phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the insulin receptor may play an important role in cell-matrix interactions, such as modulating cell adhesion and inducing cell architecture changes.

Our results suggest that the insulin receptor may play an important role in cell-matrix interactions, such as modulating cell adhesion and inducing cell architecture changes. Interactions between growth factors and integrin signaling pathways are probably involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, shape, adhesion and migration (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 2Richardson A. Parsons J.T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 229-236Google Scholar). Integrins, the receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, provide both a physical link to the cytoskeleton (often at sites of focal adhesion) and transduce signals from the extracellular matrix. A connection is observed between integrins and stress fibers of polymerized actin, which is necessary for maintenance of cell integrity and appears to terminate at focal adhesion sites. The assemblies of structural proteins (such as α-actinin, talin, vinculin, tensin, and paxillin) that co-localize with some integrins in focal adhesions are thought to play important roles in stabilizing cell adhesion and regulating cell shape, morphology, and mobility (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). These structural proteins may also serve as a framework for the association of signaling molecules that regulate signal transduction pathways leading to integrin-induced changes in cells (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). In addition, there are now many examples of growth factor-induced regulation of components involved in integrin signaling pathways. Growth factors may rapidly stimulate actin polymerization at the plasma membrane of many cell types to produce lamellipodia and edge-ruffles (e.g. PDGF 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorFAKfocal adhesion kinaseCHOChinese hamster ovary2Ninsulin receptor with a double point mutation (K164N/K582N)IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateHRPhorseradish peroxidasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisα-MEMα-modified Eagles's mediumFCSfetal calf serumBSAbovine serum albumin. and insulin) (3Ridley A.J.

Conversely, components of growth factor signaling pathways (such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade) are probably utilized by integrins as part of their signal transduction pathways (7Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 8Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

A key enzyme in cytoskeletal rearrangements/interactions/architecture appears to be the phosphorylated, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) which plays a central role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Apart from activation by integrins, specific tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK is also induced by several growth factors (9Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (10Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Google Scholar) and neuropeptides (11Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Google Scholar, 12Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Google Scholar), suggesting that several diverse signaling pathways may converge at this point. The N-terminal sequence of pp125FAK can bind synthetic peptides derived from several β-integrin cytoplasmic domains, although an in vivo association has not yet been demonstrated (2Richardson A. Parsons J.T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 229-236Google Scholar); indeed, an indirect linkage via talin (13Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Google Scholar) has recently been proposed. Within the C terminus of pp125FAK, a focal adhesion targeting sequence is both necessary and sufficient to localize pp125FAK to focal adhesions (14Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Google Scholar). The cytoskeletal protein, paxillin, also associates with pp125FAK through a C-terminal sequence of pp125FAK distinct from the focal adhesion targeting domain (15Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Google Scholar, 16Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Google Scholar). Upon integrin clustering, pp125FAK is autophosphorylated on tyrosine 397 (17Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Google Scholar), and its tyrosine kinase activity is enhanced, which may then lead to association of pp125FAK with SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins such as Src, GRB2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), C-terminal Src kinase, and phospholipase Cγ to potentially form large signaling complexes which can, for instance, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. Growth factors such as PDGF stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and pp125FAK (9Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Google Scholar) and induce the association of PI 3-kinase with pp125FAK in adherent Swiss 3T3 cells (18Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidic acid and neuropeptides such as bombesin also stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and induce formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells (6Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar, 10Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Google Scholar, 12Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Google Scholar). However, while associated with cytoskeletal rearrangements, a definitive role for pp125FAK in signal transduction mechanisms that alter cytoskeletal properties remains to be determined. As discussed above, most stimuli increase pp125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Surprisingly (and perhaps in contrast to its “PDGF-like” effect on cytoskeletal changes in some cells) (5Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Google Scholar), insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of pp125FAK in rat 1 fibroblasts (19Pillay T.S. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 991-994Google Scholar) and in CHO cells (20Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Google Scholar). Unlike the bell-shaped curve of pp125FAK phosphorylation in response to PDGF, pp125FAK dephosphorylation occurs at all insulin concentrations (21Konstantopoulos N. Clark S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 387-390Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation was also reported to correlate with a marked decrease in the length and number of actin stress fibers in CHO cells overexpressing insulin receptors (22Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Google Scholar). We now report that expression, in CHO cells, of an insulin receptor mutated to change lysines 164 and 582 to asparagine leads, in the absence of insulin, to decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK, altered cell shape, and abrogated cell adhesion. These sites, which are putative tryptic cleavage sites (23Xu Q.-Y. Paxton R.J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18673-18681Google Scholar, 24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar), were mutated as part of an ongoing study to examine the mechanism of tryptic activation of the insulin receptor (24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar). The unusual phenotype of the cell line expressing the mutant insulin receptor provides further evidence for the insulin receptor as a potential regulator of cell architecture and adhesion. Human insulin receptor containing Lys164→ Asn, Lys582→ Asn, or K164N/K582N (2N) substitutions were generated using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis by Dr. L. Macaulay (CSIRO, Australia).

The following anti-integrin antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA: mouse anti-human αv monoclonal, rabbit anti-α3 affinity purified, and rabbit anti-β5 polyclonals. The monoclonal anti-rat LFA-1 β2 chain was purchased from Seikagaku Corporation, Toyko, Japan. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased either from ICN Biomedicals, Cleveland, OH (clone PY20) or Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY (clone 4G10). Secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting and conjugated to HRP were purchased from Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Dupont NEN. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. A Lys164→ Asn mutant receptor cDNA was constructed by inserting a mutagenic oligonucleotide (generated by a polymerase chain reaction, encoding the Lys164→ Asn mutation between the KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites of the human insulin receptor cDNA) into a KpnI-EcoRI digest of the insulin receptor expression vector pET (25Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Google Scholar). For mutagenesis of Lys582→ Asn, a mutant oligonucleotide was generated by a polymerase chain reaction between the AccI and BamHI sites of the insulin receptor cDNA, and then inserted into the AccI-BamHI digest of a modified pET insulin receptor expression vector. The single mutations were combined to produce the 2N mutant by inserting the EcoRI-XbaI fragment from Asn582 into the Asn164 construct. All constructs were sequenced around the insertion, subjected to extensive restriction analysis, and shown to be correct. CHO cell lines were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM) containing 10% v/v fetal calf serum (FCS). For immunofluorescence, cells were cultured on glass coverslips to 80% confluency. When required cells were serum-starved for 18 h with α-MEM containing either 0.5% v/v FCS or 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA). CHO cell lines expressing the 2N (K164N/K582N) insulin receptor (and single point mutants) were obtained by co-transfection of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of pSVNeo DNA using Lipofectin®. Transfected CHO cell lines were maintained in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate to select for stable colonies. Positive insulin receptor expressing clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Clark et al. (24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar). The only variation to the described method (24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar) was the addition of 10 mg/ml BSA after coating the microtiter plates with CT-1, to block nonspecific binding. Cell lines expressing high levels of mutant receptors were further selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously (26Clark S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1990; 5: 559-564Google Scholar), using nonbiotinylated antibody 18-44 followed by FITC-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG. In some experiments, cell sorting with simultaneous single cell cloning was performed. Several independently derived clones were analyzed. CHO cell lines were plated in 24-well plates and incubated in Earle's balanced salt solution, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.1% w/v BSA containing approximately 20,000 cpm 125I-insulin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled insulin (1-1000 ng/ml) for 4 h at 8°C. Cells were washed and solubilized, and bound radioactivity was measured in an autogamma spectrometer as described previously (27Clark S. Konstantopoulos N. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 217-223Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled insulin and was always less than 2% of total binding. Data were analyzed by the method of Scatchard (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar). CHO cells were treated with or without insulin (172 nM) and lysed, and insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody CT-1 as described previously (27Clark S. Konstantopoulos N. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 217-223Google Scholar). In vitro autophosphorylation assays were carried out after addition of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (27Clark S. Konstantopoulos N. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 217-223Google Scholar). To measure peptide phosphorylation, receptor immunoprecipates were incubated in 40 μl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl2, 100 μM Na3VO4, 2 mM MnCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% v/v Triton X-100, 50 μM ATP, and 1 mM EGTA), and the reaction was started by the addition of 200 μM FYF peptide (RRDIFETDYFRK) and 0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample for 5 min at 30°C. At this time, duplicate 10-μl aliquots were spotted onto P81 Whatman filters, washed three times in 30% w/v glacial acetic acid, 0.05% w/v phosphoric acid, rinsed in 70% v/v ethanol, and dried, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Blank values, in the absence of FYF peptide, were subtracted from each result. For IRS-1 immunoprecipitation, cells were treated as described by Konstantopoulos and Clark (21Konstantopoulos N. Clark S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 387-390Google Scholar). For insulin receptor β-subunit immunoprecipitation, cells were treated as described above and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 18-44 overnight at 4°C. To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of either IRS-1 or insulin receptor β-subunit, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated 4G10 (1:188). CHO cell lines were seeded at 10 × 103 cells/ml in 24-well plates and maintained in α-MEM containing 10% v/v FCS. Cells from individual wells were washed twice with Versene (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% v/v EDTA), and attached cells were removed by incubation with 0.25% v/v trypsin/Versene for 3 min at 37°C. Cells were counted (in triplicate) in a Coulter counter every 24 h over 5 days, and simultaneously, the Coulter counter measured the mean cell volume. For attachment assays plates were left uncoated or coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or 15 μg/ml rat tail collagen. Treated or untreated plates were blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 37°C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to the addition of cells. Cells (10-30 × 103/ml) were allowed to attach for either 2 or 24 h after plating in the presence of α-MEM containing 0.1% BSA. For filamentous actin localization, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline for 8 min at 22°C, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline, and permeabilized for 5 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After washing in Tris-buffered saline, cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (0.1 μg/ml) for 20 min at 22°C in a dark humidity chamber. After the final washes, the coverslips were mounted with a drop of Gelvatol. Cells were viewed on a LaborLux D fluorescence microscope and photographed with Kodak TMAX 400ASA film. CHO cell lines plated in 10-cm dishes were used at 60-80% confluency. Cells were lysed (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.25% w/v deoxycholic acid, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 2 mM EGTA) and pp125FAK-immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody 2A7 overnight at 4°C. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with either 1 or 10 μM pervanadate (prepared as detailed by Bennett et al. (29Bennett P.A Dixon R.J. Kellie S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 891-901Google Scholar)) for 1 h at 37°C before lysis and immunoprecipitation of pp125FAK. Vinculin was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with 10 μg of monoclonal anti-human vinculin antibody (clone h-VIN1). For paxillin immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed and scraped before immunoprecipitation as detailed by Turner et al. (30Turner C.E. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Google Scholar) with 2 μg of anti-paxillin antibody overnight at 4°C. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the volume of each cell lysate was adjusted for the amount of cellular protein or number of cells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, and 20% v/v methanol) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes via Western blotting. To detect phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated PY20 (1:5000) or HRP-conjugated 4G10 (1:188). To detect protein levels, membranes were probed with polyclonal antibody BC3 (1:500) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) for pp125FAK, monoclonal antibody to paxillin (1:10,000) or vinculin (1:400) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:5000 paxillin or 1:2000 vinculin). Membranes were stripped (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% w/v SDS and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50°C and reprobed with the desired antibodies. The bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitated by scanning densitometry. CHO cell lines and a mouse myeloid cell line (FDC-P1) were prepared for FACS analysis as described previously (26Clark S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1990; 5: 559-564Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl aliquots (approximately 2-5 × 105 cells) were incubated with the following concentrations of anti-integrin antibodies: anti-α3 (10 μg/ml), anti-αv (50 μg/ml), anti-α5 (10 μg/ml), anti-β1 (10 μg/ml), and anti-β5 (1:100). This complement of integrin antibodies was selected based on their known expression levels in CHO cells. 2M. Ginsberg and M. Hemler, personal communication. As a negative control we used the anti-β2 integrin (10 μg/ml), a hemopoietic-specific integrin not expressed in CHO cells. 3M. Ginsberg, personal communication. Following the primary antibody, cells were incubated with either FITC-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2 at 1:50 or anti-rabbit at 1:100. FACS analysis was performed on either Becton Dickson FACS II or FACstar with 10,000 cells per sample. Cellular protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye with bovine serum albumin standards (31Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Numerical results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and statistical comparisons were performed by Student's t test for unpaired samples; p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Expression of a double point mutant of the insulin receptor (2N = K164N/K582N) was initially difficult to obtain, despite production of stable cell lines expressing either of the individual point mutations alone (Lys164→ Asn or Lys582→ Asn). To avoid overgrowth of 2N-expressing cells by non-2N-expressing cells, CHO.2N cells were simultaneously FACS sorted and single-cell cloned 10 days after transfection. This method provided eight independently derived clones expressing the 2N insulin receptor (up to 15 passages) which have been studied to varying degrees. One of the highest receptor-expressing clones (2N-10) was used in most of the studies, as its binding and phosphorylation characteristics (see below) were closest to those of CHO.T cells (overexpress wild-type human insulin receptors). The mutations in the external domain of the insulin receptor were of potential trypsin cleavage sites (23Xu Q.-Y. Paxton R.J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18673-18681Google Scholar, 24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar) and mutated as part of another study (24Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Google Scholar). However, the unusual phenotype of the cells expressing the double point mutation (see below) led to the analysis presented here. In preliminary experiments, treatment of the cell lines (expressing mutant insulin receptors) with trypsin did not result in significant differences from CHO.T cells. 4N. Konstantopoulos and S. Clark, unpublished results. The ability of two CHO.2N cell lines (clones 10 and 11) to bind insulin is shown in Fig. 1. The insulin binding of CHO.2N-10 and CHO.2N-11 cells was lower than that of CHO.T cells (clone 10 at passage 6, 9.8%, and clone 11 at passage 6, 13.2%, compared to wild-type, 42.0%, of total 125I-insulin added). In addition, 125I-insulin binding to CHO.2N-10 and 2N-11 cells decreased with prolonged passage, whereas the ability of CHO.T cells to bind 125I-insulin did not alter with passage. 125I-insulin binding always correlated with the level of insulin receptor expression measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). CHO.2N-10 cells express fewer insulin receptors per cell compared to CHO.T cells as determined by Scatchard analysis (Table I). The nontransfected parent CHO cells express approximately 3 × 103 hamster insulin receptors per cell and bind very low levels of insulin (0.47% of total 125I-insulin added, see Fig. 1). The dissociation constants for insulin binding were comparable between the cell lines (Table I).Table IInsulin-binding characteristics and kinase activity of CHO.2N-10 and CHO.T insulin receptorsCHO.TCHO.2N-10 (P5 to P10)R07.72 × 1052.87 × 105Kd16.95 × 10−10M9.13 × 10−10MKd22.07 × 10−8M1.18 × 10−8MStimulation by insulin (% of basal):Autophosphorylation557 ± 105%439 ± 69%Peptide phosphorylation1989 ± 446%2008 ± 399% Open table in a new tab The autophosphorylation of insulin-stimulated CHO.2N-10 insulin receptors (passages 6-10) was similar to wild-type insulin receptors (Fig. 2, lower panel) as measured by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Autophosphorylation of CHO.2N-10 receptors was stimulated 4.4-fold by insulin compared to 5.6-fold for wild-type receptors (Table I) in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. When the insulin-stimulated kinase activity of CHO.2N-10 and wild-type receptors toward a synthetic peptide (FYF, derived from the major autophosphorylation domain of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase) was measured, phosphorylation was stimulated 20.1- and 19.9-fold, respectively (Table I). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of pp185/IRS-1 was also comparable between CHO.T and CHO.2N-10 (passage 6-8) cells (Fig. 2, upper panel). CHO.2N-10 cells (as well as four other 2N clones) showed morphological differences which disappeared upon prolonged passage. These morphological changes were not dependent on cell density. Fig. 3A is a photomicrograph of CHO.2N-10 cells at passage 7; these cells formed a heterogenous monolayer with many large, flat cells containing large, granular nuclei. In contrast, the nontransfected, parental CHO cells (Fig. 3B) or CHO.T cells (not shown) grew as a homogenous monolayer of smaller cells. At late passages (>15 passages), CHO.2N-10 cells were indistinguishable from CHO cells (not shown). This reversion in morphology strongly correlated with the loss of insulin binding (Fig. 1) and insulin receptor expression of CHO.2N-10 cells at these later passages. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of CHO.2N-10 cells at passage 9 shows the dense formation of actin stress fibers running the length of the mutant cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the nontransfected CHO cells (Fig. 3D) or CHO.T cells (not shown) stain intensely close to the plasma membrane region of the cells, which appears to be absent in the CHO.2N-10 cells (Fig. 3C). The growth of CHO.2N cell lines, especially clone 10, appeared extremely slow compared to nontransfected CHO and wild-type CHO.T cells. However, the doubling time of CHO.2N-10 cells at all passages was similar to nontransfected CHO cells when corrected for the number of cells attached to dishes after 24 h (Fig. 4). In addition, there was a significant difference in the mean cell volume, with early passage CHO.2N-10 cells having a larger volume compared to CHO cells (1973 ± 42 fl compared to 1231 ± 42 fl, p < 0.01, n = 5) correlating with the observed differences in cell size (Fig. 3, A compared to B). The apparent slower cell growth of CHO.2N-10 cells was explained by their inability to attach efficiently to tissue culture dishes at early passage. After 24 h (reflects both cell attachment and cell growth) CHO.2N-10 (passage 6) cell number was 31% of added cells compared to CHO.2N-10 cells at late passage (150% of added cells) or controls (140% of added cells) (Table II). This reduced ability to adhere to the tissue culture dishes was observed with six out of the eight independently derived clones (data not shown). This was not due to differences in extracellular matrix production by early passage CHO.2N-10 cells as these cells still showed reduced attachment to matrix elaborated by CHO.T cells, and conversely CHO.T cells attached equally"
https://openalex.org/W2012205130,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were treated with 1,2-cyclohexanedione (CHD) in sodium borate (pH 8.0). The Ca2+-ATPase activity was completely inhibited. Inhibition of Mg·ATP and Mg·ADP binding to the high affinity ATP binding site as well as inhibition of phosphorylation with ATP occurred simultaneously with the inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity. Phosphorylation with acetyl phosphate was not inhibited. The Ca2+-ATPase was strongly protected by Mg·ATP, Mg·ADP, and Mg·AMP against this inhibition. Binding of acetyl phosphate or Pi to the enzyme gave no protection. Phosphorylation with acetyl phosphate also had no protective effect. Peptide mapping of the tryptic digests, detection of peptides containing CHD-modified arginyl residues with Girard's reagent T, and sequencing revealed that Arg-489, Arg-505, and Arg-678 were modified with CHD. Arg-489 and Arg-678 were almost completely protected by Mg·ATP against this modification, but partially protected by prelabeling with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate, which occupies the adenosine binding region in the ATP binding site. In contrast, Arg-505 was slightly protected by Mg·ATP and almost completely protected by prelabeling with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate. Taken together, these findings suggest that Arg-489 and Arg-678 are located in or near the region occupied by the triphosphate moiety of ATP, either or both of these residues being in or close to the region occupied by the α-phosphoryl group in the high affinity ATP binding site and involved in the CHD-induced inhibition of this enzyme and that Arg-505 is very close to (but slightly out of) the adenosine binding region in the ATP binding site. The acetyl phosphatase activity and phosphorylation with Pi were also inhibited by the CHD treatment, but the inhibitions were considerably slower than those described above. This suggests that the arginyl residues involved in these inhibitions are distinct from that involved in the inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2095273222,"Abstract We have used an artificial DNA bending agent to monitor the local flexibility of the DNA helix as a function of Mg2+ cation concentration, sequence, and temperature. A DNA bending agent was constructed from a pair of triple helix-forming oligonucleotides connected by a flexible polymeric linker, which, when the linker is short enough, causes a bend in a minor groove region separating the two sites of triple helix formation. The unique aspect of this system is that, since the bent region is not in direct contact with the linker or the triple helix-forming oligonucleotides, the free energy reflecting the bendability of the minor helix groove can be estimated from a comparison of binding affinity between the bent and unbent triple helices. A binding competition experiment and association and dissociation kinetic assays executed at 37°C in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ have revealed an extremely small difference in binding affinity between bent (50°) and straight triple helices, suggesting that DNA flexibility with respect to minor groove compression is extremely high and virtually independent of the sequence of the distorted duplex. This unexpectedly small difference in binding affinity was detected over the temperature range from 25 to 65°C, and over a Mg2+ concentration range from 0.3 to 10 mM. Thus, these findings provide evidence that DNA bendability for minor groove compression is inherently high and independent of DNA sequence, temperature, or a 30-fold variation of Mg2+ ion concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1967760497,"The sensitivity of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent glutamate mutase toward thiol-directed reagents has been investigated. Iodoacetate specifically alkylates one cysteine residue, Cys-15, in MutS with concomitant irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Cys-15 lies between the conserved residues Asp-14 and His-16, that are believed to coordinate cobalt to form a Co-His-Asp hydrogen-bonded “triad” when AdoCbl is bound by the enzyme. Although inactive, carboxymethylated MutS still bound AdoCbl with only a 5-fold increase in apparent Kd. To determine whether Cys-15 plays an essential role in catalysis, it was mutated to serine and to alanine. These mutants were active, but both exhibited decreased Vmax and increased apparent Km and Kd for AdoCbl. To mimic the effect of carboxymethylation, Cys15 was mutated to aspartate and, as an isosteric control, to asparagine. Neither of these mutants was active: MutS-C15N bound AdoCbl approximately 10-fold weaker than wild type, whereas MutS-C15N bound AdoCbl over 100 times less strongly than wild type. The results demonstrate both coenzyme-binding and catalysis to be very sensitive to mutations at position 15 that could potentially perturb the Co-His-Asp hydrogen-bonding network.

Roove V. Suzuki F. Iodice A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3260-3266Google Scholar). It is one of a group of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes that catalyze unusual carbon-skeleton rearrangements in which a hydrogen on one carbon atom is interchanged with an electron-withdrawing group, X, on an adjacent carbon (Scheme 1) (2Ochiai E.-I.

AdoCbl functions both as the source of free radicals that are required in the mechanism and as the intermediate hydrogen carrier in the rearrangement (4Switzer R.L. Baltimore B.G. Barker H.A. J.

These enzymes are themselves part of an emerging class of enzymes that employ free radicals to effect the cleavage of otherwise unreactive carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-oxygen bonds (7Stubbe J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 257-285Google Scholar, 8Marsh E.N.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 431-441Google Scholar). The first step in all AdoCbl-mediated reactions is homolysis of the coenzyme's labile cobalt-carbon bond, which serves to “unmask” the catalytic 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (9Babior B.M. Krouwer J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 6: 35-102Google Scholar). In free solution, the cobalt-carbon bond dissociation energy is between 25 and 30 kcal/mol (10Halpern J. Kim S.-H. Leung T.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 8317-8319Google Scholar, 11Hay B.P. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4820-4825Google Scholar), but to achieve the rates of catalysis seen in the AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, this bond must be substantially weakened when the enzyme binds the coenzyme (6Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Google Scholar). Studies on free cobalamins, cobinamides, and model alkyl-cobalt compounds have indicated that both steric compression between the corrin ring and the alkyl group, and the nucleophilicity of the axial nitrogenous ligand to cobalt influence the cobalt-carbon bond strength (12Kratky C.

Soc. 1982; 104: 621Google Scholar). However, the relative importance of these effects in the enzyme-mediated homolytic cleavage of AdoCbl has remained unclear. Glutamate mutase comprises two readily separable subunits or components designated MutE and MutS (16Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Google Scholar, 17Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 44-48Google Scholar, 18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). MutS, a monomer of Mr 14,748, forms part of the cobalamin-binding site and shows sequence similarity to several other cobalamin-dependent enzymes (16Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Google Scholar, 19Beatrix B. Zelder O. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 101-109Google Scholar), in particular, a key motif, “DXHXXG,” is conserved in all these enzymes. The crystal structures of the homologous domains from AdoCbl-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and MeCbl-dependent methionine synthase have recently been solved (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Google Scholar, 21Drennen C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Google Scholar). A surprising and important feature is that the cofactor is bound in an extended conformation in which the nucleotide tail is displaced and the histidine residue of the DXHXXG motif coordinates the central cobalt atom of the coenzyme from below (Fig. 1). The carboxylate of the aspartate residue forms a hydrogen bond to the histidine to complete a Co-His-Asp “triad” analogous to the Fe-His-Asp triad of cytochrome c peroxidase (22Goodin D.B. McRee D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3313-3324Google Scholar). EPR studies of glutamate mutase (23Zelder O. Beatrix B. Kroll F. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 252-254Google Scholar) suggest that cobalt is similarly coordinated by the histidine residue of MutS. The sensitivity of MutS to thiol-directed reagents was first noted by Switzer and Barker (24Switzer R.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2658-2674Google Scholar). Our investigation of this phenomenon was prompted by the discovery that a protein thiol plays a crucial role as a the site of an intermediate, protein-based radical in the mechanism of both the AdoCbl-dependent and iron-dependent ribonucleotide reductases (25Mao S.S. Yu G.X. Chalfoun D. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9752-9759Google Scholar, 26Booker S. Licht S. Broderick J. Stubbe J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Google Scholar). However, recent experiments with isotopically labeled substrates and coenzyme appear to rule out an intermediate protein radical for glutamate mutase (5Marsh E.N.G.

The construction of the plasmids pmutS and pmutSX, and the purification of MutE and MutS proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli strains have been described previously (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). 3-Methylaspartase was purified from Clostridium tetanomorphum as described by Hsiang and Bright (27Hsiang M.W. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3079-3084Google Scholar). AdoCbl was supplied by Fluka Chemical Co.; restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Boeringer Mannheim. Iodo-[2-14C]acetic acid was purchased from Amersham Corp. The sources of other materials have either been described previously (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar) or were purchased from commercial suppliers. The mutS gene was excised from the pUC119-based plasmid, pmutS (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar) as an EcoRI-PstI fragment and subcloned into the commercial vector pALTER-1 (Promega) to give pALmutS, which was maintained in E. coli JM109. A single-stranded DNA template for mutagenesis was obtained by transfection with helper phage R408. Standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to prepare plasmid and single-stranded DNA, and to subclone DNA fragments. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were introduced into the mutS gene using the following oligonucleotides as primers for second-strand synthesis: MutS-C15A, ATT GGT TCA GAC GCT CAT GCA GTT GG; MutS-C15S, GGT TCA GAC TCT CAT GCA GTT; MutS-C15D, ATT GGT TCA GAC GAT CAT GCA GTT GG; MutS-C15N, ATT GGT TCA GAC AAT CAT GCA GTT GG. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and the mutant mutS genes were then excised from pALmutS as NdeI-SalI fragments and subcloned into pT7-7 (29Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar) to facilitate over expression of the mutant proteins in E. coli BL12 (DE3) as described previously (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). Glutamate mutase activity was assayed spectroscopically, as described previously (1Barker H.A. Roove V. Suzuki F. Iodice A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3260-3266Google Scholar, 18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). The concentrations of MutE and MutS were determined by using the following values for their absorption coefficients at 280 nm: MutE ϵ280 = 56,300 M−1 cm−1; MutS ϵ280 = 9,380 M−1 cm−1 (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). MutS mutant proteins were assumed to have the same extinction coefficients as wild type protein. Carboxymethylation was carried out at room temperature in the dark. The reaction contained 0.1 M Tris·Cl, pH 8.5, 0.14 mM MutS (1 mg), 0.65 mM dithiothreitol, and 2.4 mM iodo[2-14C]acetic acid (7160 cpm nmol−1) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. At intervals of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 45, and 100 min, 50 μl (containing 100 μg of MutS) were withdrawn from the reaction and quenched by addition of 50 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol in 0.1 M Tris·Cl, pH 8.5. After 15 min in quench solution, 1 μg of MutS was assayed for activity. The remaining quenched reaction was dialyzed overnight against 2 × 2.5 liters 15 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 4°C; samples were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and their protein content was determined from absorbance at 280 nm. Extent of radiolabeling was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Equilibrium gel filtration (30Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Google Scholar) was used to measure the binding of AdoCbl to glutamate mutase exactly as described previously (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences of HPLC-purified peptides were determined by standard automated sequencing methods on an Applied Biosystems 477 protein sequencer. Proteins were desalted by absorption onto a reverse phase C3 HPLC column and elution with an ascending gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample, 10 pmol/μl, was then analyzed on a Kratos Profile electrospray mass spectrometer. Two properties of the glutamate mutase MutS subunit indicate that cysteine residues may be important in the enzyme mechanism (24Switzer R.L. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2658-2674Google Scholar). First, MutS is irreversibly inactived by thiol-directed alkylating agents such as iodoacetate, and secondly, MutS requires prior reduction with either 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol for activity: the oxidized protein appears to form both inter- and intra-molecular disulfide linkages that render it inactive. To clarify the role of thiols in the mechanism, and to determine whether these two properties are related, we decided to identify the reactive cysteine residue(s) in MutS and examine the effect of mutating this residue on the catalysis. The inactivation of MutS with iodo[2-14C]acetate at room temperature exhibited the expected time-dependent behavior (Fig. 2). The loss of enzyme activity was well described by pseudo-first order kinetics; the first order rate constant for inactivation, calculated over the first 45 min of the reaction, was 0.15 ± 0.01 min−1. The incorporation of radiolabel into the protein mirrored the loss of activity, although it appeared to proceed slightly faster, k = 0.21 ± 0.02 min−1, this difference is probably not significant. Holo-glutamate mutase exists in equilibrium with dissociated MutS and MutE subunits and coenzyme (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). It was, therefore, not possible to demonstrate protection of MutS by MutE and/or AdoCbl because there is always a pool of free MutS protein available to react with iodoacetate. The maximal extent of labeling was 7600 ± 260 cpm/nmol of MutS which corresponded to 1.06 ± 0.04 labels per molecule of MutS. These results indicate that alkylation of only one cysteine residue is responsible for the inactivation of MutS. Radiolabeled MutS was subjected to proteolysis using endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus V8 that cleaves after glutamate residues. This protease was chosen as it should cleave between each of the four cysteine residues in MutS. After digestion, peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C8 column using a gradient of acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The total recovery of radioactivity from the column was ≈60%. Radioactivity was associated with several peptides that eluted late in the gradient. The two most highly labeled peptides contained between them 60% of the recovered radioactivity, and were subjected to automated N-terminal sequencing. In both cases sequences corresponded to a peptide starting at Lys-3 (cleaveage after Glu-2) in which Cys-15 had been modified, implying that this is the major site of modification. It was apparent from the digest that more peptides were produced than there were cleavage sites in the protein; is most likely, therefore, that the various labeled peptides were the result of partial cleavage of the protein, rather than nonspecific labeling. Significantly, Cys-15 lies between the highly conserved residues, Asp-14 and His-16 that form part of the DXHXXG cobalamin-binding motif (16Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Google Scholar). The position of Cys-15 between two residues that are important for binding cobalamin suggested that alkylation of this cysteine may have inactivated the enzyme simply because it prevented the coenzyme binding. To test this, the Kd for AdoCbl was measured for the carboxymethylated enzyme using equilibrium gel filtration (30Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Google Scholar). The apparent Kd for AdoCbl is dependent upon the relative concentrations of MutE and MutS present in the binding assay (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). The apparent Kd for AdoCbl binding to the MutE-carboxymethylated-MutS complex, determined with 12 μM MutE and 60 μM carboxymethylated-MutS, was 9.5 ± 0.7 μM, whereas the apparent Kd for the unmodified enzyme, determined under the same protein concentrations, was 1.8 ± 0.2 μM. Carboxymethylation of MutS, therefore, only raises the apparent Kd for AdoCbl by 5-fold, which does not seem sufficient to explain why the enzyme is inactivated by this modification. To examine whether Cys-15 plays an essential role in the mechanism, this residue was mutated to both serine and alanine. To investigate the effect of carboxymethylation, Cys-15 was mutated to aspartate, a change designed to probe the effect of introducing negative charge at this position; Cys-15 was also mutated to asparagine as an isosteric control. The purified proteins were analyzed by electrospray mass spectometry to confirm that the intended mutations had been correctly expressed: in each case the experimentally determined molecular weight was in excellent agreement with that calculated from the sequence (MutS-C15A: calculated Mr 14,716, found 14,713 ± 4; MutS-C15S: calculated Mr 14,732, found 14,728 ± 4; MutS-C15D: calculated Mr 14,760, found 14,763 ± 3; MutS-C15N: calculated Mr 14,759, found 14,762 ± 4). The kinetic and coenzyme-binding properties of the mutant proteins are summarized in Table I, Table II. Both the MutS-C15A and C15S mutants were active in the glutamate mutase assay, demonstrating that Cys-15 does not play an essential role in the mechanism. This is consistent with the fact that Cys-15 is not conserved in other cobalamin-dependent enzymes that share the homologous cobalamin-binding domain and DXHXXG motif (16Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Google Scholar, 31Drennen C.L. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 919-929Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were no longer sensitive to iodoacetate; after incubation with iodoacetate for 1 h at room temperature, conditions that completely inactivate wild type MutS, they remained fully active. This confirms that Cys-15 is the site of modification. For maximal activity both mutants still had to be reduced with dithiothreitol prior to assay, otherwise the proteins exhibited only about 10% activity. Therefore, the sensitivity of the protein to oxidation appears to be due to the formation of disulfide linkages between cysteine residues other than Cys-15.Table IComparison of the kinetic parameters for wild type glutamate mutase and MutS-C15A and MutS-C15S mutants enzymesMutS mutantKm for L-glutamatekcatKapp for MutSHill coefficientmMs−1nMWild type1.3 ± 0.124.1 ± 0.364 ± 21.2 ± 0.1C15A1.4 ± 0.19.0 ± 0.396 ± 61.1 ± 0.1C15S1.4 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.596 ± 161.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IIApparent Kd and Km values for AdoCbl binding to glutamate mutase with in the presence of wild type, Cys-15 mutant and carboxymethylated MutS proteinsMutS variantKmapp for AdoCblKdapp for AdoCblμMWild type5.8 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.2C15A23 ± 43.3 ± 0.2C15S38 ± 85.3 ± 0.5C15CmCInactive9.5 ± 0.7C15NInactive17 ± 3C15DInactive>100 Open table in a new tab The MutS-C15A and MutS-C15S mutants differed little in their affinity for MutE and L-glutamate when compared with the wild type enzyme. Both mutants bound MutE slightly less tightly as judged by K, the apparent dissociation constant under the conditions of the assay, and binding was weakly cooperative, as had previously been found for wild type enzyme (18Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Google Scholar). The Km for L-glutamate was, within experimental error, unchanged. The apparent Kd for AdoCbl was measured by equilibrium gel filtration. In both cases the mutants bound the coenzyme significantly more weakly than did wild type enzyme, by 2-3-fold, although this decrease in affinity for AdoCbl was much less than was seen for the inactive MutS-C15D and MutS-C15N mutants. Consistent with this, the apparent Km for AdoCbl was significantly increased, by about 4-fold for the MutS-C15A mutant and about 6-fold for the MutS-C15S mutants. Finally, although active, these mutants were impaired in catalysis as kcat for either mutant was only about one third that of wild type. Neither MutS-C15D nor MutS-C15N mutants displayed any detectable glutamate mutase activity. Therefore, the introduction of negative charge at this position does not per se appear to the reason why carboxymethylation inactivates MutS. However, these mutants exhibited a quite striking difference in their ability to bind AdoCbl. The apparent Kd for AdoCbl of MutS-C15N was 17 ± 3 μM, whereas that for the MutS-C15D mutant was too high to measure: at the highest concentration of AdoCbl (100 μM) used the mutant showed no sign of saturation. This result was surprising because the carboxymethylated enzyme binds AdoCbl quite well (apparent Kd 9.5 μM), although in this case the charge is moved further out by two bonds. Possibly, in the case of the MutS-C15D mutation, the introduction of a second negative charge closer to Asp-14 may cause the loop containing the His-Asp pair to undergo a significant change in conformation, destroying the cobalt-histidine interaction. Homolytic cleavage of AdoCbl is firmly established as the first step in AdoCbl-dependent rearrangements. However, the mechanism by which enzymes effect homolysis has remained problematical because of the unusual nature of the bond being broken and the fact that this occurs ≈1010-fold faster on the enzyme than in free solution (6Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Google Scholar, 32Finke R.G. Bleasdale C. Golding B.T. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioorganic Processes. Royal Society of Chemistry, Newcastle, UK1990: 244-280Google Scholar). Evidence from ERP studies and x-ray crystallography has shown that in many cobalamin enzymes a histidine residue is coordinated trans to the cobalt-carbon bond. In particular, the structures of the methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase cobalamin-binding domains both show the importance of the His-Asp pair of the DXHXXG motif in forming a hydrogen-bonded network to cobalt (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Google Scholar, 21Drennen C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Google Scholar). The similarity of the cobalamin-binding domain of these enzymes to MutS suggests that AdoCbl will be bound very similarly. However, not all AdoCbl-dependent enzymes contain the DXHXXG motif and it is not established whether the Co-His-Asp triad is purely structural, or if it also controls the reactivity of the coenzyme. Our investigation of the thiol sensitivity of MutS led us to identify Cys-15 as a potentially important residue before the structure of any cobalamin-dependent enzyme was published. Although Cys-15 does not play an essential role in the mechanism, our results indicate that catalysis is very sensitive to changes in this region of the protein. Thus, even the most conservative mutations cause small increases the apparent Kd and Km for AdoCbl and significantly reduce kcat although interestingly, do not appear to perturb substrate binding. Modifications that introduce good hydrogen-bonding side-chains at position-15 abolish activity and result in a more substantial weakening of coenzyme-binding. However, although weaker coenzyme-binding appears to result in decreased activity, a simple inability to bind coenzyme does not, except perhaps for the case of the MutS-C15D mutation, satisfactorily explain why some of the mutants or the carboxymethylated enzyme are inactive. It is not known how Cys-15 is oriented with respect to the Co-His-Asp triad and so it is unclear exactly how these mutations exert their effect on AdoCbl-binding. It seems unlikely that the changes in affinity for coenzyme are due to simple steric effects, because the MutS-C15N mutant binds AdoCbl at least an order of magnitude more tightly than the isosteric MutS-C15D mutant, and Cys-15-carboxymethylated MutS, a more sterically demanding modification, binds AdoCbl tighter still. Given the proximity of Cys-15 to the cobalt-coordinating histidine, we propose that mutations at this position may perturb the Co-His-Asp hydrogen-bonding network. This might occur if the mutants are able to form alternative hydrogen bonds to histidine or aspartate, otherwise if they form hydrogen bonds to other residues or backbone amides the local conformation of the protein may be distorted and cause a less favorable alignment of the Co-His-Asp triad. Certainly, the histidine ligand is important for binding AdoCbl because MutS mutants lacking His-16 bind AdoCbl with significantly reduced affinity. 2H. P. Chen and E. N. G. Marsh, unpublished data. Also, recent studies on the analogous Co-His-Asp-Ser hydrogen-bonded quartet of methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase have shown that mutation of the aspartate or serine residues in that enzyme serve to weaken the coordination of cobalt by histidine (33Jarrett J.T. Amaratunga M. Drennan C.L. Scholten J.D. Sands R.H. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2464-2475Google Scholar). Although not essential, cysteine appears to be preferred at position 15 since all the mutants are impaired to a greater or lesser extent in catalysis as well as coenzyme binding. This observation supports the idea that the Co-Asp-His triad is not just a structural motif, but is also plays an important role in catalysis. The results are consistent with a protein-induced trans effect, mediated through the histidine, operating to promote homolysis of the coenzyme's cobalt-carbon bond. Further experiments are now in progress to elucidate in more detail the mechanism by which glutamate mutase effects homolysis of AdoCbl and to establish more precisely the role of the Co-His-Asp triad in promoting this unusual bond cleavage."
