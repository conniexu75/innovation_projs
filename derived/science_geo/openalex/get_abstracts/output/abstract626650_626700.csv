https://openalex.org/W2911534815,"Summary Tissue engineering using cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells holds a promise to revolutionize drug discovery, but only if limitations related to cardiac chamber specification and platform versatility can be overcome. We describe here a scalable tissue-cultivation platform that is cell source agnostic and enables drug testing under electrical pacing. The plastic platform enabled on-line noninvasive recording of passive tension, active force, contractile dynamics, and Ca2+ transients, as well as endpoint assessments of action potentials and conduction velocity. By combining directed cell differentiation with electrical field conditioning, we engineered electrophysiologically distinct atrial and ventricular tissues with chamber-specific drug responses and gene expression. We report, for the first time, engineering of heteropolar cardiac tissues containing distinct atrial and ventricular ends, and we demonstrate their spatially confined responses to serotonin and ranolazine. Uniquely, electrical conditioning for up to 8 months enabled modeling of polygenic left ventricular hypertrophy starting from patient cells."
https://openalex.org/W2911510951,"A complete chart of cis-regulatory elements and their dynamic activity is necessary to understand the transcriptional basis of differentiation and function of an organ system. We generated matched epigenome and transcriptome measurements in 86 primary cell types that span the mouse immune system and its differentiation cascades. This breadth of data enable variance components analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, pinpointing specific cis-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Overall, this cis-regulatory atlas provides a trove of information on transcriptional regulation through immune differentiation and a foundational scaffold to define key regulatory events throughout the immunological genome."
https://openalex.org/W2913867994,"Despite intensive efforts to discover highly effective treatments to eradicate tuberculosis (TB), it remains as a major threat to global human health. For this reason, new TB drugs directed toward new targets are highly coveted. MmpLs (Mycobacterial membrane proteins Large), which play crucial roles in transporting lipids, polymers and immunomodulators and which also extrude therapeutic drugs, are among the most important therapeutic drug targets to emerge in recent times. Here, crystal structures of mycobacterial MmpL3 alone and in complex with four TB drug candidates, including SQ109 (in Phase 2b-3 clinical trials), are reported. MmpL3 consists of a periplasmic pore domain and a twelve-helix transmembrane domain. Two Asp-Tyr pairs centrally located in this domain appear to be key facilitators of proton-translocation. SQ109, AU1235, ICA38, and rimonabant bind inside the transmembrane region and disrupt these Asp-Tyr pairs. This structural data will greatly advance the development of MmpL3 inhibitors as new TB drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2949267911,"The specific patterns and functional properties of electrical synapses of a nervous system are defined by the neuron-specific complement of electrical synapse constituents. We systematically examined the molecular composition of the electrical connectome of the nematode C. elegans through a genome- and nervous-system-wide analysis of the expression patterns of the invertebrate electrical synapse constituents, the innexins. We observe highly complex combinatorial expression patterns throughout the nervous system and found that these patterns change in a strikingly neuron-type-specific manner throughout the nervous system when animals enter an insulin-controlled diapause arrest stage under harsh environmental conditions, the dauer stage. By analyzing several individual synapses, we demonstrate that dauer-specific electrical synapse remodeling is responsible for specific aspects of the altered locomotory and chemosensory behavior of dauers. We describe an intersectional gene regulatory mechanism involving terminal selector and FoxO transcription factors mediating dynamic innexin expression plasticity in a neuron-type- and environment-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2912916321,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is a widely used translation recoding mechanism. HIV-1 expresses Gag-Pol protein from the Gag-coding mRNA through -1PRF, and the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol is strictly maintained for efficient viral replication. Here, we report that the interferon-stimulated gene product C19orf66 (herein named Shiftless) is a host factor that inhibits the -1PRF of HIV-1. Shiftless (SFL) also inhibited the -1PRF of a variety of mRNAs from both viruses and cellular genes. SFL interacted with the -1PRF signal of target mRNA and translating ribosomes and caused premature translation termination at the frameshifting site. Downregulation of translation release factor eRF3 or eRF1 reduced SFL-mediated premature translation termination. We propose that SFL binding to target mRNA and the translating ribosome interferes with the frameshifting process. These findings identify SFL as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of -1PRF and help to further elucidate the mechanisms of -1PRF."
https://openalex.org/W2911308273,"The proper interactions between blood vessels and neurons are critical for maintaining the strength of neural circuits and cognitive function. However, the precise molecular events underlying these interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the selective knockout of semaphorin 3G (Sema3G) in endothelial cells impaired hippocampal-dependent memory and reduced dendritic spine density in CA1 neurons in mice; these effects were reversed after restoration of Sema3G levels in the hippocampus by AAV transfection. We further show that Sema3G increased excitatory synapse density via neuropilin-2/PlexinA4 signaling and through activation of Rac1. These results provide the first evidence that, in the central nervous system, endothelial Sema3G serves as a vascular-derived synaptic organizer that regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory. Our findings highlight the role of vascular endothelial cells in regulating cognitive function through intercellular communication with neurons in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2911638064,"Odor perception allows animals to distinguish odors, recognize the same odor across concentrations, and determine concentration changes. How the activity patterns of primary olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), at the individual and population levels, facilitate distinguishing these functions remains poorly understood. Here, we interrogate the complete ORN population of the Drosophila larva across a broadly sampled panel of odorants at varying concentrations. We find that the activity of each ORN scales with the concentration of any odorant via a fixed dose-response function with a variable sensitivity. Sensitivities across odorants and ORNs follow a power-law distribution. Much of receptor sensitivity to odorants is accounted for by a single geometrical property of molecular structure. Similarity in the shape of temporal response filters across odorants and ORNs extend these relationships to fluctuating environments. These results uncover shared individual- and population-level patterns that together lend structure to support odor perceptions."
https://openalex.org/W2913295467,"R-DIM-P-LF11-322 and DIM-LF11-318, derived from the cationic human host defense peptide lactoferricin show antitumor activity against human melanoma. While R-DIM-P-LF11-322 interacts specifically with cancer cells, the non-specific DIM-LF11-318 exhibits as well activity against non-neoplastic cells. Recently we have shown that cancer cells expose the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, while non-cancer cells just expose zwitterionic or neutral lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) or cholesterol. Calorimetric and zeta potential studies with R-DIM-P-LF11-322 and cancer-mimetic liposomes composed of PS, PC and cholesterol indicate that the cancer-specific peptide interacts specifically with PS. Cholesterol, however, reduces the effectiveness of the peptide. The non-specific DIM-LF11-318 interacts with PC and PS. Cholesterol does not affect its interaction. The dependence of activity of R-DIM-P-LF11-322 on the presence of exposed PS was also confirmed in vitro upon PS depletion of the outer leaflet of cancer cells by the enzyme PS-decarboxylase. Further corresponding to model studies, cholesterol depleted melanoma plasma membranes showed increased sensitivity to R-DIM-P-LF11-322, whereas activity of DIM-LF11-318 was unaffected. Microscopic studies using giant unilamellar vesicles and melanoma cells revealed strong changes in lateral distribution and domain formation of lipids upon addition of both peptides. Whereas R-DIM-P-LF11-322 enters the cancer cell specifically via PS and reaches an intracellular organelle, the Golgi, inducing mitochondrial swelling and apoptosis, DIM-LF11-318 kills rapidly and non-specifically by lysis of the plasma membrane. In conclusion, the specific interaction of R-DIM-P-LF11-322 with PS and sensitivity to cholesterol seem to modulate its specificity for cancer membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2914699731,"Background Fertility rates in Europe are among the lowest in the world, which may be attributed to both biological and lifestyle factors. Cost and reimbursement of fertility treatments vary across Europe, although its citizens enjoy wide access to fertility care. Since few regional studies evaluating public support for fertility treatment exist, we conducted the Listening IVF and Fertility in Europe (LIFE) survey to ascertain public perception of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and gamete donation as a treatment for infertility among European men and women. Methods and findings This survey was distributed via an online questionnaire to 8,682 individuals who were voluntary participants in an online research panel residing in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, or the UK. The survey covered items to determine respondents’ beliefs regarding IVF and its success, the need for public funding, the use of IVF among modern families with different lifestyles, and the support for gamete donation. Results were analyzed by age, country of origin, sex, and sexual orientation. A total of 6,110 (70% of total) men and women responded. Among all respondents, 10% had undergone IVF treatment and 48% had considered or would consider IVF in case of infertility. Respondents estimated IVF mean success rate to be 47% and over half of respondents believed that availability of IVF would encourage people to delay conception. Although 93% of respondents believed that IVF treatment should be publicly funded to some extent, a majority believed that secondary infertility or use of fertility treatments allowing to delay parenthood should be financed privately. Survey respondents believed that the mean number of stimulated IVF cycles funded publicly should be limited 2 to 3 (average 2.4). 79% of respondents were willing to pay for IVF if needed with a mean amount of 5,400 € for a child brought to life through IVF. According to respondents, mean minimum and maximum ages for IVF should be 29 and 42 years old, respectively. The current survey showed support for egg and sperm donation (78%), for IVF in single women (61%) and for same-sex female couples (64%). When analyzing the results per group (i.e., sex, age, sexual orientation, and countries), youngest age groups, homosexuals, bisexuals, German respondents, and men had similar overall positive attitudes and beliefs toward IVF and opinions on public funding. Perceived limits to availability were stronger in women. Conclusion Overall, the survey results demonstrate a positive attitude among respondents in an online panel toward IVF, gamete donation, and support for public funding for fertility treatment. These findings could potentially drive discussions between patients and prescribers to explore IVF treatment and among legislators and payers to support public funding for these procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2911943505,"Humans and other animals make decisions in order to satisfy their goals. However, it remains unknown how neural circuits compute which of multiple possible goals should be pursued (e.g., when balancing hunger and thirst) and how to combine these signals with estimates of available reward alternatives. Here, humans undergoing fMRI accumulated two distinct assets over a sequence of trials. Financial outcomes depended on the minimum cumulate of either asset, creating a need to maintain “value equilibrium” by redressing any imbalance among the assets. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) tracked the level of imbalance among goals, whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) signaled the level of redress incurred by a choice rather than the overall amount received. These results suggest that a network of medial frontal brain regions compute a value signal that maintains value equilibrium among internal goals."
https://openalex.org/W2911961068,"There is increasing evidence that supports the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of dystonia. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the hypothesis that patients with cervical dystonia may have a disrupted cerebellar cortical connectivity at rest, and that cerebellar plasticity is altered too. We enrolled 12 patients with isolated cervical dystonia and 13 controls. A paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol was applied over the right cerebellum and the left primary motor area. Changes in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials were analysed. Continuous and intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation over the cerebellum was also applied. The effects of these repetitive protocols on cortical excitability, on intra-cortical circuits and on cerebellar cortical inhibition were analysed. In healthy subjects, but not in dystonic patients, a conditioning stimulus over the cerebellum was able to inhibit the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials from primary motor cortex. In healthy subjects continuous and intermittent cerebellar Theta Burst Stimulation were able to decrease and increase respectively motor cortex excitability. Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation was able to abolish the cerebellar cortical inhibition observed in basal condition. These effects were not observed in patients with cervical dystonia. Cerebellar cortical connectivity and cerebellar plasticity is altered at rest in patients with cervical dystonia."
https://openalex.org/W2914215568,"Weather changes accompanied by decreases in barometric pressure are suggested to trigger meteoropathy, i.e., weather-related pain. We previously reported that neuropathic pain-related behavior in rats is aggravated by lowering barometric pressure, and that this effect is abolished by inner ear lesions. These results suggest that mechanisms that increase vestibular neuronal activity may parallel those that contribute to meteoropathy generation. However, it remains unknown whether changes in barometric pressure activate vestibular neuronal activity. To address this issue, we used expression of c-Fos protein as a marker for neural activation. Male and female mice were placed in a climatic chamber, and the barometric pressure was lowered by 40 hPa, from 1013 hPa, for 50 min (LP stimulation). The total number of c-Fos-positive cells in the vestibular nuclei was counted bilaterally after LP stimulation. We also video-recorded mouse behaviors and calculated the total activity score during the LP stimulation. LP stimulation resulted in significant c-Fos expression in the superior vestibular nucleus (SuVe) of male and female mice. There was no effect of LP stimulation on the total activity score. These data show that distinct neurons in the SuVe respond to LP stimulation. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the generation of meteoropathy in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2911750223,"Water is one of the main agent of erosion in many environmental settings, but erosion rates derived from beryllium-10 (10Be) suggests that a relationship between precipitation and erosion rate is statistically non-significant on a global scale. This might be because of the strong influence of other variables on erosion rate. In this global 10Be compilation, we examine if mean annual precipitation has a statistically significant secondary control on erosion rate. Our secondary variable assessment suggests a significant secondary influence of precipitation on erosion rate. This is the first time that the influence of precipitation on 10Be-derived erosion rate is recognized on global scale. In fact, in areas where slope is <200m/km (~11°), precipitation influences erosion rate as much as mean basin slope, which has been recognized as the most important variable in previous 10Be compilations. In areas where elevation is <1000m and slope is <11°, the correlation between precipitation and erosion rate improves considerably. These results also suggest that erosion rate responds to change in mean annual precipitation nonlinearly and in three regimes: 1) it increases with an increase in precipitation until ~1000 mm/yr; 2) erosion rate stabilizes at ~1000 mm/yr and decreases slightly with increased precipitation until ~2200 mm/yr; and 3) it increases again with further increases in precipitation. This complex relationship between erosion rate and mean annual precipitation is best explained by the interrelationship between mean annual precipitation and vegetation. Increased vegetation, particularly the presence of trees, is widely recognized to lower erosion rate. Our results suggest that tree cover of 40% or more reduces erosion rate enough to outweigh the direct erosive effects of increased rainfall. Thus, precipitation emerges as a stronger secondary control on erosion rate in hyper-arid areas, as well as in hyper-wet areas. In contrast, the regime between ~1000 and ~2200 mm/yr is dominated by opposing relationships where higher rainfall acts to increase erosion rate, but more water also increases vegetation/tree cover, which slows erosion. These results suggest that when interpreting the sedimentological record, high sediment fluxes are expected to occur when forests transition to grasslands/savannahs; however, aridification of grasslands or savannahs into deserts will result in lower sediment fluxes. This study also implies that anthropogenic deforestation, particularly in regions with high rainfall, can greatly increase erosion."
https://openalex.org/W2912526611,"The yeast mitochondrial proteins Rcf1 and Rcf2 are associated with a subpopulation of the cytochrome bc1–cytochrome c oxidase supercomplex and have been proposed to play a role in the assembly and/or modulation of the activity of the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV). Yeast mutants deficient in either Rcf1 or Rcf2 proteins can use aerobic respiration–based metabolism for growth, but the absence of both proteins results in a strong growth defect. In this study, using assorted biochemical and biophysical analyses of Rcf1/Rcf2 single and double null-mutant yeast cells and mitochondria, we further explored how Rcf1 and Rcf2 support aerobic respiration and growth. We show that the absence of Rcf1 physically reduces the levels of CIV and diminishes the ability of the CIV that is present to maintain a normal mitochondrial proton motive force (PMF). Although the absence of Rcf2 did not noticeably affect the physical content of CIV, the PMF generated by CIV was also lower than normal. Our results indicate that the detrimental effects of the absence of Rcf1 and Rcf2 proteins on the CIV complex are distinct in terms of CIV assembly/accumulation and additive in terms of the ability of CIV to generate PMF. Thus, the combined absence of Rcf1 and Rcf2 alters both CIV physiology and assembly. We conclude that the slow aerobic growth of the Rcf1/Rcf2 double null mutant results from diminished generation of mitochondrial PMF by CIV and limits the level of CIV activity required for maintenance of the PMF and growth under aerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2913780466,"Effective adaptive immune responses depend on activation of CD4+ T cells via the presentation of antigen peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. The structure of an antigen strongly influences its processing within the endolysosome and potentially controls the identity of peptides that are presented to T cells. A recombinant immunotoxin, comprising exotoxin A domain III (PE-III) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a cancer-specific antibody fragment, has been developed to manage cancer, but its effectiveness is limited by the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we observed that this immunogenicity is substantially reduced by substituting six residues within PE-III. Although these substitutions targeted T-cell epitopes, we demonstrate that reduced conformational stability and protease resistance were responsible for the reduced antibody titer. Analysis of mouse T-cell responses coupled with biophysical studies on single-substitution versions of PE-III suggested that modest but comprehensible changes in T-cell priming can dramatically perturb antibody production. The most strongly responsive PE-III epitope was well-predicted by a structure-based algorithm. In summary, single-residue substitutions can drastically alter the processing and immunogenicity of PE-III but have only modest effects on CD4+ T-cell priming in mice. Our findings highlight the importance of structure-based processing constraints for accurate epitope prediction.

In this paper we present our studies on domain III of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PE) as a model antigen. Exotoxin A has been studied for decades as a potential cancer therapy in the form of a recombinant immunotoxin (RIT) (16Kondo T. FitzGerald D. Chaudhary V.K. Adhya S. Pastan I.

In its original form, the exotoxin A RIT contained a portion of domain I and the entirety of domains II and III of exotoxin A linked to a cancer-specific antibody fragment (Fab). The recombinant protein is administered to patients intravenously, where it binds to cell-surface proteins, is internalized, and results in cell death via ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (18Chaudhary V.K.

Clinical trials proved challenging, as the bacterial component of the PE RIT is strongly immunogenic, resulting in the induction of neutralizing antibodies after as little as one treatment, rendering the therapy ineffective (19Mazor R.

The mutations introduced to exotoxin A domain III (PE-III) were designed to reduce the affinity of epitope-containing peptides for the MHC class II molecule while maintaining the structure and enzymatic activity of PE-III (22Mazor R.

The successful “deimmunization” of PE-III provides an opportunity to use both the WT and deimmunized PE-III as model antigens to more finely probe the relationship between antigen structure and antigen processing/presentation to CD4+ T cells. To that end, we purified the wildtype (WT) PE-III, T18 PE-III, and two single mutant variants of PE-III to study how these mutations have altered the structure, processing, and immune response. We observed that the deimmunizing mutations significantly altered PE-III stability and susceptibility to antigen-processing proteases. The mutations also modified presentation of epitope-containing peptides and CD4+ T-cell epitope immunogenicity, as well as serum antibody levels in mice. We also observed that a single mutation was sufficient to reduce serum antibody titers below that observed for the six-mutant T18 while causing only modest changes in the priming of CD4+ T cells. WT PE-III and all mutant variants used for this study were purified from Escherichia coli grown in autoinduction media (23Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41 (15915565): 207-23410.1016/j.pep.2005.01.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar), with a typical yield of 10–15 mg/liter of culture. We hypothesized that the amino acid substitutions intended to disrupt peptide–MHCII interactions have instead altered the conformational stability of PE-III. To test this, we first used homology modeling and the GROMACS96 software suite to estimate changes in the free energy of PE-III folding caused by individual epitope-silencing mutations (Fig. S1) (24Fraternali F. Van Gunsteren W.F. An efficient mean solvation force model for use in molecular dynamics simulations of proteins in aqueous solution.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256 (8601844): 939-94810.1006/jmbi.1996.0139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on the GROMACS software calculations, we predicted decreases in free energy for PE-III variants containing the R427A, R494A, and R505H mutations and an increase in free energy for PE-III L477H and L552E mutations. We selected the R494A and L552E single mutations for further study, as they were predicted to have opposing effects on PE-III stability and were not located in any previously mapped mouse epitopes (20Mazor R. Vassall A.N. Eberle J.A. Beers R. Weldon J.E. Venzon D.J. Tsang K.Y. Benhar I. Pastan I. Identification and elimination of an immunodominant T-cell epitope in recombinant immunotoxins based on Pseudomonas exotoxin A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We also analyzed the regional stabilities of WT PE-III using the COREX/best algorithm to generate a structural thermodynamic ensemble (25Hilser V.J. Whitten S.T. Using the COREX/BEST server to model the native-state ensemble.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1084 (24061926): 255-26910.1007/978-1-62703-658-0_14Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The COREX/best residue-specific stabilities were compared with results calculated for R494A and L552E single-mutant variants. We observed changes in predicted stability of protein substructures located near previously identified T-cell epitopes (data not shown), as well an overall decrease in stability for the R494A variant and an overall increase in stability for the L552E variant. Based on the GROMACS and COREX analyses, we predicted that WT, T18, and the single-mutant PE-III R494A and L552E variants would exhibit differences in folding stability. We next measured folding stability of purified PE-III variants using acid- and denaturant-induced unfolding (Fig. 1, A and C). From the acid unfolding data, EC50 values were determined for each mutant PE-III variant using a sigmoidal dose–response regression model (Fig. 1B). The single mutant variant L552E unfolded at a significantly lower pH value than WT PE-III, whereas R494A unfolded at a significantly higher pH value. T18 PE-III exhibited no difference in acid-induced unfolding when compared with WT PE-III. Free energies of unfolding were determined by fitting the denaturant-induced unfolding curves as described previously (14Nguyen H.-N. Steede N.K. Robinson J.E. Landry S.J. Conformational instability governed by disulfide bonds partitions the dominant from subdominant helper T-cell responses specific for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120.Vaccine. 2015; 33 (25944298): 2887-289610.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.082Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Manyusa S. Whitford D.

The measured free energy of unfolding for T18 PE-III did not differ from that for WT PE-III, whereas the single mutant variants exhibited significant changes in measured free energy compared with WT PE-III (Fig. 1D). Our findings that the single mutant variants R494A and L552E exhibited decreased and increased resistance to unfolding, respectively, matched our predictions from computational techniques. We have demonstrated that some single-amino acid substitutions intended to deimmunize PE-III have altered the protein’s stability and resistance to unfolding. We next sought to explain these changes by observing the effects of these mutations on the crystallographic structure of PE-III. To date, we have been unable to crystallize PE-III R494A or T18, but we have obtained diffraction-quality crystals of a variant of T18 lacking the L477H mutation (T18-H477L). A high-resolution structure for WT PE-III is also already available (PDB code 1XK9) (27Yates S.P. Taylor P.L. Jørgensen R. Ferraris D. Zhang J. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Structure–function analysis of water-soluble inhibitors of the catalytic domain of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochem. J. 2005; 385 (15458385): 667-67510.1042/BJ20041480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using the WT PE-III structure as a search model, we solved the structure of PE-III T18-H477L by molecular replacement at a resolution of 1.47 Å. Statistics and software information are detailed in Table S1. In the WT PE-III structure, we observed arginine 494 participating in a hydrogen bond with glutamate 445 (Fig. 2A). When alanine is substituted for arginine 494 in T18-H477L, this interaction is eliminated, and glutamate 445 changes conformation to a more solvent-exposed position. Elimination of this hydrogen bond pair coincided with a large increase in the crystallographic B-factors for the loop spanning residues 480–496 (Fig. 2, B and C). The replacement of leucine 552 with glutamate in T18-H477L introduces a new hydrogen bond between glutamate 552 and arginine 513 (Fig. 2A). In WT PE-III, arginine 513 is more than 5.0 Å away from the nearest amino acid side chain or backbone carbonyl, too far to be participating in any meaningful structural interactions. The introduction of this hydrogen bond pair is not accompanied by a change in B-factors (Fig. 2B). In a structural analysis using the COREX algorithm described above, we observed contrasting effects of the R494A and L552E mutations on residue stabilities that are consistent with the structural changes introduced by these mutations (Fig. 2D). Residue stabilities were drastically decreased in the region where the R494A mutation eliminates the hydrogen bond, although they were noticeably increased in the region where the L552E mutation introduces a hydrogen bond. These data demonstrate that the R494A and L552E mutations have modified the structure of PE-III, resulting in significant changes in folding free energy and acid resistance. The presentation of antigen peptides bound to class II MHC molecules depends on proteolytic processing of those antigens. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the proteolytic processing of antigens preferentially occurs at sites within and between protein domains that are flexible, solvent-accessible, and lacking in secondary structure (11Dai G.

These regions are readily accessible for interactions with proteases and can easily conform to protease active sites, making them the initial sites of proteolytic cleavage within an antigen. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that protease-resistant antigens are more immunogenic than their protease-sensitive counterparts (29Delamarre L. Pack M. Chang H. Mellman I. Trombetta E.S. Differential lysosomal proteolysis in antigen-presenting cells determines antigen fate.Science. 2005; 307 (15761154): 1630-163410.1126/science.1108003Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 30Delamarre L.

Therefore, we predicted that proteolysis of PE-III initiates in flexible, unstructured regions of the protein and that mutations would alter PE-III susceptibility to proteolytic degradation according to changes in PE-III stability (32Park C. Marqusee S. Probing the high energy states in proteins by proteolysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343 (15491624): 1467-147610.1016/j.jmb.2004.08.085Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To test these hypotheses, we first performed limited proteolysis using a single protease, proteinase K. Proteolysis experiments were conducted over a pH range from 7.6 to 4.6 in intervals of 1 pH unit to simulate the environment of the antigen-processing compartment. Degradation of WT PE-III by proteinase K at pH 7.6 is rapid and produces few fragments (Fig. 3A). As the pH decreases, larger PE-III fragments accumulate, whereas the activity of the protease remains consistent to a pH as low as 4.6, indicating that PE-III becomes more resistant to proteolysis by proteinase K at low pH (Fig. 3A). To identify the initial proteinase K cleavage sites, we isolated the two largest fragments (18 and 15 kDa, Fig. 3A) from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, digested them with trypsin, and sequenced the peptides using LC and tandem MS (LC-MS/MS). High-scoring tryptic peptides from both fragments aligned to the C-terminal region of PE-III suggesting the cleavage sites are located within the N-terminal region (Table S2 and Fig. 3C). Sequenced tryptic peptides and molecular-weight estimations indicated that proteinase K generated the C-terminal 18-kDa fragment by cleavage within the segment of residues 456–462 and the C-terminal 15-kDa fragment by cleavage in the segment of residues 490–496 (Fig. 3C). To confirm the location of these preferential cleavage sites, we generated a variant of WT PE-III in which residues 485–492 (PE-III Δ485–492) were replaced by a histidine–glycine linker to inhibit proteolysis at this site. Although the deletion did not entirely block proteolysis, it did reduce cleavage of intact PE-III, increase the accumulation of the 18-kDa fragment, and decrease the accumulation of the 15-kDa fragment. These data show that initial proteolytic cleavage of PE-III preferentially occurs at two unstructured loops within the protein. These two regions also have the highest B-factors measured from the crystal structures of WT and T18-H477L, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). We next performed limited proteolysis of PE-III with cathepsin S, an important antigen-processing enzyme (3Watts C. Antigen processing in the endocytic compartment.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13 (11154913): 26-3110.1016/S0952-7915(00)00177-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As seen with proteinase K, PE-III becomes more resistant to proteolysis by cathepsin S as the pH decreases to pH 4.6, when PE-III begins to unfold (Figs. 4A and 1B). Three major fragments of 18, 15, and 13 kDa were subjected to tryptic sequencing (Table S2). The identities of tryptic peptides and molecular-weight estimations indicated that cathepsin S cleaved PE-III in the region of residues 456–462 to generate the C-terminal 18-kDa fragment, residues 514–518 to generate the N-terminal 15-kDa fragment, and residues 527–531 to generate the N-terminal 13-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). The locations of these sites were corroborated by cathepsin S digestion of PE-III Δ485–492, in which essentially the same N-terminal fragments were observed but shifted down in molecular weight, as expected for a reduction in size corresponding to the 486–492 deletion (Fig. 4C). Proteinase K is not associated with antigen processing, and although cathepsin S is an important antigen-processing enzyme, the lysosome contains a variety of exo- and endoproteases capable of participating in antigen processing (3Watts C. Antigen processing in the endocytic compartment.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13 (11154913): 26-3110.1016/S0952-7915(00)00177-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to more accurately assess differences in proteolytic processing using lysosomal extracts from a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 (29Delamarre L. Pack M. Chang H. Mellman I.

PE-III variants were incubated with lysosomal extracts in pH conditions corresponding to the early (pH 5.9), mid (pH 5.2), and late (pH 4.5) lysosomal environments (Fig. 4D) (31Machado Y. Freier R.

https://openalex.org/W2913897906,"Metastasis begins with a subset of local tumor cells acquiring the potential to invade into surrounding tissues, and remains to be a major obstacle for cancer treatments. More than 90% of cancer patients died from tumor metastasis, instead of primary tumor growth. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays essential roles in promoting tumor formation, yet its function in regulating tumor metastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Here we employed well-established Drosophila tumor models to investigate the regulating mechanism of Wingless (Wg) pathway in tumor invasion. Our results showed that Wg signaling is necessary and sufficient for cell polarity disruption-induced cell migration and molecular changes reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, reducing Wg signaling suppressed lgl−/−/RasV12-induced tumor invasion, and cooperation between Arm and RasV12 is sufficient to induce tumor invasion. Mechanistically, we found that cell polarity disruption activates JNK signaling, which in turn upregulate wg expression through transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). We identified a consensus AP-1 binding site located in the 2nd intron of wg, and confirmed that it is essential for AP-1 induced wg transcription both in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we confirmed that the transcriptional activation of WNT by AP-1 is conserved in human cancer cells. These evidences reveal a positive role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in tumor invasion, and provide a conserved mechanism that connects JNK and Wnt signaling in regulating tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2911688464,"To cope with increased extracellular osmolarity, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which controls a variety of adaptive responses. Hog1 is activated through the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which consists of a core MAPK cascade and two independent upstream branches (SHO1 and SLN1 branches) containing distinct osmosensing machineries. In the SHO1 branch, a homo-oligomer of Sho1, the four-transmembrane (TM) osmosensor, interacts with the transmembrane co-osmosensors, Hkr1 and Msb2, and the membrane anchor protein Opy2, through their TM domains, and activates the Ste20-Ste11-Pbs2-Hog1 kinase cascade. In this study, we isolated and analyzed hyperactive mutants of Sho1 and Opy2 that harbor mutations within their TM domains. Several hyperactive mutations enhanced the interaction between Sho1 and Opy2, indicating the importance of the TM-mediated interaction between Sho1 and Opy2 for facilitating effective signaling. The interaction between the TM domains of Sho1 and Opy2 will place their respective cytoplasmic binding partners Pbs2 and Ste11 in close proximity. Indeed, genetic analyses of the mutants showed that the Sho1-Opy2 interaction enhances the activation of Pbs2 by Ste11, but not Hog1 by Pbs2. Some of the hyperactive mutants had mutations at the extracellular ends of either Sho1 TM4 or Opy2 TM, and defined the Sho1-Opy2 binding site 1 (BS1). Chemical crosslinking and mutational analyses revealed that the cytoplasmic ends of Sho1 TM1 and Opy2 TM also interact with each other, defining the Sho1-Opy2 binding site 2 (BS2). A geometric consideration constrains that one Opy2 molecule must interact with two adjacent Sho1 molecules in Sho1 oligomer. These results raise a possibility that an alteration of the conformation of the Sho1-Opy2 complex might contributes to the osmotic activation of the Hog1 MAPK cascade."

Baseline clinical measurements included central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell density (ECD) and CTG18.1 TNR expansion length from peripheral leukocytes, with yearly repeat measurements of CCT and ECD. A patient was defined to have experienced significant clinical progression and to have developed Threshold Disease if any of these criteria were fulfilled in either eye: a) CCT increased to >700μm, b) ECD decreased to <700 cells/mm2, or c) underwent keratoplasty for treatment of FECD.Patients were categorized as having at least one allele whose maximum allele length was equal to or greater than 40 repeats (L≥40, n = 22, 43.1%), or having both alleles shorter than 40 repeats (L<40). Threshold Disease rates at the 5-year time point were 87.5% for the L≥40 group and 47.8% for the L<40 group (p = 0.012).

Studies concerning the useful of miRNA expression in clinical decision-making regarding SGTs remain limited and controversial.The expression of a panel of 798 miRNAs was investigated using Nanostring technology in 14 patients with malignant SGTs (6 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 1 acinic cell carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma, 1 cystadenocarcinoma and 1 adenocarcinoma) and in 10 patients with benign SGTs (pleomorphic adenomas). The DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath v3.0 software was used to determinate the miRNA regulatory roles and to identify the controlled significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) molecular pathways. Forty six miRNAs were differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate—FDR<0.05) between malignant and benign SGTs. DIANA miRPath software revealed enriched pathways involved in cancer processes as well as tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, cell growth and survival, tumor suppressor expression, angiogenesis and tumor progression. Interestingly, clustering analysis showed that this signature of 46 miRNAs is able to differentiate the two analyzed groups.

https://openalex.org/W2914273227,"There is a growing consensus that future technological developments of aquaculture systems should account for the structure and function of microbial communities in the whole system and not only in fish guts. In this study, we aimed to investigate the composition of bacterioplankton communities of a hatchery recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) used for the production of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles. To this end, we used a 16S rRNA gene based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing analyses to characterize the bacterioplankton communities of the RAS and its water supply. Overall, the most abundant orders were Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, Oceanospirillales, Vibrionales, Flavobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Thiotrichales, Burkholderiales and Bdellovibrionales. Although we found a clear distinction between the RAS and the water supply bacterioplankton communities, most of the abundant OTUs (≥50 sequences) in the hatchery RAS were also present in the water supply. These included OTUs related to Pseudoalteromonas genus and the Roseobacter clade, which are known to comprise bacterial members with activity against Vibrio fish pathogens. Overall, in contrast to previous findings for sole grow-out RAS, our results suggest that the water supply may influence the bacterioplankton community structure of sole hatchery RAS. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of aquaculture practices on RAS bacterioplankton communities and identification of the key drivers of their structure and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2911412537,"Photoreceptors enable the integration of ambient light stimuli to trigger lifestyle adaptations via modulation of central metabolite levels involved in diverse regulatory processes. Red light-sensing bacteriophytochromes are attractive targets for the development of innovative optogenetic tools because of their natural modularity of coupling with diverse functionalities and the natural availability of the light-absorbing biliverdin chromophore in animal tissues. However, a rational design of such tools is complicated by the poor understanding of molecular mechanisms of light signal transduction over long distances-from the site of photon absorption to the active site of downstream enzymatic effectors. Here we show how swapping structural elements between two bacteriophytochrome homologs provides additional insight into light signal integration and effector regulation, involving a fine-tuned interplay of important structural elements of the sensor, as well as the sensor-effector linker. Facilitated by the availability of structural information of inhibited and activated full-length structures of one of the two homologs (Idiomarina species A28L phytochrome-activated diguanylyl cyclase (IsPadC)) and characteristic differences in photoresponses of the two homologs, we identify an important cross-talk between the N-terminal segment, containing the covalent attachment site of the chromophore, and the PHY-tongue region. Moreover, we highlight how these elements influence the dynamic range of photoactivation and how activation can be improved to light/dark ratios of ∼800-fold by reducing basal dark-state activities at the same time as increasing conversion in the light state. This will enable future optimization of optogenetic tools aiming at a direct allosteric regulation of enzymatic effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2912144940,"It is essential to elucidate drug distribution in the ocular tissues and drug transit in the eye for ophthalmic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Atropine is a reversible muscarinic receptor used to treat various diseases. However, its distribution in ocular tissues is still incompletely understood. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) evaluates drug distribution in biological samples. However, there have been few investigations of drug distribution in ocular tissues, including whole-eye segments. In the present study, we explored the spatial distribution of atropine in the whole-eye segment by MALDI-IMS, and then evaluated the changes in atropine level along the anterior–posterior and superior–inferior axes. A 1% atropine solution was administered to a rabbit and after 30 min, its eye was enucleated, sectioned, and analyzed by MALDI-IMS. Atropine accumulated primarily in the tear menisci but was found at substantially lower concentrations in the tissue surrounding the conjunctival sacs. Relative differences in atropine levels between the anterior and posterior regions provided insights into the post-instillation behavior of atropine. Atropine signal intensities differed among corneal layers and between the superior and inferior eyeball regions. Differences in signal intensity among tissues indicated that the drug migrated to the posterior regions via a periocular-scleral route. Line scan analysis elucidated atropine transit from the anterior to the posterior region. This information is useful for atropine delivery in the ocular tissues and indicates that MALDI-IMS is effective for revealing drug distribution in whole-eye sections."
https://openalex.org/W2913960200,"Introduction Active tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are a public health threat in prisons around the world. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of LTBI and TB as well as to investigate TB transmission inside one prison, in Colombia. Methods A Cross-sectional study was conducted in inmates who agreed to participate. Inmates with respiratory symptoms (RS) of any duration underwent to medical evaluation and three sputum samples were taken for smear microscopy and culture for TB diagnosis. Drug susceptibility was analyzed using BACTEC MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRplus. Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed by 24-Locus MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping. LTBI was evaluated according to the result of the tuberculin skin test (TST). Close contact investigation was conducted inside the prison for inmates that shared the cell with the index TB case. Results Among 301/2,020 (15%) inmates with RS of any duration, 8% were diagnosed with active TB. The prevalence of active TB was 1,026 cases/100,000 inmates. We isolated M. tuberculosis in 19/24 (79%) TB cases, 94.7% were susceptible to first line drugs and only one was monoresistant to isoniazid. The most prevalent sub-lineage was Haarlem (68.4%), followed by LAM (26.3%) and T superfamily (5.3%). 24-Locus MIRU-VNTR typing results alone or in combination with spoligotyping identified three clusters containing two isolates each. Two clusters corresponded to inmates that shared the same cell, but each one was located in different blocks of the prison. Inmates from the last cluster were in the same block in nearby cells. TST reading was performed in 95.6% inmates, and 67.6% had a positive reaction. Conclusions The prevalence of LTBI and TB was higher in prison than in the general population. Molecular genotyping suggests that TB in this prison is mainly caused by strains imported by inmates or endogenous reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2911495173,"A 2015 article in Science (Hu et al.) proposed a new way to reduce implicit racial and gender biases during sleep. The method built on an existing counter-stereotype training procedure, using targeted memory reactivation to strengthen counter-stereotype memory by playing cues associated with the training during a 90min nap. If effective, this procedure would have potential real-world usefulness in reducing implicit biases and their myriad effects. We replicated this procedure on a sample of n = 31 college students. Contrary to the results reported by Hu et al., we found no effect of cueing on implicit bias, either immediately following the nap or one week later. In fact, bias was non-significantly greater for cued than for uncued stimuli. Our failure to detect an effect of cueing on implicit bias could indicate either that the original report was a false positive, or that the current study is a false negative. However, several factors argue against Type II error in the current study. Critically, this replication was powered at 0.9 for detecting the originally reported cueing effect. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the cueing effect in the present study did not overlap with that of the originally reported effect; therefore, our observations are not easily explained as a noisy estimate of the same underlying effect. Ultimately, the outcome of this replication study reduces our confidence that cueing during sleep can reduce implicit bias."
https://openalex.org/W2912218410,"Objective A standardization of minor salivary gland (MSG) histopathology in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) has been recently proposed. Although there is strong agreement that germinal center (GC)-like structures should be routinely identified, due to their prognostic value, a consensus regarding the best protocol is still lacking. Aim of this study was to compare the performance of different histological techniques and operators to identify GC-like structures in pSS MSGs. MSG biopsies from 50 pSS patients were studied. Methods Three blinded operators (one pathologist and two rheumatologists with different years of experience in pSS MSG assessment) assessed 50 MSGs of which one slide was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and consecutive slides were processed to investigate CD3/CD20, CD21 and Bcl-6 expression. Results By assessing 225 foci, the best agreement was between H&E-stained sections evaluated by the rheumatologist with more years of experience in pSS MSG assessment and CD3/CD20 segregation. In the foci with CD21 positivity, the agreement further increased. Bcl-6- foci could display a GC, detected with other staining, but not vice versa. Conclusion GC assessment on H&E-stained sections should be performed with caution, being operator-dependent. The combination of H&E with CD3/CD20 and CD21 staining should be recommended as it is reliable, feasible, able to overcome the bias of operator experience and easily transferrable into routine practice."
https://openalex.org/W2913413031,"Background The Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III (FPQ-III) is a self-report instrument developed to assess fear of different stimuli usually causing pain. The present study aimed to construct an Italian version of the FPQ-III and examine its psychometric properties in a heterogeneous sample of Italian healthy individuals. Methods The questionnaire was translated following the forward-backward method and completed by 511 Italian adults who met the inclusion criteria. Within 2 months of the first assessment, a subgroup of participants (n = 164) was re-tested. The factorial structure of the FPQ-III was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To better comprehend the FPQ-III’s factorial structure, a CFA was also performed for each of the two reduced versions of the FPQ-III, namely the FPQ-Short Form and the FPQ-9. Divergent validity, test-retest reliability, and gender/age measurement invariance were also evaluated. Results The results of the CFA revealed that the original three-factor model poorly fitted the data, but it became satisfactory after allowing correlated error terms. Concerning divergent validity, correlations between FPQ-III scores and pain intensity, depression, and anxiety were found to be positive but weak in magnitude (< .20). FPQ-III subscales and total scores showed good internal consistency and time reliability. Finally, scalar invariance was only partially obtained, whereas all the other types of invariance were fully respected both for gender and age. Conclusions The current findings indicate that the Italian version of the FPQ-III provides valid and reliable scores for the assessment of fear of pain in the Italian population."
https://openalex.org/W2912126527,"Invasive breast cancers are thought to arise from in situ lesions, but some ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are indolent with low likelihood of progressing to invasive carcinoma. Comparison of risk factor associations between DCIS and invasive disease may elucidate which factors influence early versus late stages of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we determined whether there were differences in risk factor profiles for screen-detected DCIS and invasive breast cancer among Luminal A lesions.We conducted a case-control analysis using data from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (1993-2001). Analyses were restricted to Luminal A tumors and screen-detected tumors among mammography-eligible women, to limit confounding by mode of detection (N = 108 DCIS; N = 203 invasive). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between risk factors and lesion type.In stratified analyses, we observed qualitative differences in the direction of association for ever smoking, obese BMI, high waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR), and ≥10 years of oral contraceptive use between DCIS and invasive disease. Breastfeeding was inversely associated with invasive disease and was not associated with DCIS. Interaction tests for risk factor associations between Luminal A DCIS and invasive breast cancer were not statistically significant (p>0.05).Among Luminal A tumors, established breast cancer risk factors may exert stronger effects on progression of early lesions to invasive disease, with lesser effects on risk of DCIS."
https://openalex.org/W2913430244,"Until now, few studies have evaluated the effect of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) on patients' quality of life, and none have used a specific instrument to measure this effect. The objective of this study was to identify factors that may be associated with the high impact of CL and to assess patients' satisfaction with treatment and health services by utilizing a disease-specific questionnaire.Between December 2015 and May 2017, 100 patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis were interviewed at a leishmaniasis referral center in Brazil. Data were collected by two questionnaires. One questionnaire compiled the sociodemographic, economic, and clinical information related to the disease. The second questionnaire was the Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Impact Questionnaire (CLIQ), which consisted of two subscales that measured 1) the general impact of CL and 2) patients' perceptions of treatment and health services. The median scores from each of these two subscales were used to dichotomize the dependent variables. Risk factors for the high impact of CL and for low patient satisfaction with treatment and health services were analyzed with a logistic regression analysis.The chance of higher impact of CL was increased in patients with the presence of comorbidities (OR: 3.9; CI 1.25-12.36), in those with absences from work (OR: 12.0; CI 3.78-42.55), in those who relied on public transportation by a municipal bus (OR: 5.8; CI 1.27-26.77), and in those who had illness-related expenses greater than U$137 (OR: 3.5; CI 1.17-10.24). The chance of patient dissatisfaction with treatment and health services increased with higher education (OR: 5.0; CI 1.19-21.03) and with illness-related expenses exceeding U$137 (OR: 4.64; CI 1.49-14.48). Once the sample was non-probabilistic, findings are not representative of CL patients in general.CL and its treatment have a negative impact on patients' quality of life. Considering these effects during public health planning may help patients to confront the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2914013714,"Cultural evolution is the product of the psychological mechanisms that underlie individual decision making. One commonly studied learning mechanism is a disproportionate preference for majority opinions, known as conformist transmission. While most theoretical and experimental work approaches the majority in terms of the number of individuals that perform a behaviour or hold a belief, some recent experimental studies approach the majority in terms of the number of instances a behaviour is performed. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that disagreement between these two notions of the majority can arise when behavioural variants are performed at different rates, with different salience or in different contexts (variant overrepresentation) and when a subset of the population act as demonstrators to the whole population (model biases). We also show that because conformist transmission changes the distribution of behaviours in a population, how observers approach the majority can cause populations to diverge, and that this can happen even when the two approaches to the majority agree with regards to which behaviour is in the majority. We discuss these results in light of existing findings, ranging from political extremism on twitter to studies of animal foraging behaviour. We conclude that the factors we considered (variant overrepresentation and model biases) are plausibly widespread. As such, it is important to understand how individuals approach the majority in order to understand the effects of majority influence in cultural evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2889770788,"Proteins that misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transported back to the cytosol for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The Sec61 channel is one of the candidates for the retrograde transport conduit. Channel opening from the ER lumen must be triggered by ERAD factors and substrates. Here we aimed to identify new lumenal interaction partners of the Sec61 channel by chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry. In addition to known Sec61 interactors we detected ERAD factors including Cue1, Ubc6, Ubc7, Asi3, and Mpd1. We show that the CPY* ERAD factor Mpd1 binds to the lumenal Sec61 hinge region. Deletion of the Mpd1 binding site reduced the interaction between both proteins and caused an ERAD defect specific for CPY* without affecting protein import into the ER or ERAD of other substrates. Our data suggest that Mpd1 binding to Sec61 is a prerequisite for CPY* ERAD and confirm a role of Sec61 in ERAD of misfolded secretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2911696019,"We investigated the stability, correlations and bidirectional relationship of light physical activities (PA), moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA), television viewing (TV) and video game/computer use (VG) in Brazilian adolescents.Adolescent Nutritional Assessment Longitudinal Study-ELANA is a middle school cohort study conducted in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil in 2010-2012. Self-reported data on PA (International Physical Activity Questionnaire- IPAQ) and screen activities were obtained from 810 adolescents (mean ages of 10.9 years old (SD 0.78) for girls; 11 years old (SD 0.85) for boys) to perform autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation models in two time points for PA and three time points for screen activities.There was no significant stability of light PA and MVPA for boys and girls. Moderate stability of screen activities were found for both genders, with a significant coefficient of TV for boys (T1-T2:0.29; T2-T3:0.27 p<0.001); and VG for boys (T1-T2:0.33; T2-T3:0.35 p<0.001) and girls (T1-T2: 0.26; T2-T3:0.37 p<0.01). Significant lagged effects were obtained only among girls: light PA had effect on VG (-0.10 p<0.01), as well as in the opposite direction of TV on light PA (-0.03 p<0.01) and TV on MVPA (-0.11 p<0.01).The light PA, MVPA and screen activities (among girls) did not demonstrate stability over time. A warning scenario was suggested by the stability of high amounts of screen activities among boys over time. Screen activities had bidirectional association with light PA and MVPA among girls over time."

Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed how SDO relates to intergroup reconciliation. This study (effective N = 819) measured participants’ SDO along with their attitudes toward various governmental apologies to test the hypothesis that SDO is associated with unwillingness to issue intergroup apologies. The results showed that SDO was negatively correlated with supportive attitudes toward government-issued international apologies. This negative correlation remained intact after controlling for the effects of political conservatism and militarism."
https://openalex.org/W2913332678,"Objectives Globally, hypertension affects one billion people and disproportionately burdens low-and middle-income countries. Despite the high disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, optimal care models for diagnosing and treating hypertension have not been established. Emergency departments (EDs) are frequently the first biomedical healthcare contact for many people in the region. ED encounters may offer a unique opportunity for identifying high risk patients and linking them to care. Methods Between July 2017 and March 2018, we conducted a prospective cohort study among patients presenting to a tertiary care ED in northern Tanzania. We recruited adult patients with a triage blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg in order to screen for hypertension. We explored knowledge, attitudes and practices for hypertension using a questionnaire, and assessed factors associated with successful follow-up. Hypertension was defined as a single blood pressure measurement ≥ 160/100 mmHg or a three-time average of ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as a three-time average measurement of ≥ 160/100 mmHg. Successful follow-up was defined as seeing an outpatient provider within one month of the ED visit. Results We enrolled 598 adults (mean age 59.6 years), of whom 539 (90.1%) completed the study. The majority (78.6%) of participants were aware of having hypertension. Many (223; 37.2%) had uncontrolled hypertension. Overall, only 236 (43.8%) of participants successfully followed-up within one month. Successful follow-up was associated with a greater understanding that hypertension requires lifelong treatment (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03,1.21) and inversely associated with greater anxiety about the future (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64,0.99). Conclusion In a northern Tanzanian tertiary care ED, the burden of hypertension is high, with few patients receiving optimal outpatient care follow-up. Multi-disciplinary strategies are needed to improve linkage to care for high-risk patients from ED settings."
https://openalex.org/W2915032512,"Cryptococcosis is an Invasive Fungal Infection (IFI) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, mainly in immunocompromised patients. Therapeutic failure due to pathogen drug resistance, treatment inconstancy and few antifungal options is a problem. The study of amino acid biosynthesis and uptake represents an opportunity to explore possible development of novel antifungals. C. neoformans has 10 amino acids permeases, two of them (Aap3 and Aap7) not expressed at the conditions tested, and five were studied previously (Aap2, Aap4, Aap5, Mup1 and Mup3). Our previous results showed that Aap4 and Aap5 are major permeases with overlapping functions. The aap4Δ/aap5Δ double mutant fails to grow in amino acids as sole nitrogen source and is avirulent in animal model. Here, we deleted the remaining amino acid permeases (AAP1, AAP6, AAP8) that showed gene expression modulation by nutritional condition and created a double mutant (aap1Δ/aap2Δ). We studied the virulence attributes of these mutants and explored the regulatory mechanism behind amino acid uptake in C. neoformans. The aap1Δ/aap2Δ strain had reduced growth at 37°C in L-amino acids, reduced capsule production and was hypovirulent in the Galleria mellonella animal model. Our data, along with previous studies, (i) complement the analysis for all 10 amino acid permeases mutants, (ii) corroborate the idea that these transporters behave as global permeases, (iii) are required during heat and nutritional stress, and (iv) are important for virulence. Our study also indicates a new possible link between Ras1 signaling and amino acids uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2911639198,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is commonly overexpressed in a variety of tumor types including lung cancer. As a key regulator of angiogenesis, it promotes tumor survival, growth, and metastasis through the activation of the downstream protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) activation. The VEGF promoter contains a 36 bp guanine-rich sequence (VEGFq) which is capable of forming quadruplex (four-stranded) DNA. This sequence has been implicated in the down-regulation of both basal and inducible VEGF expression and represents an ideal target for inhibition of VEGF expression. Results Our experiments demonstrate sequence-specific interaction between a G-rich quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide encoding a portion of the VEGFq sequence and its double stranded target sequence, suggesting that this G-rich oligonucleotide binds specifically to its complementary C-rich sequence in the genomic VEGF promoter by strand invasion. We show that treatment of A549 non-small lung cancer cells (NSCLC) with this oligonucleotide results in decreased VEGF expression and growth inhibition. The VEGFq oligonucleotide inhibits proliferation and invasion by decreasing VEGF mRNA/protein expression and subsequent ERK 1/2 and AKT activation. Furthermore, the VEGFq oligonucleotide is abundantly taken into cells, localized in the cytoplasm/nucleus, inherently stable in serum and intracellularly, and has no effect on non-transformed cells. Suppression of VEGF expression induces cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and increased expression of LC3B, suggesting that VEGFq may induce autophagic cell death. Conclusion Our data strongly suggest that the G-rich VEGFq oligonucleotide binds specifically to the C-rich strand of the genomic VEGF promoter, via strand invasion, stabilizing the quadruplex structure formed by the genomic G-rich sequence, resulting in transcriptional inhibition. Strand invading oligonucleotides represent a new approach to specifically inhibit VEGF expression that avoids many of the problems which have plagued the therapeutic use of oligonucleotides. This is a novel approach to specific inhibition of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2912237514,"Various cell-based therapeutic strategies have been investigated for vascular and tissue regeneration after ischemic stroke. We have developed a novel cell population, called regeneration-associated cells (RACs), by quality- and quantity-controlled culture of unfractionated mononuclear cells. RACs were trans-arterially injected into 10-week-old syngeneic male mice at 1, 3, 5 or 7 days after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to determine the optimal timing for administration in terms of outcome at day 21. Next, we examined the effects of RACs injection at day 1 after MCAO on neurological deficits, infarct volume, and mediators of vascular regeneration and anti-inflammation at days 7 and 21. Infarct volume at day 21 was significantly reduced by transplantation of RACs at day 1 or 3. RACs injected at day 1 reduced the infarct volume at day 7 and 21. Angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory mediators, VEGF and IL-10, were increased at day 7, and VEGF was still upregulated at day 21. We also observed significantly enhanced ink perfusion in vivo, tube formation in vitro, and definitive endothelial progenitor cell colonies in colony assay. These results suggest that RAC transplantation in MCAO models promoted significant recovery of neural tissues through intensified anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2912908528,"Cryopreservation is an essential tool to meet the increasing demand for stem cells in medical applications. To ensure maintenance of cell function upon thawing, the preservation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial, but so far there is little quantitative data on the influence of cryopreservation on cytoskeletal structures. For this reason, our study aims to quantitatively describe cryopreservation induced alterations to F-actin in adherent human mesenchymal stem cells, as a basic model for biomedical applications. Here we have characterised the actin cytoskeleton on single-cell level by calculating the circular standard deviation of filament orientation, F-actin content, and average filament length. Cryo-induced alterations of these parameters in identical cells pre and post cryopreservation provide the basis of our investigation. Differences between the impact of slow-freezing and vitrification are qualitatively analyzed and highlighted. Our analysis is supported by live cryo imaging of the actin cytoskeleton via two photon microscopy. We found similar actin alterations in slow-frozen and vitrified cells including buckling of actin filaments, reduction of F-actin content and filament shortening. These alterations indicate limited functionality of the respective cells. However, there are substantial differences in the frequency and time dependence of F-actin disruptions among the applied cryopreservation strategies; immediately after thawing, cytoskeletal structures show least disruption after slow freezing at a rate of 1°C/min. As post-thaw recovery progresses, the ratio of cells with actin disruptions increases, particularly in slow frozen cells. After 120 min of recovery the proportion of cells with an intact actin cytoskeleton is higher in vitrified than in slow frozen cells. Freezing at 10°C/min is associated with a high ratio of impaired cells throughout the post-thawing culture."
https://openalex.org/W2914437756,"Whereas previous research has focused on the role of the rTPJ when consciously inhibiting mimicry, we test the role of the rTPJ on mimicry within a social interaction, during which mimicking occurs nonconsciously. We wanted to determine whether higher rTPJ activation always inhibits the tendency to imitate (regardless of the context) or whether it facilitates mimicry during social interactions (when mimicking is an adaptive response). Participants received either active or sham intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS: a type of stimulation that increases cortical activation) to the rTPJ. Next, we measured how much participants mimicked the hair and face touching of another person. Participants in the active stimulation condition engaged in significantly less mimicry than those in the sham stimulation condition. This finding suggests that even in a context in which mimicking is adaptive, rTPJ inhibits mimicry rather than facilitating it, supporting the hypothesis that rTPJ enhances representations of self over other regardless of the goals within a given context."
https://openalex.org/W2911576314,"A geotextile mattress with sloping curtain is a newly proposed countermeasure against river and estuarine scour. In previous laboratory experiments, a geotextile mattress with sloping curtain was capable of protecting the bed downstream from scour and stimulating sediment deposition on both sides. However, the seepage scour under its geotextile mattress is inadequately researched at present. In this study, the Geotextile Mattress with Sloping Plate (GMSP) is proposed based on the simplification of the geotextile mattress with sloping curtain with the construction feasibility considered. A series of experiments was conducted to investigate the pressure distribution around the GMSP and the averaged seepage hydraulic gradient beneath its mattress. The results indicate remarkable pressure difference on two sides of the GMSP. The minimum bed pressure appears about 1.3 times the plate height downstream to the GMSP. The averaged seepage hydraulic gradient beneath the mattress increases with the sloping angle increasing from 35° to 60° in general. The averaged hydraulic gradient also ascends as the relative plate height increases, but reduces as the opening ratio increases at opening ratios greater than 0.143. The safety boundary for the averaged hydraulic gradient under the geotextile mattress of the GMSP could get much smaller than the critical hydraulic gradient of piping and can easily be overwhelmed. This phenomenon can mainly be attributed to the discontinuous contact between the mattress and the seabed. A suggestion for the parametric design of the GMSP is to extend the width of the mattress to reduce the risk of seepage failure."
https://openalex.org/W2914420501,"Background PACAP and VIP are closely related neuropeptides with wide distribution and potent effect in the vasculature. We previously reported vasomotor activity in peripheral vasculature of male wild type (WT) and PACAP-deficient (KO) mice. However, female vascular responses are still unexplored. We hypothesized that PACAP-like activity is maintained in female PACAP KO mice and the mechanism through which it is regulated differs from that of male PACAP KO animals. Methods We investigated the vasomotor effects of VIP and PACAP isoforms and their selective blockers in WT and PACAP KO female mice in carotid and femoral arteries. The expression and level of different PACAP receptors in the vessels were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results In both carotid and femoral arteries of WT mice, PACAP1-38, PACAP1-27 or VIP induced relaxation, without pronounced differences between them. Reduced relaxation was recorded only in the carotid arteries of KO mice as compared to their WT controls. The specific VPAC1R antagonist completely blocked the PACAP/VIP-induced relaxation in both arteries of all mice, while PAC1R antagonist affected relaxation only in their femoral arteries. Conclusion In female WT mice, VPAC1 receptors appear to play a dominant role in PACAP-induced vasorelaxation both in carotid and in femoral arteries. In the PACAP KO group PAC1R activation exerts vasorelaxation in the femoral arteries but in carotid arteries there is no significant effect of the activation of this receptor. In the background of this regional difference, decreased PAC1R and increased VPAC1R availability in the carotid arteries was found."
https://openalex.org/W2912343687,"Ipomoea imperati is widely used in tropical areas to treat several pathological conditions. The effect of this plant against parasitic species has not been investigated even being used for this purpose in the Brazilian northeastern. This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic and acaricide potential of a hydroethanolic extract of I. imperati leaves and stolons. I. imperati leaves and stolons were crushed and subjected to maceration in ethanol 70% (v/v), after which the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The chromatographic profile of the extract was obtained by UV Spectrum high-performance liquid chromatography and compounds were identified by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Identification of the compounds present in the extract was achieved by comparing their retention times and UV spectra with data in the literature. Anthelmintic activity was evaluated by larval exsheathment inhibition assays using Haemonchus contortus larvae and five concentrations of each extract ranging from 0.07 to 1.2 mg/mL. Acaricide activity was evaluated via larval immersion of Rhipicephalus microplus in eight concentrations of each extract ranging from 5.0 to 25.0 mg/mL. Live and dead larvae were counted after 24 hours. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for H. contortus larvae and the median lethal concentration (LC50) for R. microplus larvae were calculated. Twelve compounds were observed in the hydroethanolic extract of leaves, with a predominance of the aglycone form of flavonoids and tannins. This extract was effective against H. contortus larvae, presenting an average inhibitory concentration of 0.22 mg/mL, but showed no activity toward R. microplus larvae. The stolon hydroethanolic extract presented 11 compounds, with phenolic acids and glycosylated flavonoids prevailing. This extract showed low activity on R. microplus and no effect on inhibiting H. contortus larval exsheathment at the concentrations tested. This study is the first to assess the anthelmintic and acaricidal activities of I. imperati. Data reported confirm promising potential of I. imperati leaves hydroethanolic extract against H. contortus. This effect could be due to its secondary compounds presents in this extract, such as procyanidin, kaempferol, isoquercitrin and rutin."

Distal segments of ITA were obtained from 54 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Histological observation was performed in paraffin-embedded transverse sections of ITA through four staining protocols: hematoxylin-eosin, van Gieson, Masson's trichrome and von Kossa. Morphometric analysis included the intimal width (IW), medial width (MW) and intima/media ratio (IMR). No overt atherosclerotic lesions were observed. Mild calcifications were observed across the vascular wall layers in almost all samples. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed associations between IW and IMR and the following clinical variables: age, gender, kidney function expressed as eGFR and myocardial infarction history. Age (odds ratio = 1.16, P = 0.004), female gender (odds ratio = 11.34, P = 0.011), eGFR (odds ratio = 1.03, P = 0.059) and myocardial infarction history (odds ratio = 4.81, P = 0.040) were identified as the main clinical predictors for intimal hyperplasia. Preatherosclerotic lesions in ITA samples from patients undergoing coronary revascularization were associated not only with classical cardiovascular risk factors such as age and gender, but also with other clinical variables, namely kidney function and myocardial infarction history."
https://openalex.org/W2913991540,"The presence of native grasses in communities can suppress native forbs through competition and indirectly benefit these forbs by suppressing the invasion of highly competitive exotic species. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the potential of direct and indirect interactions to influence the aboveground biomass of four native forb species in the presence of the native perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium and exotic invasive Lespedeza cuneata. We examined patterns of growth for the invasive legume, the perennial grass, and four native species in four scenarios: 1) native species grown with the grass, 2) native species grown with the legume, 3) native species grown with both the grass and legume together, and 4) native species grown alone. Schizachyrium scoparium significantly decreased biomass of all forb species (p<0.05). In contrast, L. cuneata alone only significantly affected biomass of Asclepias tuberosa; L. cuneata increased the biomass of A. tuberosa only when the grass was present. When S. scoparium and L. cuneata were grown together, L. cuneata had significantly lower biomass (p = 0.007) and S. scoparium had significantly greater biomass (p = 0.002) than when each grew alone. These reciprocal effects suggest a potential pathway by which L. cuneata could alter forb diversity in grassland communities In this scenario, L. cuneata facilitates grass growth and competition with other natives. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring interactions between exotic invasive plant species and dominant native species in grassland communities to understand pathways of plant community change."

Outcome measures included spatiotemporal variables, scalar kinematic parameters (starting angles, range of motion-ROM, and endpoint angles) and time-normalized kinematic waveforms of trunk and UL joint angles (scapulothoracic, humerothoracic and elbow).Elastic tape provided common modifications throughout the task (shoulder more towards midline, reduced scapula protraction and trunk flexion) and important alterations at specific time-instants. At the end of the reaching phase, for both groups (ET and ST), the elastic tape increased elbow extension [ET: CI = 12.57 (6.90 to 18.17), p<0.001; ST: CI: 12.89 (6.79 to 18.98), p<0.001). At the end of transporting the glass to the mouth, patients who underwent the elastic tape intervention presented more shoulder elevation [ET: CI = 16.40 (4.28 to 28.52), p = 0.007; ST: CI: 15.13 (5.79 to 24.48), p = 0.002)]. Moreover, an increase of elbow extension at the end of transporting the glass to the table was observed for both groups [ET: CI = 8.13 (1.48 to 14.79), p = 0.014; ST: CI: 8.20 (4.03 to 12.38), p<0.001)]. However, no changes in the spatiotemporal parameters were observed for both groups during all the phases of the task (p>0.05).The ET changed UL joint motions and posture during a drinking task in chronic hemiparetic subjects, which defines its role as an adjuvant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2914504946,"99m-Technetium-labeled (99mTc) erythrocyte imaging with planar scintigraphy is widely used for evaluating both patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding and patients at risk for chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. While a number of alternative radionuclide-based blood pool imaging agents have been proposed, none have yet to achieve widespread clinical use. Here, we present both in vitro and small animal in vivo imaging evidence that the high physiological expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 on human erythrocytes allows uptake of the widely available radiotracer 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), at a rate and magnitude sufficient for clinical blood pool positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging. This imaging technique is likely to be amenable to rapid clinical translation, as it can be achieved using a simple FDG labeling protocol, requires a relatively small volume of phlebotomized blood, and can be completed within a relatively short time period. As modern PET scanners typically have much greater count detection sensitivities than that of commonly used clinical gamma scintigraphic cameras, FDG-labeled human erythrocyte PET imaging may not only have significant advantages over 99mTc-labeled erythrocyte imaging, but may have other novel blood pool imaging applications."
https://openalex.org/W2914124490,"Different metabolic conditions can affect what and how much we eat. Hormones of glucose metabolism and adipokines such as adiponectin take part in the control of these decisions and energy balance of the body. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these endocrine and metabolic factors influence food intake has not been reached. We hypothesised that the amount of food a person consumes differs substantially after a fasting period even after the energy deficit was partially removed by glucose ingestion and endocrine signals like insulin and C-peptide indicated a high glucose metabolic status. Furthermore, the macronutrient composition of the consumed food and a possible association with adiponectin under the influence of glucose ingestion was assessed.In a within-subject design, 24 healthy males participated in both a fasting (42 h) and control (non-fasting) condition. A total of 20 blood samples from each subject were collected during each condition to assess serum levels of adiponectin, insulin, C-peptide, cortisol and ACTH. At the end of each condition food intake was measured with an ad libitum buffet after the acute energy deficit was compensated using a carbohydrate-rich drink.The total amount of caloric intake and single macronutrients was higher after the fasting intervention after replenishment with glucose. All recorded hormone levels, except for adiponectin, were significantly different for at least one of the study intervals. The relative proportions of the macronutrient composition of the consumed food were stable in both conditions under the influence of glucose ingestion. In the non-fasting condition, the relative amount of protein intake correlated with adiponectin levels during the experiment.An anabolic glucose metabolism after glucose ingestion following a fasting intervention did not even out energy ingestion compared to a control group with regular food intake and glucose ingestion. Anorexigenic hormones like insulin in this context were not able despite higher levels than in the control condition to ameliorate the drive for food intake to normal or near normal levels. Relative macronutrient intake remains stable under these varying metabolic conditions and glucose influence. Serum adiponectin levels showed a positive association with the relative protein intake in the non-fasting condition under the influence of glucose although adiponectin levels overall did not differ in between the conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2912396396,"Current research on the relationship between phytoestrogens and mortality has been inconclusive. We explored the relationship between genistein, a phytoestrogen, and mortality in a large cohort representative of the United States population.Data were analyzed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2010. Normalized urinary genistein (nUG) was analyzed as a log-transformed continuous variable and in quartiles. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Index and matched to the NHANES participants. Survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for all-cause and cause-specific mortality without and with adjustment for potential confounding variables.Of 11,497 participants, 944 died during the 64,443 person-years follow-up. The all-cause mortality rate was significantly lower in the lowest quartile compared to the highest quartile (incidence rate ratio = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.76 to 2.60). Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile had significantly higher adjusted all-cause (HR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.23 to 2.00), cardiovascular (HR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.04 to 2.68), and other-cause (HR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.33 to 2.57) mortality.We found that high urinary genistein levels were associated with increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and other-cause mortality. This is contrary to popular opinion on the health benefits of genistein and needs further research."
https://openalex.org/W2911859871,"To observe the effects of different treatments of lymph after intestinal I/R in rats on macrophages in vitro.Forty-eight healthy SPF SD rats weighing 300 ± 20 g, were randomly divided into two groups: group A, and group B. The rats in group A were drained of lymph fluid for 180 min; the rats in group B were subjected to 60 min ischemia by clamping the SMA, followed by 120 min reperfusion and 180 min of lymph drainage. The lymph fluid collected was divided into 4 sub-groups: 1. no treatment (A1, Ly, and B1, I/R Ly); 2. protein degradation (A2, Ly PD, and B2 I/R PD); 3. endotoxin removal (A3, Ly ER, and B3, I/R ER); 4. protein degradation plus endotoxin removal (A4, Ly PD+ER, and B4, I/R PD+ER), then used to stimulate a monocyte-macrophage cell line.Compared with group A1, the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, HMGB1 concentration, protein and mRNA expression of TLR4, HMGB1 and NF-κBp65 were significantly increased in group B1. There was a significant reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and of the expression of TLR4, NF-κBp65, and chemokines in groups A2, B2, A4, and B4. However, there were no significant decrease of these factors in groups A3 and B3.The lymph fluid drained after intestinal I/R can cause inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Deproteinization of lymph fluid with proteinase K significantly reduced the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, TLR4 and NF-κBp65 in cell culture supernatant, exerting a protective effect on inflammatory reaction caused by the intestinal I/R. Passage of lymph fluid through an endotoxin removal column did not reduce the levels of active proinflammatory factors produced by macrophages in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2914650459,"In healthy arteries, blood flow is regulated by microvascular tone assessed by changes in blood flow volume and vascular resistance to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators. We developed a novel method of using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and a Doppler flow wire to measure changes in blood flow volume and vascular resistance of the profunda arterial bed. We assessed the variability over 6 months in measuring microvascular endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine and endothelium-independent dilation to adenosine in 20 subjects who were part of a larger study of Gulf War Illness without obstructive peripheral artery disease. Vasomotor function was assessed by Infusions of control (dextrose), acetylcholine (10-6M), adenosine (50μg), and nitroglycerin (25μg/ml). 400 IVUS and 240 flow velocity images were measured a mean 6 (SD = 2) months apart blind to measurement and infusion stage. The mean (SD) baseline profunda flow was 227 (172) ml/min and vascular resistance 4.6 x 104 (2.4 x 104) dynes-s/cm5. The intraclass correlation coefficients for 6-month variability for vascular function were excellent (range 0.827-0.995). Bland-Altman analyses showed mean differences of less than 2% for microvascular endothelium-dependent function (flow volume and resistance) and less than 1% for macrovascular endothelium-dependent function with acceptable limits of agreement. In 49 subjects assessing concurrent validity of the technique against atherosclerosis risk factors, we observed greater impairment in microvascular endothelium-dependent function per year of age (flow volume = -1.4% (p = 0.018), vascular resistance = 1.5% (p = 0.015)) and current smoking (flow volume = -36.7% (p = .006), vascular resistance = 50.0% (p<0.001)). This novel method of assessing microvascular vasomotor function had acceptable measurement reproducibility and validity."
