https://openalex.org/W1983762572,"Modeling and documenting malignant progression in vitro without the need for in vivo transplantation represents a clear step forward for cancer investigation. Using an air-liquid interface methodology, Xingnan Li and colleagues show they can robustly model a range of gastrointestinal malignancies from pancreas, stomach and colon in primary epithelial/mesenchymal organoid culture. This setup is able to generate detailed histologic endpoints for oncogenic transformation in vitro and demonstrate in vivo tumorigenicity when the organoids are transplanted. The application of primary organoid cultures containing epithelial and mesenchymal elements to cancer modeling holds promise for combining the accurate multilineage differentiation and physiology of in vivo systems with the facile in vitro manipulation of transformed cell lines. Here we used a single air-liquid interface culture method without modification to engineer oncogenic mutations into primary epithelial and mesenchymal organoids from mouse colon, stomach and pancreas. Pancreatic and gastric organoids exhibited dysplasia as a result of expression of Kras carrying the G12D mutation (KrasG12D), p53 loss or both and readily generated adenocarcinoma after in vivo transplantation. In contrast, primary colon organoids required combinatorial Apc, p53, KrasG12D and Smad4 mutations for progressive transformation to invasive adenocarcinoma-like histology in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, recapitulating multi-hit models of colorectal cancer (CRC), as compared to the more promiscuous transformation of small intestinal organoids. Colon organoid culture functionally validated the microRNA miR-483 as a dominant driver oncogene at the IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor-2) 11p15.5 CRC amplicon, inducing dysplasia in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. These studies demonstrate the general utility of a highly tractable primary organoid system for cancer modeling and driver oncogene validation in diverse gastrointestinal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2041653784,"Robert West, Jonathan Pollack and colleagues identify mutations in either the Hedgehog pathway gene SMO or the MAPK gene BRAF in 24 of the 28 ameloblastoma samples studied. They found 9 of 11 SMO mutations were found in maxillary ameloblastomas, whereas 9 of 13 BRAF mutations were found in mandibular cases. Here we report the discovery of oncogenic mutations in the Hedgehog and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in over 80% of ameloblastomas, locally destructive odontogenic tumors of the jaw, by genomic analysis of archival material. Mutations in SMO (encoding Smoothened, SMO) are common in ameloblastomas of the maxilla, whereas BRAF mutations are predominant in tumors of the mandible. We show that a frequently occurring SMO alteration encoding p.Leu412Phe is an activating mutation and that its effect on Hedgehog-pathway activity can be inhibited by arsenic trioxide (ATO), an anti-leukemia drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that is currently in clinical trials for its Hedgehog-inhibitory activity. In a similar manner, ameloblastoma cells harboring an activating BRAF mutation encoding p.Val600Glu are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Our findings establish a new paradigm for the diagnostic classification and treatment of ameloblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W1970880147,"Immune evasion is an emerging hallmark of cancer progression. However, functional studies to understand the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment are limited by the lack of available specific cell surface markers. We adapted a competitive peptide phage display platform to identify candidate peptides binding MDSCs specifically and generated peptide-Fc fusion proteins (peptibodies). In multiple tumor models, intravenous peptibody injection completely depleted blood, splenic and intratumoral MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice without affecting proinflammatory immune cell types, such as dendritic cells. Whereas control Gr-1-specific antibody primarily depleted granulocytic MDSCs, peptibodies depleted both granulocytic and monocytic MDSC subsets. Peptibody treatment was associated with inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, which was superior to that achieved with Gr-1-specific antibody. Immunoprecipitation of MDSC membrane proteins identified S100 family proteins as candidate targets. Our strategy may be useful to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic surface targets on rare cell subtypes, including human MDSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2047426399,"Antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad array of HIV-1 viral isolates from different clades have been isolated from some chronically infected individuals, but their development is thought to require several years. In this issue, Julie Overbaugh and her colleagues report that HIV-infected infants also develop broadly neutralizing antibodies—some at 1 year of age—and their occurrence early in life may shed light on HIV vaccine efforts to induce these antibodies. Eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against HIV-1 is daunting because of the extensive genetic and antigenic diversity of HIV-1. Moreover, broad and potent responses are uncommon even during persistent infection, with only a subset of adults developing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that recognize viral variants from different HIV-1 clades1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is not known whether bNAbs can also arise in HIV-1–infected infants, who typically progress to disease faster than adults9, presumably in part due to an immature immune system10. Here, we show that bNAbs develop at least as commonly in infants as in adults. Cross-clade NAb responses were detected in 20/28 infected infants, in some cases within 1 year of infection. Among infants with breadth of responses within the top quartile, neutralization of tier 2 or 3 variants from multiple clades was detected at 20 months after infection. These findings suggest that, even in early life, there is sufficient B cell functionality to mount bNAbs against HIV-1. Additionally, the relatively early appearance of bNAbs in infants may provide a unique setting for understanding the pathways of B cell maturation leading to bNAbs."

The resulting protein is a potent transcriptional activator of PAX3 response elements and is associated with aberrant expression of genes involved in neuroectodermal and myogenic differentiation. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma (SNS) is a newly described tumor of the nasal and paranasal areas. Here we report a recurrent chromosomal translocation in SNS, t(2;4)(q35;q31.1), resulting in a PAX3-MAML3 fusion protein that is a potent transcriptional activator of PAX3 response elements. The SNS phenotype is characterized by aberrant expression of genes involved in neuroectodermal and myogenic differentiation, closely simulating the developmental roles of PAX3."

https://openalex.org/W2151627051,"Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinomas are rare but highly aggressive tumors, and our understanding of them is limited. In a new study, Miles Wilkinson and colleagues now report that they have identified somatic mutations in an RNA helicase encoded by UPF1 in some pancreatic adenosquamous carcinomas. UPF1 is required for nonsense-mediated RNA decay, suggesting that the aberrant accumulation of altered RNA transcripts may contribute to the malignant phenotype of these tumors and could be a target of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this tumor type. Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is an enigmatic and aggressive tumor that has a worse prognosis and higher metastatic potential than its adenocarcinoma counterpart. Here we report that ASC tumors frequently harbor somatically acquired mutations in the UPF1 gene, which encodes the core component of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway. These tumor-specific mutations alter UPF1 RNA splicing and perturb NMD, leading to upregulated levels of NMD substrate mRNAs. UPF1 mutations are, to our knowledge, the first known unique molecular signatures of pancreatic ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2077670883,"Cisplatin has been the most accepted drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer for almost 40 years. Although the majority of patients with ovarian cancer respond to front-line platinum combination chemotherapy, many patients will develop cisplatin-resistance disease, which is extremely rapid and fatal. Although various mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been postulated, the key molecules involved in such resistance have not been identified. MiRNAs are endogenously expressed small non-coding RNAs, which are evolutionarily conserved and function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Dysregulation of miRNAs have been associated with cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance. The oncogenic miRNA-21, one of the best-studied miRNAs, is upregulated in almost all human cancers. However, the regulation of miR-21 in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells has not been assessed. In this study, we measured the miR-21 expression by real-time PCR and found upregulation of miR-21 in cisplatin resistant compared with cisplatin sensitive ovarian cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the association of the c-Jun transcription factor to the pri-mir-21 DNA promoter regions. Blocking the JNK-1, the major activator of c-Jun phosphorylation, reduced the expression of pre-mir-21 and increased the expression of its well-known target gene, PDCD4. Overexpression of miR-21 in cisplatin sensitive cells decreased PDCD4 levels and increased cell proliferation. Finally, targeting miR-21 reduced cell growth, proliferation and invasion of cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that the JNK-1/c-Jun/miR-21 pathway contributes to the cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells and demonstrated that miR-21 is a plausible target to overcome cisplatin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2052506731,"Contact-free palm-vein recognition is one of the most challenging and promising areas in hand biometrics. In view of the existing problems in contact-free palm-vein imaging, including projection transformation, uneven illumination and difficulty in extracting exact ROIs, this paper presents a novel recognition approach for contact-free palm-vein recognition that performs feature extraction and matching on all vein textures distributed over the palm surface, including finger veins and palm veins, to minimize the loss of feature information. First, a hierarchical enhancement algorithm, which combines a DOG filter and histogram equalization, is adopted to alleviate uneven illumination and to highlight vein textures. Second, RootSIFT, a more stable local invariant feature extraction method in comparison to SIFT, is adopted to overcome the projection transformation in contact-free mode. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical mismatching removal algorithm based on neighborhood searching and LBP histograms is adopted to improve the accuracy of feature matching. Finally, we rigorously evaluated the proposed approach using two different databases and obtained 0.996% and 3.112% Equal Error Rates (EERs), respectively, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
https://openalex.org/W2032534351,"Asphyxia around the time of preterm birth is associated with neurodevelopmental disability. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of connexin hemichannels would improve recovery of brain activity and reduce cell loss after asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep. Asphyxia was induced by 25 min of complete umbilical cord occlusion in preterm fetal sheep (103–104 d gestational age). Connexin hemichannels were blocked by intracerebroventricular infusion of mimetic peptide starting 90 min after asphyxia at a concentration of 50 µM/h for one hour followed by 50 µM/24 hour for 24 hours (occlusion-peptide group, n = 6) or vehicle infusion for controls (occlusion-vehicle group, n = 7). Peptide infusion was associated with earlier recovery of electroencephalographic power after asphyxia compared to occlusion-vehicle (p<0.05), with reduced neuronal loss in the caudate and putamen (p<0.05), but not in the hippocampus. In the intragyral and periventricular white matter, peptide administration was associated with an increase in total oligodendrocyte numbers (p<0.05) and immature/mature oligodendrocytes compared to occlusion-vehicle (p<0.05), with a significant increase in proliferation (p<0.05). Connexin hemichannel blockade was neuroprotective and reduced oligodendrocyte death and improved recovery of oligodendrocyte maturation in preterm fetuses after asphyxia."
https://openalex.org/W2017605179,"Background Accumulated evidence shows that the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is markedly activated in chronic heart failure (CHF). Recent studies provide information that Angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7), a metabolite of AngII, counteracts the effects of AngII. However, this balance between AngII and Ang-(1–7) is still little understood in CHF. We investigated the effects of exercise training on circulating and skeletal muscle RAS in the ischemic model of CHF. Methods/Main Results Male Wistar rats underwent left coronary artery ligation or a Sham operation. They were divided into four groups: 1) Sedentary Sham (Sham-S), 2) exercise-trained Sham (Sham-Ex), sedentary CHF (CHF-S), and exercise-trained CHF (CHF-Ex). Angiotensin concentrations and ACE and ACE2 activity in the circulation and skeletal muscle (soleus and plantaris) were quantified. Skeletal muscle ACE and ACE2 protein expression, and AT1, AT2, and Mas receptor gene expression were also evaluated. CHF reduced ACE2 serum activity. Exercise training restored ACE2 and reduced ACE activity in CHF. Exercise training reduced plasma AngII concentration in both Sham and CHF rats and increased the Ang-(1–7)/AngII ratio in CHF rats. CHF and exercise training did not change skeletal muscle ACE and ACE2 activity and protein expression. CHF increased AngII levels in both soleus and plantaris muscle, and exercise training normalized them. Exercise training increased Ang-(1–7) in the plantaris muscle of CHF rats. The AT1 receptor was only increased in the soleus muscle of CHF rats, and exercise training normalized it. Exercise training increased the expression of the Mas receptor in the soleus muscle of both exercise-trained groups, and normalized it in plantaris muscle. Conclusions Exercise training causes a shift in RAS towards the Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis in skeletal muscle, which can be influenced by skeletal muscle metabolic characteristics. The changes in RAS circulation do not necessarily reflect the changes occurring in the RAS of skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1977667863,"Growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), are key regulators of cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Growth factor signaling is modulated by context-dependent cross-talk between different signaling pathways. We demonstrate in this study that PDGF-BB induces phosphorylation of Smad2, a downstream mediator of the canonical TGFβ pathway, in primary dermal fibroblasts. The PDGF-BB-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation was dependent on the kinase activities of both TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) and PDGF β-receptor (PDGFRβ), and it was prevented by inhibitory antibodies against TGFβ. Inhibition of the activity of the TβRI kinase greatly reduced the PDGF-BB-dependent migration in dermal fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that the receptors for PDGF-BB and TGFβ interact physically in primary dermal fibroblasts and that stimulation with PDGF-BB induces internalization not only of PDGFRβ but also of TβRI. In addition, silencing of PDGFRβ by siRNA decreased the stability of TβRI and delayed TGFβ-induced signaling. We further show that the hyaluronan receptor CD44 interacts with both PDGFRβ and TβRI. Depletion of CD44 by siRNA increased signaling via PDGFRβ and TβRI by stabilizing the receptor proteins. Our data suggest that cross-talk between PDGFRβ and TβRI occurs in dermal fibroblasts and that CD44 negatively modulates signaling via these receptors."

Despite the recent interest in FFA4, its development as a therapeutic target has been hindered by a lack of available ligands and, in particular, a lack of ligands with suitable selectivity for FFA4 over FFA1, the other GPCR activated by LCFAs. Indeed, beyond the use of LCFAs that activate FFA1 and FFA4 with very similar potency, much of the early work on FFA4 utilized the compound GW9508, despite the fact that this ligand has only modest potency at FFA4 (1–5 μm) and is ∼100-fold more potent at FFA1 (8Briscoe C.P.

Early attempts to identify novel FFA4-selective agonists yielded only modest success, with all compounds described displaying low potency and/or very limited selectivity for FFA4 over FFA1 (9Hara T.

However, the recent description of ortho-biphenylmethoxyphenylpropionic acid derivatives as selective FFA4 agonists, as exemplified by the most potent and selective compound TUG-891, has provided a means to selectively probe the function of FFA4 (11Shimpukade B. Hudson B.D. Hovgaard C.K. Milligan G. Ulven T. Discovery of a potent and selective GPR120 agonist.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently used TUG-891 to explore in detail the in vitro pharmacology of FFA4 to begin to define the therapeutic potential of this receptor (12Hudson B.D. Shimpukade B. Mackenzie A.E. Butcher A.J. Pediani J.D. Christiansen E. Heathcote H. Tobin A.B. Ulven T. Milligan G.

Pharmacol. 2013; 84: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although TUG-891 currently represents the best available FFA4-selective ligand, this compound still possesses relatively modest potency and high lipophilicity (ClogP = 5.8), and it has been shown to have limited selectivity for the mouse ortholog of FFA4 over mouse FFA1 (12Hudson B.D.

Pharmacol. 2013; 84: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Considering these factors, there is a clear need to identify novel FFA4 agonists. Structure-based ligand design represents one approach that might be used to identify ligands for this receptor. However, although this approach has been successfully used for other GPCRs (13Congreve M. Langmead C. Marshall F.H. The use of GPCR structures in drug design.Adv. Pharmacol. 2011; 62: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Shoichet B.K. Kobilka B.K. Structure-based drug screening for G-protein-coupled receptors.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the lack of atomic level structural information on FFA4 is currently a restriction. Although there have been great advances in recent years within the field of GPCR structural biology (15Venkatakrishnan A.J. Deupi X. Lebon G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Babu M.M. Molecular signatures of G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2013; 494: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), it still remains impractical to obtain high resolution structures for receptors on demand. Instead, structure-based drug design must utilize homology modeling of the receptor and its binding site linked to validation by detailed receptor mutagenesis and functional studies. In this study, a combination of molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and ligand structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have been employed, through an iterative approach, to define the orthosteric binding site of FFA4. Through this, we have identified key residues within FFA4 involved in binding of the LCFA, α-linolenic acid (aLA), the previously studied FFA1/FFA4 agonist GW9508, as well as TUG-891. We demonstrate key differences in the interaction of each ligand with FFA4 and provide rationale for the high potency of the structural scaffold of TUG-891. Furthermore, examining SAR variations of this ortho-biphenyl scaffold has identified key residues in FFA4 responsible for the preference for the terminal methyl substituent present in TUG-891. Taken together, combining these approaches has allowed us to develop a well validated model of ligand interaction with FFA4 that will be useful in the future identification of novel ligands for this receptor.

The combined organic phase was washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to give 19 mg (98%) of TUG-909 as a white solid: mp 94–95 °C; Rf = 0.10 (EtOAc/petroleum ether, 1:2); 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 12.17 (br s, 1H), 7.42–7.15 (m, 7H), 7.10 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2H), 6.78 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 4.89 (s, 2H), 2.78–2.71 (m, 2H), 2.58 to 2.41 (m, 2H), 2.28 (s, 3H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 172.2, 161.4 (d, JCF = 244.0 Hz), 156.2, 138.8, 137.8 (d, JCF = 3.0 Hz), 136.6 (d, JCF = 7.6 Hz), 133.4, 132.9, 131.8 (d, JCF = 8.1 Hz), 129.7, 129.2, 128.2, 128.1 126.0, 115.6 (d, JCF = 21.9 Hz), 114.9 (d, JCF = 20.9 Hz), 114.53, 67.1, 35.3, 29.4, 20.9; HRMS calculated for C23H21FO3Na (M + Na+) was 387.1367 and found was 387.1378. The sequences of the short isoform of human FFA4 and the nanobody-stabilized β2-adrenoreceptor (Protein Data Bank 3P0G) (16Rasmussen S.G. Choi H.-J. Fung J.J. Pardon E. Casarosa P. Chae P.S.

Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the β2 adrenoceptor.Nature. 2011; 469: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) were aligned manually. Homology models of FFA4 were constructed using the Prime module implemented in the Schrödinger suite 2012 (17Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. A hierarchical approach to all-atom protein loop prediction.Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The FFA4 model was built using default settings, preprocessed using the OPLS-2005 force field, added hydrogen atoms, and assigned partial charges. Hydrogen bond assignment was done at pH 7.4 using PROPKA (18Olsson M.H. Søndergaard C.R. Rostkowski M. Jensen J.H. PROPKA3: Consistent treatment of internal and surface residues in empirical pKa predictions.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Restrained minimization was performed until heavy atoms converged to root mean square deviation = 0.3 Å using the OPLS-2005 force field. Loop refinement was performed using Prime's loop refinement module (17Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. A hierarchical approach to all-atom protein loop prediction.Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). For short loops, the default sampling rate was chosen, whereas the highest sampling rate was used for loops with more than eight amino acid residues. Variable dielectric surface-generalized Born model was selected as the solvent model. Side chains within 7 Å of the loop were energy-minimized with the energy cutoff at 10 kcal/mol. Mutations were introduced in the hFFA4 model in Maestro, and rotamers were adjusted manually to minimize side-chain clashes. The mutant models were preprocessed and restrained minimized using the OPLS-2005 force field in the Protein Preparation Wizard. All ligands were converted to three-dimensional structures in Maestro. Macromodel was used for energy minimization of ligands using the OPLS-2005 force field (19Schrödinger, LLCMacroModel. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2012Google Scholar). Ligands were prepared using LigPrep (39SchrödingerLigPrep, version 2.6. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2013Google Scholar). Ionization states were generated using Epik at pH 7.0 ± 1.0, and low energy ring conformations were restricted to one per ligand (20Shelley J.C. Cholleti A. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Timlin M.R. Uchimaya M. Epik: a software program for pKa prediction and protonation state generation for drug-like molecules.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2007; 21: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Induced-fit docking studies were performed using the IFD 2006 protocol as implemented in Schrödinger suite 2013-1 (21Schrödinger, LLCSchrödinger Suite 2013-1. Induced Fit Docking Protocol. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2013Google Scholar). The docking box was placed to include Arg-992.64, Phe-1153.29, Phe-2115.42, Trp-2776.48, and Phe-3047.36. Hydrogen bond constraints were set between the carboxylate of the ligand and Arg-992.64 and applied in both docking stages. Ligand conformational sampling was performed using default settings. Initial Glide docking was performed using standard settings, and the maximum number of poses per ligand was restricted to 15. Prime was used to refine residues within 5.0 Å of ligand poses. Re-docking was performed in Glide using the extra precision mode for the 10 highest ranking protein-ligand complex structures generated in the initial docking, which was within 30.0 kcal/mol of the lowest energy protein-ligand complex structure. Molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA) simulations were used to calculate ligand-binding energy (ΔGbind) (22Schrödinger, LLCPrime. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2013Google Scholar). Calculations were performed for all the docking poses resulting from induced-fit docking. Complexes were taken from separated ligand and protein structures; the variable dielectric surface-generalized Born solvation method was used, and the protein flexibility region was restricted to 4.0 Å from ligand. In sampling, only side chains were minimized, and constraints were applied on flexible residues to restrict them from deviating too much from their initial position. Plasmids encoding the short isoform of human FFA4 fused at its C terminus to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) and containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag and β-arrestin-2 fused to Renilla luciferase (Rluc) were as described previously (11Shimpukade B. Hudson B.D. Hovgaard C.K. Milligan G. Ulven T. Discovery of a potent and selective GPR120 agonist.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Hudson B.D. Shimpukade B. Mackenzie A.E. Butcher A.J. Pediani J.D. Christiansen E. Heathcote H. Tobin A.B. Ulven T. Milligan G. The pharmacology of a potent and selective agonist, TUG-891, demonstrates both potential opportunity and possible challenges to therapeutic agonism of FFA4 (GPR120).Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 84: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the FFA4 sequence using the QuikChange method (Stratagene), and in all cases the presence of the mutation was verified through sequencing. Stable inducible 293 cell lines were generated for either wild type or mutant FFA4-eYFP constructs using the Flp-InTM T-RExTM system (Invitrogen). Briefly, Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells were co-transfected with the desired FFA4-eYFP construct and the pOG44 plasmid encoding the Flp recombinase enzyme. This allows for polyclonal selection of cells using hygromycin B to generate cell lines with inducible expression of the desired receptor in response to the antibiotic doxycycline. Once generated, receptor expression and doxycycline sensitivity were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy to detect the C-terminal eYFP tag. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out with polyethyleneimine, and experiments were conducted 48 h post-transfection according to a previously described protocol (12Hudson B.D. Shimpukade B. Mackenzie A.E. Butcher A.J. Pediani J.D. Christiansen E. Heathcote H. Tobin A.B. Ulven T. Milligan G. The pharmacology of a potent and selective agonist, TUG-891, demonstrates both potential opportunity and possible challenges to therapeutic agonism of FFA4 (GPR120).Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 84: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-FFA4-eYFP (or appropriate mutant) and β-arrestin-2-Rluc plasmids in a ratio of 4:1. 24 h post-transfection, cells were subcultured into poly-d-lysine-coated white 96-well tissue culture plates and maintained for a further 24 h prior to the experiment. To conduct the experiments, cells were first washed and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The Rluc substrate coelenterazine h was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm before a further incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. Test compounds were then added at the specified concentration, and cells were incubated for a final 5-min period prior to measuring luminescent emission at 530 and 490 nm using a PheraStar FS plate reader (BMG Lab Tech) fitted with a BRET1 optic module. The 530/490 emission ratio was calculated and corrected for the ratio obtained in cells transfected with only the β-arrestin-2-Rluc plasmid to obtain the “net BRET” signal. To compare the magnitude of signal across FFA4 mutants, net BRET values were normalized against the signal obtained from wild type FFA4 treated with 100 μm aLA. HEK293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-FFA4-eYFP (or mutant) and β-arrestin-2-Rluc plasmids in a 4:1 ratio were subcultured 24 h after transfection into poly-d-lysine-coated black 96-well tissue culture plates with clear bottoms. After 24 h, cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal primary antibody diluted in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 30 min with a combination of Hoechst 33342 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Cells were then washed three times with PBS before reading both eYFP (excitation 500 nm and emission 535 nm) and Hoechst (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm) on a PolarStar Omega plate reader (BMG LabTech). Cells were then washed a final time with PBS before incubation in the dark with the horseradish peroxidase SureBlueTM TMB substrate (KPL, Inc.). Absorbance at 620 nm was then measured on a PolarStar Omega plate reader. To obtain total expression, the eYFP fluorescence was corrected for cell number based on the Hoechst fluorescence. Surface expression was reported as the 620 nm absorbance corrected for cell number based on Hoechst fluorescence. In both cases, all values were expressed as a percentage of the signal obtained from wild type FLAG-FFA4-eYFP-transfected cells. Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells engineered to express the desired form of FFA4 were plated 50,000 cells/well in black 96-well plates with clear bottoms. Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml doxycycline to induce receptor expression and maintained overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to their use. For the assay, cells were first pre-labeled for 45 min with the calcium-sensitive dye Fura2-AM, then washed, and maintained in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Fura-2 fluorescent emission at 510 nm resulting from 340 or 380 nm of excitation was then monitored using a Flexstation II plate reader (Molecular Devices). Basal fluorescence was measured for 16 s; test compounds were then added, and fluorescence was measured for an additional 74 s. The background subtracted peak 340/380 ratio obtained following compound addition was then used to plot concentration-response data. All data presented represent the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using the GraphPad Prism software package version 5.0b. Concentration-response data were plotted on a log axis, where the untreated vehicle control condition was plotted at 1 log unit lower than the lowest test concentration of ligand and fitted to a three-parameter sigmoidal concentration-response curve. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc test. To define the ligand binding pocket of human FFA4 and to identify specific residues important for ligand interaction, we employed combinations of molecular modeling, receptor mutagenesis, and ligand SAR studies. Previous work defining the mode of binding of orthosteric agonists to the free fatty acid receptors FFA1–FFA3 has demonstrated that a pair of Arg residues near the top of the transmembrane (TM) helical bundle, at positions 5.39 and 7.35 (Ballesteros and Weinstein GPCR numbering scheme (23Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for modeling G-protein coupled receptors.Methods Neurosci. 1995; : 366-428Crossref Scopus (2465) Google Scholar)), form critical ionic interactions with the carboxylate of both endogenous fatty acids and various synthetic ligands (24Tikhonova I.G.

However, FFA4 is only distantly related to FFA1–FFA3, and these two positively charged residues are not conserved. Instead, several studies have implicated a single Arg at position 2.64 (amino acid 99 in the primary sequence) as the critical residue involved in the interaction between FFA4 and the carboxylate of its ligands (12Hudson B.D.

Based on this key interaction, we developed models of the FFA4 ligand binding pocket, including one described previously (11Shimpukade B. Hudson B.D. Hovgaard C.K. Milligan G. Ulven T.

Chem. 2012; 55: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), to predict additional residues that might be involved in binding to the receptor of either the endogenous agonist aLA or selected synthetic ligands. From this, 21 residues predicted to contribute to or to be in close proximity to the ligand binding pocket were identified and subjected to Ala replacement (except for R99Q2.64 and F303H7.35) mutagenesis (Table 1, top).TABLE 1Potency and efficacy in a β-arrestin-2 recruitment assay of aLA, TUG-891, TUG-670, and GW9508 on wild type FFA4 and mutations predicted to be in close proximity to the ligand binding pocketa Primary amino acid residue number with Ballesteros and Weinstein position in parentheses.b Cell surface expression is shown as a percentage of wild type; total expression is in parentheses.c pEC50 values with efficacy expressed as a percentage of the wild type aLA response in parentheses.d (pEC50 mutant) − (pEC50 WT FFA4).

https://openalex.org/W2132532698,"The oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD represents a new promising therapeutic agent for patients with a malignant glioma and is currently under investigation in clinical phase I/II trials. Earlier preclinical studies showed that Delta24-RGD is able to effectively lyse tumor cells, yielding promising results in various immune-deficient glioma models. However, the role of the immune response in oncolytic adenovirus therapy for glioma has never been explored. To this end, we assessed Delta24-RGD treatment in an immune-competent orthotopic mouse model for glioma and evaluated immune responses against tumor and virus. Delta24-RGD treatment led to long-term survival in 50% of mice and this effect was completely lost upon administration of the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone. Delta24-RGD enhanced intra-tumoral infiltration of F4/80+ macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and increased the local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In treated mice, T cell responses were directed to the virus as well as to the tumor cells, which was reflected in the presence of protective immunological memory in mice that underwent tumor rechallenge. Together, these data provide evidence that the immune system plays a vital role in the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic adenovirus therapy of glioma, and may provide angles to future improvements on Delta24-RGD therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051879351,"Dysfunction and reduction of circulating endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) is correlated with the onset of cardiovascular disorders including coronary artery disease (CAD). VEGF is a known mitogen for EPC to migrate out of bone marrow to possess angiogenic activities, and the plasma levels of VEGF are inversely correlated to the progression of CAD. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in patient body fluids have recently been considered to hold the potential of being novel disease biomarkers and drug targets. However, how miRNAs and VEGF cooperate to regulate CAD progression is still unclear. Through the small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq), we deciphered the miRNome patterns of EPCs with different angiogenic activities, hypothesizing that miRNAs targeting VEGF must be more abundant in EPCs with lower angiogenic activities. Candidates of anti-VEGF miRNAs, including miR-361-5p and miR-484, were enriched in not only diseased EPCs but also the plasma of CAD patients. However, we found out only miR-361-5p, but not miR-484, was able to suppress VEGF expression and EPC activities. Reporter assays confirmed the direct binding and repression of miR-361-5p to the 3′-UTR of VEGF mRNA. Knock down of miR-361-5p not only restored VEGF levels and angiogenic activities of diseased EPCs in vitro, but further promoted blood flow recovery in ischemic limbs of mice. Collectively, we discovered a miR-361-5p/VEGF-dependent regulation that could help to develop new therapeutic modalities not only for ischemia-related diseases but also for tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1993478044,"Severe influenza is characterized by cytokine storm and multiorgan failure with metabolic energy disorders and vascular hyperpermeability. In the regulation of energy homeostasis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex plays an important role by catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid synthesis, and thus its activity is linked to energy homeostasis. The present study tested the effects of diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), a new PDH kinase 4 (PDK4) inhibitor, in mice with severe influenza. Infection of mice with influenza A PR/8/34(H1N1) virus resulted in marked down-regulation of PDH activity and ATP level, with selective up-regulation of PDK4 in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver and lungs. Oral administration of DADA at 12-h intervals for 14 days starting immediately after infection significantly restored PDH activity and ATP level in various organs, and ameliorated disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism in the blood, together with marked improvement of survival and suppression of cytokine storm, trypsin up-regulation and viral replication. These results indicate that through PDK4 inhibition, DADA effectively suppresses the host metabolic disorder-cytokine cycle, which is closely linked to the influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle, resulting in prevention of multiorgan failure in severe influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2143406866,"ATP is as an extracellular signaling molecule able to amplify the cell lysis inflicted by certain bacterial toxins including the two RTX toxins α-hemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli and leukotoxin A (LtxA) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Inhibition of P2X receptors completely blocks the RTX toxin-induced hemolysis over a larger concentration range. It is, however, at present not known how the ATP that provides the amplification is released from the attacked cells. Here we show that both HlyA and LtxA trigger acute release of ATP from human erythrocytes that preceded and were not caused by cell lysis. This early ATP release did not occur via previously described ATP-release pathways in the erythrocyte. Both HlyA and LtxA were capable of triggering ATP release in the presence of the pannexin 1 blockers carbenoxolone and probenecid, and the HlyA-induced ATP release was found to be similar in erythrocytes from pannexin 1 wild type and knock-out mice. Moreover, the voltage-dependent anion channel antagonist TRO19622 had no effect on ATP release by either of the toxins. Finally, we showed that both HlyA and LtxA were able to release ATP from ATP-loaded lipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) vesicles devoid of any erythrocyte channels or transporters. Again we were able to show that this happened in a non-lytic fashion, using calcein-containing vesicles as controls. These data show that both toxins incorporate into lipid vesicles and allow ATP to be released. We suggest that both toxins cause acute ATP release by letting ATP pass the toxin pores in both human erythrocytes and artificial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2094852275,"Accelerated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase results from its sterol-induced binding to ER membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2. This binding allows for subsequent ubiquitination of reductase by Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases. Once ubiquitinated, reductase becomes dislocated from ER membranes into the cytosol for degradation by 26 S proteasomes through poorly defined reactions mediated by the AAA-ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 and augmented by the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol. Here, we report that the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol and geranylgeraniol combine to trigger extraction of reductase across ER membranes prior to its cytosolic release. This conclusion was drawn from studies utilizing a novel assay that measures membrane extraction of reductase by determining susceptibility of a lumenal epitope in the enzyme to in vitro protease digestion. Susceptibility of the lumenal epitope to protease digestion and thus membrane extraction of reductase were tightly regulated by 25-hydroxycholesterol and geranylgeraniol. The reaction was inhibited by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of either Insigs or VCP/p97. In contrast, reductase continued to become membrane-extracted, but not cytosolically dislocated, in cells deficient for AAA-ATPases of the proteasome 19 S regulatory particle. These findings establish sequential roles for VCP/p97 and the 19 S regulatory particle in the sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase that may be applicable to the ERAD of other substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2105626368,"The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is one member of the most important WD repeat–containing family of proteins found in all eukaryotes and is involved in multiple signaling pathways. However, compared with the progress in the area of mammalian RACK1, our understanding of the functions and molecular mechanisms of RACK1 in the regulation of plant growth and development is still in its infancy. In the present study, we investigated the roles of rice RACK1A gene (OsRACK1A) in controlling seed germination and its molecular mechanisms by generating a series of transgenic rice lines, of which OsRACK1A was either over-expressed or under-expressed. Our results showed that OsRACK1A positively regulated seed germination and negatively regulated the responses of seed germination to both exogenous ABA and H2O2. Inhibition of ABA biosynthesis had no enhancing effect on germination, whereas inhibition of ABA catabolism significantly suppressed germination. ABA inhibition on seed germination was almost fully recovered by exogenous H2O2 treatment. Quantitative analyses showed that endogenous ABA levels were significantly higher and H2O2 levels significantly lower in OsRACK1A-down regulated transgenic lines as compared with those in wildtype or OsRACK1A-up regulated lines. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcript levels of OsRbohs and amylase genes, RAmy1A and RAmy3D, were significantly lower in OsRACK1A-down regulated transgenic lines. It is concluded that OsRACK1A positively regulates seed germination by controlling endogenous levels of ABA and H2O2 and their interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2015207743,"Background The evidence on alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected civilian populations remains extremely weak, despite a number of potential risk-factors. The aim of this study is to examine patterns of alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected persons in the Republic of Georgia. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 3600 randomly selected internally displaced persons (IDPs) and former IDPs. Two alcohol use disorder outcomes were measured: (i) having at least hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT score ≥8); (ii) episodic heavy drinking (consuming >60 grams of pure alcohol per drinking session at least once a week). Individual level demographic and socio-economic characteristics were also recorded, including mental disorders. Community level alcohol environment characteristics relating to alcohol availability, marketing and pricing were recorded in the respondents' communities and a factor analysis conducted to produce a summary alcohol environment factor score. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between individual and community level factors with the alcohol use disorder outcomes (among men only). Results Of the total sample, 71% of men and 16% of women were current drinkers. Of the current drinkers (N = 1386), 28% of men and 1% of women were classified as having at least hazardous alcohol use; and 12% of men and 2% of women as episodic heavy drinkers. Individual characteristics significantly associated with both outcomes were age and experiencing a serious injury, while cumulative trauma events and depression were also associated with having at least hazardous alcohol use. For the community level analysis, a one unit increase in the alcohol environment factor was associated with a 1.27 fold increase in episodic heavy drinking among men (no significant association with hazardous alcohol use). Conclusion The findings suggest potential synergies for treatment responses for alcohol use disorder and depression among conflict-affected populations in Georgia, as well as the need for stronger alcohol control policies in Georgia."
https://openalex.org/W2064093038,"The archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus grows optimally at 100 °C by converting carbohydrates to acetate, CO2, and H2, obtaining energy from a respiratory membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH). This conserves energy by coupling H2 production to oxidation of reduced ferredoxin with generation of a sodium ion gradient. MBH is encoded by a 14-gene operon with both hydrogenase and Na(+)/H(+) antiporter modules. Herein a His-tagged MBH was expressed in P. furiosus and the detergent-solubilized complex purified under anaerobic conditions by affinity chromatography. Purified MBH contains all 14 subunits by electrophoretic analysis (13 subunits were also identified by mass spectrometry) and had a measured iron:nickel ratio of 15:1, resembling the predicted value of 13:1. The as-purified enzyme exhibited a rhombic EPR signal characteristic of the ready nickel-boron state. The purified and membrane-bound forms of MBH both preferentially evolved H2 with the physiological donor (reduced ferredoxin) as well as with standard dyes. The O2 sensitivities of the two forms were similar (half-lives of ∼ 15 h in air), but the purified enzyme was more thermolabile (half-lives at 90 °C of 1 and 25 h, respectively). Structural analysis of purified MBH by small angle x-ray scattering indicated a Z-shaped structure with a mass of 310 kDa, resembling the predicted value (298 kDa). The angle x-ray scattering analyses reinforce and extend the conserved sequence relationships of group 4 enzymes and complex I (NADH quinone oxidoreductase). This is the first report on the properties of a solubilized form of an intact respiratory MBH complex that is proposed to evolve H2 and pump Na(+) ions."
https://openalex.org/W2150832106,"The aim of this study was to determine whether virtual training improves grip force control in prosthesis use, and to examine which type of augmented feedback facilitates its learning most. Thirty-two able-bodied participants trained grip force with a virtual ball-throwing game for five sessions in a two-week period, using a myoelectric simulator. They received either feedback on movement outcome or on movement execution. Sixteen controls received training that did not focus on force control. Variability over learning was examined with the Tolerance-Noise-Covariation approach, and the transfer of grip force control was assessed in five test-tasks that assessed different aspects of force control in a pretest, a posttest and a retention test. During training performance increased while the variability in performance was decreased, mainly by reduction in noise. Grip force control only improved in the test-tasks that provided information on performance. Starting the training with a task that required low force production showed no transfer of the learned grip force. Feedback on movement execution was detrimental to grip force control, whereas feedback on movement outcome enhanced transfer of grip force control to tasks other than trained. Clinical implications of these results regarding virtual training of grip force control are discussed."

This study aimed to explore the effect of suspension type on kinetic and kinematic gait parameters during level walking with the new suspension system as well as two other commonly used systems (the Seal-In and pin/lock). Thirteen persons with transtibial amputation participated in this study. A Vicon motion system (six cameras, two force platforms) was utilized to obtain gait kinetic and kinematic variables, as well as pistoning within the prosthetic socket. The gait deviation index was also calculated based on the kinematic data. The findings indicated significant difference in the pistoning values among the three suspension systems. The Seal-In system resulted in the least pistoning compared with the other two systems. Several kinetic and kinematic variables were also affected by the suspension type. The ground reaction force data showed that lower load was applied to the limb joints with the magnetic suspension system compared with the pin/lock suspension. The gait deviation index showed significant deviation from the normal with all the systems, but the systems did not differ significantly. Main significant effects of the suspension type were seen in the GRF (vertical and fore-aft), knee and ankle angles. The new magnetic suspension system showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters to the other studied systems. This study may have implications on the selection of suspension systems for transtibial prostheses. Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2013061813706N1."

We previously reported that the oral administration of rebamipide (Reb), a mucosal protective agent, had a potent therapeutic effect on autoimmune lesions in a murine model of Sjögren's syndrome (SS). However, the effects of topical treatment with Reb eyedrops on the ocular lesions in the murine model of SS are unknown. Methods and Finding Reb eyedrops were administered to the murine model of SS aged 4–8 weeks four times daily. Inflammatory lesions of the extraorbital and intraorbital lacrimal glands and Harderian gland tissues were histologically evaluated. The direct effects of Reb on the lacrimal glands were analyzed using cultured lacrimal gland cells. Tear secretions of Reb-treated mice were significantly increased compared with those of untreated mice. In addition to the therapeutic effect of Reb treatment on keratoconjunctivitis, severe inflammatory lesions of intraorbital lacrimal gland tissues in this model of SS were resolved. The mRNA expression levels of IL-10 and mucin 5Ac in conjunctival tissues from Reb-treated mice was significantly increased compared with those of control mice. Moreover, lactoferrin production from lacrimal gland cells was restored by Reb treatment. Conclusion Topical Reb administration had an anti-inflammatory effect on the ocular autoimmune lesions in the murine model of SS and a protective effect on the ocular surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1997910750,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) suggests a direct cellular insult to myocardium. Apoptosis is considered as one of the hallmarks of DCM. Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DCM. In this study, we explored the prevention of myocardial apoptosis by crude extract from Flos Puerariae (FPE) in experimental diabetic mice.Experimental diabetic model was induced by intraperitoneally injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg/day) for five consecutive days in C57BL/6J mice. FPE (100, 200 mg/kg) was orally administrated once a day for ten weeks. Cardiac structure changes, apoptosis, superoxide production, NADPH oxidase subunits expression (gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox), and related regulatory factors were assessed in the heart of mice.Diabetic mice were characterized by high blood glucose (≥11.1 mmol/L) and reduced body weight. In the end of the experiment, aberrant myofilament structure, as well as TUNEL positive cardiac cells coupled with increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression was found in diabetic mice. Moreover, ROS formation, the ratio of NADP+/NADPH and NADPH oxidase subunits expression of gp91phox and p47phox, lipid peroxidation level was significantly increased, while antioxidant enzyme SOD and GSH-Px activity were reduced in the myocardial tissue of diabetic mice. In contrast, treatment with FPE resulted in a normalized glucose and weight profile. FPE administration also preserved myocardial structure and reduced apoptotic cardiac cell death in diabetic mice. The elevated markers of oxidative stress were significantly reversed by FPE supplementation. Further, FPE treatment markedly inhibited the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression, as well as suppressed JNK and P38 MAPK activation in the heart of diabetic mice.Our data demonstrate for the first time that FPE may have therapeutic potential for STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy through preventing myocardial apoptosis via attenuation oxidative stress. And this effect is probably mediated by JNK and P38 MAPK signaling pathway."

The aim of our study has been to investigate the mechanism by which the loss of CBX7 expression may contribute to the emergence of a more malignant phenotype.We analyzed the gene expression profile of a thyroid carcinoma cell line after the restoration of CBX7 and, then, analyzed the transcriptional regulation of identified genes. Finally, we evaluated the expression of CBX7 and regulated genes in a panel of thyroid and lung carcinomas.We found that CBX7 negatively or positively regulates the expression of several genes (such as SPP1, SPINK1, STEAP1, and FOS, FOSB, EGR1, respectively) associated to cancer progression, by interacting with their promoter regions and modulating their transcriptional activity. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses in human thyroid and lung carcinoma tissues revealed a negative correlation between CBX7 and its down-regulated genes, while a positive correlation was observed with up-regulated genes.In conclusion, the loss of CBX7 expression might play a critical role in advanced stages of carcinogenesis by deregulating the expression of specific effector genes."

https://openalex.org/W2084894022,"Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and WNT proteins are key regulators in many developmental processes, like embryonic patterning and brain development. In the brain, SHH is expressed in a gradient starting in the floor plate (FP) progressing ventrally in the midbrain, where it is thought to be involved in the development and specification of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons. GLI2A-mediated SHH-signaling induces the expression of Gli1, which is inhibited when cells start expressing SHH themselves. To determine whether mdDA neurons receive GLI2A-mediated SHH-signaling during differentiation, we used a BAC-transgenic mouse model expressing eGFP under the control of the Gli1 promoter. This mouse-model allowed for mapping of GLI2A-mediated SHH-signaling temporal and spatial in the mouse midbrain. Since mdDA neurons are born from E10.5, peaking at E11.0–E12.0, we examined Gli1-eGFP embryos at E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, indicating whether Gli1 was induced before or during mdDA development and differentiation. Our data indicate that GLI2A-mediated SHH-signaling is not involved in mdDA neuronal differentiation. However, it appears to be involved in the differentiation of neurons which make up a subset of the red nucleus (RN). In order to detect whether mdDA neuronal differentiation may be under the control of canonical WNT-signaling, we used a transgenic mouse-line expressing LacZ under the influence of stable β-catenin. Here, we show that TH+ neurons of the midbrain receive canonical WNT-signaling during differentiation. Therefore, we suggest that early SHH-signaling is indirectly involved in mdDA development through early patterning of the midbrain area, whereas canonical WNT-signaling is directly involved in the differentiation of the mdDA neuronal population."

The ratio of assembled to disassembled V-ATPases is dynamic and responds to variations in glucose concentration. Glucose removal leads to V1Vo disassembly, which helps reserve energy when glucose is limiting. Once energy is restored, after glucose readdition, V1Vo reassembles (2Kane P.M.

PEGylated and non-PEGylated DyLight 650 and 750 dyes were conjugated to the chimeric anti-CEA antibody. The dyes were initially injected intravenously into nude mice without tumors. Tissue biodistribution was determined by tissue sonication and analyzing tissue dye concentration profiles over time. PEGylated dyes had significantly lower accumulation in the liver (p = 0.03 for the 650 dyes; p = 0.002 for the 750 dyes) compared to non-PEGylated dyes. In an experimental liver metastasis model of HT-29 colon cancer, PEGylated dyes conjugated to the anti-CEA antibody showed good labeling of metastatic tumors with high contrast between normal and malignant tissue which was not possible with the non-PEGylated dyes since there was so much non-specific accumulation in the liver. PEGylation of the DyLight 650 and 750 NIR dyes significantly altered tissue biodistribution, allowing brighter tissue labeling, decreased accumulation in normal organs, particularly the liver. This enabled high fidelity and high contrast imaging of liver metastases."
https://openalex.org/W1999908911,"SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, acts as a negative regulator for many transcription factors, and plays protective roles in inflammation and atherosclerosis. Transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) has been previously shown to play pro-inflammatory roles in endothelial cells. Inhibition of NFAT signaling may be an attractive target to regulate inflammation in atherosclerosis. However, whether NFAT transcriptional activity is suppressed by SIRT1 remains unknown. In this study, we found that SIRT1 suppressed NFAT-mediated transcriptional activity. SIRT1 interacted with NFAT, and the NHR and RHR domains of NFAT mediated the interaction with SIRT1. Moreover, we found that SIRT1 primarily deacetylated NFATc3. Adenoviral over-expression of SIRT1 suppressed PMA and calcium ionophore Ionomycin (PMA/Io)-induced COX-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), while SIRT1 RNAi reversed the effects in HUVECs. Moreover, inhibition of COX-2 expression by SIRT1 in PMA/Io-treated HUVECs was largely abrogated by inhibiting NFAT activation. Furthermore, SIRT1 inhibited NFAT-induced COX-2 promoter activity, and reduced NFAT binding to the COX-2 promoter in PMA/Io-treated HUVECs. These results suggest that suppression of NFAT transcriptional activity is involved in SIRT1-mediated inhibition of COX-2 expression induced by PMA/Io, and that the negative regulatory mechanisms of NFAT by SIRT1 may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2094323790,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) have both anabolic and catabolic effects on bone. However, no GC anabolic effect mediator has been identified to date. Here we show that targeted expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a GC anti-inflammatory effect mediator, enhances bone acquisition in mice. Transgenic mice, in which the expression of GILZ is under the control of a 3.6-kb rat type I collagen promoter, exhibited a high bone mass phenotype with significantly increased bone formation rate and osteoblast numbers. The increased osteoblast activity correlates with enhanced osteogenic differentiation and decreased adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cell cultures in vitro. In line with these changes, the mRNA levels of key osteogenic regulators (Runx2 and Osx) increased, and the level of adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ2 decreased significantly. We also found that GILZ physically interacts with C/EBPs and disrupts C/EBP-mediated PPARγ gene transcription. In conclusion, our results showed that GILZ is capable of increasing bone acquisition in vivo, and this action is mediated via a mechanism involving the inhibition of PPARγ gene transcription and shifting of bone marrow MSC/progenitor cell lineage commitment in favor of the osteoblast pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2152479682,"Children often make letter reversal errors when first learning to read and write, even for letters whose reversed forms do not appear in normal print. However, the brain basis of such letter reversal in children learning to read is unknown. The present study compared the neuroanatomical correlates (via functional magnetic resonance imaging) and the electrophysiological correlates (via event-related potentials or ERPs) of this phenomenon in children, ages 5-12, relative to young adults. When viewing reversed letters relative to typically oriented letters, adults exhibited widespread occipital, parietal, and temporal lobe activations, including activation in the functionally localized visual word form area (VWFA) in left occipito-temporal cortex. Adults exhibited significantly greater activation than children in all of these regions; children only exhibited such activation in a limited frontal region. Similarly, on the P1 and N170 ERP components, adults exhibited significantly greater differences between typical and reversed letters than children, who failed to exhibit significant differences between typical and reversed letters. These findings indicate that adults distinguish typical and reversed letters in the early stages of specialized brain processing of print, but that children do not recognize this distinction during the early stages of processing. Specialized brain processes responsible for early stages of letter perception that distinguish between typical and reversed letters may develop slowly and remain immature even in older children who no longer produce letter reversals in their writing."
https://openalex.org/W1963882459,"Although accelerometers are extensively used for assessing gait, limited research has evaluated the concurrent validity of these devices on less predictable walking surfaces or the comparability of different methods used for gravitational acceleration compensation. This study evaluated the concurrent validity of trunk accelerations derived from a tri-axial inertial measurement unit while walking on firm, compliant and uneven surfaces and contrasted two methods used to remove gravitational accelerations; i) subtraction of the best linear fit from the data (detrending); and ii) use of orientation information (quaternions) from the inertial measurement unit. Twelve older and twelve younger adults walked at their preferred speed along firm, compliant and uneven walkways. Accelerations were evaluated for the thoracic spine (T12) using a tri-axial inertial measurement unit and an eleven-camera Vicon system. The findings demonstrated excellent agreement between accelerations derived from the inertial measurement unit and motion analysis system, including while walking on uneven surfaces that better approximate a real-world setting (all differences <0.16 m.s−2). Detrending produced slightly better agreement between the inertial measurement unit and Vicon system on firm surfaces (delta range: −0.05 to 0.06 vs. 0.00 to 0.14 m.s−2), whereas the quaternion method performed better when walking on compliant and uneven walkways (delta range: −0.16 to −0.02 vs. −0.07 to 0.07 m.s−2). The technique used to compensate for gravitational accelerations requires consideration in future research, particularly when walking on compliant and uneven surfaces. These findings demonstrate trunk accelerations can be accurately measured using a wireless inertial measurement unit and are appropriate for research that evaluates healthy populations in complex environments."
https://openalex.org/W2078776195,"Objective Recent treatment patterns and cost data associated with HIV in the United States are limited. This study assessed first-line persistence and healthcare costs of HIV-1 in patients by treatment line and CD4 cell count. Methods MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (2007–2011) and Lab Database (2007–2010) were used to construct two HIV-1 cohorts: 1) newly treated HIV-1–infected patients with ≥6 months' continuous enrollment prior to first third-agent drug claim (Newly Treated Cohort) and 2) CD4 cell count test results (CD4 Measurements Cohort). All patients were ≥18 years old and without hepatitis co-infection. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to measure treatment switch rates. Generalized linear models (gamma distribution, log link) were used to compare healthcare costs by treatment line and CD4 cell count controlling for potential confounders. Results Newly treated patients (n = 8,617) had mean age of 41, 82% were male, and 20% had experienced AIDS-defining events at baseline. Over 20% of newly treated patients switched initial treatment regimen within 2 years. Average unadjusted (and covariate-adjusted) total healthcare cost/year was $33,674 ($28,861) for first-line, $39,191 ($35,805) for second-line, and $39,882 ($40,804) for third-line treatment. Covariate-adjusted costs of care on second- and third-line treatments were significantly more expensive than first-line treatment (24% [p<0.001] and 41% [p = 0.006] higher, respectively). The CD4 Measurements Cohort included 803 CD4 measurements (mean age 49, 76% male, 8% experienced an AIDS-defining event). Costs associated with CD4 measurements <100 cells/µL were 92% higher than those with >350 cells/µL (p<0.001). For higher CD4 cell counts, the majority of expenditures were for antiretrovirals (64% of total for CD4 >350 cells/µL). Conclusions Despite modern advances in antiretroviral therapy and medical care, direct medical costs of HIV-1–infected patients increase after treatment switch and with lower CD4 counts, consistent with previous costing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2030859880,"Plant lectins, especially those purified from species of the Leguminosae family, represent the best-studied group of carbohydrate-binding proteins. Lectins purified from seeds of the Diocleinae subtribe exhibit a high degree of sequence identity notwithstanding that they show very distinct biological activities. Two main factors have been related to this feature: variance in key residues influencing the carbohydrate-binding site geometry and differences in the pH-dependent oligomeric state profile. In this work, we have isolated a lectin from Canavalia boliviana (Cbol) and solved its x-ray crystal structure in the unbound form and in complex with the carbohydrates Man(α1-3)Man(α1-O)Me, Man(α1-4)Man(α1-O)Me and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-mannose. We evaluated its oligomerization profile at different pH values using Small Angle X-ray Scattering and compared it to that of Concanavalin A. Based on predicted pKa-shifts of amino acids in the subunit interfaces we devised a model for the dimer-tetramer equilibrium phenomena of these proteins. Additionally, we demonstrated Cbol anti-inflammatory properties and further characterized them using in vivo and in vitro models."
https://openalex.org/W2035303231,"To investigate the effect of ageing on the recovery of ocular blood flow, intravitreal oxygen tension and retinal function during and after intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation.Long Evans rats (3- and 14-month-old) underwent acute stepwise IOP elevation from 10 to 120 mmHg (5 mmHg steps each 3 minutes). IOP was then returned to baseline and recovery was monitored for 2 hours. Photopic electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded at each IOP step during stress and at each minute during recovery. Ocular blood flow and vitreal oxygen tension (pO2) were assayed continuously and simultaneously using a combined laser Doppler flow meter (LDF) and an oxygen sensitive fibre-optic probe, respectively. The combined sensor was placed in the vitreous chamber, proximal to the retina. Data were binned into 3 minute intervals during stress and 1 min intervals during recovery. Recovery data was described using a bi-logistic function.Rats of both ages showed similar susceptibility to IOP elevation, with pO2 showing a closer relationship to ERG than LDF. During recovery, both ages showed a distinctive two-phased recovery for all three measures with the exception of the LDF in 3-month-old rats, which showed only 1 phase. In all animals, LDF recovered fastest (<1 minute), followed by pO2 (<10 minute) and ERG (>1 hour). 14-month-old rats showed surprisingly faster and greater LDF recovery compared to the younger group, with similar levels of pO2 recovery. However, the ERG in these middle-aged animals did not fully recover after two hours, despite showing no difference in susceptibility to IOP during stress compared to the young group.Young and middle-aged eyes showed similar susceptibility to IOP elevation in terms of pO2, LDF and ERG. Despite this lack of difference during stress, older eyes did not completely recover function, suggesting a more subtle age-related susceptibility to IOP."
https://openalex.org/W2000183664,"The multidrug resistant bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant cause of nosocomial infection. Biofilm formation, that requires both disulfide bond forming and chaperone-usher pathways, is a major virulence trait in this bacterium. Our biochemical characterizations show that the periplasmic A. baumannii DsbA (AbDsbA) enzyme has an oxidizing redox potential and dithiol oxidase activity. We found an unexpected non-covalent interaction between AbDsbA and the highly conserved prokaryotic elongation factor, EF-Tu. EF-Tu is a cytoplasmic protein but has been localized extracellularly in many bacterial pathogens. The crystal structure of this complex revealed that the EF-Tu switch I region binds to the non-catalytic surface of AbDsbA. Although the physiological and pathological significance of a DsbA/EF-Tu association is unknown, peptides derived from the EF-Tu switch I region bound to AbDsbA with submicromolar affinity. We also identified a seven-residue DsbB-derived peptide that bound to AbDsbA with low micromolar affinity. Further characterization confirmed that the EF-Tu- and DsbB-derived peptides bind at two distinct sites. These data point to the possibility that the non-catalytic surface of DsbA is a potential substrate or regulatory protein interaction site. The two peptides identified in this work together with the newly characterized interaction site provide a novel starting point for inhibitor design targeting AbDsbA."
https://openalex.org/W2153273235,"Clusterin is a multifunctional protein that participates in tissue remodeling, apoptosis, lipid transport, complement-mediated cell lysis and serves as an extracellular chaperone. The role of clusterin in cancer and neurodegeneration has been extensively studied, however little is known about its functions in the immune system. Using expression profiling we found that clusterin mRNA is considerably down-regulated in mouse spleen stroma upon knock-out of lymphotoxin β receptor which plays pivotal role in secondary lymphoid organ development, maintenance and function. Using immunohistochemistry and western blot we studied clusterin protein level and distribution in mouse spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes in steady state and upon immunization with sheep red blood cells. We showed that clusterin protein, represented mainly by the secreted heterodimeric form, is present in all stromal compartments of secondary lymphoid organs except for marginal reticular cells. Clusterin protein level rose after immunization and accumulated in light zones of germinal centers in spleen - the effect that was not observed in lymph nodes. Regulation of clusterin expression by the lymphotoxin beta signaling pathway and its protein dynamics during immune response suggest a specific role of this enigmatic protein in the immune system that needs further study."
https://openalex.org/W1969016601,"The genus Rattus is highly speciose, the taxonomy is complex, and individuals are often difficult to identify to the species level. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of phylogenetic approaches to identification in Rattus but some species, especially among the endemics of the New Guinean region, showed poor resolution. Possible reasons for this are simple misidentification, incomplete gene lineage sorting, hybridization, and phylogenetically distinct lineages that are unrecognised taxonomically. To assess these explanations we analysed 217 samples, representing nominally 25 Rattus species, collected in New Guinea, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. To reduce misidentification problems we sequenced museum specimens from earlier morphological studies and recently collected tissues from samples with associated voucher specimens. We also reassessed vouchers from previously sequenced specimens. We inferred combined and separate phylogenies from two mitochondrial DNA regions comprising 550 base pair D-loop sequences and both long (655 base pair) and short (150 base pair) cytochrome oxidase I sequences. Our phylogenetic species identification for 17 species was consistent with morphological designations and current taxonomy thus reinforcing the usefulness of this approach. We reduced misidentifications and consequently the number of polyphyletic species in our phylogenies but the New Guinean Rattus clades still exhibited considerable complexity. Only three of our eight New Guinean species were monophyletic. We found good evidence for either incomplete mitochondrial lineage sorting or hybridization between species within two pairs, R. leucopus/R. cf. verecundus and R. steini/R. praetor. Additionally, our results showed that R. praetor, R. niobe and R. verecundus each likely encompass more than one species. Our study clearly points to the need for a revised taxonomy of the rats of New Guinea, based on broader sampling and informed by both morphology and phylogenetics. The remaining taxonomic complexity highlights the recent and rapid radiation of Rattus in the Australo-Papuan region."
https://openalex.org/W2013585610,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the most important biomarkers for arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that CRP affects cell cycle and inflammatory process in cardiac myocytes. Survivin is also involved in cardiac myocytes replication and apoptosis. Reduction of survivin expression is associated with less favorable cardiac remodeling in animal models. However, the effect of CRP on survivin expression and its cellular mechanism has not yet been studied. We demonstrated that treatment of CRP resulted in a significant decrease of survivin protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner in cardiac myocytes. The upstream signaling proteins of survivin, such as Akt, mTOR and p70S6K, were also downregulated by CRP treatment. In addition, CRP increased the protein and mRNA levels of PTEN. The siRNA transfection or specific inhibitor treatment for PTEN restored the CRP-induced downregulation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and survivin protein expression. Moreover, pretreatment with a specific p53 inhibitor decreased the CRP-induced PTEN expression. ERK-specific inhibitor also blocked the p53 phosphorylation and PTEN expression induced by CRP. Our study provides a novel insight into CRP-induced downregulation of survivin protein expression in cardiac myocytes through mechanisms that involved in downregulation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway by expression of PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2025509587,"Inference of population demographic history has vastly improved in recent years due to a number of technological and theoretical advances including the use of ancient DNA. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) stands among the most promising methods due to its simple theoretical fundament and exceptional flexibility. However, limited availability of user-friendly programs that perform ABC analysis renders it difficult to implement, and hence programming skills are frequently required. In addition, there is limited availability of programs able to deal with heterochronous data. Here we present the software BaySICS: Bayesian Statistical Inference of Coalescent Simulations. BaySICS provides an integrated and user-friendly platform that performs ABC analyses by means of coalescent simulations from DNA sequence data. It estimates historical demographic population parameters and performs hypothesis testing by means of Bayes factors obtained from model comparisons. Although providing specific features that improve inference from datasets with heterochronous data, BaySICS also has several capabilities making it a suitable tool for analysing contemporary genetic datasets. Those capabilities include joint analysis of independent tables, a graphical interface and the implementation of Markov-chain Monte Carlo without likelihoods."
https://openalex.org/W2064739182,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamic aspects of the molecular recognition between a small molecule ligand and a flat, exposed protein surface, representing a typical target in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors. Specifically, we analyze the complex between the protein Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) and a recently discovered small molecule inhibitor, labeled sm27 for which the binding site and the residues mainly involved in small molecule recognition have been previously characterized. We have approached this problem using microsecond MD simulations and NMR-based characterizations of the dynamics of the apo and holo states of the system. Using direct combination and cross-validation of the results of the two techniques, we select the set of conformational states that best recapitulate the principal dynamic and structural properties of the complex. We then use this information to generate a multi-structure representation of the sm27-FGF2 interaction. We propose this kind of representation and approach as a useful tool in particular for the characterization of systems where the mutual dynamic influence between the interacting partners is expected to play an important role. The results presented can also be used to generate new rules for the rational expansion of the chemical diversity space of FGF2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2086335124,"Background It is time-consuming to obtain the square root of airway wall area of the hypothetical airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm (√Aaw at Pi10), a comparable index of airway dimensions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), from all airways of the whole lungs using 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) analysis. We hypothesized that √Aaw at Pi10 differs among the five lung lobes and √Aaw at Pi10 derived from one certain lung lobe has a high level of agreement with that derived from the whole lungs in smokers. Methods Pulmonary function tests and chest volumetric CTs were performed in 157 male smokers (102 COPD, 55 non-COPD). All visible bronchial segments from the 3rd to 5th generations were segmented and measured using commercially available 3-dimensional CT analysis software. √Aaw at Pi10 of each lung lobe was estimated from all measurable bronchial segments of that lobe. Results Using a mixed-effects model, √Aaw at Pi10 differed significantly among the five lung lobes (R2 = 0.78, P<0.0001). The Bland-Altman plots show that √Aaw at Pi10 derived from the right or left upper lobe had a high level of agreement with that derived from the whole lungs, while √Aaw at Pi10 derived from the right or left lower lobe did not. Conclusion In male smokers, CT-derived airway wall area differs among the five lung lobes, and airway wall area derived from the right or left upper lobe is representative of the whole lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2123232727,"Growth rate has long been considered one of the most valuable phenotypes that can be measured in cells. Aside from being highly accessible and informative in laboratory cultures, maximal growth rate is often a prime determinant of cellular fitness, and predicting phenotypes that underlie fitness is key to both understanding and manipulating life. Despite this, current methods for predicting microbial fitness typically focus on yields [e.g., predictions of biomass yield using GEnome-scale metabolic Models (GEMs)] or notably require many empirical kinetic constants or substrate uptake rates, which render these methods ineffective in cases where fitness derives most directly from growth rate. Here we present a new method for predicting cellular growth rate, termed SUMEX, which does not require any empirical variables apart from a metabolic network (i.e., a GEM) and the growth medium. SUMEX is calculated by maximizing the SUM of molar EXchange fluxes (hence SUMEX) in a genome-scale metabolic model. SUMEX successfully predicts relative microbial growth rates across species, environments, and genetic conditions, outperforming traditional cellular objectives (most notably, the convention assuming biomass maximization). The success of SUMEX suggests that the ability of a cell to catabolize substrates and produce a strong proton gradient enables fast cell growth. Easily applicable heuristics for predicting growth rate, such as what we demonstrate with SUMEX, may contribute to numerous medical and biotechnological goals, ranging from the engineering of faster-growing industrial strains, modeling of mixed ecological communities, and the inhibition of cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W2002683820,"Autophagy is an intrinsic host defense system that recognizes and eliminates invading bacterial pathogens. We have identified microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a hallmark of autophagy, as a binding partner of phospholipase C-related catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) that was originally identified as an inositol trisphosphate-binding protein. Here, we investigated the involvement of PRIP in the autophagic elimination of Staphylococcus aureus in infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We observed significantly more LC3-positive autophagosome-like vacuoles enclosing an increased number of S. aureus cells in PRIP-deficient MEFs than control MEFs, 3 h and 4.5 h post infection, suggesting that S. aureus proliferates in LC3-positive autophagosome-like vacuoles in PRIP-deficient MEFs. We performed autophagic flux analysis using an mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid and found that autophagosome maturation is significantly inhibited in PRIP-deficient MEFs. Furthermore, acidification of autophagosomes was significantly inhibited in PRIP-deficient MEFs compared to the wild-type MEFs, as determined by LysoTracker staining and time-lapse image analysis performed using mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3. Taken together, our data show that PRIP is required for the fusion of S. aureus-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles with lysosomes, indicating that PRIP is a novel modulator in the regulation of the innate immune system in non-professional phagocytic host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084885134,"Understanding factors influencing survival of Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) is essential to species conservation, because drivers of mortality can vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although recent studies have evaluated the effects of climate, habitat quality, or resource management (e.g., hatchery operations) on salmonid recruitment and survival, a failure to look at multiple factors simultaneously leaves open questions about the relative importance of different factors. We analyzed the relationship between ten factors and survival (1980-2007) of four populations of salmonids with distinct life histories from two adjacent watersheds (Salmon and Scott rivers) in the Klamath River basin, California. The factors were ocean abundance, ocean harvest, hatchery releases, hatchery returns, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, El Niño Southern Oscillation, snow depth, flow, and watershed disturbance. Permutation tests and linear mixed-effects models tested effects of factors on survival of each taxon. Potential factors affecting survival differed among taxa and between locations. Fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha survival trends appeared to be driven partially or entirely by hatchery practices. Trends in three taxa (Salmon River spring Chinook salmon, Scott River fall Chinook salmon; Salmon River summer steelhead trout O. mykiss) were also likely driven by factors subject to climatic forcing (ocean abundance, summer flow). Our findings underscore the importance of multiple factors in simultaneously driving population trends in widespread species such as anadromous salmonids. They also show that the suite of factors may differ among different taxa in the same location as well as among populations of the same taxa in different watersheds. In the Klamath basin, hatchery practices need to be reevaluated to protect wild salmonids."
https://openalex.org/W2088746043,"Population persistence is a direct measure of the viability of a population. Monitoring the distribution of declining populations or subpopulations over time can yield estimates of persistence, which we show can be modeled as a latent selection difference (LSD) contrasting attributes of sites where populations have persisted versus those that have not. Predicted persistence can be modeled with predictor covariates to identify factors correlated with species persistence. We demonstrate how to model persistence based on changes in occupancy that can include adjustments for detection probability. Using a known historical distribution of the western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), we adapted methods originally developed for occupancy modeling to evaluate how environmental covariates including emergent vegetation and human developments have affected western grebe persistence in Alberta. The relative probability of persistence was correlated with the extent of shoreline bulrush (Scirpus lacustris), which is important vegetation for nesting cover. We also documented that western grebe populations were less likely to persist on lakes in the boreal forest, primarily located on the northern boundary of the species' range. Factors influencing occupancy were different than those determining persistence by western grebes; persistence and occupancy were not correlated. Persistence was more likely on lakes with recreational development, reflecting reliance by grebes on the larger, fish-bearing waterbodies that also are attractive for lakeshore development. Unfortunately, the correlation with recreational development on Alberta's lakes puts grebes at risk for loss of brood-rearing habitats—primary threats to altricial birds—if steps are not taken to prevent disturbance to bulrush stands. Identifying factors related to the persistence of a species—especially one in decline—is a fundamental step in conservation management."
