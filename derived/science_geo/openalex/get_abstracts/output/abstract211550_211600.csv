https://openalex.org/W2041128161,"After adaptation of the human tongue to sodium chloride solutions, subjects reported the taste quality of sodium chloride solutions both above and below the adapting concentration. The adapting solutions became tasteless; solutions weaker than the adapting concentration tasted sour or bitter, and stronger solutions were reported as sweet or salty. The taste of both water and sodium chloride solutions is specific depending on prior adaptation."

Such events were presented at rates of either 5 per minute or 30 per minute, and signals averaged 15 per hour during an 80-minute vigil. Observers missed about 10 percent of the signals with the low event rate and about 70 percent of the signals with the high event rate. The experiment supports a decisiontheory approach to observing behavior."

https://openalex.org/W4253856671,"Fluorescein-sodium, a fluorescent tracer whose molecular weight is 376, diffuses rather freely from the interior of one cell to another in a gland epithelium (Drosophila) but does not diffuse along the intercellular space to the exterior. The permeability of the junctional surfaces of the cell membranes appears to be high, in contrast to the nonjunctional surfaces and intercellular spaces which represent strong diffusion barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2012239578,A single injection of cortisol acetate into young mice induced a wasting syndrome similar to that observed in runt disease and in the post-thymectomy syndrome. The course of the disease was less severe if the dose of the drug was decreased or if the animals were older at the time of injection.
https://openalex.org/W1975702123,"Thermal denaturation temperature of newly reconstituted collagen fibrils from rat tail tendons is 52 degrees C compared with 42 degrees C for neutral solutions. This suggests that the increase in concentration of collagen within the fibril increases the stability of the individual molecules. The absence of firm intermolecular bonds in these fibrils rules out crosslinking as an explanation for increased stability. ""Aging"" at 37 degrees C up to 1 year raises the shrinkage temperature of reconstituted fibrous gels by 4 degrees to 6 degrees C and greatly increases resistance to dissolution at high temperature. The newly formed fibrils dissolve without shrinking, whereas older gels exhibit shrinkage before dissolution. Since nearly all extractable collagen is in the form of fibrillar aggregates in tissue, it is unlikely that thermal denaturation occurs at body temperature; therefore it could not be involved as a necessary stage in collagen resorption."

https://openalex.org/W1990517705,"Phospholipids extracted from ""ghosts"" of human erythrocytes or from other sources carry substantial quantities of glucose or other monosaccharides from the dry state into highly nonpolar solvents. Various characteristics of this weak association phenomenon show suggestive parallels with known properties of the mediated sugar-transfer system in the membrane of the intact red cell."
https://openalex.org/W1977447347,"INJECTION of homogenates of active prothoracic glands into fourth instar locust larvæ, a day after moulting, causes them to moult again prematurely. The instar is shortened by about 12–18 h (Fig. 1). The active agent appears to be an ecdysone (which we have named ecdysone-λ). Injection of those fractions of extracts of whole locusts that contain ecdysone-λ have a similar effect. The plant growth hormone gibberellic acid likewise shortens the instar when injected at the appropriate time into larvse of both Locusta migratoria migratorioides (R. and F.) and Schistocerca gregaria (Forskäl) (Fig. 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2042195765,Previous research has shown that aversive stimulation causes aggression in several lower species of mammals prior to any specific conditioning. Our results show that fighting in response to shock tends to persist in spite of negative reinforcement for other behavior. The frequency of shock-induced fights decreased significantly only when the reinforcement of shock termination was made contingent upon a specific nonaggressive response.
https://openalex.org/W1977057752,"A SURVEY of the volatiles produced from a range of cooked vegetables showed that both methanol and dimethyl sulphide were usually present as major components1. When a commercial sample of instant coffee powder was examined, however, no methanol and only small amounts of dimethyl sulphide were detected, although other common volatiles of low boiling point which are engendered from amino-acids2 were conspicuously present. It appeared likely, therefore, that both methanol and dimethyl sulphide were produced from vegetables on cooking by some system which was not present in the coffee powder."

https://openalex.org/W1989060073,"A comparison of behavior of infant monkeys shortly after birth reveals differences in reactivity which can be related to the route of delivery, whether vaginal or cesarean section. The depression of behavior in the surgically delivered infants persists through day 5 postpartum and ultimately appears as lowered conditionability. Anesthetics or other drugs are not causal factors."

https://openalex.org/W2156145712,"SEVERAL investigations1–3 of chromosomal RNA synthesis during mitosis have established that such synthesis, maximal in interphase, continues during mitotic prophase. It decreases progressively as chromosome contraction advances, none occurring during the fully contracted stages of metaphase and anaphase. RNA synthesis recommences with chromosome despiralization at late telophase."

https://openalex.org/W1994346827,"IN preparing the combined technique of pyrolysis and gas chromatography for the general purpose of identification of compounds in food odours we now have carried out pyrolysis experiments using some aliphatic compounds as test substances. In a previous note I reported the detection of the benzene ring in organic compounds by pyrolysis and gas chromatography1, using a Pye apparatus from which the argon detector was removed and replaced by a flame ionization detector following the method of Murray and Williams2. A column carrying 30 per cent ‘Apiezon L’ on ‘Chromosorb W’ was used. The quartz pyrolysis tube (length, 20 cm ; inner diam., 2 mm) was filled with ‘Chromosorb P’ over a length of 10 cm and was connected to the top of the column. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow of 32 ml./min."

https://openalex.org/W2013347101,"ALTHOUGH bisexual reproduction is usual among ticks, there have been reports of parthenogenesis in various species including Amblyomma agamum1, Rhipicephalus bursa2, A. dissimile3, Hyalomma anatolicum4, Ornithodorus moubata5, and Haemaphysalis bispinosa6; but there appears to be no previous record of parthenogenesis in Boophilus microplus. In fact, it was considered by many workers on the cattle tick in Australia that B. microplus females were unable to complete engorgement in the absence of males, and it was reported7 that female cattle ticks isolated from males in small areas on a sheep by means of repellent barriers did not engorge completely. Furthermore, Riek8 observed that unfertilized female cattle ticks remained attached to mice for considerable periods without engorging. In both instances the subsequent introduction of males led to rapid engorgement of the females."

https://openalex.org/W1967189401,"Purified preparations of leucoanthocyanins from several sources were heated in butanol-hydrochloric acid solutions from 50 degrees to 90 degrees C and the rate of production of cyanidin was measured. From the temperature dependence of this rate, the calculated energy of activation was of the order of magnitude of 20,000 calories. The rate-limiting step in this reaction was similar for two preparations tested, and of lower energy for a third, presumably of lower degree of polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W1980494169,RELIABLE investigations of intelligence suggest that at least 75 per cent of individual variations in ability are determined by inheritance1. The distribution of intelligence appears to be best described by a Pearson type IV curve2 determined mainly by polygenic factors.

https://openalex.org/W2008032621,Portions of an adult human lung were studied by autoradiography in order to detect the presence of fallout particles. The radioactivity in the remainder of the tissue was determined with a gamma-ray spectrometer. Four particles were found and their activities were determined. From the measurement for total-fission-product activity in the lung tissue it was calculated that there were approximately 264 particles in the right lung at the time of death.
