https://openalex.org/W4294012180,"The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) is the largest fully open resource of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data consented for public distribution without access or use restrictions. The final, phase 3 release of the 1kGP included 2,504 unrelated samples from 26 populations and was based primarily on low-coverage WGS. Here, we present a high-coverage 3,202-sample WGS 1kGP resource, which now includes 602 complete trios, sequenced to a depth of 30X using Illumina. We performed single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertion and deletion (INDEL) discovery and generated a comprehensive set of structural variants (SVs) by integrating multiple analytic methods through a machine learning model. We show gains in sensitivity and precision of variant calls compared to phase 3, especially among rare SNVs as well as INDELs and SVs spanning frequency spectrum. We also generated an improved reference imputation panel, making variants discovered here accessible for association studies."
https://openalex.org/W4294243316,"Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO 2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (that is, elements heavier than helium, also called ‘metallicity’) 1–3 , and thus the formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants 4–6 . It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets 7–9 . Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO 2 , but have not yielded definitive detections owing to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification 10–12 . Here we present the detection of CO 2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science programme 13,14 . The data used in this study span 3.0–5.5 micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO 2 absorption feature at 4.3 micrometres (26-sigma significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, ten-times solar metallicity models that assume radiative–convective–thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO 2 , but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 micrometres that is not reproduced by these models."
https://openalex.org/W4294012161,"Chemical synapses between axons and dendrites mediate neuronal intercellular communication. Here, we describe a synapse between axons and primary cilia: the axo-ciliary synapse. Using enhanced focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy on samples with optimally preserved ultrastructure, we discovered synapses between brainstem serotonergic axons and the primary cilia of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Functionally, these cilia are enriched in a ciliary-restricted serotonin receptor, the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 (5-HTR6). Using a cilia-targeted serotonin sensor, we show that opto- and chemogenetic stimulation of serotonergic axons releases serotonin onto cilia. Ciliary 5-HTR6 stimulation activates a non-canonical Gαq/11-RhoA pathway, which modulates nuclear actin and increases histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. Ablation of this pathway reduces chromatin accessibility in CA1 pyramidal neurons. As a signaling apparatus with proximity to the nucleus, axo-ciliary synapses short circuit neurotransmission to alter the postsynaptic neuron's epigenetic state."
https://openalex.org/W4294011199,"Drug-tolerant persister cells (persisters) evade apoptosis upon targeted and conventional cancer therapies and represent a major non-genetic barrier to effective cancer treatment. Here, we show that cells that survive treatment with pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetics display a persister phenotype that includes colonization and metastasis in vivo and increased sensitivity toward ferroptosis by GPX4 inhibition. We found that sublethal mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and holocytochrome c release are key requirements for the generation of the persister phenotype. The generation of persisters is independent of apoptosome formation and caspase activation, but instead, cytosolic cytochrome c induces the activation of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase and engagement of the integrated stress response (ISR) with the consequent synthesis of ATF4, all of which are required for the persister phenotype. Our results reveal that sublethal cytochrome c release couples sublethal MOMP to caspase-independent initiation of an ATF4-dependent, drug-tolerant persister phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4294012083,"Great progress has been made in understanding gut microbiomes' products and their effects on health and disease. Less attention, however, has been given to the inputs that gut bacteria consume. Here, we quantitatively examine inputs and outputs of the mouse gut microbiome, using isotope tracing. The main input to microbial carbohydrate fermentation is dietary fiber and to branched-chain fatty acids and aromatic metabolites is dietary protein. In addition, circulating host lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and urea (but not glucose or amino acids) feed the gut microbiome. To determine the nutrient preferences across bacteria, we traced into genus-specific bacterial protein sequences. We found systematic differences in nutrient use: most genera in the phylum Firmicutes prefer dietary protein, Bacteroides dietary fiber, and Akkermansia circulating host lactate. Such preferences correlate with microbiome composition changes in response to dietary modifications. Thus, diet shapes the microbiome by promoting the growth of bacteria that preferentially use the ingested nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W4294119740,"A hallmark of primate postimplantation embryogenesis is the specification of extraembryonic mesoderm (EXM) before gastrulation, in contrast to rodents where this tissue is formed only after gastrulation. Here, we discover that naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are competent to differentiate into EXM cells (EXMCs). EXMCs are specified by inhibition of Nodal signaling and GSK3B, are maintained by mTOR and BMP4 signaling activity, and their transcriptome and epigenome closely resemble that of human and monkey embryo EXM. EXMCs are mesenchymal, can arise from an epiblast intermediate, and are capable of self-renewal. Thus, EXMCs arising via primate-specific specification between implantation and gastrulation can be modeled in vitro. We also find that most of the rare off-target cells within human blastoids formed by triple inhibition (Kagawa et al., 2021) correspond to EXMCs. Our study impacts our ability to model and study the molecular mechanisms of early human embryogenesis and related defects."
https://openalex.org/W4294012183,"The cardiomyocyte (CM) subtypes in the mammalian heart derive from distinct lineages known as the first heart field (FHF), the anterior second heart field (aSHF), and the posterior second heart field (pSHF) lineages that are specified during gastrulation. We modeled human heart field development from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by using single-cell RNA-sequencing to delineate lineage specification and progression. Analyses of hPSC-derived and mouse mesoderm transcriptomes enabled the identification of distinct human FHF, aSHF, and pSHF mesoderm subpopulations. Through staged manipulation of signaling pathways identified from transcriptomics, we generated myocyte populations that display molecular characteristics of key CM subtypes. The developmental trajectory of the human cardiac lineages recapitulated that of the mouse, demonstrating conserved cardiovascular programs. These findings establish a comprehensive landscape of human embryonic cardiogenesis that provides access to a broad spectrum of cardiomyocytes for modeling congenital heart diseases and chamber-specific cardiomyopathies as well as for developing new therapies to treat them."
https://openalex.org/W4294118660,"Despite its clinical and fundamental importance, our understanding of early human development remains limited. Stem cell-derived, embryo-like structures (or embryoids) allowing studies of early development without using natural embryos can potentially help fill the knowledge gap of human development. Herein, transcriptome at the single-cell level of a human embryoid model was profiled at different time points. Molecular maps of lineage diversifications from the pluripotent human epiblast toward the amniotic ectoderm, primitive streak/mesoderm, and primordial germ cells were constructed and compared with in vivo primate data. The comparative transcriptome analyses reveal a critical role of NODAL signaling in human mesoderm and primordial germ cell specification, which is further functionally validated. Through comparative transcriptome analyses and validations with human blastocysts and in vitro cultured cynomolgus embryos, we further proposed stringent criteria for distinguishing between human blastocyst trophectoderm and early amniotic ectoderm cells."
https://openalex.org/W4294012267,"Although disrupted bile acid (BA) homeostasis is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the role of hepatic BA metabolism in the pathogenesis of colitis is poorly understood. Here, we found that cholic acid (CA) levels were increased in patients and mice. Cytochrome P450 8B1 (CYP8B1), which synthesizes CA, was induced in livers of colitic mice. CA-treated or liver Cyp8b1-overexpressing mice developed more severe colitis with compromised repair of the mucosal barrier, whereas Cyp8b1-knockout mice were resistant to colitis. Mechanistically, CA inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), resulting in impeded fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and impaired Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell (ISC) renewal. A PPARα agonist restored FAO and improved Lgr5+ ISC function. Activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) suppressed liver CYP8B1 expression and ameliorated colitis in mice. This study reveals a connection between the hepatic CYP8B1-CA axis and colitis via regulating intestinal epithelial regeneration, suggesting that BA-based strategies might be beneficial in IBD treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4294011132,"Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are widespread in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, extruding protein substrates following synthesis of the entire polypeptide. The Escherichia coli hemolysin A secretion system has long been considered a prototype in structural and mechanistic studies of T1SSs. Three membrane proteins-an inner membrane ABC transporter HlyB, an adaptor protein HlyD, and an outer membrane porin TolC-are required for secretion. However, the stoichiometry and structure of the complex are unknown. Here, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures determined in two conformations reveal that the inner membrane complex is a hetero-dodecameric assembly comprising three HlyB homodimers and six HlyD subunits. Functional studies indicate that oligomerization of HlyB and HlyD is essential for protein secretion and that polypeptides translocate through a canonical ABC transporter pathway in HlyB. Our data suggest that T1SSs entail three ABC transporters, one that functions as a protein channel and two that allosterically power the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W4294295583,"Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that present attractive characteristics such as nano size and unique structure for their use as drug delivery systems for drug therapy, biomarkers for prognostic, diagnostic and personalized treatments. So far, one of the major challenges for therapeutic applications of exosomes is the development of optimized isolation methods. In this context, aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have been used as an alternative method to isolate biological molecules and particles with promising expectations for exosomes. In this work, fractionation of exosomes obtained from CaCo2 cell line and culture media contaminants were individually performed in 20 polymer-polymer ATPS. The effect of design parameters such as polymer composition, molecular weight, and tie-line length (TLL) on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-Dextran, Dextran-Ficoll and PEG-Ficoll systems was studied. After partition analysis, 4 of the 20 systems presented the best exosome fractionation from contaminants under initial conditions, which were optimized via salt addition (NaCl) to a final concentration of 25 mM, to improve collection efficiency. The PEG 10,000 gmol- 1 –Dextran 10,000 gmol- 1 system at TLL 25% w/w with NaCl, showed the best potential isolation efficiency. Following this proposed strategy, an exosome purification factor of 2 in the top PEG-rich phase can be expected furtherly demonstrating that ATPS have the potential for the selective recovery of these promising nanovesicles."
https://openalex.org/W4294295906,"Background Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) patients have elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, rendering them at high risk of premature coronary artery disease (PCAD). However, the FH prevalence among angiogram-proven PCAD (AP-PCAD) patients and their status of coronary risk factors (CRFs) have not been reported in the Asian population. Objectives This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence of clinically diagnosed FH among AP-PCAD patients, (2) compare CRFs between AP-PCAD patients with control groups, and (3) identify the independent predictors of PCAD. Methods AP-PCAD patients and FH patients without PCAD were recruited from Cardiology and Specialist Lipid Clinics. Subjects were divided into AP-PCAD with FH (G1), AP-PCAD without FH (G2), FH without PCAD (G3) and normal controls (G4). Medical records were collected from the clinic database and standardised questionnaires. FH was clinically diagnosed using Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria. Results A total of 572 subjects were recruited (males:86.4%; mean ± SD age: 55.6±8.5years). The prevalence of Definite, Potential and All FH among AP-PCAD patients were 6%(19/319), 16% (51/319) and 45.5% (145/319) respectively. G1 had higher central obesity, family history of PCAD and family history of hypercholesterolaemia compared to other groups. Among all subjects, diabetes [OR(95% CI): 4.7(2.9,7.7)], hypertension [OR(95% CI): 14.1(7.8,25.6)], FH [OR(95% CI): 2.9(1.5,5.5)] and Potential (Definite and Probable) FH [OR(95% CI): 4.5(2.1,9.6)] were independent predictors for PCAD. Among FH patients, family history of PCAD [OR(95% CI): 3.0(1.4,6.3)] and Definite FH [OR(95% CI): 7.1(1.9,27.4)] were independent predictors for PCAD. Conclusion Potential FH is common among AP-PCAD patients and contributes greatly to the AP-PCAD. FH-PCAD subjects have greater proportions of various risk factors compared to other groups. Presence of FH, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and family history of PCAD are independent predictors of PCAD. FH with PCAD is in very-high-risk category, hence, early management of modifiable CRFs in these patients are warranted."

We determined the various mental health disorders and other predictors that were associated with different levels of homelessness risk, including identifying the impact of dual diagnosis of mental health and substance use disorder on homelessness.Using retrospective de-identified linked administrative data from various government departments we identified various dimensions of homelessness which were mapped from the European Topology of Homelessness (ETHOS) framework and associated mental health variables which were determined from the WHO ICD-10 codes. We used ordered logistic regression and Poisson regression analysis to estimate the impact of homelessness and housing instability respectively.A total homelessness prevalence of 60% was determined in the care-leaving population. After adjustment, high risk of homelessness was associated with dual diagnosis of mental health and substance use disorder, intentional self-harm, anxiety, psychotic disorders, assault and maltreatment, history of involvement with the justice system, substance use prior to leaving care, residential and home-based OHC placement and a history of staying in public housing.There is clearly a need for policy makers and service providers to work together to find effective housing pathways and integrated health services for this heterogeneous group of vulnerable young people with complex health and social needs. Future research should determine longitudinally the bidirectional relationship between mental health disorders and homelessness."
https://openalex.org/W4294354014,"Continuous turnover of taste bud cells in the oral cavity underlies the homeostasis of taste tissues. Previous studies have demonstrated that Sox2 + stem cells give rise to all types of epithelial cells including taste bud cells and non-gustatory epithelial cells in the oral epithelium, and Sox2 is required for generating taste bud cells. Here, we show the dynamism of single stem cells through multicolor lineage tracing analyses in Sox2-CreERT2 ; Rosa26-Confetti mice. In the non-gustatory epithelium, unicolored areas populated by a cluster of cells expressing the same fluorescent protein grew over time, while epithelial cells were randomly labeled with multiple fluorescent proteins by short-term tracing. Similar phenomena were observed in gustatory epithelia. These results suggest that the Sox2 + stem cell population is maintained by balancing the increase of certain stem cells with the reduction of the others. In the gustatory epithelia, many single taste buds contained cells labeled with different fluorescent proteins, indicating that a single taste bud is composed of cells derived from multiple Sox2 + stem cells. Our results reveal the characteristics of Sox2 + stem cells underlying the turnover of taste bud cells and the homeostasis of taste tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4294354937,"Religious institutions have been responsive to the needs of Black men and other marginalized populations. Religious service attendance is a common practice that has been associated with stress management and extended longevity. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between religious service attendance and all-cause mortality among Black men 50 years of age and older. Data for this study were from NHANES III (1988–1994). The analytic sample (n = 839) was restricted to participants at least 50 years of age at the time of interview who self-identified as Black and male. Mortality was the primary outcome for this study and the NHANES III Linked Mortality File was used to estimate race-specific, non-injury-related death rates using a probabilistic matching algorithm, linked to the National Death Index through December 31, 2015, providing up to 27 years follow-up. The primary independent variable was religious service attendance, a categorical variable indicating that participants attended religious services at least weekly, three or fewer times per month, or not at all. The mean age of participants was 63.6±0.3 years and 36.4% of sample members reported that they attended religious services one or more times per week, exceeding those attending three or fewer times per month (31.7%), or not at all (31.9%). Cox proportional hazard logistic regression models were estimated to determine the association between religious service attendance and mortality. Participants with the most frequent religious service attendance had a 47% reduction of all-cause mortality risk compared their peer who did not attend religious services at all (HR 0.53, CI 0.35–0.79) in the fully adjusted model including socioeconomic status, non-cardiovascular medical conditions, health behaviors, social support and allostatic load. Our findings underscore the potential salience of religiosity and spirituality for health in Black men, an understudied group where elevated risk factors are often present."
https://openalex.org/W4294433428,"Our daily 24-h rhythm is synchronized to the external light-dark cycle resulting from the Earth's daily rotation. In the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master clock and receives light-mediated input via the retinohypothalamic tract. Abrupt changes in the timing of the light-dark cycle (e.g., due to jet lag) cause a phase shift in the circadian rhythms in the SCN. Here, we investigated the effects of a 6-h delay in the light-dark cycle on PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE expression at the single-cell level in mouse SCN organotypic explants. The ensemble pattern in phase shift response obtained from individual neurons in the anterior and central SCN revealed a bimodal distribution; specifically, neurons in the ventrolateral SCN responded with a rapid phase shift, while neurons in the dorsal SCN generally did not respond to the shift in the light-dark cycle. We also stimulated the hypothalamic tract in acute SCN slices to simulate light-mediated input to the SCN; interestingly, we found similarities between the distribution and fraction of rapid shifting neurons (in response to the delay) and neurons that were excited in response to electrical stimulation. These results suggest that a subpopulation of neurons in the ventral SCN that have an excitatory response to light input, shift their clock more readily than dorsal located neurons, and initiate the SCN's entrainment to the new light-dark cycle. Thus, we propose that light-excited neurons in the anterior and central SCN play an important role in the organism's ability to adjust to changes in the external light-dark cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4293722843,"Newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), need to be correctly targeted and imported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. GPI-APs are synthesized in the cytosol as preproproteins, which contain an N-terminal signal sequence (SS), mature protein part, and C-terminal GPI-attachment sequence (GPI-AS), and translocated into the ER lumen where SS and GPI-AS are removed, generating mature GPI-APs. However, how various GPI-APs are translocated into the ER lumen in mammalian cells is unclear. Here, we investigated the ER entry pathways of GPI-APs using a panel of KO cells defective in each signal recognition particle-independent ER entry pathway-namely, Sec62, GET, or SND pathway. We found GPI-AP CD59 largely depends on the SND pathway for ER entry, whereas prion protein (Prion) and LY6K depend on both Sec62 and GET pathways. Using chimeric Prion and LY6K constructs in which the N-terminal SS or C-terminal GPI-AS was replaced with that of CD59, we revealed that the hydrophobicity of the SSs and GPI-ASs contributes to the dependence on Sec62 and GET pathways, respectively. Moreover, the ER entry route of chimeric Prion constructs with the C-terminal GPI-ASs replaced with that of CD59 was changed to the SND pathway. Simultaneously, their GPI structures and which oligosaccharyltransferase isoforms modify the constructs were altered without any amino acid change in the mature protein part. Taking these findings together, this study revealed N- and C-terminal sequences of GPI-APs determine the selective ER entry route, which in turn regulates subsequent maturation processes of GPI-APs."

Bacterial sortases are cysteine transpeptidase enzymes that play important roles at the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Despite over 20 years since the discovery of the first sortase enzyme in Staphylococcus aureus, a complete picture of how these critical enzymes recognize their ligands has remained elusive because of limited structural information involving sortases in complex with their substrates (1Ton-That H.

A thorough understanding of this process is also relevant to human health and disease in two significant ways; sortases are used in protein engineering, for example, sortase-mediated ligation (SML), sortagging, or sortylation applications, and sortases are also therapeutic targets for the development of antibiotics (5Antos J.M.

These structures have revealed that sortases share a conserved core antiparallel eight-stranded β-barrel structure, termed the sortase fold (8Jacobitz A.W. Kattke M.D. Wereszczynski J. Clubb R.T.

As of early 2022, there were over 65 structures of sortases in the PDB, including from all six classes and SrtA structures from 10 different organisms. Despite this, there is a notable lack of structural information about ligand recognition in sortases. Of the three SrtA structures that contain ligands, two approximate the acyl–enzyme intermediates of saSrtA and Bacillus anthracis SrtA (baSrtA) using cleverly designed peptidomimetic ligands (PDB IDs: 2KID and 2RUI). However, because it is not present, these structures do not provide information about recognition of the P1′ residue, a position for which SrtA enzymes have shown variable selectivity in vitro (9Piper I.M.

The third structure contains a complex between saSrtA and a noncovalently bound LPETG peptide that is shifted by several Angstroms in the peptide-binding pocket (PDB ID: 1T2W), revealing a geometry that is not consistent with known biochemical data (16Zong Y.

In this work, we have sought to fill remaining gaps in the understanding of SrtA target recognition through the structural characterization of multiple states in the catalytic mechanism of Streptococcus pyogenes class A sortase (spySrtA) (Fig. 1). The apo structure of spySrtA was solved using X-ray crystallography in 2009, and its catalytic triad consists of His142, Cys208, and Arg216 (17Race P.R. Bentley M.L. Melvin J.A. Crow A. Hughes R.K.

Using similar crystallization conditions, we were able to crystallize and solve the structures of a catalytically inactive C208A spySrtA mutant bound to the peptides LPATA and LPATS, which are sequences that are known to serve as spySrtA substrates in vitro (17Race P.R.

In addition, we synthesized a model peptide (LPAT-LII) of the ligation product between the LPAT fragment and the in vivo nucleophile LII and solved the structures of two complexes between C208A spySrtA and LPAT-LII where the peptide is in the “Thr-in” and “Thr-out” conformations, terminology previously used to describe the side chain of the P1 Thr as protein interacting (“Thr-in”) or solvent interacting (“Thr-out”) (8Jacobitz A.W.

Biol. 2017; 109: 223-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because these are the first solved peptide-bound sortase structures that include the P1′ residue and initial cleavage site, we wanted to investigate the relative dynamics of ligand binding. We ran 900 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using four structures (apo spySrtA [PDB ID: 3FN5]), spySrtA–LPATA, spySrtA–LPATS, and spySrtA–LPAT-LII) to assess positional flexibility and the overall dynamics of the sortase–peptide complex. Finally, we used our peptide-bound structures to model the acyl–enzyme intermediate of spySrtA–LPAT. Taken together, this work provides new structural insights for important states in the SrtA catalytic mechanism (Fig. 1), significantly increasing our understanding of target recognition in this important protein family. Like other class A sortases, the majority of predicted and verified in vivo targets of spySrtA possess LPXTG substrate sequences (24Raz A. Tanasescu A.M. Zhao A.M. Serrano A. Alston T.

In addition, prior work from ourselves and others has demonstrated that spySrtA readily accepts LPXTA and LPXTS substrates in vitro, despite the fact that these particular sequence variants do not appear to be present in naturally occurring spySrtA substrates in vivo (20Guimaraes C.P.

The spySrtA enzyme also accepts alanine- or serine-based nucleophiles, which is a characteristic that has been exploited for dual-labeling SML strategies and is consistent with the presence of N-terminal alanines in the interpeptide bridge of LII in S. pyogenes (17Race P.R.

Notably, the ability of spySrtA to recognize nonglycine nucleophiles and to accept substrates that vary at the P1′ position is in stark contrast to saSrtA, which is narrowly selective for glycine at these sites (15Nikghalb K.D.

In order to gain a stereochemical understanding of target recognition by spySrtA and other class A sortases, we sought to cocrystallize a catalytically inactive mutant (C208A) of spySrtA with a range of model peptides containing known substrate sequences (LPATG/S/A). Briefly, spySrtA protein containing the inactivating C208A mutation was expressed and purified as previously described for the wildtype protein and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and LC–electrospray ionization (ESI)–mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S1) (23Gao M. Johnson D.A. Piper I.M. Kodama H.M. Svendsen J.E.

Purified protein (at ∼1.1 mM) was incubated in a 1:1 ratio with 1 mM peptide for 1 h prior to crystallization by hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystallization conditions were optimized from those used for apo spySrtA (PDB ID: 3FN5) and are described in the Experimental procedures section (17Race P.R. Bentley M.L. Melvin J.A. Crow A.

From this, we succeeded in crystallizing and solving two structures of C208A spySrtA bound to the model peptides (P1′ position in bold) Abz-LPATAGK(Dnp)-NH2 and Ac-LPATSG-NH2 (Abz, 2-aminobenzoyl; Fig. 2A).

For both substrates, LC–ESI–MS was used to confirm that they were cleaved by wildtype spySrtA in a model transacylation reaction (Fig. S2). Notably, we also crystallized C208A spySrtA with peptides containing the canonical LPXTG sequence (Abz-LPATGGK(Dnp)-NH2 and fluorescently labeled 5-FAM-Ahx-LPATGG-NH2); however, the crystals obtained were not of suitable diffraction quality. For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to the solved enzyme–substrate complexes as spySrtA–LPATA and spySrtA–LPATS (Fig. 2B). All diffraction and refinement statistics for these complexes are provided in Table 1. In general, crystals grew stacked and were relatively unstable in traditional cryosolutions (e.g., with 10–20% [w/v] glycerol added). As a likely result of these challenges, the crystal ultimately used for spySrtA–LPATA structure determination contained pseudosymmetry. We predict that this may be due to lattice disruption during crystal harvesting. The space group of this crystal was P 21 21 21 and contained two protomers in the asymmetric unit. We refined it to a Rwork/Rfree = 0.21/0.24 at 1.4 Å resolution (Table 1). Relatively high R-factors are a consequence of pseudosymmetry in crystal packing (32Zwart P.H. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Optimization of cryo conditions, namely using PEG 400 as a cryoprotectant, resulted in better quality diffraction data for the crystal used to solve the spySrtA–LPATS structure, as described in the Experimental procedures section. This crystal diffracted to 1.4 Å resolution, and the resulting structure was solved in space group P 21 to a Rwork/Rfree = 0.17/0.19, with two spySrtA molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab Alignment of chain (or protomer) A of spySrtA–LPATS with the two molecules of spySrtA–LPATA revealed very similar structures, with pairwise RMSD values for main-chain atoms of all protomers of both structures <0.13 Å (Fig. S3A). We were able to model all residues of the enzyme in protomer B of spySrtA–LPATA and protomer A of spySrtA–LPATS revealing an additional N-terminal helix not previously seen in the apo structure (Fig. S3B). Because of the large degree of similarity between these structures, unless otherwise noted, our analyses will focus on spySrtA–LPATS protomer A. We next used our peptide-bound crystal structures to analyze the stereochemistry of target recognition by class A sortases. In both structures, we see clear peptide density and modeled the entire pentapeptide motif for all spySrtA protomers (Fig. 2, B and C). Unbiased electron density maps, created by omitting the peptide atoms and running a round of refinement, confirm strong electron density for peptide residues (Fig. S3C). Alignment of spySrtA–LPATS with the two (A and B) protomers of apo spySrtA revealed RMSD values for main-chain atoms of 0.158 Å (508 atoms) and 0.189 Å (541 atoms), respectively. The largest difference between these structures is an approximately 1 Å displacement in the backbone of the β7–β8+3, β7–β8+4, and β7–β8+5 loop residues (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W4293722880,"Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the antineoplastic mechanism of LECT2, especially its influence on hepatic cancer stem cells (CSCs), remains largely unknown. In The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort, LECT2 mRNA expression was shown to be associated with stage, grade, recurrence, and overall survival in human HCC patients, and LECT2 expression was downregulated in hepatoma tissues compared with the adjacent nontumoral liver. Here, we show by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses that LECT2 was expressed at lower levels in tumors and in poorly differentiated HCC cell lines. Using functional assays, we also found LECT2 was capable of suppressing oncogenic behaviors such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasiveness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatoma cells. Moreover, we show exogenous LECT2 treatment inhibited CSC functions such as tumor sphere formation and drug efflux. Simultaneously, hepatic CSC marker expression was also downregulated, including expression of CD133 and CD44. This was supported by infection with adenovirus encoding LECT2 (Ad-LECT2) in HCC cells. Furthermore, in animal experiments, Ad-LECT2 gene therapy showed potent efficacy in treating HCC. We demonstrate LECT2 overexpression significantly promoted cell apoptosis and reduced neovascularization/CSC expansion in rat hepatoma tissues. Mechanistically, we showed using immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses that LECT2 inhibited β-catenin signaling via the suppression of the hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET axis to diminish CSC properties in HCC cells. In summary, we reveal novel functions of LECT2 in the suppression of hepatic CSCs, suggesting a potential alternative strategy for HCC therapy."

https://openalex.org/W4294295650,"The present study proposes to measure and quantify the heart rate variability (HRV) changes during effort as a function of the heart rate and to test the capacity of the produced indices to predict cardiorespiratory fitness measures. Therefore, the beat-to-beat cardiac time interval series of 18 adolescent athletes (15.2 ± 2.0 years) measured during maximal graded effort test were detrended using a dynamical first-order differential equation model. HRV was then calculated as the standard deviation of the detrended RR intervals (SDRR) within successive windows of one minute. The variation of this measure of HRV during exercise is properly fitted by an exponential decrease of the heart rate: the SDRR is divided by 2 every increase of heart rate of 20 beats/min. The HR increase necessary to divide by 2 the HRV is linearly inversely correlated with the maximum oxygen consumption (r = -0.60, p = 0.006), the maximal aerobic power (r = -0.62, p = 0.006), and, to a lesser extent, to the power at the ventilatory thresholds (r = -0.53, p = 0.02 and r = -0.47, p = 0.05 for the first and second threshold). It indicates that the decrease of the HRV when the heart rate increases is faster among athletes with better fitness. This analysis, based only on cardiac measurements, provides a promising tool for the study of cardiac measurements generated by portable devices."
https://openalex.org/W4294295878,"Using respiratory virus rapid diagnostic tests in the emergency department could allow better and faster clinical management. Point-of-care PCR instruments now provide results in less than 30 minutes. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the use of a rapid molecular diagnostic test, the cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV Assay, during the clinical management of emergency department patients.Patients (adults and children) requiring admission or suffering from an underlying condition at risk of respiratory complications were prospectively recruited in the emergency department of four hospitals in the Brussels region. Physicians' intentions regarding admission, isolation, antibiotic, and antiviral use were collected before and after performing the rapid molecular test. Additionally, a comparison of the analytical performance of this test against antigen rapid tests and viral culture was performed as well as a time-to-result evaluation.Among the 293 patients recruited, 90 had a positive PCR, whereas 44 had a positive antigen test. PCR yielded a sensitivity of 100% for all targets. Antigen tests yielded sensitivities ranging from 66.7% for influenza B to 83.3% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The use of PCR allowed a decrease in the overall need for isolation and treatment by limiting the isolation of negative patients and antibiotic use for positive patients. Meanwhile, antiviral treatments better targeted patients with a positive influenza PCR.The use of a rapid influenza and RSV molecular test improves the clinical management of patients admitted to the emergency department by providing a fast and reliable result. Their additional cost compared to antigen tests should be balanced with the benefit of their analytical performance, leading to efficient reductions in the need for isolation and antibiotic use."

Contrary to the so-far-studied topics related to the CT imaging of burnt bones and their virtual exploration, we concentrated on the analysis of the structures formed by the soil fauna activity in the fills of urns and additional vessels, and reconstruction of the dynamics of the ecosystem variability within the cemetery area based on thereof. We also demonstrated the impact of macrofaunal activity on stratigraphy and bone fragmentation. From the total of 222 excavated burials in 18 urns and one additional vessel, the remains of macrofauna or its bioturbation activity were identified. Out of 19 vessels subjected to CT examinations, traces of macrofaunal activity were demonstrated in 13: in five vessels animal bioturbative activity was not observed and in one, observations was impossible (due to significant metal-related artifacts). In two vessels both macrofaunal remains and traces of activity were identified. Discovered bioturbations were associated with specific species or genera. Nests or their parts of the genus Geotrupes sp. beetles were the most frequently observed traces of macrofaunal activity. Tunnels and aestivation chambers of earthworms and chambers of the genus Harpalus sp. beetles filled with Setaria sp. caryopses were discovered. The chitinous parts of other insects and the humerus bones of the vole of the genus Microtus sp. were also identified. It was shown, especially due to the non-destructive method, that rodents activity had the most destructive effect on the bone stratigraphy as well as on the movement and fragmentation of the burnt bones. The chances of visualizing bioturbations decreased with time since their creation. The process of disappearance of traces of macrofaunal activity concerned both traces of rodent activity and nests set up by Geotrupes sp. and other species."

In this paper, we examine digital exchange in two of its simplest forms: email and SMS. Specifically, our data consist of 2,004 messages provided by a diverse sample of college students, supplemented by in-depth interviews with their authors. These data were collected in 2010-a time when both mediums were widespread but devoid of most of their modern complexity. Based on these data, we make two contributions: First, we develop an empirically grounded typology of the basic properties of text-based digital communication; second, we document the distribution of these properties across five common relationship types. Respectively, these findings provide a starting point to understanding the substance of digital exchange in all its many forms and an empirical benchmark for comparison."
https://openalex.org/W4293722464,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is the most severe result of spine injury, but no effective therapy exists to treat SCI. We have previously shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Two RING fingers and DRIL 1 (Triad1) promotes neurite outgrowth after SCI. However, the mechanism by which Triad1 affects neuron growth and the potential involvement of its ubiquitination activity is unclear. Neuroprotective cytokine pleiotrophin (PTN) can promote microglia proliferation and neurotrophic factor secretion to achieve neuroprotection. We find using immunostaining and behavioral assays in rats that the expression of Triad1 and the PTN was peaked at 1 day after SCI and Triad1 improved motor function and histomorphological injury after SCI. We show using flow cytometry and astrocyte/neuronal coculture assays that Triad1 overexpression promoted PTN protein levels, neurotrophic growth factor (NGF) expression, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, astrocyte and neuronal viability, and neurite outgrowth but suppressed astrocyte apoptosis, while shRNA-mediated knockdown of Triad1 and PTN had the opposite effects. Ubiquitin ligase murine double mutant 2 (MDM2) has previously been demonstrated to participate in the process of neurite outgrowth and mediate ubiquitination of p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate overexpression of MDM2 downregulated PTN protein levels, NGF expression and BDNF expression in astrocytes, and inhibited neurite outgrowth of neurons. In addition, MDM2 facilitated PTN ubiquitination, which was reversed by Triad1. Finally, we show simultaneous sh-PTN and MDM2 overexpression attenuated the neurite outgrowth-promoting effect of Triad1 overexpression. In conclusion, we propose Triad1 promotes astrocyte-dependent neurite outgrowth to accelerate recovery after SCI by inhibiting MDM2-mediated PTN ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W4294295570,"Editorial boards play a key role in the production, dissemination, and promotion of scientific knowledge. The cross-presence of scholars in different journals, known as editorial board interlocking, maps the connections between such bodies of governance. Former research on this topic is typically restricted to individual disciplines and has failed to consider the relevance of potential interlocking between related, but different academic fields. Further, although existing studies note a significant lack of diversity in editorial board representation, they mainly focus on a single dimension, such as gender or geography. This study addressed these knowledge gaps by offering a complex cross-disciplinary approach to the geographical, gender, and institutional compositions of editorial boards, with a specific emphasis on within- and between-fields editorial board interlocking. We used graph and social network analysis to examine editorial board connections between 281 top journals (13,084 members and 17,092 connections) of six disciplines: communication, psychology, political science, sociology, economics, and management. We found substantial differences in terms of field connections, ranging from sociology with 42% interlocking with other fields, to management with only 11%. Psychology is significantly less connected to the other five disciplines. The results also show a clear overrepresentation of American institutions and native English-speaking countries in all fields, with Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and New York University forming a well-connected central cluster. Although female scholars are underrepresented, there are no significant differences in terms of positioning in the network. Female scholars are even employed in more central positions than male scholars in psychology, sociology, and management. Our findings extend the literature on editorial board diversity by evidencing a significant imbalance in their gender, geographical, institutional representation, and interlocking editorship both within and between fields."
https://openalex.org/W4294295612,"Monochamus alternatus is a major forest pest that spreads pine wilt disease in pine trees as a vector of pine wilt nematodes. Chemical insecticides used as fumigants to control overwintering M . alternatus in forests are highly toxic to the environment, so we investigated entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana ERL836 as an eco-friendly and alternative material to control overwintering M . alternatus . In this work, we evaluated the insecticidal activity of B . bassiana ERL836 against M . alternatus adults, the possibility of fungal colonization on pine tree bark, and finally the control efficacy of fungal pre-treatment on pine tree logs against emerging M . alternatus adults in semi-field and field conditions. M . alternatus adults were killed on the pine tree logs pre-treated with the B . bassiana ERL836. White conidia were observed not only on the surface of the dead adults but also on the pine tree logs, suggesting that the adults were killed by the fungus on the pine. A formulated ERL836 powder treatment on larvae-infested pine logs showed high insecticidal activity against adults, similar to that with the fungal powder suspension treatment, but we demonstrated that using the fungal powder was simpler than using the suspension in field conditions. Even in the field condition, the fungal powder treatment showed high insecticidal activity against M . alternatus adults, which we attribute to its ability to maintain fungal activity for a long time in field conditions by covering the pine tree logs with a film during overwintering. We confirmed that the risk that fungus-infected M . alternatus adults would spread the fungus to other non-target forest insects was low. Thus, even a high-concentration treatment in a specific area is unlikely to transmit the fungus outside that area, so it can be safely used to control this pine wilt nematode vector in forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4294295704,"In Germany, the incidence of cervical cancer, a disease caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV), is higher than in neighboring European countries. HPV vaccination has been recommended for girls since 2007. However, it continues to be significantly less well received than other childhood vaccines, so its potential for cancer prevention is not fully realized. To find new starting points for improving vaccination rates, we analyzed pseudonymized routine billing data from statutory health insurers in the PRÄZIS study (prevention of cervical carcinoma and its precursors in women in Saarland) in the federal state Saarland serving as a model region. We show that lowering the HPV vaccination age to 9 years led to more completed HPV vaccinations already in 2015. Since then, HPV vaccination rates and the proportion of 9- to 11-year-old girls among HPV-vaccinated females have steadily increased. However, HPV vaccination rates among 15-year-old girls in Saarland remained well below 50% in 2019. Pediatricians vaccinated the most girls overall, with a particularly high proportion at the recommended vaccination age of 9-14 years, while gynecologists provided more HPV catch-up vaccinations among 15-17-year-old girls, and general practitioners compensated for HPV vaccination in Saarland communities with fewer pediatricians or gynecologists. We also provide evidence for a significant association between attendance at the children´s medical check-ups ""U11"" or ""J1"" and HPV vaccination. In particular, participation in HPV vaccination is high on the day of U11. However, obstacles are that U11 is currently not financed by all statutory health insurers and there is a lack of invitation procedures for both U11 and J1, resulting in significantly lower participation rates than for the earlier U8 or U9 screenings, which are conducted exclusively with invitations and reminders. Based on our data, we propose to restructure U11 and J1 screening in Germany, with mandatory funding for U11 and organized invitations for HPV vaccination at U11 or J1 for both boys and girls."
https://openalex.org/W4294295711,"Mobilisation is a term used to describe the supply of a pollutant from its environmental source, e.g., soil or faeces, into a hydrological transfer pathway. The overarching aim of this study was to determine, using a laboratory-based approach, whether faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are hydrologically mobilised in different quantities from a typical agricultural, wildlife and wildfowl source, namely dairy cattle, red deer and greylag goose faeces. The mobilisation of FIB from fresh and ageing faeces under two contrasting temperatures was determined, with significant differences in the concentrations of both E. coli and intestinal enterococci lost from all faecal sources. FIB mobilisation from these faecal matrices followed the order of dairy cow > goose > deer (greatest to least, expressed as a proportion of the total FIB present). Significant changes in mobilisation rates from faecal sources over time were also recorded and this was influenced by the temperature at which the faecal material had aged over the course of the 12-day study. Characterising how indicators of waterborne pathogens are mobilised in the environment is of fundamental importance to inform models and risk assessments and develop effective strategies for reducing microbial pollution in catchment drainage waters and associated downstream impacts. Our findings add quantitative evidence to support the understanding of FIB mobilisation potential from three important faecal sources in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4294295791,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous opportunistic foodborne pathogen capable of survival in various adverse environmental conditions. Pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes is tightly controlled by a complex regulatory network of transcriptional regulators that are necessary for survival and adaptations to harsh environmental conditions both inside and outside host cells. Among these regulatory pathways are members of the DeoR-family transcriptional regulators that are known to play a regulatory role in sugar metabolism. In this study, we deciphered the role of FruR, a DeoR family protein, which is a fructose operon transcriptional repressor protein, in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and growth. Following intravenous (IV) inoculation in mice, a mutant strain with deletion of fruR exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial burden in liver and spleen tissues compared to the parent strain. Further, the ΔfruR strain had a defect in cell-to-cell spread in L2 fibroblast monolayers. Constitutive activation of PrfA, a pleiotropic activator of L. monocytogenes virulence factors, did not restore virulence to the ΔfruR strain, suggesting that the attenuation was not a result of impaired PrfA activation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that FruR functions as a positive regulator for genes encoding enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and as a repressor for genes encoding enzymes in the glycolysis pathway. These results suggested that FruR may function to facilitate NADPH regeneration, which is necessary for full protection from oxidative stress. Interestingly, deletion of fruR increased sensitivity of L. monocytogenes to H2O2, confirming a role for FruR in survival of L. monocytogenes during oxidative stress. Using anti-mouse neutrophil/monocyte monoclonal antibody RB6-8C5 (RB6) in an in vivo infection model, we found that FruR has a specific function in protecting L. monocytogenes from neutrophil/monocyte-mediated killing. Overall, this work clarifies the role of FruR in controlling L. monocytogenes carbon flow between glycolysis and PPP for NADPH homeostasis, which provides a new mechanism allowing metabolic adaptation of L. monocytogenes to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W4294295921,"Background Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has been used in evaluating clinical competence in health professions education around the world. Despite its implementation in Iraq for around a decade, limited studies investigated the challenges and opportunities to improve the standard and quality of this examination from student’s perspective. Methods This qualitative study was based on an online open-ended questionnaire survey that was carried out in the College of Medicine, Hawler Medical University, Iraq at the beginning of the 2018–2019 academic year. A convenience sample of 180 students in the clinical phase (4 th , 5th, and 6 th ) year of study were invited to participate. Results A total of 141 students responded to the online questionnaire. The participants were generally happy with the OSCE, and they recognized many positive aspects, including the role of the OSCE in increasing confidence, engagement and motivating learning, the role of the OSCE in achieving a higher level of learning, the content validity of the OSCE, and the quality of the OSCE. The main weak points of the OSCE identified by the students included unfairness, gender discrimination, duration of the OSCE, and the behavior of the examiners. Suggestions to improve the OSCE examination included improving the examiners’ behavior, with the focus on the training of the examiners, and avoiding discrimination among students. Conclusions Most of the students were generally satisfied with the current OSCE examination. The main concern of the students was related to the organization of the OSCE. Valuable suggestions were raised to improve the OSCE quality including examiners’ and simulated patients’ training."
https://openalex.org/W4294355873,"Acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is an enzyme that converts fatty acids to acyl-CoA-derivatives for lipid catabolism and lipid synthesis in general and can provide substrates for the production of mediators of inflammation in monocytes and macrophages. Acsl1 expression is increased by hyperglycemia and inflammatory stimuli in monocytes and macrophages, and promotes the pro-atherosclerotic effects of diabetes in mice. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms underlying Acsl1 transcriptional regulation. Here we demonstrate that the glucose-sensing transcription factor, Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (CHREBP), is a regulator of the expression of Acsl1 mRNA by high glucose in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). In addition, we show that inflammatory stimulation of BMDMs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases Acsl1 mRNA via the transcription factor, NF-kappa B. LPS treatment also increases ACSL1 protein abundance and localization to membranes where it can exert its activity. Using an Acsl1 reporter gene containing the promoter and an upstream regulatory region, which has multiple conserved CHREBP and NF-kappa B (p65/RELA) binding sites, we found increased Acsl1 promoter activity upon CHREBP and p65/RELA expression. We also show that CHREBP and p65/RELA occupy the Acsl1 promoter in BMDMs. In primary human monocytes cultured in high glucose versus normal glucose, ACSL1 mRNA expression was elevated by high glucose and further enhanced by LPS treatment. Our findings demonstrate that CHREBP and NF-kappa B control Acsl1 expression under hyperglycemic and inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4293722386,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is a potent membrane-damaging β-barrel pore-forming toxin. Upon binding to the target membranes, VCC monomers first assemble into oligomeric prepore intermediates and subsequently transform into transmembrane β-barrel pores. VCC harbors a designated pore-forming motif, which, during oligomeric pore formation, inserts into the membrane and generates a transmembrane β-barrel scaffold. It remains an enigma how the molecular architecture of the pore-forming motif regulates the VCC pore-formation mechanism. Here, we show that a specific pore-forming motif residue, E289, plays crucial regulatory roles in the pore-formation mechanism of VCC. We find that the mutation of E289A drastically compromises pore-forming activity, without affecting the structural integrity and membrane-binding potential of the toxin monomers. Although our single-particle cryo-EM analysis reveals WT-like oligomeric β-barrel pore formation by E289A-VCC in the membrane, we demonstrate that the mutant shows severely delayed kinetics in terms of pore-forming ability that can be rescued with elevated temperature conditions. We find that the pore-formation efficacy of E289A-VCC appears to be more profoundly dependent on temperature than that of the WT toxin. Our results suggest that the E289A mutation traps membrane-bound toxin molecules in the prepore-like intermediate state that is hindered from converting into the functional β-barrel pores by a large energy barrier, thus highlighting the importance of this residue for the pore-formation mechanism of VCC."

https://openalex.org/W4294295418,"Aglaonema , commonly called Chinese evergreens, are widely used for ornamental purposes. However, attempts to identify Aglaonema species and cultivars based on leaf morphology have been challenging. In the present study, chloroplast sequences were used to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of cultivated Aglaonema in South China. The chloroplast genomes of one green species and five variegated cultivars of Aglaonema , Aglaonema modestum , ‘Red Valentine’, ‘Lady Valentine’, ‘Hong Yan’, ‘Hong Jian’, and ‘Red Vein’, were sequenced for comparative and phylogenetic analyses. The six chloroplast genomes of Aglaonema had typical quadripartite structures, comprising a large single copy (LSC) region (91,092–91,769 bp), a small single copy (SSC) region (20,816–26,501 bp), and a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions (21,703–26,732 bp). The genomes contained 112 different genes, including 79–80 protein coding genes, 28–29 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs. The molecular structure, gene order, content, codon usage, long repeats, and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were generally conserved among the six sequenced genomes, but the IR-SSC boundary regions were significantly different, and ‘Red Vein’ had a distinct long repeat number and type frequency. For comparative and phylogenetic analyses, Aglaonema costatum was included; it was obtained from the GenBank database. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) were determined among the seven Aglaonema genomes studied. Nine divergent hotspots were identified: trnH-GUG-CDS1_psbA , trnS-GCU_trnS-CGA-CDS1 , rps4-trnT-UGU , trnF-GAA-ndhJ , petD-CDS2-rpoA , ycf1-ndhF , rps15-ycf1-D2 , ccsA-ndhD , and trnY-GUA-trnE-UUC . Additionally, positive selection was found for rpl2 , rps2 , rps3 , ycf1 and ycf2 based on the analyses of Ka/Ks ratios among 16 Araceae chloroplast genomes. The phylogenetic tree based on whole chloroplast genomes strongly supported monophyletic Aglaonema and clear relationships among Aroideae, Lasioideae, Lemnoideae, Monsteroideae, Orontioideae, Pothoideae and Zamioculcadoideae in the family Araceae. By contrast, protein coding gene phylogenies were poorly to strongly supported and incongruent with the whole chloroplast genome phylogenetic tree. This study provided valuable genome resources and helped identify Aglaonema species and cultivars."

The reproductive health is a particular area of their concern. Evidence demonstrates that previous therapeutic treatments for cancer and comorbidities may have harmful effects on female fertility and delivery outcomes, which will significantly affect patient quality of life. However, these reports are heterogeneous. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide the up-to-date evidence on the risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes in female survivors of childhood or adolescent cancer. Methods and analysis This meta-analysis will be carried out and reported with adherence to the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook. We will search online databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to August, 2022 to identify all relevant cohort studies examining the relationship between cancer and subsequent obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Data extraction from eligible studies will be conducted and crosschecked separately by two investigators using pre-tested standardized data extraction forms. Discrepancies will be resolved via a third investigator. Methodological quality assessment for each study will be conducted using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) tool. We will apply the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model to calculate the pooled estimates. Further sources of heterogeneity will be explored by performing subgroup analysis based on multiple study characteristics. Potential publication bias will be assessed by inspection of a funnel plot, Begg’s and Egger’s regression tests of funnel plot asymmetry. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval will not be required as all data used for this pooled analysis will be obtained from published cohort studies.

https://openalex.org/W4294295613,"Genetic diversity of plant populations on islands is likely to be influenced by characteristics such as island origin (oceanic or continental) and their age, size, and distance to continental landmasses. In Japan, Planchonella obovata sensu lato which is found on both continental and oceanic islands of varying age, size, and distance to East Asian continental areas—is an ideal system in which to investigate the factors influencing genetic diversity of island plant species. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of P . obovata s . l . populations, in the context of the species population genetic structure, demography, and between island migration, from 668 individuals, 28 populations and 14 islands including both continental (the Yaeyama Islands) and oceanic islands (the Daito, Bonin, and Volcano Islands) using 11 microsatellite markers. The Yaeyama and Volcano Islands respectively had the highest and lowest genetic diversity, and island origin and age significantly affected genetic diversity. Clustering analysis revealed that populations were grouped into Bonin, Volcano, and Yaeyama + Daito groups. However, Bonin and Volcano groups were distinct despite the relatively short geographical distance between them. Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis suggested that the population size was stable in Bonin and Yaeyama + Daito groups, whereas population reduction occurred in Volcano group, and migration between groups were very limited. Younger oceanic islands showed lower genetic diversity, probably due to limited gene flow and a lack of time to accumulate unique alleles. Genetic structure was generally consistent with the geographic pattern of the islands, but in Volcano, a limited number of founders and limited gene flow among islands are likely to have caused the large genetic divergence observed."
https://openalex.org/W4294295639,"This study was undertaken to investigate the inhibitory effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Liver fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting DMN intraperitoneally (at 10 mg/kg of body weight) daily for three consecutive days per week for 4 weeks. To investigate the effect of GM-CSF on disease onset, GM-CSF (50 μg/kg of body weight) was co-treated with DMN for 2 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks (4-week groups). To observe the effect of GM-CSF on the progression of liver fibrosis, GM-CSF was post-treated alone at 5–8 weeks after the 4 weeks of DMN injection (8-week groups). We found that DMN administration for 4 weeks produced molecular and pathological manifestations of liver fibrosis, that is, it increased the expressions of collagen type I, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression. In addition, elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin level (TBIL), and decreased albumin level (ALB) were observed. In both the 4-week and 8-week groups, GM-CSF clearly improved the pathological liver conditions in the gross and histological observations, and significantly recovered DMN-induced increases in AST and TBIL and decreases in ALB serum levels to normal. GM-CSF also significantly decreased DMN-induced increases in collagen type I, α-SMA, and TGF-β1 and increased DMN-induced decreases in PPAR-γ expression. In the DMN groups, survival decreased continuously for 8 weeks after DMN treatment for the first 4 weeks. GM-CSF showed a survival benefit when co-treated for the first 4 weeks but a marginal effect when post-treated for 5–8 weeks. In conclusion, co-treatment of GM-CSF showed therapeutic effects on DMN-induced liver fibrosis and survival rates in rats, while post-treatment efficiently blocked liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4294295665,"Introduction Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized fenestrated scavenger endothelial cells involved in the elimination of modified plasma proteins and tissue turnover waste macromolecules from blood. LSECs also participate in liver immune responses. A challenge when studying LSEC biology is the rapid loss of the in vivo phenotype in culture. In this study, we have examined biological processes and pathways affected during early-stage primary culture of rat LSECs and checked for cell responses to the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. Methods LSECs from male Sprague Dawley rats were cultured on type I collagen in 5% oxygen atmosphere in DMEM with serum-free supplements for 2 and 24 h. Quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tag technology was used to examine proteins in cells and supernatants. Validation was done with qPCR, ELISA, multiplex immunoassay, and caspase 3/7 assay. Cell ultrastructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy, and scavenger function by quantitative endocytosis assays. Results LSECs cultured for 24 h showed a characteristic pro-inflammatory phenotype both in the presence and absence of IL-1β, with upregulation of cellular responses to cytokines and interferon-γ, cell-cell adhesion, and glycolysis, increased expression of fatty acid binding proteins (FABP4, FABP5), and downregulation of several membrane receptors (STAB1, STAB2, LYVE1, CLEC4G) and proteins in pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle, fatty acid elongation, amino acid metabolism, and oxidation-reduction processes. Dexamethasone inhibited apoptosis and improved LSEC viability in culture, repressed inflammatory and immune regulatory pathways and secretion of IL-1β and IL-6, and further upregulated FABP4 and FABP5 compared to time-matched controls. The LSEC porosity and endocytic activity were reduced at 24 h both with and without dexamethasone but the dexamethasone-treated cells showed a less stressed phenotype. Conclusion Rat LSECs become activated towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype during early culture. Dexamethasone represses LSEC activation, inhibits apoptosis, and improves cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W4294295687,"Changing demographics in a population may have an inevitable influence on disease incidence including limb amputation. However, the extent to which these changes affect limb amputation (LA) is unknown. Understanding the impact of changing demographics on LA would provide the best opportunity to plan for the future. We assessed the impact of changes in age and sex on limb amputation in Saskatchewan between 2006 and 2019.Retrospective linked Saskatchewan's LA cases, and demographic characteristics and residents population from 2006-2019 was used. The amputation rate was calculated by dividing the total number of LA cases recorded each year by the annual Saskatchewan resident population and the results expressed per 100,000 populations. Furthermore, decomposition analysis was used to assess the impact of changes in age and sex on LA in a decade (2008-2017) and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was employed to examine the linear and non-linear effect of age.We found that in the ten years (2008-2017), the absolute LA rate difference was 9.0 per 100,000 population. Changes in age structure alone contributed 7.7% to the LA rate increase and 92.3% to changes in age-specific LA rates. The decade witnessed a marginal population difference between males and females, but the LA rate was 2.1-2.2 times higher in males than in females. The GAM revealed a non-linear relationship between LA and age, and further indicates that the risk of LA significantly increased as age increases.In a decade, we found that changes in age distribution and age-specific rate substantially impacted the increase in the LA rate observed in the province. This highlights the urgent need for strategized programs to respond to these changes as both the population and diabetes, which is age-dependent and a leading cause of LA, are expected to increase in the province by 2030. As changes in population and demographic factors are inevitable, this study provides data for policy makers on the need for continuous incorporation of the shift in population in the design of future health services."

In the first year after MI, 93.45% of the patients received LLT, mainly high-intensity statin (67.79%); with a minority of patients receiving statin + ezetimibe (4.55%), PCSK9i (0.20%) or ezetimibe alone (0.07%).Patients hospitalized with MI in Dubai present an increased risk of CVEs in their first-year post-discharge. Majority of the patients presented with LDL-C levels above 70 mg/dL, which indicates suboptimal lipid control with existing LLT, particularly in high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W4294295876,"Modeling oviposition as a function of female insect age, temperature, and host plant suitability may provide valuable insight into insect population growth of polyphagous insect pests at a landscape level. In this study, we quantified oviposition by beet leafhoppers, Circulifer (= Neoaliturus ) tenellus (Baker) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), on four common non-agricultural host plant species [ Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’Hér. (Geraniaceae), Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrader (Amaranthaceae), Plantago ovata Forsskál (Plantaginaceae), and Salsola tragus L. (Amaranthaceae)] at two constant temperature conditions. Additionally, temperature-based oviposition models for each host plant species were validated, under semi-field and greenhouse conditions. We found that K . scoparia was the most suitable host plant, and optimal temperature for oviposition was estimated to be 30.6°C. Accordingly, beet leafhoppers appear to be well-adapted to high-temperature conditions, so increasing temperatures due to climate change may favor population growth in non-agricultural areas. Maximum total fecundity ( R m ) was used as an indicator of relative suitability of host plants. S . tragus has been considered an important non-agricultural host plant, however, we found that S . tragus and E . cicutarium have lower R m compared to K . scoparia and P . ovata . The combination of detailed experimental oviposition bioassays, modeling, and model validation is considered widely relevant and applicable to host plant assessments and modeling of population dynamics of other polyphagous insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W4294295894,"The early transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK are unknown but their investigation is critical to aid future pandemic planning. We tested over 11,000 anonymised, stored historic antenatal serum samples, given at two north-west London NHS trusts in 2019 and 2020, for total antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (anti-RBD). Estimated prevalence of seroreactivity increased from 1% prior to mid-February 2020 to 17% in September 2020. Our results show higher prevalence of seroreactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in younger, non-white ethnicity, and more deprived groups. We found no significant interaction between the effects of ethnicity and deprivation. Derived from prevalence, the estimated incidence of seroreactivity reflects the trends observed in daily hospitalisations and deaths in London that followed 10 and 13 days later, respectively. We quantified community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in London, which peaked in late March / early April 2020 with no evidence of community transmission until after January 2020. Our study was not able to determine the date of introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but demonstrates the value of stored antenatal serum samples as a resource for serosurveillance during future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4294295897,"Obesity continues to be a significant global health issue and contributes to a variety of comorbidities and disease states. Importantly, obesity contributes to adverse cardiovascular health outcomes, which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Further, maternal obesity during gestation has been shown to predispose offspring to adverse phenotypic outcomes, specifically cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that diet-induced obesity during gestation would result in adverse cardiovascular phenotypes in first-generation offspring that would have functional consequences in juvenile and advanced ages. Multiparous Rambouillet/Columbia cross ewes (F0) were fed a highly palatable, pelleted diet at either 100% (CON), or 150% (OB) of National Research Council recommendations from 60 days prior to conception, until necropsy at d 135 (90%) of gestation (CON: n = 5, OB: n = 6), or through term for lambs (F1: 2.5 mo. old; CON: n = 9, OB: n = 6) and ewes (F1:9 years old; CON: n = 5, OB: n = 8). Paraffin-embedded fetal aorta section staining revealed increased collagen:elastin ratio and greater aortic wall thickness in OBF1 fetuses. Invasive auricular blood pressure recordings revealed elevated systolic blood pressure in OBF1 lambs, but no differences in diastolic pressure. In aged F1 ewes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced in OBF1 relative to CONF1. Echocardiography revealed no treatment differences in F1 lambs, but F1 ewes show tendencies for increased end systolic volume and decreased stroke volume, and markedly reduced ejection fraction. Therefore, we conclude that maternal obesity programs altered cardiovascular development that results in a hypertensive state in OBF1 lambs. Increased cardiac workload resulting from early life hypertension precedes the failure of the heart to maintain function later in life."
https://openalex.org/W4294295911,"Superficial soft tissue sarcomas are often left untreated unless they invade the skin and skin ulcers manifest. Progressive sarcomas frequently result in dismal oncological outcomes despite multidisciplinary treatment. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for superficial soft tissue sarcomas.This study retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of 82 patients with superficial soft tissue sarcomas treated between August 2003 and December 2020 at our institution. A superficial soft tissue sarcoma was defined if the percentage of the area occupied by the tumor in the assessed region (skin, subcutaneous) was more than 50%. Age, sex, location, tumor size, tumor-skin invasion, tumor grade, and distant metastasis at initial diagnosis were evaluated as potential prognostic factors. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify the prognostic factors. Five-year survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.The mean follow-up time was 60.1 months. The 5-year overall survival, 5-year local recurrence-free survival, and 5-year metastasis survival rates were 76.4%, 60.6%, and 71.0%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed significant relationships between poor prognosis and tumor size ≥5 cm, distant metastasis at initial diagnosis, and tumor-skin invasion. In the multivariate analysis, only the tumor-skin invasion was associated with worse overall survival.Superficial soft tissue sarcomas have biologically been considered a separate category due to their better prognosis. In this study, the tumor-skin invasion was the only significant factor associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, all superficial soft tissue sarcomas without tumor-skin invasion should be treated as early as possible."
https://openalex.org/W4294295948,"Sleep loss is a common phenomenon with consequences to physical and mental health. While the effects of sleep restriction on working memory are well documented, it is unknown how sleep restriction affects continuous force control. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of sleep restriction on visually and memory-guided force production magnitude and variability. We hypothesized that both visually and memory-guided force production would be impaired after sleep restriction. Fourteen men participated in an eleven-day inpatient sleep study and completed a grip force task after two nights of ten hours’ time in bed (baseline); four nights of five hours’ time in bed (sleep restriction); and one night of ten hours’ time in bed (recovery). The force task entailed four 20-second trials of isometric force production with the thumb and index finger targeting 25% of the participant’s maximum voluntary contraction. During visually guided trials, participants had continuous visual feedback of their force production. During memory-guided trials, visual feedback was removed for the last 12 seconds of each trial. During both conditions, participants were told to maintain the target force production. After sleep restriction, participants decreased the magnitude of visually guided, but not memory-guided, force production, suggesting that visual attention tasks are more affected by sleep loss than memory-guided tasks. Participants who reported feeling more alert after sleep restriction and recovery sleep produced higher force during memory-guided, but not visually guided, force production, suggesting that the perception of decreased alertness may lead to more attention to the task during memory-guided visual tasks."
https://openalex.org/W4294354080,"Recurrent or chronic pain affects 11-38% of children and adolescents. Pediatric pain research typically focuses on risk factors, such as anxiety and parent functional disability, but resilience-building, protective factors also play an important role in the pain experience. New methods to incorporate resilience-enhancing factors into pain research are needed. Photovoice is a highly participatory research method, where participants take photos to address a common question, caption their photos, and discuss the meaning of the photos in a group. The main objective of this study was to determine whether photovoice is an acceptable method to young people living with chronic pain for identifying and sharing sources of joy. Another objective was to explore sources of joy. Sixteen adolescents and young adults participated, which involved meeting in a group to discuss the goal of the study, taking photographs of self-identified sources of joy over a two-week period, and meeting as a group again to discuss the photographs and participate in a focus group about the experience. Results suggest that photovoice is an acceptable method, as all participants took photographs and attended both meetings, and three themes from the focus group data suggested the participants considered photovoice to be appropriate: 1.) Relief associated with meeting peers, 2.) Potential to benefit young people living with pain, and 3.) Potential to raise awareness. Three themes emerged from the discussion of the photographs to describe sources of joy: 1.) Gratitude for everyday pleasures and accomplishments, 2.) Support from pets, and 3.) Journey of acceptance. Results add to the strengths-based literature on pediatric pain by identifying an acceptable method that could be further explored for use as an intervention to enhance protective factors such as positive affect, gratitude, and social support and to compare the experiences of different populations of youth living with pain."
https://openalex.org/W4294355378,"Turfgrass management relies on frequent watering events from natural precipitation or irrigation. However, most irrigation scheduling strategies in turfgrass ignore the magnitude of canopy interception. Interception is the process by which precipitation or irrigation water is intercepted by and evaporated from plant canopies or plant residue. The objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of precipitation interception and throughfall in 'Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica L.) and '007' creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.). We used a new method consisting of co-located pluviometers with and without circular turfgrass patches to measure interception and throughfall. The resulting dataset includes 15 storms and 25 individual rainfall events ranging in precipitation totals from 0.3 mm to 42.4 mm throughout the research study. Throughfall amount resulted in a strong (r = 0.98) positive linear relationship with precipitation totals. On average, zoysiagrass and creeping bentgrass canopies intercepted a minimum of 4.4 mm before throughfall occurred. This indicates that, on average, no precipitation reaches the soil surface for precipitation events <4.4 mm. After the point of throughfall, 16% of each additional millimeter of precipitation or irrigation is lost due to interception. Nearly, 45% of the area of the contiguous U.S. could result in >50% of the annual precipitation being intercepted by canopies of zoysiagrass and bentgrass. This study provides detailed insights to understanding the interception dynamics in turfgrass and highlights the inefficient nature of small precipitation and irrigation events in turfgrass systems."
