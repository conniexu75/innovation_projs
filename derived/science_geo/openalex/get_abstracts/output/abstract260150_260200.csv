https://openalex.org/W2010897775,"In plants, seasonal changes in day length are perceived in leaves, which initiate long-distance signaling that induces flowering at the shoot apex. The identity of the long-distance signal has yet to be determined. In Arabidopsis , activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) transcription in leaf vascular tissue (phloem) induces flowering. We found that FT messenger RNA is required only transiently in the leaf. In addition, FT fusion proteins expressed specifically in phloem cells move to the apex and move long distances between grafted plants. Finally, we provide evidence that FT does not activate an intermediate messenger in leaves. We conclude that FT protein acts as a long-distance signal that induces Arabidopsis flowering."
https://openalex.org/W2024294468,"Florigen, the mobile signal that moves from an induced leaf to the shoot apex and causes flowering, has eluded identification since it was first proposed 70 years ago. Understanding the nature of the mobile flowering signal would provide a key insight into the molecular mechanism of floral induction. Recent studies suggest that the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a candidate for encoding florigen. We show that the protein encoded by Hd3a, a rice ortholog of FT, moves from the leaf to the shoot apical meristem and induces flowering in rice. These results suggest that the Hd3a protein may be the rice florigen."
https://openalex.org/W2015402753,"Nearly half of the mammalian genome is composed of repeated sequences. In Drosophila, Piwi proteins exert control over transposons. However, mammalian Piwi proteins, MIWI and MILI, partner with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are depleted of repeat sequences, which raises questions about a role for mammalian Piwi's in transposon control. A search for murine small RNAs that might program Piwi proteins for transposon suppression revealed developmentally regulated piRNA loci, some of which resemble transposon master control loci of Drosophila. We also find evidence of an adaptive amplification loop in which MILI catalyzes the formation of piRNA 5' ends. Mili mutants derepress LINE-1 (L1) and intracisternal A particle and lose DNA methylation of L1 elements, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role for PIWI proteins in transposon suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2055206190,"In possessing a lone pair of electrons and an accessible vacant orbital, singlet carbenes resemble transition metal centers and thus could potentially mimic their chemical behavior. Although singlet di(amino)carbenes are inert toward dihydrogen, it is shown that more nucleophilic and electrophilic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes can activate H 2 under mild conditions, a reaction that has long been known for transition metals. However, in contrast to transition metals that act as electrophiles toward dihydrogen, these carbenes primarily behave as nucleophiles, creating a hydride-like hydrogen, which then attacks the positively polarized carbon center. This nucleophilic behavior allows these carbenes to activate NH 3 as well, a difficult task for transition metals because of the formation of Lewis acid-base adducts."
https://openalex.org/W1975521355,"The quest to create superhard materials rarely strays from the use of high-pressure synthetic methods, which typically require gigapascals of applied pressure. We report that rhenium diboride (ReB 2 ), synthesized in bulk quantities via arc-melting under ambient pressure, rivals materials produced with high-pressure methods. Microindentation measurements on ReB 2 indicated an average hardness of 48 gigapascals under an applied load of 0.49 newton, and scratch marks left on a diamond surface confirmed its superhard nature. Its incompressibility along the c axis was equal in magnitude to the linear incompressibility of diamond. In situ high-pressure x-ray diffraction measurements yielded a bulk modulus of 360 gigapascals, and radial diffraction indicated that ReB 2 is able to support a remarkably high differential stress. This combination of properties suggests that this material may find applications in cutting when the formation of carbides prevents the use of traditional materials such as diamond."
https://openalex.org/W2047148152,"Competition between neurons is necessary for refining neural circuits during development and may be important for selecting the neurons that participate in encoding memories in the adult brain. To examine neuronal competition during memory formation, we conducted experiments with mice in which we manipulated the function of CREB (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein) in subsets of neurons. Changes in CREB function influenced the probability that individual lateral amygdala neurons were recruited into a fear memory trace. Our results suggest a competitive model underlying memory formation, in which eligible neurons are selected to participate in amemorytrace as a function of their relative CREB activity at the time of learning."

https://openalex.org/W2027577154,"Intercellular protein movement plays a critical role in animal and plant development. SHORTROOT (SHR) is a moving transcription factor essential for endodermis specification in the Arabidopsis root. Unlike diffusible animal morphogens, which form a gradient across multiple cell layers, SHR movement is limited to essentially one cell layer. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. We show that SCARECROW (SCR) blocks SHR movement by sequestering it into the nucleus through protein-protein interaction and a safeguard mechanism that relies on a SHR/SCR-dependent positive feedback loop for SCR transcription. Our studies with SHR and SCR homologs from rice suggest that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved, providing a plausible explanation why nearly all plants have a single layer of endodermis."
https://openalex.org/W2082420839,"Most working scientists hold fast to the concept of 'realism'--a viewpoint according to which an external reality exists independent of observation. But quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations. In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are abandoned."
https://openalex.org/W2083280040,"We report the structures of three intermediates in the O 2 activation and insertion reactions of an extradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenase. A crystal of Fe 2+ -containing homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase was soaked in the slow substrate 4-nitrocatechol in a low O 2 atmosphere. The x-ray crystal structure shows that three different intermediates reside in different subunits of a single homotetrameric enzyme molecule. One of these is the key substrate-alkylperoxo-Fe 2+ intermediate, which has been predicted, but not structurally characterized, in an oxygenase. The intermediates define the major chemical steps of the dioxygenase mechanism and point to a general mechanistic strategy for the diverse 2-His-1-carboxylate enzyme family."

https://openalex.org/W2041854776,"A family of inexpensive, Al 2 O 3 -forming, high–creep strength austenitic stainless steels has been developed. The alloys are based on Fe-20Ni-14Cr-2.5Al weight percent, with strengthening achieved through nanodispersions of NbC. These alloys offer the potential to substantially increase the operating temperatures of structural components and can be used under the aggressive oxidizing conditions encountered in energy-conversion systems. Protective Al 2 O 3 scale formation was achieved with smaller amounts of aluminum in austenitic alloys than previously used, provided that the titanium and vanadium alloying additions frequently used for strengthening were eliminated. The smaller amounts of aluminum permitted stabilization of the austenitic matrix structure and made it possible to obtain excellent creep resistance. Creep-rupture lifetime exceeding 2000 hours at 750°C and 100 megapascals in air, and resistance to oxidation in air with 10% water vapor at 650° and 800°C, were demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2064280886,"Sodium plays a key role in determining the basal excitability of the nervous systems through the resting “leak” Na+ permeabilities, but the molecular identities of the TTX- and Cs+-resistant Na+ leak conductance are totally unknown. Here we show that this conductance is formed by the protein NALCN, a substantially uncharacterized member of the sodium/calcium channel family. Unlike any of the other 20 family members, NALCN forms a voltage-independent, nonselective cation channel. NALCN mutant mice have a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm and die within 24 hours of birth. Brain stem-spinal cord recordings reveal reduced neuronal firing. The TTX- and Cs+-resistant background Na+ leak current is absent in the mutant hippocampal neurons. The resting membrane potentials of the mutant neurons are relatively insensitive to changes in extracellular Na+ concentration. Thus, NALCN, a nonselective cation channel, forms the background Na+ leak conductance and controls neuronal excitability.

The resting membrane potentials of the mutant neurons are relatively insensitive to changes in extracellular Na+ concentration. Thus, NALCN, a nonselective cation channel, forms the background Na+ leak conductance and controls neuronal excitability. The resting membrane potential (RMP) of most mammalian neurons is in the range from −50 to −80 mV, considerably depolarized to the potassium equilibrium potential near −92 mV. This suggests that in addition to resting potassium conductances, there are also conductances due to other ions. In fact, recordings from a variety of neurons reveal a significant resting or background sodium permeability (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. The effect of sodium ions on the electrical activity of the giant axon of the squid.J. Physiol. 1949; 108: 37-77PubMed Google Scholar, Nicholls et al., 2001Nicholls J.G. Martin A.R. Wallace B.G. Fuchs P.A. From Neuron to Brain.Fourth Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of resting sodium permeability remains unclear. In some neurons, there is resting permeability from hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (Ih, encoded by HCN genes; Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents: from molecules to physiological function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and there can also be resting sodium permeability from TTX-sensitive sodium channels giving a subthreshold, persistent sodium current (Crill, 1996Crill W.E. Persistent sodium current in mammalian central neurons.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, both of these conductances are highly sensitive to voltage, and there is also evidence for a true voltage-insensitive background leak sodium permeability not blocked by Cs or TTX. The leak Na+ current (IL-Na) is believed to play important roles in the regulation of neuronal excitability, but the in vivo function of such a leak conductance has not been tested because of a lack of specific blockers (Atherton and Bevan, 2005Atherton J.F.

Furthermore, the molecular basis for the voltage-independent sodium permeability is completely unknown. In animals, voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) and Ca2+ (CaV)-selective channels have four homologous repeats (domains I–IV) of 6TM-spanning segments (S1–S6) (4x6TM) (Catterall, 2000Catterall W.A.

The selectivity filter is formed by stretches of S5-S6 pore (P) loops contributed by each 6TM domain (Figure 1A) (Catterall, 2000Catterall W.A.

In CaV channels, the calcium selectivity requires acidic amino acids that bind Ca (four glutamate [E] or aspartate [D] residues, one from each of the four homologous repeats; EEEE motif) in the mouth of the pore.

NALCN differs from NaV and CaV channels in that it has fewer positively charged residues (arginine or lysine) in its voltage-sensing S4 segments. Additionally, NALCN has an EEKE motif, a mixture of the EEEE (CaV) and DEKA (NaV) residues, in its predicted selectivity filter (Figure 1A). NALCN is highly conserved in mammals (99% identity between human and rat). Drosophila melanogaster has a NALCN homology named α1U (for unusual α1 subunit, accession number AY160083, 57% identity with the human homolog) (Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Ion channels and synaptic organization: analysis of the Drosophila genome.Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Hypomorphic alleles in the fruit flies with reduced NALCN expression, although viable and fertile, have altered locomotive behavioral circadian rhythms (Lear et al., 2005Lear B.C. Lin J.M. Keath J.R.

Furthermore, the mutant flies display a narrow abdomen phenotype (na) and have altered sensitivities to general anesthetics such as halothane (Krishnan and Nash, 1990Krishnan K.S. Nash H.A.

A succession of anesthetic endpoints in the Drosophila brain.J. Neurobiol. 2006; 66: 1195-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two homologs also exist in C. elegans (nca-1, accession number NP_741413; nca-2, accession number NP_498054; both with 48% identity to the human homolog). The functional significance of NALCN in mammals and whether NALCN indeed encodes a plasma membrane ion channel are unknown (Lee et al., 1999Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Cloning of a novel four repeat protein related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels.FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report that NALCN forms a voltage-independent, nonselective, noninactivating cation channel permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+. Mice with deletion of the NALCN gene have a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm characterized by a regular rhythm interrupted by periods of apnea. Mutant pups die within 24 hr of birth. Hippocampal neurons from the mutant lack IL-Na and the current can be restored by NALCN cDNA transfection. We thus conclude that NALCN, a nonselective cation channel, encodes the neuronal background Na+ leak conductance. Northern blot analysis suggested that NALCN mRNA is expressed in all brain regions (Lee et al., 1999Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Cloning of a novel four repeat protein related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels.FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine which types of cells express the gene, we carried out in situ hybridization of mouse brain slices with DIG-labeled RNA probes derived from its 1.8 kb cDNA (carboxyl terminus). In the cerebral cortex (Figure 1B) and hippocampus (Figure 1C), an antisense RNA probe detected NALCN mRNA expression in all layers and in essentially all the neurons. Sense RNA probe was minimally detected, demonstrating specificity of staining. Similarly, NALCN mRNA was detected in all neurons of the spinal cord dorsal and ventral horns (data not shown). Using northern blot and in situ hybridization, we did not detect NALCN expression in liver, muscle, lung, kidney, or testis (data not shown, see also Lee et al., 1999Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Cloning of a novel four repeat protein related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels.FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that NALCN is likely a widely expressed neuronal ion channel. Attempts to functionally reconstitute NALCN as an ion channel in heterologous systems have been unsuccessful (Lear et al., 2005Lear B.C. Lin J.M. Keath J.R. McGill J.J. Raman I.M. Allada R.

To determine if NALCN indeed encodes an ion channel, we transfected NALCN-encoding cDNA into HEK293 cells and recorded whole-cell current 48–72 hr after transfection (Figure 2A). Immediately after break-in, >80% (19 of 22) of NALCN-transfected cells appeared “leaky,” had input resistance below 1 GΩ, and displayed a current with a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship (INALCN, −22 to −1691 pA; −573 ± 124 pA, at −80 mV; n = 22) that was largely absent in mock-transfected (−10 ± 3 pA, n = 15) and nontransfected control cells (Figure 2B). Since currents with a linear I-V curve (Figure 2B) could also be generated by nonspecific leaks from cell damage or through poor seals, we used ion replacement to ensure that the currents analyzed were from ion-selective conductances. When extracellular Na+ and K+ were replaced with larger ions Tris+ or NMDG+, the inward currents were largely abolished and the I-V curves became outwardly rectifying (Figure 2C). The input resistance (Rm) under this condition became >1 GΩ (at −80 mV). INALCN could also be suppressed by channel blockers (see below). Unlike the ten CaV and nine NaV members in the 4x6TM channel family, NALCN's activation is voltage independent (Figure 2B). No significant voltage-dependent inactivation was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). The lack of voltage dependence of activation and inactivation is likely a result of the absence of some of the charged residues conserved in the S4 domains of voltage-gated channels (Figure 1A) (Bezanilla, 2000Bezanilla F. The voltage sensor in voltage-dependent ion channels.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Replacement of >90% of Cl− in the bath by methanesulfonate (MES) did not result in a significant change in the size or reversal potential of the current (Figure 3A), indicating that NALCN was impermeable to anion and that the current was carried by cations. In contrast, changing [Na+]o from 155 to 15.5 mM reduced the amplitude of inward current and shifted the reversal potential, suggesting Na+ as a permeant ion (Figure 3B). NALCN is also clearly permeable to K+ and Ca2+ (Figure 3B). We used reversal potentials of INALCN under various bi-ionic conditions to estimate the ion selectivity of the channel. The selectivity sequence was PNa (1.3, n = 12) > PK (1.2, n = 5) > PCs (1.0, n = 12) > PCa (0.5, n = 7). Thus, NALCN is a nonselective cation channel, unlike any of the other 20 members in the 4x6TM channel family, which are highly selective for either Na+ (NaV1-9 and NaX) or Ca2+ (CaV1.1-1.4, CaV2.1-2.3, and CaV3.1-3.3) (Yu and Catterall, 2004Yu F.H.

The channel's unique ion selectivity is likely the result of its unusual sequences of amino acids associated with the putative channel pore (Figure 1A), as suggested by the extensive mutagenesis studies carried out on the EEEE motif in CaVs and DEKA in NaVs (Heinemann et al., 1992Heinemann S.H.

In support of the importance of the EEKE motif in NALCN's ion selectivity, a mutant NALCN with an EEKA motif had a largely decreased Ca2+ permeability; PNa (1.3, n = 11) = PK (1.3, n = 8) > PCs (1.0, n = 11) > PCa (0.1, n = 11) (Figure 3C). The involvement of amino acids surrounding the EEKE locus (Figure 1A) in ion selectivity may explain why the EEKA mutant is not as Na+ selective as NaV channels (DEKA motif). INALCN was not blocked by the NaV channel blocker TTX (up to 10 μM) (Figures 4A and 4C) but could be partially blocked by several Cav blockers with low affinity (apparent IC50s, 0.15 mM for Cd2+, 0.26 mM for Co2+, and 0.38 mM for verapamil) (Figure 4B). The trivalent ion Gd3+, which is often considered a high-affinity blocker for stretch-activated channels (Yang and Sachs, 1989Yang X.C. Sachs F. Block of stretch-activated ion channels in Xenopus oocytes by gadolinium and calcium ions.Science. 1989; 243: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), effectively blocked INALCN with an apparent IC50 of 1.4 μM (Figure 4). The overall properties of INALCN (including the I-V relationship, activation, inactivation, PCa/PNa, and pharmacology) are unlike those of the majority of TRP cation channels, making it unlikely that the currents we recorded were through nonspecific leaks or through other proteins such as TRPs that could have been upregulated by the NALCN cDNA transfection (see the Experimental Procedures for details). To uncover the in vivo function of NALCN, we generated mice with NALCN's exon 1 deleted (Figure 5A). Semiquantitative RT-PCR assays show that the homozygous mutant (E18.5 embryos) did not express the wild-type (WT) NALCN mRNA; heterozygotes expressed reduced amounts in brain (Figure 5A). Mice were born in a roughly Mendelian ratio (22% −/−, 27% +/+ and 51% +/−; from 1043 pups in 127 litters, tail clips used for genotyping collected within ∼10 hr of birth), suggesting that the channel gene is not required for embryonic viability. We did not observe gross differences in embryonic development, righting responses, spontaneous limb movement, and toe/tail pinch responses between WT and mutant newborn pups. The homozygous mutants appeared normal up to 12 hr after birth (Figure 5A). No mutant, however, survived beyond 24 hr after birth (data from 52 mutant pups in 28 litters). Thus, NALCN is one of the few channels in the 4x6TM channel family required for neonatal survival. A clear distinction between null and WT mouse breathing patterns was apparent. Null mice respiration was sporadic, with apnea for a few seconds before beginning a burst of deep breathing lasting 5–10 s (data from >20 pairs). We measured the respiratory patterns using a whole-body plethysmograph, which detected the pressure changes generated by the breathing activities of the mice. The WT and mutant pups were subjected to recording a few hours after they were born, when they appeared otherwise indistinguishable. WT mice breathed in a well-defined rhythm (Figure 5B). Null mice breathing was characterized by apnea for ∼5 s followed by a burst of breathing of ∼5 s, at a rate of ∼5 apnea events/minute (Figures 5C and 5D). Intriguingly, this pattern is reminiscent of the periodic breathing of Cheyne-Stokes respiration found in humans with CNS damage (Strohl, 2003Strohl K.P. Periodic breathing and genetics.Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2003; 135: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Respiratory rhythms are controlled by the central nervous system. Given the expression of the NALCN channel in CNS neurons but absence in muscle, and the ability of the mutant pups to breathe, we suspected that the disrupted respiratory patterns in the mutant was due to a defect in neuronal control. We recorded the electrical activities from the fourth cervical nerve root (C4) that innervates the diaphragm and discharges rhythmic electrical signals that regulate breathing. The C4 nerves in isolated brain stem spinal cords from newborn pups (P0) have robust rhythmic electrical activities in WT mice (Figures 5E and 5G). In null mice, however, such electrical activities were largely absent (Figures 5F and 5G). These recordings support the hypothesis that severe defects in the respiratory rhythm in the null mice were due to defects in electrical signaling in the nervous system. To determine the native channel that NALCN encodes, we measured currents in hippocampal neurons that express NALCN mRNA and are among the best electrically characterized neurons (Figure 1C). Using a slow ramp protocol, the TTX-sensitive, persistent Na+ current was observed in both WT and mutant mice (data not shown) (Raman and Bean, 1997Raman I.M. Bean B.P. Resurgent sodium current and action potential formation in dissociated cerebellar Purkinje neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we used step protocols to record the NaV and CaV currents. The NaV current density in the mutant was not significantly different from the WT (WT, −26.0 ± 7.1 pA/pF, n = 10; mutant, −25.3 ± 7.0 pA/pF, n = 10; at −17 mV). We next examined the CaV currents using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Ba2+ currents elicited in the mutant and WT neurons were comparable (WT, −35.1 ± 6.0 pA/pF, n = 5; mutant, −25.7 ± 8.2 pA/pF, n = 5; at −10 mV). Consistent with this observation, depolarization with 40 mM [K+]o readily evoked [Ca2+]i increases in both WT and mutant neurons when assayed with Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging (data not shown). Thus, the disruption in NALCN likely did not lead to nonspecific effects on NaV or CaV channels. NALCN expressed in HEK293 cells has a linear I-V relationship, is permeable to Na+, and is constitutively open (Figure 2, Figure 3). These properties fit reasonably well with those of IL-Na (Nicholls et al., 2001Nicholls J.G. Martin A.R. Wallace B.G. Fuchs P.A. From Neuron to Brain.Fourth Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). To compare the Na+ leak currents in hippocampal neurons cultured from WT and the mutant, we used extracellular baths containing TTX (1 μM) and Cs+ (2 mM) to block the Nav and Ih currents, respectively. The small IL-Na leak current was further isolated by subtracting the currents recorded in low (14 mM) [Na+]o from those in high (140 mM) [Na+]o at holding potentials (ΔIL-Na at −68 mV) (Raman et al., 2000Raman I.M. Gustafson A.E. Padgett D. Ionic currents and spontaneous firing in neurons isolated from the cerebellar nuclei.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9004-9016PubMed Google Scholar, Simasko, 1994Simasko S.M. A background sodium conductance is necessary for spontaneous depolarizations in rat pituitary cell line GH3.Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C709-C719PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 6A) (see the Experimental Procedures). In WT neurons, 97% (29 of 30) had ΔIL-Na larger than 5 pA (−13.2 ± 0.8 pA at −68 mV, n = 30). In contrast, none of the 15 mutant neurons measured had ΔIL-Na >5 pA (−0.2 ± 0.7 pA) within the resolution limit of our measurement (Figures 6A and 6B). Transfection of NALCN to the mutant neurons restored and enhanced the Na+ current (ΔIL-Na, −72.4 ± 14.4 pA, n = 12) (Figures 6A and 6B), while transfection of an empty vector failed to do so (Figure 6B). Taken together, these data suggest that the TTX- and Cs+-insensitive background Na+ leak current IL-Na is likely carried by the nonselective NALCN-containing channel. Hypothetically, IL-Na would balance background K+ currents to maintain the RMP and regulate neuronal excitability (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, Nicholls et al., 2001Nicholls J.G. Martin A.R. Wallace B.G. Fuchs P.A. From Neuron to Brain.Fourth Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the mutant neurons were hyperpolarized (RMP, −71.4 ± 3.2 mV, n = 14) compared with WT (−61.3 ± 1.2 mV, n = 24) (Figure 6C). Furthermore, mutant neurons were markedly depolarized when transfected with NALCN cDNA (−36.5 ± 3.7 mV, n = 15), but not with empty vector (−67.9 ± 3.0 mV, n = 5) (Figure 6C). To test if the NALCN-encoded channel contributes to the sensitivity of the neuron's membrane potential to extracellular [Na+], we monitored MPs while [Na+]o was reduced. A drop of [Na+]o from 140 mM to 14 mM led to a hyperpolarization (ΔVm, −13.7 ± 1.6 mV, n = 17) in the WT neurons. In contrast, such effect of a 10-fold [Na+]o drop was largely diminished in the mutant (ΔVm, −3.1 ± 1.5 mV, n = 10) (Figures 6D and 6E). Transfection of NALCN cDNA to the mutant neurons restored and enhanced the sensitivity (ΔVm, −32.0 ± 2.9 mV, n = 9), while transfection with an empty vector did not have a similar effect (ΔVm, 0.0 ± 0.8 mV, n = 5) (Figures 6D and 6E). In addition to the NALCN channel carrying the Cs+- and TTX-insensitive Na+ leak (Figure 6B), NaV (activated by depolarization, blocked by TTX) and Ih (activated by hyperpolarization, blocked by Cs+) may be partially active and may serve as two additional paths for the total Na+ leak at RMPs in mammalian neurons (C. elegans has two NALCN genes but no genes encoding NaV or Ih) (Nicholls et al., 2001Nicholls J.G. Martin A.R. Wallace B.G. Fuchs P.A. From Neuron to Brain.Fourth Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of each of the three components, we measured ΔIL-Na in the same neuron in the absence of TTX and Cs+, in the presence of Cs+, and in the presence of both TTX and Cs+. The relative contributions of INALCN, Ih and NaV to the total background Na+ current were estimated to be 72.1% ± 4.1%, 9.6% ± 11.5%, and 18.3% ± 10.9% (n = 5), respectively (Figure 7A). These data suggest NALCN channel as the dominant path for the Na+ leak in the hippocampal neurons. Consistent with the major contribution of NALCN, mutant neurons' MPs are relatively insensitive to the change of [Na+]o, even in the absence of Cs+ and TTX (Figure 7B). Finally, we tested if NALCN contributes to neuronal excitability. In WT neurons, the frequency of continuous firing could be significantly reduced by an application of 10 μM Gd3+ (77.1% ± 5.3%, n = 7) (Figure 7C, upper panel; Figure 7D). Consistent with the idea that the frequency reduction was due to a blockade of the INALCN leak current, injection of a depolarizing current restored the firing frequency."

Within these islets, communication between β cells inhibits basal insulin secretion and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thus contributing to glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding. In the search for the underlying molecular mechanism, we have discovered that β cells communicate via ephrin-As and EphAs. We provide evidence that ephrin-A5 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We further show that EphA-ephrin-A-mediated β cell communication is bidirectional: EphA forward signaling inhibits insulin secretion, whereas ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates insulin secretion. EphA forward signaling is downregulated in response to glucose, which indicates that, under basal conditions, β cells use EphA forward signaling to suppress insulin secretion and that, under stimulatory conditions, they shift to ephrin-A reverse signaling to enhance insulin secretion. Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to improve glucose homeostasis.

Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to improve glucose homeostasis. Pancreatic islets are essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and defects in their ability to adequately secrete insulin in response to glucose result in diabetes mellitus (Bell and Polonsky, 2001Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes mellitus and genetically programmed defects in beta-cell function.Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, β cells initially develop as scattered cells (Grapin-Botton and Melton, 2000Grapin-Botton A. Melton D.A.

However, as development progresses, they aggregate with other β cells and endocrine cells to form pancreatic islets (Halban, 2004Halban P.A.

Cell-cell communication therefore ensures that β cells secrete low amounts of insulin during times of starvation but sufficient amounts of insulin after food uptake. However, the molecular mechanism that allows β cell communication to suppress basal insulin secretion and enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remains elusive. Here we investigated EphA receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and their ephrin-A ligands in pancreatic β cells since EphAs and ephrin-As are involved in various aspects of cell-cell communication (Himanen and Nikolov, 2003Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Eph signaling: a structural view.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 46-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Pasquale, 2005Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signalling casts a wide net on cell behaviour.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Ephs and ephrins are classified in A and B subclasses, and most EphAs bind to ephrin-As, while most EphBs bind to ephrin-Bs (Gale et al., 1996Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. et al.Eph receptors and ligands comprise two major specificity subclasses and are reciprocally compartmentalized during embryogenesis.Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Both EphAs and ephrin-As are localized on the plasma membrane and, therefore, require direct cell-cell contact to bind and activate each other (Flanagan and Vanderhaeghen, 1998Flanagan J.G.

Eph receptor signalling casts a wide net on cell behaviour.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway downstream of the transmembrane EphA RTKs is referred to as EphA forward signaling and can be exogenously activated by ephrin-A-Fc-fusion proteins (Figure 1A). The signaling pathway downstream of the GPI-anchored ephrin-As is referred to as ephrin-A reverse signaling and can be exogenously activated by EphA-Fc-fusion proteins (Figure 1A). In general, when both signaling pathways are active, EphA-ephrin-A bidirectional signaling takes place (Figure 1A). However, if EphA forward signaling is inhibited by dephosphorylation of EphA receptors or, alternatively, truncation of their cytoplasmic parts, ephrin-A reverse signaling occurs without kinase-dependent EphA forward signaling (Holmberg et al., 2000Holmberg J.

Eph receptors are negatively controlled by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that β cells communicate with each other via EphAs and ephrin-As. We show that EphA forward signaling inhibits basal insulin secretion. In contrast, glucose stimulation attenuates EphA forward signaling by dephosphorylation of EphAs. This allows predominant ephrin-A reverse signaling, which enhances insulin secretion. Our study on pancreatic islets therefore shows that interacting cells coexpressing EphAs and ephrin-As can switch between two opposite states in response to a stimulus. This mechanism enables pancreatic islets to switch from low levels of insulin secretion to high levels of insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation. We investigated the presence of Ephs and ephrins in pancreatic islets as possible candidate molecules involved in cell-cell communication (Figure 1A). First, we detected similar transcription of ephrin-As and EphAs in islets and mouse insulinoma cells, MIN6 (Figure 1B). We also detected expression of ephrin-Bs and EphBs (data not shown) but focused on ephrin-As and EphAs due to their strong abundance and similar expression in both islets and MIN6 cells. Immunostaining mouse pancreas sections showed coexpression of ephrin-A5 and EphA5 proteins in islets, and this expression was stronger in the islets than in the surrounding exocrine tissue (Figures 1C and 1E). A similar expression was observed in the human pancreas (Figures S1A–S1F). Other ephrin-As and EphAs, such as ephrin-A1 and EphA7, were also expressed in mouse pancreatic islets (Figures S2A and S2B). Next we stained mouse pancreas sections with EphA5-Fc- and ephrin-A5-Fc-fusion proteins, which bind with different affinity to virtually all ephrin-As and EphAs, respectively (Figure 1A; Flanagan and Vanderhaeghen, 1998Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. The ephrins and Eph receptors in neural development.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The staining showed that islet ephrin-As bind to EphA5 (Figure 1D) and that islet EphAs bind to ephrin-A5 (Figure 1F). EphA5 and ephrin-As colocalized in regions where MIN6 cells were in contact with each other (Figures 1G and 1H). In line with the findings that EphAs and ephrin-As segregate in motor neurons (Marquardt et al., 2005Marquardt T. Shirasaki R. Ghosh S. Andrews S.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Pfaff S.L. Coexpressed EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands mediate opposing actions on growth cone navigation from distinct membrane domains.Cell. 2005; 121: 127-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and that several transmembrane proteins also segregate in insulinoma cells (Uhles et al., 2003Uhles S. Moede T. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. Isoform-specific insulin receptor signaling involves different plasma membrane domains.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we observed little colocalization of EphA5 and ephrin-As on the free surfaces of MIN6 cells (Figure 1I). Moreover, based on the EphA5-Fc and ephrin-A5-Fc staining of nonpermeabilized MIN6 cells, we found that ephrin-As were more strongly localized to the plasma membrane compared to the EphAs (Figures S3A and S3B). Conversely, EphAs strongly localized to insulin secretory granules (Figure S3D), whereas ephrin-As did not (Figure S3C). These results show that EphAs and ephrin-As are coexpressed in β cells and suggest that EphA-ephrin-A bidirectional signaling may take place between adjacent β cells (Figure 1A). To investigate whether ephrin-A5, a possible participant in bidirectional signaling between β cells, was required for insulin secretion, we compared control islets with ephrin-A5-deficient islets (ephrin-A5−/−) (Figures 2A and 2B). In comparison with control islets, ephrin-A5−/− islets had a significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (compare black columns in Figure 2A), showing that ephrin-A5 is required for normal β cell insulin secretory response to glucose (compare Δs in Figure 2A). In contrast, we did not detect any differences in the insulin content between control and ephrin-A5−/− islets (Figure 2B), thus excluding an effect of ephrin-A5 on insulin production. In line with the insulin-secretion defects (Figure 2A), we also detected impaired glucose tolerance in ephrin-A5-deficient mice (Figure 2C). To rule out the possibility that the observed defects were due to changes in non-β cells, which are also present in islets, we knocked down ephrin-A5 in MIN6 cells (Figures 2D and 2E), a frequently used model for β cells (Miyazaki et al., 1990Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Establishment of a pancreatic beta cell line that retains glucose-inducible insulin secretion: special reference to expression of glucose transporter isoforms.Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). We noticed that ephrin-A5 knockdown led to significantly increased basal insulin secretion (white columns in Figure 2F) as well as significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (black columns in Figure 2F). These results show that ephrin-A5 is involved in suppression of basal insulin secretion and is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The data further show that ephrin-A5 plays a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which is not substituted by any of the other ephrin-As expressed in pancreatic β cells. To uncover the underlying molecular mechanism, we first investigated the effects of ephrin-A reverse signaling and EphA forward signaling on insulin secretion (Figure 3). We used EphA5-Fc to stimulate ephrin-A reverse signaling and ephrin-A5-Fc to stimulate EphA forward signaling (Figures 3A and 3B), and we used Fc fragment as control (Figures S4A and S4B). We showed that EphA5-Fc significantly increased basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (compare EphA5-Fc with Fc in Figure 3A), whereas ephrin-A5-Fc significantly decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets (compare ephrin-A5-Fc with Fc in Figure 3A). Islets consist mainly of β cells but also harbor other cell types that might have been affected in these experiments. Therefore, we tested the role of ephrin-A reverse signaling and EphA forward signaling in MIN6 cells and obtained similar results (Figure 3B). Moreover, EphA7-Fc and ephrin-A1-Fc also conversely affected glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Figure S2C). Finally, we showed that EphA5-Fc increased, and that ephrin-A5-Fc suppressed, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from human pancreatic islets (Figure S1G). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is decreased in situations of reduced β cell communication (Luther et al., 2006Luther M.J. Hauge-Evans A. Souza K.L. Jorns A. Lenzen S. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. MIN6 beta-cell-beta-cell interactions influence insulin secretory responses to nutrients and non-nutrients.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Maes and Pipeleers, 1984Maes E. Pipeleers D.

Invest. 1990; 86: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore we asked whether EphA5-Fc restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 cells with reduced cell-cell contact (Figure 3C). We first showed that nonconfluent cells (“low cell density”) had less glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to confluent cells (“high cell density”; compare white columns in Figure 3C). We then showed that EphA5-Fc partially restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in these cells (compare last two columns in Figure 3C), suggesting that endogenous ephrin-A reverse signaling is required for enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We noticed that ephrin-A5-Fc decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but did not decrease basal insulin secretion from islets and MIN6 cells (Figures 3A and 3B). We hypothesized that basal insulin secretion could not be decreased because it was maximally suppressed by endogenous EphA-ephrin-A interactions. As shown in Figure 3D, nonconfluent MIN6 cells had significantly enhanced basal insulin secretion (compare white columns) as well as reduced EphA5 phosphorylation levels compared to confluent cells (Figure 3E; compare white columns in Figure 3F). Importantly, ephrin-A5-Fc decreased basal insulin secretion in these cells to a level characteristic of confluent MIN6 cells (compare last two columns in Figure 3D). Consistent with the idea that this inhibition was due to exogenous activation of EphA forward signaling, ephrin-A5-Fc significantly increased EphA5 phosphorylation levels in the nonconfluent cells (Figure 3E; compare last two columns in Figure 3F). These results therefore suggest that endogenous EphA forward signaling is required for inhibiting basal insulin secretion. The previous experiments strongly suggested that ephrin-A reverse signaling enhanced insulin secretion (Figure 3). Here we used single primary β cells to stimulate ephrin-A reverse signaling with EphA5-Fc, without simultaneously affecting endogenous EphA forward signaling (Figure 4A). We expressed GFP-tagged insulin in primary mouse β cells and stimulated these cells with glucose in the presence or absence of EphA5-Fc (Figure 4A). We then monitored the secretory events in single β cells by using total internal reflection-fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM; Movies S1 and S2). As shown in Figure 4B, EphA5-Fc treatment significantly increased fusion events of newly recruited insulin secretory granules (white columns). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, in response to a sudden increase in glucose concentration, follows a biphasic time course consisting of a rapid first phase followed by a sustained second phase (Rorsman and Renstrom, 2003Rorsman P. Renstrom E. Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic beta cells.Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We found that EphA5-Fc increased the number of secretory events during both phases of insulin secretion with a stronger effect on the second phase (compare Figures 4C and 4D). We conclude that ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates insulin secretion. The experiments, shown in Figure 3, strongly suggested that EphA forward signaling suppressed insulin secretion. Here we used TIR-FM of single ephrin-A5-Fc-treated primary β cells to provide evidence of a suppressive effect of EphA forward signaling (Figure 4E; Movies S3 and S4). As shown in Figure 4F, ephrin-A5-Fc significantly reduced the number of fusion events of newly recruited insulin secretory granules (white columns). In addition, ephrin-A5-Fc reduced the number of secretory events during both phases of insulin secretion with a stronger effect on the second phase (compare Figures 4G and 4H). As additional evidence of an inhibitory effect of EphA forward signaling on insulin secretion, a dominant-negative EphA5 protein (DN-EphA5) lacking its cytoplasmic domain was expressed in MIN6 cells (Figure S5A). This DN-EphA5 binds to ephrin-As and is expected to induce ephrin-A reverse signaling and inhibit EphA forward signaling (Gao et al., 1998Gao P.P. Yue Y. Zhang J.H. Cerretti D.P. Levitt P. Zhou R. Regulation of thalamic neurite outgrowth by the Eph ligand ephrin-A5: implications in the development of thalamocortical projections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of a full-length EphA5 protein (WT EphA5) is expected to induce both ephrin-A reverse signaling and EphA forward signaling (Figure S5B). In support of an inhibitory effect of EphA forward signaling, we found that DN-EphA5 increased basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas WT EphA5 overexpression decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in confluent MIN6 cells (Figure S5C). We conclude that EphA forward signaling suppresses insulin secretion. It has been shown that destabilization of F-actin enhances insulin secretion, whereas its stabilization inhibits insulin secretion (Orci et al., 1972Orci L. Gabbay K.H. Malaisse W.J. Pancreatic beta-cell web: its possible role in insulin secretion.Science. 1972; 175: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that dense cortical F-actin limits access of insulin secretory granules to the plasma membrane. However, since complete F-actin depolymerization inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Li et al., 1994Li G. Rungger-Brandle E. Just I. Jonas J.C. Aktories K. Wollheim C.B. Effect of disruption of actin filaments by Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin on insulin secretion in HIT-T15 cells and pancreatic islets.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), certain actin filaments appear to be required for the secretory process. Because ephrin-A reverse signaling and EphA forward signaling, were shown to rearrange F-actin in several cell types (Marquardt et al., 2005Marquardt T. Shirasaki R. Ghosh S. Andrews S.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Pfaff S.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34008-34018Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we tested whether EphA5-Fc and ephrin-A5-Fc also changed the F-actin state of mouse insulinoma cells (Figures 5A–5E). We found that EphA5-Fc resulted in F-actin rearrangements with a subtle decrease in F-actin intensity under basal conditions (compare Figures 5A and 5B), consistent with its stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. In contrast, ephrin-A5-Fc increased F-actin polymerization in nonconfluent clusters of MIN6 cells under basal and stimulatory conditions (compare Figures 5C and 5D), consistent with its inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. EphAs modulate activity of Rac1, a Rho-GTPase involved in F-actin remodeling and endocytosis (Marston et al., 2003Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D.

Since Rac1 is also involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Kowluru and Veluthakal, 2005Kowluru A. Veluthakal R.

Metab. 2004; 286: E818-E827Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we investigated whether EphA5-Fc and ephrin-A5-Fc modulated Rac1 activity in confluent MIN6 cells. In line with previous reports (Kowluru and Veluthakal, 2005Kowluru A. Veluthakal R. Rho guanosine diphosphate-dissociation inhibitor plays a negative modulatory role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3523-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2004Li J.

Metab. 2004; 286: E818-E827Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), glucose stimulation significantly enhanced Rac1 activity (Fc; Figures 5F and 5G). Consistent with its stimulatory effects on insulin secretion, we found that EphA5-Fc stimulated Rac1 activity (compare Fc with EphA5-Fc in Figure 5G), whereas, consistent with its inhibitory effect on insulin secretion, ephrin-A5-Fc inhibited Rac1 activity (compare Fc with ephrin-A5-Fc in Figure 5G). In addition, both EphA5-Fc and ephrin-A5-Fc required Rac1 activity for their effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (compare DN-Rac1 with empty vector in Figure 5H). Since Eph-ephrin signaling was shown to affect connexin localization and gap junction communication (Davy et al., 2006Davy A. Bush J.O. Soriano P. Inhibition of gap junction communication at ectopic Eph/ephrin boundaries underlies craniofrontonasal syndrome.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e315https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040315Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Mellitzer et al., 1999Mellitzer G. Xu Q. Wilkinson D.G. Eph receptors and ephrins restrict cell intermingling and communication.Nature. 1999; 400: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether connexin-36, the gap junction protein of β cells (Ravier et al., 2005Ravier M.A. Guldenagel M. Charollais A. Gjinovci A. Caille D. Sohl G. Wollheim C.B. Willecke K. Henquin J.C. Meda P. Loss of connexin36 channels alters beta-cell coupling, islet synchronization of glucose-induced Ca2+ and insulin oscillations, and basal insulin release.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was required for the effects of Eph-ephrin signaling on insulin secretion (Figure S6). We showed that the stimulatory effect of EphA5-Fc required connexin-36 (compare Fc with EphA5-Fc in Figure S6C), whereas an inhibitory effect of ephrin-A5-Fc was still detected in the absence of this gap junction protein (compare Fc with ephrin-A5-Fc in Figure S6C). Taken together, these results show that EphA-ephrin-A-signaling events affect several β cell components required for regulating insulin secretion: F-actin, Rac1, and connexin-36. We then investigated the hypotheses that, under basal conditions, EphA forward signaling was active in order to suppress insulin secretion (Figure 6A) and that glucose stimulation attenuated EphA forward signaling by EphA dephosphorylation, thus allowing predominance of ephrin-A reverse signaling with a stimulatory outcome for insulin secretion (Figure 6B). Supporting this hypothesis, EphA5 phosphorylation levels were higher at a low glucose concentration (2 mM) compared to all depicted time points after glucose stimulation (25 mM; Figures 6C and 6D). In islets, the presence of phosphorylated EphA5 decreased shortly after glucose stimulation (Figure 6C). However, when the islets were brought back to low glucose concentration, EphA5 phosphorylation reached basal levels again (Figure 6C). As with islets, the amount of phosphorylated EphA5 in MIN6 cells decreased shortly after glucose stimulation (Figure 6D), and bringing back glucose-stimulated MIN6 cells to a low glucose concentration fully restored basal EphA5 phosphorylation (Figure 6D). We also noticed that ephrin-A5-Fc significantly increased EphA5 p"

Locations and morphologic characteristics of this gravel indicate that Itokawa has experienced considerable vibrations, which have triggered global-scale granular processes in its dry, vacuum, microgravity environment. These processes likely include granular convection, landslide-like granular migrations, and particle sorting, resulting in the segregation of the fine gravels into areas of potential lows. Granular processes become major resurfacing processes because of Itokawa's small size, implying that they can occur on other small asteroids should those have regolith."

Previously these two modes were thought to be distinct, yet we show that high incubation temperatures reverse genotypic males (ZZ) to phenotypic females in a lizard with ZZ and ZW sex chromosomes. Thus, the W chromosome is not necessary for female differentiation. Sex determination is probably via a dosage-sensitive male-determining gene on the Z chromosome that is inactivated by extreme temperatures. Our data invite a novel hypothesis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and suggest that sex chromosomes may exist in many TSD reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2026361605,"A variety of molecules in human blood have been implicated in the inhibition of HIV-1. However, it remained elusive which circulating natural compounds are most effective in controlling viral replication in vivo. To identify natural HIV-1 inhibitors we screened a comprehensive peptide library generated from human hemofiltrate. The most potent fraction contained a 20-residue peptide, designated VIRUS-INHIBITORY PEPTIDE (VIRIP), corresponding to the C-proximal region of alpha1-antitrypsin, the most abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor. We found that VIRIP inhibits a wide variety of HIV-1 strains including those resistant to current antiretroviral drugs. Further analysis demonstrated that VIRIP blocks HIV-1 entry by interacting with the gp41 fusion peptide and showed that a few amino acid changes increase its antiretroviral potency by two orders of magnitude. Thus, as a highly specific natural inhibitor of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptide, VIRIP may lead to the development of another class of antiretroviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2152116743,"Introduction of disulfide bonds into proteins entering the secretory pathway is catalyzed by Ero1p, which generates disulfide bonds de novo, and Pdi1p, which transfers disulfides to substrate proteins. A sufficiently oxidizing environment must be maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to allow for disulfide formation, but a pool of reduced thiols is needed for isomerization of incorrectly paired disulfides. We have found that hyperoxidation of the ER is prevented by attenuation of Ero1p activity through noncatalytic cysteine pairs. Deregulated Ero1p mutants lacking certain cysteines show increased enzyme activity, a decreased lag phase in kinetic assays, and growth defects in vivo. We hypothesize that noncatalytic cysteine pairs in Ero1p sense the level of potential substrates in the ER and correspondingly modulate Ero1p activity as part of a homeostatic regulatory system governing the thiol-disulfide balance in the ER."

It is unclear whether the self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic SC (ESC) and of tissue-specific adult SC such as hematopoietic SC (HSC) is controlled by common mechanisms.

These studies identify Zfx as a shared transcriptional regulator of ESC and HSC, suggesting a common genetic basis of self-renewal in embryonic and adult SC. The development and function of multicellular organisms are based on the activity of stem cells (SC). During early embryonic development, pluripotent stem cells give rise to all cell types in the body, including the germline (Boiani and Scholer, 2005Boiani M. Scholer H.R. Regulatory networks in embryo-derived pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In the adult, tissue homeostasis is maintained by multipotent adult stem cells, which continuously generate cell lineages comprising a given tissue. In adult mammals, SC have been identified in many tissues and organs, including the hematopoietic system, brain, skin, and intestine (Weissman et al., 2001Weissman I.L. Anderson D.J. Gage F. Stem and progenitor cells: origins, phenotypes, lineage commitments, and transdifferentiations.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Whereas the precise differentiation potential varies between different SC types, all SC share the fundamental property of self-renewal, i.e., the maintenance of their number and identity in an undifferentiated state. Embryonic stem cells (ESC) can be derived from pluripotent cells of the blastocyst inner cell mass and propagated in vitro as continuous clonal lines (Chambers and Smith, 2004Chambers I. Smith A. Self-renewal of teratocarcinoma and embryonic stem cells.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These ESC lines are capable of unlimited growth in culture while retaining their undifferentiated state and full developmental potential. Murine ESC are typically cultured on fibroblast feeder cells with serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that activates the essential gp130/Stat3 signaling pathway. Combined with LIF, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) support unlimited ESC self-renewal in the absence of serum or feeders (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). The pluripotency of ESC is regulated by a unique network of ESC-specific transcription factors including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and their binding partners (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L.

Indeed, a defined combination of Oct4, Sox2, and other transcription factors is sufficient to derive ESC-like pluripotent cells from mouse fibroblasts (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17010) Google Scholar). In addition, a distinct genetic pathway regulating ESC self-renewal involves transcription factors Tbx3 and Esrrb and a signaling cofactor Tcl1 (Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Among adult SC types, one of the best characterized is the blood-producing hematopoietic SC (HSC) of the adult bone marrow (BM) (Kondo et al., 2003Kondo M. Wagers A.J. Manz M.G. Prohaska S.S. Scherer D.C. Beilhack G.F. Shizuru J.A. Weissman I.L. Biology of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors: Implications for clinical application.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 759-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). These cells sustain hematopoiesis throughout adult life and are capable of clonal, long-term hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated recipients after serial transplantation. HSC are localized in a distinct structural and functional compartment in the BM, the HSC niche, which provides critical signals supporting HSC self-renewal (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Osteoblastic cells regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L.

Feng J.Q. et al.Identification of the haematopoietic stem cell niche and control of the niche size.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). Upon differentiation, the bona fide long-term repopulating HSC rapidly lose their self-renewal potential, producing a hierarchy of multipotent short-term HSC and/or multilineage progenitors, common lymphoid and myeloid progenitors, and lineage-committed precursors. In the adult mouse BM, all HSC activity is contained in the rare (<0.1%) lineage marker (Lin)−Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cell subset, which can be further subdivided to define the homogeneous long-term HSC population. The self-renewal of adult HSC is regulated by several broadly expressed transcription factors including Bmi-1 (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Bmi-1 determines the proliferative capacity of normal and leukaemic stem cells.Nature. 2003; 423: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2003Park I.K. Qian D. Kiel M.

Although both ESC and adult SC are capable of unlimited self-renewal, their cellular and molecular features are strikingly different. First, ESC can self-renew in defined culture conditions in vitro, whereas the self-renewal of adult SC typically depends on their in vivo niche (Li and Xie, 2005Li L. Xie T. Stem cell niche: structure and function.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 605-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ESC are highly proliferative and exhibit unusual features of cell-cycle control, such as the lack of a G1 checkpoint (Burdon et al., 2002Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Signalling, cell cycle and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In contrast, a cardinal feature of adult SC is their low proliferation rate (Li and Xie, 2005Li L. Xie T. Stem cell niche: structure and function.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 605-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic manipulations that increase HSC proliferation lead to HSC exhaustion and eventual failure (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T.

In view of these fundamental differences between ESC and various adult SC, a major unresolved question is whether their self-renewal is regulated by common genes and/or pathways (Eckfeldt et al., 2005Eckfeldt C.E. Mendenhall E.M. Verfaillie C.M. The molecular repertoire of the “almighty” stem cell.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Deconstructing stemness.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2715-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such “stemness” genes have been postulated on the basis of global expression analysis of different SC populations (Ivanova et al., 2002Ivanova N.B. Dimos J.T. Schaniel C. Hackney J.A. Moore K.A. Lemischka I.R. A stem cell molecular signature.Science. 2002; 298: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, Ramalho-Santos et al., 2002Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. “Stemness”: transcriptional profiling of embryonic and adult stem cells.Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar); however, they remain to be reconciled between different studies and verified in functional assays (Sakaguchi et al., 2006Sakaguchi T. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Iwama A. Morita Y. Iwamori N. Nakauchi H. Kiyonari H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A.

Biol. 2006; 26: 6557-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other studies emphasized the lack of a common gene expression program in ESC and adult SC (D'Amour and Gage, 2003D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H.

Zfx is a zinc finger protein of the Zfy family, whose members are highly conserved in vertebrates. Mammalian Zfx is encoded on the X chromosome and contains an acidic transcriptional activation domain (AD), a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of 13 C2H2-type zinc fingers (Schneider-Gadicke et al., 1989Schneider-Gadicke A.

A targeted mutation of murine Zfx resulted in partially penetrant neonatal lethality and hypofertility in surviving females (Luoh et al., 1997Luoh S.W. Bain P.A. Polakiewicz R.D. Goodheart M.L. Gardner H. Jaenisch R. Page D.C. Zfx mutation results in small animal size and reduced germ cell number in male and female mice.Development. 1997; 124: 2275-2284PubMed Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the targeting created a hypomorphic Zfx allele could not be ruled out. Recently, two microarray-based expression studies suggested that Zfx might be expressed at elevated levels in several SC types (Fortunel et al., 2003Fortunel N.O. Otu H.H. Ng H.H. Chen J. Mu X. Chevassut T. Li X. Joseph M. Bailey C. Hatzfeld J.A. et al.Comment on “‘Stemness’: transcriptional profiling of embryonic and adult stem cells” and “A stem cell molecular signature.”.Science. 2003; 302: 371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ramalho-Santos et al., 2002Ramalho-Santos M.

Melton D.A. “Stemness”: transcriptional profiling of embryonic and adult stem cells.Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate the role of Zfx in SC function. Here, we use conditional gene targeting to examine the role of murine Zfx in two prototypical SC types, ESC and adult HSC. We report that Zfx is required for the self-renewal of both SC types, whereas it is dispensable for the growth and differentiation of their progeny. These results establish Zfx as a shared transcriptional regulator of embryonic and adult SC, suggesting a common molecular basis of SC self-renewal. To confirm the elevated expression of Zfx in SC, we measured Zfx levels in SC by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As shown in Figure 1A, the expression of Zfx was twice as high in HSC and in undifferentiated ESC compared to their respective differentiated progeny. To test the function of Zfx in SC, we generated a conditional LoxP-flanked (“floxed”) allele of murine Zfx by homologous recombination in ESC (Figure 1B and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Cre-mediated recombination of the only Zfxflox allele in male Zfxflox/y cells produced Zfxnull allele, which did not encode a detectable protein product (Figure 1C). Embryos with germline Zfx deletion developed normally until 9.5 d.p.c. and subsequently died due to extraembryonic tissue abnormalities (data not shown). The embryos with Zfx deletion in the embryo proper died neonatally but were grossly normal at 18.5 d.p.c., with Zfxnull cells contributing extensively to all tissues (Figure S2). Similarly, a nearly complete deletion of Zfx in the absence of obvious abnormalities was observed in embryos and newborns with early brain- or hematopoietic-specific Zfx deletion (Figure S2). These data suggest that Zfx is dispensable for cell growth and differentiation of most tissues in vivo. To analyze the growth of Zfx-deficient ESC, we transiently induced Cre recombination in Zfxflox ESC and cultured the resulting mixture of recombined (Zfxnull) and unrecombined ESC in the conditions favoring self-renewal (serum/LIF/feeders). As shown in Figure 2A, Zfxnull ESC were rapidly out-competed by Zfxflox cells and disappeared after two passages. In contrast, Zfxnull cells persisted when ESC were allowed to differentiate in the absence of LIF/feeders. Moreover, a similar competition assay revealed normal growth of Zfx-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), confirming a specific role of Zfx in undifferentiated ESC. To further characterize the phenotype of Zfx-deficient ESC, we derived clonal Zfxnull ESC lines and then stably re-expressed Zfx in these cells (Figure 2B). The resulting Zfxnull ESC remained undifferentiated, as judged by the expression of ESC marker alkaline phosphatase (Figure 2C) and key ESC regulators Nanog and Oct4 (Suppl. Figure S3). Nevertheless, all Zfxnull clones (n = 10) exhibited abnormal colony morphology, reduced clonogenic capacity, slower growth and spontaneous apoptosis in serum/LIF (Figures 2C–2E). The impaired self-renewal of Zfxnull ESC was particularly evident in serum-free culture with LIF and BMP4, in which Zfxnull clones failed to expand and collapsed after two to three passages (Figure 2F). During the initial growth in serum-free culture, Zfxnull cells underwent massive apoptosis as revealed by increased proportion of Annexin V-positive and hypodiploid cells (Figures 2G and S3). Notably, nearly all (9/10) Zfxnull ESC clones reconstituted with Zfx (Zfxnull + Zfx) regained normal morphology and vigorous growth (Figures 2C, 2D, 2F, and 2G). These data demonstrate a specific and reversible defect in the growth and survival of undifferentiated Zfx-deficient ESC. In contrast to their impaired self-renewal, the differentiation capacity of Zfx-deficient ESC was intact. When injected into mice, Zfxnull ESC efficiently produced teratomas containing differentiated tissues from the three germinal layers (Figure 3A). Despite the low efficiency of chimera formation after blastocyst injection, Zfxnull ESC contributed to the majority of adult tissues in chimeric mice, including the germline (Figure 3B). The lack of contribution to the thymus and BM is consistent with the essential role of Zfx in adult hematopoiesis (see below). Furthermore, Zfxnull ESC clones grew normally in short-term differentiation cultures without LIF (Figures 3C and 3D) and expressed appropriate differentiation markers (Figure S3). Finally, Zfxnull ESC efficiently formed embryoid bodies (EB) that expressed the expected markers of hematopoietic differentiation (Keller, 2005Keller G. Embryonic stem cell differentiation: emergence of a new era in biology and medicine.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) such as β-globin and Flk-1 (Figures 3D and 3E, and data not shown). These results suggest that the loss of Zfx impairs the self-renewal of undifferentiated ESC but does not affect their developmental potential or the growth of their differentiated progeny. In the course of these experiments, we noticed that ESC clones expressing higher levels of Zfx (Zfxnull + Zfx∗, Figure 2B) were less prone to differentiation. In short-term differentiation culture without LIF, Zfx-overexpressing ESC grew better than Zfxnull or Zfxflox ESC (Figure 3C) and retained undifferentiated phenotype (Figure 3D), followed by massive cell death after replating. Furthermore, Zfxnull + Zfx∗ ESC generated small EB without cavities, which lost the pluripotency marker Nanog but failed to express hematopoietic differentiation marker β-globin (Figures 3D and 3E). Finally, Zfx-overexpressing ESC failed to efficiently generate teratomas or mouse chimeras (data not shown). Thus, overexpression of Zfx appears to facilitate ESC self-renewal in suboptimal conditions and to oppose ESC differentiation, the phenotype complementary to the loss of Zfx. Altogether, these data establish Zfx as a critical and specific regulator of ESC self-renewal. To examine the role of Zfx in adult hematopoiesis, we generated Mx1-Cre+Zfxflox/y conditional knockout (CKO) mice, in which Cre-mediated Zfx deletion is induced by interferonogen pI·C (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Two weeks after induction, total numbers of BM cells and of c-Kit+ Sca-1− myeloid progenitors were unaffected in CKO mice, whereas the HSC-containing LSK population was significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased (Figure 4A). Time course analysis revealed a progressive loss of the HSC at 2–5 weeks after induction, resulting in the decreased ratio of HSC to c-Kit+ Sca-1− myeloid progenitors (Figure 4B). The fractions of erythroid and myeloid differentiated cells were normal, while lymphocytes were initially depleted by pI·C treatment and failed to regenerate in the CKO BM (Figure S4). A similar loss of the LSK population was observed after Zfx deletion induced by tamoxifen-activated Cre construct (R26-CreER, Figure S5), ruling out potential side effects of pI·C injection. The consequences of constitutive Zfx deletion in hematopoietic cells were analyzed using the Tie2-Cre strain, in which pan-hematopoietic Cre recombination is initiated in the early embryo (Koni et al., 2001Koni P.A. Joshi S.K. Temann U.A. Olson D. Burkly L. Flavell R.A. Conditional vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 deletion in mice: impaired lymphocyte migration to bone marrow.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Zfx deletion was inefficient in most adult CKO mice, suggesting a strong selection against Zfxnull cells in adult hematopoiesis. Indeed, the rare adult CKO mice with a complete Zfx deletion (n = 5) showed the same specific loss of the HSC population (Figure 4C). In contrast, the CKO fetal livers were uniformly Zfxnull (Figure S2), exhibited normal cellularity and contained only a slightly reduced fraction of HSC (Figure 4C). Furthermore, primitive hematopoiesis in the yolk sac of Zfxnull embryos was normal (Figure S6). Thus, the absence of Zfx abolishes the maintenance of adult BM HSC under steady-state conditions but largely spares embryonic hematopoiesis. Further analysis of the HSC/progenitor compartment in induced Mx1-Cre CKO mice (Figure 4D) and in Tie2-Cre CKO mice (Figure S7) confirmed the loss of Flt3− LSK subset that contains the self-renewing long-term HSC. In addition, the Flt3+ LSK population containing short-term HSC and c-Kitlow Flt3+ lymphoid progenitors including IL-7Rα+ common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) were severely reduced (Figures 4D, S4, S5, and S7). The HSC in induced Mx1-Cre+ CKO mice proliferated normally, did not show increased egress from the BM, and displayed normal homing to and lodging in the BM after adoptive transfer (Figure S8). On the other hand, Zfx-deficient HSC showed a significant (p = 0.0002) increase in Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells (Figure 4E). In contrast, the Lin− Sca-1− c-Kit+ erythromyeloid progenitors were present in normal numbers, contained common and lineage-restricted subsets (Figure 4D), did not show increased apoptosis (Figure 4E), and maintained their characteristically high proliferation rate (Figure S8). Indeed, control and CKO BM generated similar numbers of erythroid and myeloid colonies in short-term colony-forming assays (Figure 4F). These observations suggest that Zfx is required for the long-term survival of HSC but is dispensable in erythromyeloid progenitors. Consistent with the defective maintenance of Zfx-deficient HSC, the BM from induced Mx1-Cre CKO mice failed to contribute to hematopoiesis in competitively reconstituted BM recipients (Figures 5A and 5B). To measure the maintenance of HSC independent of their homing or engraftment, we induced the loss of Zfx in pre-established BM chimeric mice (Mikkola et al., 2003Mikkola H.K. Klintman J. Yang H. Hock H. Schlaeger T.M. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Haematopoietic stem cells retain long-term repopulating activity and multipotency in the absence of stem-cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene.Nature. 2003; 421: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1+ CD45.2+) were transplanted with a mixture of donor BM from uninduced Mx1-Cre+ CKO or control mice (CD45.2+) and competitor wild-type BM (CD45.1+). Four weeks later, chimeric mice were injected with pI·C to induce Zfx loss in the engrafted CKO BM, and the fraction of donor-derived peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was subsequently monitored (Figure 5C). In contrast to all control recipient groups, the pI·C-injected recipients of CKO BM manifested a sharp decline of donor-derived PBL (Figures 5D and 5E). The endpoint analysis 6 months after induction confirmed the virtual absence of Zfx-deficient donor cells in all hematopoietic cell types, including the HSC-containing LSK subset (Figure 5F). These results demonstrate at the functional level that Zfx is absolutely required for the long-term HSC maintenance. To identify Zfx target genes in SC, we compared global expression profiles of control and Zfx-deficient ESC and HSC. Several genes that were affected by Zfx loss in both ESC and HSC were identified, including 5 downregulated genes (6 probes, p = 0.0075) and 20 upregulated genes (22 probes, p = 7 × 10−8) (Figure 6A and Table S1). In the latter group, a more permissive analysis suggested several additional candidates. By qPCR (Figure 6B and Table S2), four downregulated genes (6720467C03Rik, AV340375, Phca, and Retsat) and six upregulated genes (Procr, Pkia, Ier3, Cryab, Gem, and Ptgs2) were validated as differentially expressed, revealing a common expression signature of Zfx-deficient ESC and HSC. The predicted regulatory regions of commonly downregulated genes contain multiple potential binding sites for Zfx (Figure S9). To analyze the binding of Zfx to these genomic regions in live SC, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of epitope-tagged Zfx expressed in Zfxnull ESC (Zfxnull + ZfxTAG, Figure S10). We found that promoter regions of 6720467C03Rik, AV340375 and Retsat were significantly enriched in ChIP with anti-tag antibodies; in contrast, no enrichment was seen in parental Zfxnull ESC that do not express tagged Zfx (Figure 6C). Finally, the expression of all three genes was increased in Zfx-overexpressing ESC clones (Table S2). These results suggest that genes commonly downregulated in Zfxnull ESC and HSC are direct targets of Zfx. Among the six genes coordinately upregulated in Zfx-deficient ESC and HSC, four (Cryab, Ier3, Gem, and Ptgs2) are known to be induced by stress, inflammatory stimuli and/or growth factors, with the latter three representing immediate-early genes. Therefore, their induction could be indirect and reflect the impaired function of Zfx-deficient SC. Indeed, four genes (Pkia, Cryab, Ier3, and Ptgs2) were upregulated in Zfxnull ESC and HSC, but not in their respective differentiated progeny (Figure 6D). Notably, three genes (Gem, Procr, and Pkia) display highly HSC-specific expression pattern (Ivanova et al., 2002Ivanova N.B. Dimos J.T. Schaniel C. Hackney J.A. Moore K.A. Lemischka I.R. A stem cell molecular signature.Science. 2002; 298: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar; and this study). The specific upregulation of Procr in Zfx-deficient HSC was confirmed by cell-surface staining for its product CD201 (Figure S11). Thus, the impaired self-renewal of Zfx-deficient ESC and HSC correlates with SC-specific upregulation of stress-inducible and/or immediate-early genes. To test whether Zfx controls genes and pathways specific only for a particular SC type, we analyzed known ESC-specific regulators of self-renewal. By protein staining (Figure S3), microarray analysis (Table S3), and qPCR (Figure 7A), the components of the Nanog/Oct4/Sox2 transcriptional network were only minimally affected in Zfxnull ESC. On the other hand, we observed the downregulation of several ESC-specific genes including Dub1/2, Ceacam1, and particularly Tbx3, which encodes a transcription factor required for ESC self-renewal (Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Further qPCR analysis showed that another ESC-specific regulator, Tcl1, was similarly reduced in Zfxnull ESC. Short-term batch culture of ESC after Cre-mediated Zfx deletion showed a prominent reduction of Tbx3 and a slight decrease of Tcl1, but not of Nanog (Figure 7B). Finally, Zfx-overexpressing ESC expressed higher levels of Tbx3 and Tcl1, whereas Nanog and Oct4 were unchanged (Figure 7C). The predicted promoter regions of Tbx3 and Tcl1 contain multiple consensus binding sites for Zfx (Figure S12). In the case of Tbx3, ChIP analysis localized the region of prominent Zfx binding to ∼0.5 Kb upstream of the transcription start site (Figure 7D). Indeed, the binding of Zfx to Tbx3 and Tcl1 promoters was detected only in Zfx-expressing Zfxnull + ZfxTAG ESC, but not in the parental Zfxnull ESC (Figure 7E). Finally, Zfx binding to Tbx3 promoter was observed in undifferentiated ESC but not in ESC differentiated without LIF, consistent with the rapid loss of Tbx3 expre"

Fatty acids are key components of the cell, and their synthesis is essential for all organisms except archaea. They are major constituents of cellular membranes and are used for posttranslational protein modifications that are functionally important. Saturated fatty acids are the main stores of chemical energy in organisms. Deregulation of fatty acid synthesis affects many cellular functions and may result in aberrant mitosis, cancer, and obesity (Kuhajda, 2006Kuhajda F.P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The de novo synthesis of fatty acids is carried out by fatty acid synthase (FAS), which catalyzes cycles of multistep chemical reactions that are essentially the same in all organisms. FAS uses one acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and seven malonyl-CoA molecules to synthesize the 16-carbon palmitic acid, the most abundant fatty acid in eukaryotes (Lynen, 1980Lynen F. On the structure of fatty acid synthetase of yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Despite the conserved reaction mechanisms, FAS systems are remarkably diverse and are divided into two types based on the organization of their catalytic units. Type I FASs are highly integrated multienzymes that contain all catalytic activities of the cyclic reaction as discrete domains on a single polypeptide chain (α) or on two different polypeptides (α and β). Type I FASs are further divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup is the animal FAS that is active as α2 homodimers (Smith et al., 2003Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Structural and functional organization of the animal fatty acid synthase.Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The second, microbial, subgroup comprises some bacterial type I FASs, which are α6 hexamers, and fungal FASs, which are α6β6 dodecamers (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Bacterial, plant, and mitochondrial FASs belong to the type II FAS systems, the components of which, in contrast to the type I, are small independent proteins. Each protein usually catalyzes a single step of the multistep cyclic reaction (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Yeast FAS, a member of the fungal type I FAS family, contains six copies of eight independent functional domains in an α6β6 molecular complex of 2.6 MDa. Each of the α and β subunits contains four functional domains (Fichtlscherer et al., 2000Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. A novel function of yeast fatty acid synthase. Subunit alpha is capable of self-pantetheinylation.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Mohamed et al., 1988Mohamed A.H. Chirala S.S. Mody N.H. Huang W.Y.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12315-12325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). These eight functional domains catalyze all reactions required for synthesis of fatty acids in yeast: activation, priming, multiple cycles of elongation, and termination. All these reactions occur in a limited space inside the α6β6 complex (Lynen, 1980Lynen F. On the structure of fatty acid synthetase of yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The activation of yeast FAS is achieved by its phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPT) domain located at the C terminus of the α subunit (Fichtlscherer et al., 2000Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. A novel function of yeast fatty acid synthase. Subunit alpha is capable of self-pantetheinylation.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PPT attaches the 18 Å 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (pantetheine arm) of CoA to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that is positioned at the N terminus of the α subunit (Figure 1A, reaction 1). ACP plays a central role in the entire synthesis process by shuttling among the catalytic centers of the FAS complex all of the substrate intermediates that remain covalently linked to the SH terminus of the pantetheine arm. The location of PPT and ACP on the same polypeptide chain is a unique feature of yeast FAS (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of yeast PPT has a low degree of similarity with those of other phosphopantetheinyl transferases (Lambalot et al., 1996Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. A new enzyme superfamily - the phosphopantetheinyl transferases.Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The priming reaction is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase (AT) domain located close to the N terminus of the β subunit. AT initiates fatty acid synthesis by loading the acetate primer from acetyl-CoA onto the SH group of the ACP pantetheine arm (Figure 1A, reaction 2). A unique characteristic of yeast FAS is the existence of a separate AT domain that has exclusive specificity for the priming substrate, acetyl-CoA, and discriminates against the elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA (Schuster et al., 1995Schuster H. Rautenstrauss B. Mittag M. Stratmann D. Schweizer E. Substrate and product binding sites of yeast fatty acid synthase. Stoichiometry and binding kinetics of wild-type and in vitro mutated enzymes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, animal type I FAS multienzymes use the same malonyl/acetyltransferase domain to load either the priming or the elongating substrate onto ACP (Smith et al., 2003Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Structural and functional organization of the animal fatty acid synthase.Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In bacterial type II FAS systems, the acetate primer is directly transferred from acetyl-CoA to the enzyme β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) that catalyzes the first condensation reaction in the chain elongation cycle (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Elongation cycles begin when ACP delivers the acetate primer to the active-site cysteine on the ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain located in the α subunit (Figure 1A, reaction 3). Subsequently, the empty ACP moves to the malonyl transacylase (MPT) domain located at the C terminus of the β subunit in order to acquire the malonyl group of the elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA (Figure 1A, reaction 4). ACP then delivers the bound malonate back to the KS domain for chain elongation. KS condenses its bound acyl group with the ACP-bound malonate to a 3-ketoacyl intermediate (Figure 1A, reaction 5). This two-carbon-longer 3-ketoacyl intermediate is then processed sequentially three times to produce the saturated fatty acid (Figure 1A, reactions 6–8). The ketoacyl reductase (KR) domain in the α subunit catalyzes the first step of substrate reduction, followed by a dehydration reaction catalyzed by the dehydratase (DH) domain in the β subunit. A second reduction reaction is catalyzed next by the enoyl reductase (ER) domain in the β subunit. ACP shuttles the reaction intermediates between active centers during processing and subsequently brings the processed acyl chain back to the KS domain for the next cycle of elongation (Figure 1A, reaction 3). Termination occurs when the length of the fatty acid chain reaches 16 or 18 carbons. The product, palmitic or stearic acid, is delivered by ACP from ER to the active center of MPT, where it is transferred to the SH group of CoA and then released (Figure 1A, reaction 9). This reaction is the second reaction catalyzed by MPT, which is therefore a malonyl/palmitoyl transacylase that catalyzes both the transfer of elongation substrates and the transfer of the final product (Lynen, 1980Lynen F. On the structure of fatty acid synthetase of yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most striking feature of fungal FAS is its high degree of architectural complexity, in which 48 functional centers exist in a single α6β6 particle. Detailed structural information is essential for delineating how this complex particle coordinates the reactions involved in many steps of synthesis of fatty acids. The structures of fungal FAS have been studied by immunoelectron microscopy (Wieland et al., 1978Wieland F. Siess E.A. Renner L. Verfurth C. Lynen F. Distribution of yeast fatty acid synthetase subunits: three-dimensional model of the enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 5792-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Kolodziej et al., 1996Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. Structure-function relationships of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid synthase. Three-dimensional structure.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and X-ray crystallography (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies show that the α6β6 fungal FAS forms a barrel-shaped hollow body separated at the equator by a wheel-like structure with three spokes. The 5 Å-resolution X-ray electron density map further allowed the placement of the known structures of the homologous bacterial enzymes that catalyze individual steps of the cyclic reactions, except for ACP and PPT (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have now determined the atomic structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS derived from two crystal forms of the enzyme that were obtained by a fortuitous accident. While attempting to crystallize the yeast 40S ribosomal subunit, we obtained instead these crystals of FAS, which cosediments at 40S with the small ribosomal subunit. Though the electron density maps are at only modestly high resolution (4 Å), their quality is superb due to 9-fold noncrystallographic averaging, thereby allowing us to enhance the visibility of side-chain electron density through sharpening to trace the entire polypeptide backbone (minus a few disordered regions) for both chains and to position 50% of the protein side chains. In contrast to the previous structural studies of fungal FAS (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we have now been able to observe that the ACP resides within the particle chamber, while unexpectedly, the activating PPT domain is observed to lie outside of the particle. The six α subunits form a central wheel in the assembly, and the β subunits form domes on the top and bottom of the wheel, creating six reaction chambers within which each ACP can reach the six active sites through surprisingly modest movements. This structure now provides a complete framework for understanding the structural basis of this macromolecular machine's important function. The crystal structure of the yeast S. cerevisiae fatty acid synthase was determined at 4 Å resolution from two crystal forms with space groups P21 and P43212, respectively (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method using the Cα coordinates of homologous domains that were previously placed in a low-resolution map of fungal FAS (Protein Data Bank ID code 2CDH) (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that these Cα atoms represent less than 5% of the total mass of the FAS particle, the model-based phases were dramatically improved by interactive cycles of 9-fold noncrystallographic averaging in the two crystal forms. The final electron density map is of exceptional quality, uncharacteristic of its 4 Å resolution, as judged by the appearance of electron density for many side chains (Figures 1B–1D). This allowed us to build with confidence a model that contains main-chain backbones for 1687 aa (out of 1887 aa) of the α subunit and all of the β subunit, as well as about 50% of the amino acid side chains. Our model of the 2.6 MDa α6β6 fatty acid synthase (Figure 2A; Movie S1) comprises all of the eight catalytic domains that are required for fatty acid synthesis, including ACP and PPT, which were previously unobserved (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). ACP is located inside the hollow particle and presumably moves within a limited space, which we call the reaction chamber. The active sites of the catalytic domains that are required for priming, elongation, and termination are embedded in the chamber walls facing inward. As a consequence of their spatial arrangement, only one unique set of six catalytic centers is accessed by a particular ACP domain. The overall interior of the FAS particle therefore contains six separate reaction chambers. Interestingly, the PPT domains, which activate ACP, lie outside the particle and are inaccessible to ACP because they are on the opposite side of the particle wall. The external position of the PPT domain has profound implications for the FAS activation mechanism and the assembly of the FAS particle, as described in the Discussion. The complex architecture of the FAS particle is maintained by structural domains and linkers that make up about half of the molecule (Figure 2B). These domains provide the framework that holds the particle together and orients the catalytic domains. Their sizes and complexity range from a simple loop or helix to large domain structures with distinctive folds. We used the Dali server (Holm and Park, 2000Holm L. Park J. DaliLite workbench for protein structure comparison.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) to search for proteins that have structures similar to these domains and found none. They consequentially represent new folds and may have evolved independently to tether and orient the multiple active centers of fungal FAS for efficient catalysis. The barrel-shaped FAS particle is separated into two halves by a wheel-like structure at the equator formed by the α subunits (Figure 2C). This central wheel consists exclusively of six α subunits and has a point-group symmetry of 32 (D3). The dome is formed by a trimer of β subunits that lie on each side of the α subunit wheel (Figure 2D). The two β trimers do not interact with each other and are only held together by interactions with the α subunits on the equator. The particle is 270 Å long and 230 Å wide at the equator, and its width tapers to 160 Å at the end of the barrel. The overall smooth exterior surface of the FAS particle is disrupted at the equator by three pairs of 30 Å protuberances (Figures 2A and 2C), each of which is composed of two PPT domains. The α subunit of yeast FAS is composed of four functional domains and two structural domains (SDα) that are positioned in the sequence in the following order: ACP, SD1α, KR, KS, SD2α, and PPT (Figure 3A). The catalytic domains are located at the “rim” and the protuberance of the central wheel, while the structural domains form the central scaffold that contains the “axle,” the “hub,” and the “spoke” of the wheel (Figure 2E). The central player in the reaction of fatty acid synthesis—ACP—lies at the N terminus of domain 1 (residues 137–305) and is located above the hub of the wheel inside the FAS reaction chamber (Figure 2C and Figure 3B). This domain is composed of eight α helices and is divided into two subdomains. The ACP subdomain (residues 147–217) lies close to the periphery of the wheel, and the second subdomain, a four-helix bundle, is positioned near the center axle. The structure of the ACP subdomain is similar to that of decanoyl-ACP of Escherichia coli (Roujeinikova et al., 2007Roujeinikova A. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. Slabas A.R. Structural studies of fatty acyl-(acyl carrier protein) thioesters reveal a hydrophobic binding cavity that can expand to fit longer substrates.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365 (Published online September 23, 2006): 135-145https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2006.09.049Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C; Table S2). In our structure, ACP interacts with a KS dimer at the dimer interface via the N terminus of the ACP helix α2, which is a conserved region known to be important for ACP to interact with the catalytic domains of type II FAS (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang Y.M. Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. The application of computational methods to explore the diversity and structure of bacterial fatty acid synthase.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This region of ACP contains Ser180, which was identified biochemically to be the active site (Mohamed et al., 1988Mohamed A.H. Chirala S.S. Mody N.H. Huang W.Y. Wakil S.J. Primary structure of the multifunctional alpha subunit protein of yeast fatty acid synthase derived from FAS2 gene sequence.J. Biol.

The palmityl binding sites of fatty acid synthetase from yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Cα atom of Ser180 faces the deep cavity of the KS active site and lies about 18 Å from the Cα atom of the KS catalytic residue Cys1305. This distance is about the length of the pantetheine arm, and, therefore, the observed ACP is presumably in an active conformation. In addition, the second subdomain of domain 1 interacts with the hub of the central wheel. There is no electron density in the map for the N-terminal 136 residues and for about 60 residues that follow domain 1. Presumably these residues form a flexible region that allows ACP to move inside the chamber and reach the reaction centers. The striking architecture of the internal core of the central wheel is formed by two structural domains from six α subunits (Figure 2E). The first structural domain (SD1α, residues 360–420) is an L-shaped helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that forms the axle and spoke of the central wheel. The N-terminal helix of SD1α is perpendicular to the plane of the wheel with three helices coiled above the plane and three below. These two inversely oriented trimers surround the 3-fold axis and comprise the axle at the center (Figure 2E). The C-terminal helix takes a sharp turn of about 90°, and three pairs of helices form the three spokes of the wheel (Figure 2E). The second structural domain of the α subunit (SD2α, residues 1110–1173) is an insertion in the C terminus of KS. SD2α extends toward the FAS center via a two-stranded arm. The core fold of the domain comprises a three-stranded β sheet packed against an α helix. Two SD2αs dimerize by pairing their β sheets side by side, thereby forming a six-stranded β sheet. They are located between spokes and around the axle and form the hub of the wheel (Figure 2E). The KR domain (residues 680–940) forms the core of domain 3 (residues 420–970; Figure 3D). The KR domain has all characteristics of the adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) binding Rossmann-fold domains (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and superimposes well on that of the β-ketoacyl carrier protein reductase of Brassica napus (Fisher et al., 2000Fisher M. Kroon J.T. Martindale W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B.

The Ser-Tyr-Lys triad residues shown previously to be involved in the catalysis and substrate binding in bacterial homologs (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) are identified in the KR active site to be residues Ser827, Tyr839, and Lys843 from our structural and sequence alignments (Figure 3D). The KS domain (domain 4, residues 1015–1109 and 1074–1661) has a thiolase fold (Figure 3E). The topology of the core of this domain is homologous to that of the bacterial counterpart of KS, which is the β-ketoacyl synthase I (KAS I) (Olsen et al., 1999Olsen J.G. Kadziola A. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Siggaard-Andersen M. Lindquist Y. Larsen S. The X-ray crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase I.FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 46-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Table S2; Figure S1B). Our structural and sequence alignments show that the KS residues Cys1305, His1542, and His1583 correspond to the catalytic triad of the KAS I/II family of condensing enzymes (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and Phe1395 corresponds to the invariant phenylalanine of the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket in KAS I (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang Y.M. White S.W. Rock C.O. Inhibiting bacterial fatty acid synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17541-17544Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The PPT domain (domain 6, residues 1747–1887) lies at the C terminus of the α subunit (Figure 3A). The PPT domain is structurally homologous to its bacterial counterpart, Bacillus subtilis acyl carrier protein synthase (AcpS) (Parris et al., 2000Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S.

The superimposition of the PPT and AcpS structures reveals that the conserved amino acid residues of yeast PPT (Lambalot et al., 1996Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. A new enzyme superfamily - the phosphopantetheinyl transferases.Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) are located in the α subunit protuberance near a dimer interface (Figure 2C and Figure 3F). This interface is composed of two pairs of long antiparallel helices (sr2) (Figures 3A and 3E), which separate two PPT domains and prevent the formation of a CoA binding site observed in the AcpS trimer (Parris et al., 2000Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S.

This suggests that the PPT domains are in an inactive conformation in the assembled yeast FAS particle. The β subunit of yeast FAS is composed of four functional domains and four structural domains (SDβ) in the following order: SD1β, AT, ER, SD2β, SD3β, DH, SD4β, and MPT (Figure 4A). Unlike the structural domains in the α subunit, which are small and rely on multimerization to form unique domains, those in the β subunit are large, distinctive domains that function individually. Domain 1 (SD1β, residues 1–136) lies at the N terminus of the β subunit and forms a trimer interface around the 3-fold axis on the apices of the FAS barrel structure (Figure 2D). Previously, SD1β was interpreted to be the PPT domain of the α subunit (Jenni et al., 2006Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of a fungal fatty acid synthase at 5 A resolution.Science. 2006; 311: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our electron density map of yeast FAS unambiguously identifies this region as being the N terminus of the β subunit. Two domains exhibiting a similar fold are located on opposite ends of the β subunit. The first is the AT domain (domain 2, residues 155–547), which uses exclusively acetyl-CoA as a substrate, is located just after SDβ1 (Figure 4A), and exists only in fungal FAS I systems. The second is the MPT domain (domain 8, residues 1616–2051) located at the C terminus of the β subunit (Figure 4A). Both domains have an α/β-hydrolase fold as a core structure as well as an insertion of a smaller ferredoxin-like subdomain (Figures 4B and 4C). They are structurally homologous to E. coli malonyl transacylase (FabD) (Oefner et al., 2006Oefner C. Schulz H. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E.

Ultrafast electron crystallography with the use of a tilted optical geometry technique afforded the necessary atomic-scale spatial and temporal resolutions. The observed transient behavior displays a notable “structural isosbestic” point and a threshold effect for the dependence of c -axis expansion (Δ c ) on fluence ( F ), with Δ c / F = 0.02 angstrom/(millijoule per square centimeter).

Rather, both the boundary between two-cell blastomeres and the E-Ab axis of the blastocyst align relative to the ellipsoidal shape of the zona pellucida (ZP), an extraembryonic structure. Lack of correlation between cell lineage and the E-Ab axis can be explained by the rotation of the embryo within the ZP."

Such questions include the evolution of photosynthesis and multicellularity, the developmental genetic changes responsible for alterations in body plan, and the origin of important plant innovations such as roots, leaves, and vascular tissue. As more plant genome sequences become available, researchers are increasingly using comparative genomics to address some of the major questions in plant biology. Such questions include the evolution of photosynthesis and multicellularity, the developmental genetic changes responsible for alterations in body plan, and the origin of important plant innovations such as roots, leaves, and vascular tissue. All plants are descended from a single eukaryotic ancestor that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterium as an endosymbiont (the ancestral plastid). The acquisition of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont was a momentous event in the evolution of life on Earth leading to a shift of most primary production from prokaryotic cyanobacteria to photosynthetic eukaryotes. Although the endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium was a singular event in the history of life, plastids have also been transmitted horizontally to other eukaryotic lineages via secondary endosymbiotic events where unrelated eukaryotes acquired endosymbiotic plants. There are five or so eukaryotic lineages, one of which is plants (Keeling et al., 2005Keeling P.J. Burger G. Durnford D.G. Lang B.F. Lee R.W. Pearlman R.E. Roger A.J. Gray M.W. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2005; 20: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Within the plants, three distinct groups have been identified (Figure 1): the glaucophytes (little-known freshwater algae), rhodophytes (red algae), and the green plants (which include green algae and land plants). The rhodophytes are primarily marine algae and include reef-building coralline algae; they provide a source of agar and form the basis of the billion-dollar nori industry in Japan. The green plants, by far the most diverse of the three groups, comprise two major clades: the chlorophytes (freshwater and marine algae) and the streptophytes (including the paraphyletic charophycean freshwater algae and the land plants). It was the land plants (embryophytes) that colonized and eventually dominated terrestrial landscapes and whose evolution allowed the subsequent colonization of land by the metazoans. Plastid genome sequences are available for species in all major lineages of plants, and nuclear genome sequences have been determined for a red alga, two chlorophytes, and three distinct lineages of land plants. Here, we highlight some of the major evolutionary transitions in the evolution of land plants and some key questions that are beginning to be addressed by comparing genome sequences from a diverse range of plant species. Following the capture of a cyanobacterium by the plant ancestor, the evolution of the endosymbiont genome was characterized by wholesale transfer of genetic material to the host nuclear genome, resulting in a reduction in the endosymbiont genome and an enrichment of the host nuclear genome. Plastid genome sequences are available from all major plant lineages, and perhaps surprisingly, the plastid genomes from all lineages are similar in size and gene content. The plastids of the glaucophytes (called cyanelles) still retain a peptidoglycan cell wall characteristic of the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont and yet have genomes similar to those of other plants. The continuing nuclear bombardment of plastid-derived DNA is thought to have contributed significantly to the genome content of plants, with as much as 18% of the genome of the model flowering plant (angiosperm) Arabidopsis thaliana thought to have been derived from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont (Martin et al., 2002Martin W. Rujan T. Richly E. Hansen A. Cornelsen S. Lins T. Leister D. Stoebe B. Hasegawa M. Penny D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12246-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The contribution of cyanobacterial genes to algal nuclear genomes has not been analyzed in detail, but substantial differences might have contributed to differing genomic trajectories in the major plant lineages. There are three plant species for which almost complete genome information for nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondrion is available: the red alga Cyanidioshyzon merolae, the marine prasinophycean green alga Ostreococcus tauri, and the chlorophycean green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Table 1). These unicellular algae are ideal models for cell biology because the cells are monoplastidic, with C. merolae and O. tauri cells also containing only a single mitochondrion and Golgi body, the division of which can be synchronized. C. merolae lives in acidic hot springs but can be grown in culture. Its genome is compact with most genes lacking introns (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Misumi O. Shin-I T. Maruyama S. Takahara M. Miyagishima S. Mori T. Nishida K. Yagisawa F. Nishida K. et al.Nature. 2004; 428: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The phytoplankton O. tauri is a picoeukaryote comprising cells that are about the size of prokaryotes (about 1 μm in diameter). Its genome is similarly compact with an average spacing of only 197 basepairs between genes (Derelle et al., 2006Derelle E. Ferraz C. Rombauts S. Rouze P. Worden A.Z. Robbens S. Partensky F. Degroeve S. Echeynié S. Cooke R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11647-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). One remarkable feature of the O. tauri genome is its extreme heterogeneity with 2 chromosomes differing from the other 18 in GC content and transposable element distribution, suggesting horizontal acquisition of at least one of its chromosomes. In contrast, the C. reinhardtii genome is larger and contains more genes. A comparative genomics study using the Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis, and human genomes facilitated the identification of genes involved in flagellar development and function in both Chlamydomonas and humans, including genes involved in human disease (angiosperms lack the flagellated sperm found in many other organisms) (Li et al., 2004Li J.B. Gerdes J.M. Haycraft C.J. Fan Y. Teslovich T.M. May-Simera H. Li H. Blacque O.E. Li L. Leitch C.C. et al.Cell. 2004; 117: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii is a sophisticated model for investigating photosynthesis and fundamental cell biology with tools available for transformation of all three genomes (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial) and for both forward and reverse genetics (reviewed in Grossman et al., 2007Grossman A.R.

Additional red and green algal genome sequences, such as the sequences of two other Ostreococcus genomes (US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, www.jgi.doe.gov), are required to assess whether these characteristics are unique or more general for these taxa.Table 1Plant Genomes for Which Sequence Is Available (circa March 2007)Size (Mb)# of GenesCyanidioschyzon merolae (unicellular red alga)16.55331Ostreococcus tauri (unicellular green alga)12.568166Chlamydomomas reinhardtii (unicellular green alga)136>15,000Physcomitrella patens (moss)487>20,000Selaginella moellendorfii (lycophyte)85??Oryza sativa (rice)38941,000Populus trichocarpa (popular tree)48545,000Arabidopsis thaliana (flowering plant)14027,500 Open table in a new tab By producing oxygen as a waste product, the evolution of photosynthetic cyanobacteria 3.5 billion years ago dramatically altered the Earth's ecosystem. Following the primary endosymbiotic event that defines plants, this eukaryotic lineage evolved to become the dominant primary producer in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Comparisons among algal genome sequences can provide information to elucidate characteristics of the ancestral photosynthetic eukaryotes. For example, the O. tauri genome includes genes potentially involved in C4 photosynthesis, which enhances photosynthetic capabilities under low CO2 conditions and has evolved repeatedly in several angiosperm lineages. C4 photosynthesis in O. tauri would confer a significant advantage under specific environmental conditions, suggesting that this capability may have been present at an early stage of green algal evolution (Derelle et al., 2006Derelle E. Ferraz C. Rombauts S. Rouze P. Worden A.Z. Robbens S. Partensky F. Degroeve S. Echeynié S. Cooke R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11647-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Additionally, genomic comparisons between C. merolae and the green algae will provide insight into both shared and specific genetic characters in the two algal lineages. The emergence of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors occurred repeatedly in the evolution of eukaryotes, most notably in the metazoan and land plant lineages. The origin of multicellularity is thus one of the key questions in the evolution of life on Earth. Comparative genomics suggests that a combination of co-opting existing genes for new functions and the evolution of new proteins from novel combinations of pre-existing protein domains contributed to the emergence of multicellularity in metazoans (Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2007Ruiz-Trillo I. Burger G. Holland P.W.H. King N. Lang B.F. Roger A.J. Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 113-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Multicellularity has evolved numerous times within the red and green algae. Are similar or distinct genetic programs recruited to pattern multicellular algal taxa? Is multicellularity in land plants fundamentally different or similar to that of their algal relatives? Comparative genomics of multicellular organisms from distinct lineages should shed light on these questions. However, given that only unicellular algae have thus far had their genomes sequenced, sequencing of the genomes of multicellular red and green algae will be required to address this issue. The origin of land plants from aquatic ancestors marks a major evolutionary transition in the history of green plants. Land plants inherited many biochemical, ultrastructural, and physiological characters from their algal ancestors. Comparison of mitochondrial genomes of the charophycean alga Chara, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, and other land plants provides some of the strongest evidence for the sister relationship of Chara to land plants and of liverworts to other land plants (Turmel et al., 2003Turmel M. Otis C. Lemieux C. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1888-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unlike the development of their closely related multicellular charophycean algal relatives, land plants exhibit growth from an apical meristem that produces a three-dimensional body that becomes patterned to produce distinct tissues. One of the key questions is how programs for development and growth were changed to allow the production and patterning of tissues. The ability to compare the ancestral land plant genome with that of algal relatives would facilitate the identification of the genetic bases for the key innovations that allowed green plants to evolve from aquatic ancestors and adapt to life on land. Such key innovations include the perception of environmental cues (light and gravity), the origin of extracellular matrices (sporopollenin, lignin, and pectic acid), establishment of intercellular communication networks (plasmodesmata, plant hormones, receptors, and their ligands), and diversification of gene regulatory networks promoting cell differentiation. Because of the enormous evolutionary divergence between chlorophytes and streptophytes, sequencing of the genome of a charophycean alga (such as Chara) will be required to assess the origins of genetic mechanisms in land plants. The closest relatives of land plants, the charophycean algae, have a haplontic life cycle in which the zygote is the only diploid cell. All land plants have a life cycle that includes an alternation of generations involving a haploid phase (gametophyte) in which gametes are produced and a diploid phase (sporophyte) that produces spores. Thus, multicellularization of the zygote evolved early during land plant evolution. Was the initial elaboration of the zygote to produce a multicellular diploid sporophyte due to a co-option of already existing developmental pathways of gametophyte development or was it due to the origin of de novo developmental genes and networks? The earliest land plants most likely had a haploid-dominant life cycle, with an ephemeral-dependent sporophyte, and this has been retained in the extant bryophytes (mosses, hornworts, and liverworts). Flowering plant models such as Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar all represent diploid-dominant plants in which the sporophyte is long lived and complex and the gametophyte is diminutive and ephemeral. One of the major questions in plant evolution concerns the evolution of the sporophyte developmental program, which was modified through time so that sporophytes became larger and acquired the ability to branch, develop conducting tissues, and produce roots, leaves, seeds, and flowers. Another key question concerns the relationship between radial and bilateral or dorsiventral development in land plants (Friedman et al., 2004Friedman W.E. Moore R.C. Purugganan M.D. Am. J. Bot. 2004; 91: 1726-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The most familiar instance of dorsiventral development is that of leaves. There has been a great deal of research interest in understanding the genetics of polarity and growth of leaves in flowering plants. Organs referred to as leaves occur in all extant vascular plants, but in at least three cases these leaves evolved independently, in lycophytes, ferns, and seed plants. The earliest vascular plants (known only from fossils) lacked laminar, lateral, vascularized appendages. Thus, in vascular plants, organs with dorsiventral polarity evolved in the sporophyte generation that had radial patterning mechanisms. Variability in growth form also exists in gametophytes: some have radial organization (mosses, whisk ferns) and others have dorsiventral or thalloid organization (liverworts, hornworts, ferns). Evidence from the earliest land plant fossils suggests that the earliest land plants may have been liverworts or liverwort-like plants with a thalloid gametophyte. If this is true, then a transition from dorsiventral to radial gametophyte development must have occurred within land plants, and more than once. Liverworts represent the sister group to all other extant land plants. The best hope of assessing the nature of the land plant ancestral genome for comparison with algal genomes will require comparison of a liverwort genome with that of other land plant genomes. For example, the genome of the thalloid liverwort M. polymorpha will provide the basis for comparing the developmental genetics of plants with dorsiventral development and those with radial development. Efforts toward obtaining the nuclear genome sequence of M. polymorpha include the construction of BAC libraries (Green Plant BAC project), end-sequences of both BAC and EST libraries (T. Kohchi, personal communication), and submission of a pilot proposal for whole-genome shotgun sequencing (JGI). Although genome sequences from liverworts and charophycean algae are not yet available, the nuclear genome of the moss, Physcomitrella patens, has recently been sequenced along with a large number of cDNA clones derived from various developmental stages, including leafy shoots of gametophytes and sporophytes (M. Hasebe, personal communication). Initial analyses of cDNA sequences suggest that mosses and angiosperms have largely the same types of gene families, including most of the gene families implicated in developmental patterning in angiosperms. This suggests a co-option of existing genes rather than the evolution of new genes in the transition from a gametophyte-dominant life cycle to a sporophyte-dominant one (Nishiyama et al., 2003Nishiyama T. Fujita T. Shin-I T. Seki M. Nishide H. Uchiyama I. Kamiya A. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Shinozaki K. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Floyd and Bowman, 2007Floyd S.K. Bowman J.L. Int. J. Plant Sci. 2007; 168: 1-35Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the gene families have markedly diversified in the angiosperms relative to mosses (Floyd and Bowman, 2007Floyd S.K. Bowman J.L. Int. J. Plant Sci. 2007; 168: 1-35Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Functional analyses using homologous recombination knockout technology in P. patens will be required to clarify the questions of whether the same genetic networks function in both haploid and diploid generations of land plants, whether the radial shoots of the moss gametophyte and the vascular plant sporophyte are regulated by similar developmental programs, and whether body plans in the different generations require different developmental programs. Another plant genome that has been sequenced and awaits assembly and annotation is that of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. There are two major lineages of extant vascular plants, the lycophytes (spike mosses, club mosses, quillworts) and the euphyllophytes (ferns, horsetails, seed plants), representing an ancient divergence of a vascular plant ancestor. These lineages separated prior to the evolution of many features we commonly associate with plants. Leaves, roots, and complex vascular architectures have evolved independently within both lineages from a morphologically simpler common ancestor. Despite millions of years of evolution, lycophytes have also retained many developmental features thought to be ancestral or primitive for vascular plants. These include an apical meristem with one or a few apical initial cells, apical dichotomous branching, and a protostelic vasculature with xylem surrounded by phloem. The differences between lycophytes and euphyllophytes highlight some of the major questions in vascular plant evolution. How were the complex shoot apical meristems of seed plants derived from simpler ancestral meristems? Are both simple and complex meristems regulated by the same gene regulatory networks? How might these networks have changed as the simpler ancestral meristems evolved? Are the independently acquired leaves and roots of these organisms patterned by the same or different genetic programs? Are the vascular tissues analogous or homologous to the conducting tissues in mosses? In the case of leaves some insight has already been gained from genomic data in addition to using candidate gene approaches (Floyd and Bowman, 2006Floyd S.K. Bowman J.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1911-1917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Harrison et al., 2005Harrison C.J. Corley S.B. Moylan E.C. Alexander D.L. Scotland R.W. Langdale J.A. Nature. 2005; 434: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the S. moellendorffii genome has not been assembled yet, searches of the unassembled sequences have identified many developmental gene families that are shared with flowering plants and some that are not (reviewed in Floyd and Bowman, 2007Floyd S.K. Bowman J.L. Int. J. Plant Sci. 2007; 168: 1-35Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two gene families important for leaf development in flowering plants, Class III HD-Zip and KANADI, are both present in the genome of S. moellendorffii. However, the subclade of Class III HD-Zip genes involved in leaf polarity in flowering plants has no ortholog in S. moellendorffii. Likewise, the YABBY gene family, important for abaxial identity and laminar outgrowth in flowering plants, has not been found in the S. moellendorffii genomic sequence. With the completion of the assembly and annotation of the S. moellendorffii genome the full assessment of many gene families will be possible and we can begin to address long-standing questions in vascular plant evolution with a new set of genetic tools. Techniques for genetic transformation in S. moellendorffii enabling transgenic approaches for studying gene expression may also be possible. One surprising discovery from the genome sequences of the model plants A. thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) is evidence for repeated whole-genome duplications, despite the diploid nature of the two species. Flowering plants offer an attractive system to study the consequences of whole-genome duplications due to their propensity for polyploidization. Flowering plants have likely undergone multiple rounds of polyploizidation in the past 150–200 million years. In contrast, in mammals polyploidization has been suppressed over the same timeframe due to the presence of the X-Y sex chromosome system. There are three key questions: (1) How does the process of diploidization occur? (2) Do whole-genome duplications correlate with speciation events? and (3) Do whole-genome duplications correspond to an explosive evolution of morphology by providing the raw material of entire genetic pathways for selection, as suggested by Ohno, 1970Ohno S. Evolution by Gene Duplication. George Allen and Unwin, London1970Crossref Google Scholar? The availability of multiple whole-genome duplications of varying antiquity in flowering plants facilitates the formulation of some hypotheses to address these questions. Several groups have tried to date the three whole-genome duplications (called 1R, 2R, and 3R) that have left their imprint in the organization of the Arabidopsis genome (reviewed in De Bodt et al., 2005De Bodt S. Maere S. Van de Peer Y. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2005; 20: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although there is much uncertainty in the precise timings, the earliest event could correspond with the origin of extant flowering plants, and the second event with the origin of the eudicots (the most species-rich clade of flowering plants). Likewise, a whole-genome duplication event dating to the base of the monocots, the second large clade of angiosperms, is evident in the genome of rice. That the whole-genome duplications correlate in time with origins or major radiations of flowering plants is consistent with Ohno's idea that such events facilitate major leaps in morphological evolution. More precise dating of the whole-genome duplication events relative to the adaptive radiations of angiosperms will require the analysis of other phylogenetically informative angiosperm genomes such as that of the basal eudicot Aquilegia (columbine; in progress at JGI). Based on comparison of the genome sequences of Arabidopsis and of the poplar tree (Populus), it has been estimated that their common ancestor possessed only 12,000–14,000 genes. This suggests differential retention of genes in the different lineages, possibly related to their different life histories, that is, ephemeral annual versus long-lived and sometimes vegetatively propagated perennial (Tuskan et al., 2006Tuskan G.A. Difazio S. Jansson S. Bohlmann J. Grigoriev I. Hellsten U. Putnam N. Ralph S. Rombauts S. Salamov A. et al.Science. 2006; 313: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, Maere et al., 2005Maere S. De Bodt S. Raes J. Casneuf T. Van Montagu M. Kuiper M. Van de Peer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5454-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Arabidopsis genome has also revealed the preferential retention of specific classes of genes—such as those encoding transcription factors, signaling molecules, and secondary metabolism enzymes—following whole-genome duplications (Blanc and Wolfe, 2004Blanc G. Wolfe K.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Such preferential retention could also be evidence of a requirement to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry in protein complexes and a selection for increased diversity of secondary metabolites involved in defense. The preferential retention of transcription factors is also consistent with the higher percentage of transcription factors in multicellular plants (12%–15%) relative to unicellular plants (2%–4%). The increase in genes encoding signaling molecules and transcription factors is also consistent with the idea of neofunctionalization following gene duplication contributing to the evolution of morphological complexity. The evolutionary process of diploidization, whereby a polyploid decays to become a diploid, is enigmatic. However, the study of recent polyploids suggests that massive gene loss accompanied by structural evolution of chromosomes and epigenetic reprogramming of retained genes may influence chromosome pairing and thus contribute to diploidization. The evolution of the flower and the carpel were key innovations that allowed angiosperms to engage in specialized animal pollination systems and seed dispersal mechanisms. Did the evolution of these innovations require the evolution of new genes, or were already existing genetic programs co-opted to new roles? Similar to the situation described earlier in the evolution of vascular plants from a bryophyte-like ancestor, orthologs of flower patterning genes are present in gymnosperms (that is, nonflowering seed plants such as conifers). For example, B and C class MADS box genes that pattern the reproductive organs of angiosperm flowers are also expressed in the reproductive organs of gymnosperms. However, whereas gymnosperms appear to have single copies of a C class gene, angiosperms harbor multiple copies derived from gene/genome duplications within the angiosperm lineage. At least two C class genes are present in all angiosperms, suggesting that neofunctionalization could have contributed to one gene being specialized for carpel development (an angiosperm-specific structure) and the other gene specialized for ovule and integument development (shared by both angiosperms and gymnosperms). In contrast, secondary growth (the production of wood) has secondarily evolved multiple times within the angiosperms from herbacious ancestors, suggesting that most if not all angiosperm species still possess the ancestral genetic programs. This implies that secondary growth may involve co-option of pre-existing genetic programs via changes in gene regulation mediated, for example, by modifications to chromatin. Thus, it is likely that both the evolution of new genes, via gene duplication events, and the co-option of existing genetic programs contributed to the evolution of morphological diversity within the angiosperms, and that the ample genetic material provided by whole-genome duplications has played a major role in the rise of the angiosperms as the dominant land plant vegetation on the planet today. Genomes from plants representing different phylogenetic lineages, levels of organization, and body plan will soon be available for comparative genomic analyses and for functional analysis of development using reverse genetics and transgenic techniques. As researchers begin to mine the rich source of data from Cyanidioshyzon, Ostreococcus, Chlamydomonas, Physcomitrella, and Selaginella to compare with Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Populus, we look ahead to the addition of still more plant genomes such as those of Marchantia and Chara to bridge some of the vast evolutionary gaps that remain. We are on the verge of a new and exciting era of comparative genomics for the major lineage of photosynthetic organisms, and the future looks very green."
https://openalex.org/W1981588862,"Neuronal migration and growth-cone extension are both guided by extracellular factors in the developing brain, but whether these two forms of guidance are mechanistically linked is unclear. Application of a Slit-2 gradient in front of the leading process of cultured cerebellar granule cells led to the collapse of the growth cone and the reversal of neuronal migration, an event preceded by a propagating Ca(2+) wave from the growth cone to the soma. The Ca(2+) wave was required for the Slit-2 effect and was sufficient by itself to induce the reversal of migration. The Slit-2-induced reversal of migration required active RhoA, which was accumulated at the front of the migrating neuron, and this polarized RhoA distribution was reversed during the migration reversal induced by either the Slit-2 gradient or the Ca(2+) wave. Thus, long-range Ca(2+) signaling coordinates the Slit-2-induced changes in motility at two distant parts of migrating neurons by regulating RhoA distribution."

One-carbon metabolism is compromised by folate deficiency and common genetic polymorphisms. In this study, the mechanism for the preferential partitioning of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT)-derived methylenetetrahydrofolate to de novo thymidylate biosynthesis was investigated. The cSHMT enzyme was shown to interact with UBC9 and was a substrate for UBC9-catalyzed small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification in vitro. SUMOylated cSHMT was detected in extracts from S phase MCF-7 cells, and cSHMT was shown to localize to the nucleus and nuclear periphery during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (L474F-cSHMT) impaired the UBC9-cSHMT interaction and inhibited cSHMT SUMOylation in vitro. The three folate-dependent enzymes that constitute the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway, cSHMT, thymidylate synthase, and dihydrofolate reductase, all contain SUMO modification consensus sequences. Compartmentation of the folate-dependent de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway in the nucleus accounts for the preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived folate-activated one-carbon units into thymidylate biosynthesis; the efficiency of nuclear folate metabolism is likely to be modified by the cSHMT L474F polymorphism.

The term folate refers to a family of enzyme cofactors that carry and chemically activate single carbons at three oxidation states (1Christensen K.E. MacKenzie R.E.

Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is a metabolic network that is required for the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Fig. 1). Folate cofactors incorporate activated formate into the 2- and 8-positions of the purine ring, provide activated formaldehyde and two electrons for the methylation of dUMP to dTMP, and provide activated methanol for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine can be adenosylated to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; cSHMT, cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TS, thymidylate synthase; THF, tetrahydrofolate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. which serves as a methyl donor for numerous substrates, including lipids, neurotransmitters, DNA, and histones (3Donnelly J.G. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2001; 38: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Formate generated in the mitochondria is the primary source of single carbons for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism (Fig. 1) (4Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, folate-activated one-carbon units can be derived in the cytoplasm through the activity of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT), which catalyzes the reversible conversion of THF and serine to glycine and methylene-THF, but this enzyme is not expressed in all cells (5Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Perturbation of one-carbon metabolism can result from vitamin deficiencies and/or penetrant single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that encode folate-dependent enzymes (2Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62: S3-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-carbon metabolism is essential for genome stability and methylation; biomarkers for impaired folate metabolism include elevated uracil content in DNA due to uracil misincorporation during replication and repair as well as depressed cellular methylation capacity (6Stempak J.M. Sohn K.J. Chiang E.P. Shane B. Kim Y.I. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Blount B.C. Mack M.M. Wehr C.M. MacGregor J.T. Hiatt R.A. Wang G.

Uracil accumulation in DNA leads to genome instability, and chromatin hypomethylation affects chromatin structure, genome stability, and gene expression (8Jang H. Mason J.B. Choi S.W. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2967-2971Crossref Google Scholar). It is not known if the associations between disruptions in folate metabolism and pathologies (including colon cancer and cardiovascular disease) and developmental anomalies (including neural tube closure defects) result from altered AdoMet synthesis and/or folate-dependent thymidylate biosynthesis (2Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62: S3-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways compete for a limited pool of folate cofactors (9Scott J.M. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1981; 2: 337-340Abstract PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 10Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The concentration of folate-binding proteins in cells exceeds that of folate derivatives; therefore, the concentration of free folate in the cell is negligible (10Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12149-12155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This competition is most pronounced for the two reactions that utilize methylene-THF: thymidylate synthesis catalyzed by thymidylate synthase (TS) and 5-methyl-THF synthesis catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (Fig. 1). The MTHFR-catalyzed reaction commits one-carbon units to the methionine cycle (Fig. 1) (13Green J.M. MacKenzie R.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8014-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both reactions are essentially irreversible in vivo (10Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling studies, in vitro binding experiments, and mathematical modeling have indicated that methylene-THF is preferentially directed toward methionine synthesis relative to thymidylate biosynthesis (13Green J.M. MacKenzie R.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8014-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Reed M.C. Nijhout H.F. Neuhouser M.L. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Shane B. James S.J. Boynton A. Ulrich C.M. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the partitioning of methylene-THF between methionine and thymidylate synthesis is central to the origin of folate-related pathologies. For example, a prevalent MTHFR variant (A222V) is thermolabile; carriers exhibit 40–70% less enzymatic activity, impaired methylation, and hypomethylated DNA but more robust de novo thymidylate biosynthesis compared with carriers of the more common allele (15Ma J. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Artigas C. Hunter D.J. Fuchs C. Willett W.C. Selhub J. Hennekens C.H. Rozen R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1098-1102PubMed Google Scholar). The A222V polymorphism is associated with increased risk for developmental anomalies, including neural tube closure defects (16Molloy A.M. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 53-56PubMed Google Scholar), but affords protection from colon cancer (15Ma J. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Artigas C. Hunter D.J. Fuchs C. Willett W.C. Selhub J. Hennekens C.H. Rozen R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1098-1102PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of methylene-THF partitioning between the thymidylate and AdoMet synthetic pathways. Recently, we have provided evidence that the cSHMT enzyme contributes to the regulation of methylene-THF partitioning between the thymidylate and AdoMet biosynthetic pathways and is rate-limiting for de novo thymidylate synthesis in MCF-7 cells (17Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Previous isotope tracer studies demonstrated that cSHMT-derived methylene-THF is preferentially directed to thymidylate biosynthesis relative to the methionine synthesis pathway (17Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cSHMT is an abundant, high affinity 5-methyl-THF binding protein (10Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A 2-fold increase in cSHMT protein levels was sufficient to sequester cytoplasmic folate as 5-methyl-THF in MCF-7 cells and deplete AdoMet levels (Fig. 1) (17Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, cSHMT is poised within the one-carbon network to contribute to the etiology of folate-related pathologies. In this study, the mechanism underlying the preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived methylene-THF into thymidylate synthesis was investigated. Cell Lines and Media—Human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells (HTB22) and HeLa cells (CCL2) were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 11% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Isolation of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Wild-type C57/BL6 and isogenic cshmt–/– embryos were harvested at embryonic day 14 and genotyped by PCR. 3A. J. MacFarlane and P. J. Stover, unpublished results. Fibroblasts were isolated and cultured on collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 11% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as described elsewhere (18Loo D.T. Cotman C.W. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, London1994: 45-53Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested by gentle scraping and washed two times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER) (Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 10–20 min on ice. Isolation of cell nuclei was performed using the NE-PER kit from Pierce. For the identification of SUMOylated proteins, a SUMO protease inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm), was added to the lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method as modified by Bensadoun (19Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred at 4 °C to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 15 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated for 4–15 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized using the horseradish peroxidase SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). For cSHMT detection, affinity-purified sheep anti-human cSHMT antibody was diluted 1:20,000, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was diluted 1:10,000. For TS detection, affinity-purified sheep anti-human TS antibody (Abcam) was diluted 1:5000. For detection of SUMOylated proteins, rabbit polyclonal anti-human SUMO (Abcam) was diluted 1:5000, and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was diluted 1:10,000. Rabbit anti-human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Novus) was used at a 1:100,000 dilution, mouse anti-rat lamin B1 (Abcam) was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and mouse anti-bovine calpain M (Affinity Bioreagents) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A HeLa cell-derived cDNA expression library encoding Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins was screened with a cSHMT fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. To generate the cDNA encoding the cSHMT fusion protein, the human cSHMT cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TAGAATTCATGACGATGCCAGTC-3′ and 5′-TAGTCGACTTAGAAGTCAGGCAG-3′, which contain the restriction sites (EcoRI and SalI, respectively) shown in boldface type. The product was cloned into the pGBK-DNA binding vector and then transformed into the yeast strain AH109. A pretransformed HeLa cDNA library in Y187 yeast cells (Clontech) was mated to AH109 cells transformed with the pGBK-cSHMT vector following the Clontech Matchmaker protocol. After mating for 24 h, cells were plated on His–, Ade–, Leu–, Trp– dropout medium containing X-α-galactosidase. Positive colonies were picked after a 4-day incubation at 30 °C. Clones were tested against the negative controls lamin and empty cassette plasmids according to the Matchmaker protocol. Coimmunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed as described above in M-PER buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. The extract (150 μg) was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads to remove proteins that bound nonspecifically to the matrix. The precleared extracts were then incubated with 5 μg of either anti-cSHMT, UBC9, UBC13, SUMO, or HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. The beads were collected and washed three times with PBS. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads to release protein complexes. Immunoblots were prepared as described above. GST Pull-down Assay—The UBC9 and UBC13 cDNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) vector using the following primers: UBC9 forward, 5′-TAGAATTCCCATGTCGGGGATCGCC-3′; UBC9 reverse, 5′-TAGTCGACTTATGAGGGCGCAAAC-3′; UBC13 forward, 5′-TAGAATTCCCATGGCCGGGCTGCCC-3′; UBC13 reverse, 5′-TACTCGAGTTAAATATTATTCATGG-3′). The EcoRI and SalI (UBC9) and EcoRI and XhoI (UBC13) sites are shown in boldface type. Equal amounts of GST fusion protein (5 μg) and glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 500 μg of MCF-7 extract with end over end shaking for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with PBS. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 20 mm glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, and identified by immunoblotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cSHMT cDNA was cloned into pet28b as described (20Zanetti K.A. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10142-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to make the following mutant cSHMT proteins: K38R, K39R, K38R/K39R (corresponding to the SUMOylation site, Ile37-Lys38-Lys39-Glu40), and L474F (the cSHMT polymorphic protein corresponding to C1420T (21Skibola C.F. Smith M.T. Hubbard A. Shane B. Roberts A.C. Law G.R. Rollinson S. Roman E. Cartwright R.A. Morgan G.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 3786-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)). The primers used were K38R(A→ G) (5′-TACAACATCATTAGGAAGGAGAGTAACCGGCA-3′), K39R(A→ G) (5′-TACAACATCATTAAGAGGGAGAGTAACCGGCA-3′), K38R/K39R (5′-TACAACATCATTAGGAGGGAGAGTAACCGGCA-3′), and L474F (5′-GAGAGCTTCGCCTCTTTCTTCCCTCTGCCTGGCCTG-3′. The mutations are shown in boldface type, and the modified codons are underlined. The corresponding complement primers were also used following the protocol for the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cDNAs were sequence-verified at the Cornell BioResource Center. Quantitative β-Galactosidase Assay—Plasmids containing either the cSHMT, cSHMT-K38R, cSHMT-K38R/K39R, or cSHMT-L474F cDNA fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 were cotransformed into Y187 yeast with a plasmid encoding UBC9 fused to the Gal4 activating domain. The cells were plated on selection medium that lacked leucine and tryptophan to maintain both plasmids. Colonies were picked from the plates, grown in selection medium overnight, and then diluted to an A600 of 0.2 in 5 ml of selection medium. After a 6-h incubation at 30 °C, the A600 was recorded, and cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of Y-PER buffer (Pierce). After a 30-min lysis, the extracts were centrifuged to remove the insoluble material. β-Galactosidase assay buffer (300 μl; Pierce) was added to the extracts. After a 4–12-h incubation, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 m Na2CO3 (400 μl). The A420 of each reaction was recorded, and the β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the following formula: β-galactosidase units = (1000 × A420)/(t × A600)(t = time of incubation with substrate). All values were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity obtained from the cSHMT-UBC9 interaction. Purification of Recombinant cSHMT—Plasmids containing cSHMT cDNAs fused to a His6 tag (pet28a) at the N terminus were transformed into BL21 cells (Novagen) and purified as described previously (20Zanetti K.A. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10142-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In Vitro SUMOylation Assays—SUMOylation reactions were performed using a kit from Active Motif following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a 3 μm concentration of either recombinant wild-type, K38R, K39R, K38R/K39R, or L474F human cSHMT was added to the purified SUMO components: Aos1/Uba2 (E1), UBC9 (E2), and SUMO. The reactants were mixed briefly and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Reactions with a mutant SUMO that cannot be activated by the E1/E2 machinery were performed as a negative control. When RanBP2 was included in the reaction, 5 ng of purified recombinant GST-RanBP2ΔFG (plasmid was a kind gift of Frauke Melchior (22Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar)) was added in place of 2 μl of water. SUMOylation of p53 served as a positive control (data not shown). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 95 °C for 10 min before immunoblotting using antibodies against cSHMT or SUMO. DNA Transfections—DNA was transfected into MCF-7 cells using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids encoding V5-Ran and V5-Ran-T24N (constitutively inactive Ran) were kindly provided by Rick Cerione (Cornell University). Cell Cycle Synchronization and Analysis—MCF-7 or HeLa cells at 30% confluence were arrested at various stages of the cell cycle with 30 μm lovastatin (Sigma), 1 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma), or 80 ng/ml nocodazole (Calbiochem). After a 20–24-h exposure, half of the cells were collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and the rest were fixed with methanol and prepared for immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (described below). For cell synchronization experiments, cells were grown to 40% confluence and treated with 80 ng/ml nocodazole for 20 h. After the nocodazole was removed (t = 0), the cells were washed, and α-minimal essential medium was applied to the cells. Cells were isolated for fluorescence-activated cell sorting and for Western analysis at time 0, 12, and 20 h. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed using 3 mm sodium citrate containing 1% Triton X-100 with 50 ng/ml propidium iodide as the lysis/DNA binding reagent at the Biomedical Sciences Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory at Cornell University. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown on sterile coverslips in α-minimal essential medium then fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min and allowed to air-dry. The coverslips were rinsed briefly in PBS before incubation with the blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h. The blocking solution was removed, and a solution of primary antibodies in 2% bovine serum albumin-PBS (antibody dilution was 1:500) (either cSHMT, nonspecific sheep IgG (control), or a Q-dot 605 nm conjugated cSHMT primary antibody) was applied to the coverslips for 1–2 h at room temperature in the dark. To visualize the nucleus, 10 nm TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) DNA binding dye was added, and the cells were then washed five times with PBS. Samples that required a secondary antibody for detection were incubated with an Alexa-fluor 488 nm conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted to slides using mounting medium (Sigma), and confocal images were obtained at the Microscope Imaging Facility at Cornell University. The cSHMT protein levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus were quantified using the MetaMorph program, version 6.1. Molecular Modeling of the cSHMT-UBC9 Interaction—UBC9 from the crystal structure of a RanGAP1-UBC9 complex (23Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1KPS) was manually docked with human cSHMT (Protein Data Bank entry 1BJ4) using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), positioning the molecules so that Lys38 and Asn42 of cSHMT chain A occupied approximately the same positions as Lys526 and Glu528 of RanGAP1, relative to UBC9 residues 86–93. After overall molecular placement, side chains at the cSHMT-UBC9 interface were manually adjusted, and energy minimization of the complex was carried out using CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Buried surface area was calculated for the RanGAP1-UBC9 and cSHMT-UBC9 complexes using the EBI PISA server (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html). Identification of cSHMT as a Nuclear Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify proteins that physically interact with cSHMT and thereby facilitate the preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived methylene-THF to the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway. Several proteins were identified as cSHMT binding partners (Table 1), including UBC9, UBC13, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These three proteins localize to the nucleus and nuclear periphery and are involved in DNA replication and repair (26Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Their interaction with cSHMT was confirmed through replicate screening and co-immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-human UBC9 and UBC13 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Endogenous cSHMT protein in MCF-7 cell extract was also shown to interact with GST-UBC9 and GST-UBC13 fusion proteins (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1cSHMT yeast two-hybrid screen resultsGene nameNumber of coloniesDescriptionUBC1310Ubiquitin E2 conjugaseUBC96SUMO E2 conjugasecSHMT5Serine hydroxymethyltransferaseUbiquitin B3UbiquitinPCNA2DNA replication clampPoly(rC)BP2Poly(rC)-binding protein 2RanBP9 (RanBPM)1Ran-binding protein 9 Open table in a new tab UBC13 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugase that functions in the error-free DNA postreplication repair pathways (27Ashley C. Pastushok L. McKenna S. Ellison M.J. Xiao W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). UBC9 is an E2 SUMO conjugase (28Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). SUMO modification protects proteins from ubiquitin-mediated degradation, targets proteins for nuclear or subnuclear localization, enables protein-protein interactions, and/or modifies protein activity (29Dohmen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). PCNA is a highly conserved polymerase-associated protein that is synthesized in G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and localizes to sites of DNA synthesis. PCNA is SUMOylated by UBC9 in S phase to promote DNA synthesis; ubiquitination of PCNA occurs in the nucleus and is a signal for error-free DNA repair (31Pastushok L. Xiao W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 69: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Watts F.Z. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived methylene-THF to TS could occur through a physical TS-cSHMT interaction that permits substrate channeling. Alternatively, compartmentation of the thymidylate biosynthesis pathway apart from the methionine synthesis pathway would also enable the preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived methylene-THF to thymidylate synthesis. There was no evidence for a direct interaction between TS and cSHMT when tested by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Therefore, the nuclear compartmentation of the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway was explored as a mechanism to account for the preferential partitioning of cSHMT-derived one-carbon units to the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway. Localization of cSHMT and TS to the Nucleus—Western blot analyses demonstrated that the cSHMT and TS enzymes were present in purified HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A). SUMOylated cSHMT enzyme was visualized only in extracts prepared with the SUMO protease inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide, and SUMOylated cSHMT was enriched in the nuclear fraction relative to the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitates generated from MCF-7 cell extracts using a rabbit anti-human SUMO antibody contained cSHMT (55 kDa) and SUMOylated cSHMT (75 kDa) (Fig. 3C). SUMO isopeptidases are highly active and located in the nucleus and nuclear periphery; they rapidly hydrolyze SUMO polypeptides from proteins in cell extracts (33Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not assess if all nuclear cSHMT was SUMOylated. The active cSHMT enzyme is a homotetramer in mammalian cells. It is possible that only one subunit requires SUMOylation to transport the tetramer, which would result in the presence of both SUMO-modified and -unmodified cSHMT in the nucleus. Many proteins that undergo SUMO modification are present both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and typically only a small fraction localizes to the nucleus (34Pichler A. Melchior F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of cSHMT was verified by confocal microscopy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from C57/BL6 and C57/BL6 cshmt–/– embryos (Fig. 4A). The cSHMT protein was present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. SUMO modification and SUMO-dependent nuclear localization have been shown to be cell cycle-regulated (35Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 36Saitoh N. Uchimura Y. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Saitoh H. Nakao M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, PCNA is SUMOylated during S phase, the septin proteins are SUMO-modified during mitosis (35Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and topoisomerase SUMOylation occurs during G2/M. The cSHMT enzyme was localized a"

TopBP1 has been identified as a direct activator of ATR. We show that ATM regulates Xenopus TopBP1 by phosphorylating Ser-1131 and thereby strongly enhancing association of TopBP1 with ATR. Xenopus egg extracts containing a mutant of TopBP1 that cannot be phosphorylated on Ser-1131 are defective in the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to DSBs but not to DNA replication stress. Thus, TopBP1 is critical for the ATM-dependent activation of ATR following production of DSBs in the genome."

Therefore, many signaling responses induce the nuclear translocation of transcription factors, kinases, and others. By using inducible translocation trap, a reporter gene-based system to detect inducible nuclear translocation, we found that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, a key enzyme in glycolysis, translocates into the nucleus by interleukin-3, but not by epidermal growth factor, stimulation. The C domain of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase was sufficient for interleukin-3-induced nuclear translocation. Interleukin-3-induced nuclear translocation of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase was dependent on the activation of Jak2.

Here, we showed IL-3-induced nuclear translocation of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) and examined its significance in cell proliferation. Cell Lines—BB13 was derived from an IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3 (8Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and ectopically expresses human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (9Miyazaki T.

BB13 proliferates in response to EGF even in the absence of IL-3. Bcl-2 expression is required for EGF-induced proliferation. In the absence of EGF and IL-3, BB13 dies by apoptosis, but cell death is markedly delayed compared with its parental cell line, which does not overexpress Bcl-2. LexA-d1EGFP (10Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol.

LexA-d1EGFP reporter gene contains 8 × LexA binding elements, interferon β minimal promoter, and destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (d1EGFP). Plasmid Construction—For construction of a retroviral vector expressing GFP fused with the carboxyl (C)-terminal of the full-length M2-PK (M2-PK-GFP), the coding sequence of mouse M2-PK was amplified by PCR from the Ba/F3 cDNA library and ligated with GFP gene from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) and pMX-neo vector. For construction of a retroviral vector expressing hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged M2-PK fused with the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from SV40 T-antigen at its N terminus (HA-NLS-M2-PK), the coding sequence of M2-PK was amplified by PCR and ligated with a sequence encoding SV40 T-antigen NLS cleaved from pLGV-NLS-β-galactosidase (10Hoshino A.

For construction of a retroviral vector encoding HA-tagged M2-PK (HA-M2-PK/pMXs-IG), the coding sequence of M2-PK was amplified by PCR and ligated with HA sequence from pEF-HA into pMXs-IG. Immunoblot Analysis—Preparation of nuclear extracts/whole cell lysates and immunoblot analyses were performed as described (10Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol.

The antibodies (Abs) used in this study were anti-PK (Abcam and Serotec), anti-Stat5, anti-Sp1, anti-Rho-GDI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (Clontech), and anti-HA (Roche Applied Science). For inhibition of Jak2, AG-490 (BIOSOURCE) (50 μm) was added to growth factor-starved cells 30 min before IL-3 stimulation. Preparation of Nuclei for Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 400 μl of A buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), and 0.3% Nonidet P-40), and vortexed for 30 s. Nuclei were spun down at 5,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature and suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde to be fixed for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed nuclei were washed with flow cytometry buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and suspended in flow cytometry buffer for flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescent Microscopy—Ba/F3 expressing M2-PK-GFP were growth factor-starved and mock-stimulated or stimulated with IL-3 for 30 min. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to indicate the positions of the nuclei, and observed with a deconvolution microscope. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were growth factor-starved for 5 h and mock-stimulated or stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) or IL-3 (1 ng/ml) for the indicated time intervals.

Isolation of M2-PK cDNA in Screening of IL-3-induced Nuclear Translocating Molecules—By using the inducible translocation trap system (10Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we attempted to isolate cDNAs that encode proteins translocating into the nucleus by IL-3 stimulation. The inducible translocation trap system is based on expression of a fusion protein consisting of the LexA DNA-binding domain, the Gal4 transactivation domain, and the test protein encoded by cDNA subcloned downstream of the Gal4 transactivation domain (10Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fusion molecule is expressed in cells containing GFP reporter gene with multiple LexA binding sites in its promoter (LexA-d1EGFP). Following nuclear translocation of the fusion protein by ligand stimulation, the LexA DNA-binding domain targets the fusion protein to the LexA operator sites of the reporter gene and then the Gal4 transactivation domain activates the expression of GFP. Thus, nuclear translocation of the test protein is detected by the expression of GFP. LexA-d1EGFP gene was transfected into BB13 (9Miyazaki T. Liu Z.-J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y.

BB13 is a Ba/F3-derived cell line ectopically expressing EGF receptor and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Parental Ba/F3 dies by apoptosis in the absence of IL-3, whereas BB13 proliferates even in the absence of IL-3 if EGF is present in the culture medium (9Miyazaki T. Liu Z.-J. Kawahara A. Minami Y.

Screening of the cDNA library was performed as schematized in Fig. 1. The Ba/F3 cDNA library (48 μg) constructed in the pLG retroviral vector to express cDNA-encoded proteins fused with LexA DNA-binding domain and Gal4 transactivation domain (10Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was transfected into 1.8 × 107 of 293T cells with amphotropic helper plasmid to produce retrovirus particles. Two days after transfection, 2 × 107 of BBLG were infected with the supernatant (60 ml) of the 293T containing virus particles. Infection efficiency was estimated to be ∼7% (data not shown). A day after infection, cells were resuspended in medium containing EGF (10 ng/ml). Two days after infection, cells were stimulated with IL-3 (1 ng/ml) for 4 h, and GFP (+) cells were sorted and incubated in medium containing EGF (IL-3 (-)) for 4 days for down-regulation of GFP, and then GFP (-) cells were sorted. Three days after, cells were restimulated with IL-3, and GFP (+) cells were sorted. Nine rounds of GFP (+) sorting after IL-3 stimulation and subsequent GFP (-) sorting were performed. The percentage of GFP (+) cells did not increase by IL-3 stimulation 2 days after infection (mock-stimulation, 1.57%; IL-3 stimulation, 1.56%) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, after nine rounds of sorting, IL-3 stimulation significantly increased GFP (+) cells in the sorted population (mock-stimulation, 17.1%; IL-3 stimulation, 33.6%) (Fig. 2A). Then cells were subjected to single-cell sorting, and GFP induction by IL-3 was examined for each clone. About 240 of more than 600 clones showed IL-3-induced GFP expression. Representative data for clones that showed GFP induction by IL-3 are shown in Fig. 2B. PCR amplification using genomic DNA extracted from these clones and viral vector primers gave rise to several different patterns (Fig. 2C, a–d). Percentages of each pattern were 84% (a), 8% (b), 4% (c), 1% (d), and 3%, others. We concentrated our effort for the analysis of the cDNA inserts in the dominant pattern (a). The fact that three bands were amplified in the pattern (a) suggested that three different cDNA clones are integrated in the genome of this clone. To determine which cDNA insert is responsible for IL-3-induced expression of GFP, PCR products from the pattern (a) were subcloned into pLG and transduced into BBLG, and then GFP expression by IL-3 was analyzed. IL-3 stimulation significantly induced expression of GFP in BBLG expressing the fusion protein consisting of LG and the protein encoded by the 1.2-kb pair (kbp) insert (Fig. 2D). In contrast, IL-3 stimulation did not induce expression of GFP in BBLG expressing fusion proteins consisting of LG and proteins encoded by the other inserts (1.6- and 0.8-kbp) (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the protein encoded by the 1.2-kbp insert of the pattern (a) translocates into the nucleus by IL-3. Sequence analysis revealed that the 1.2-kbp insert encodes the C-terminal 139 amino acid residues of mouse M2-PK (18Izumi S. Manabe A. Tomoyasu A. Kihara-Negishi F. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1267: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). PK is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, and it catalyzes the transfer to ADP of the high energy phosphate group of phosphoenolpyruvate to generate ATP (19Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Muirhead H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Four highly homologous isoforms, M1, M2, L, and R types, have been reported in mammalian cells (21Lone Y.-C. Simon M.-P. Kahn A. Marie J.

M2-PK is localized mainly in the cytoplasm and expressed in early fetal tissues as well as in most of the adult tissues (19Imamura K. Tanaka T.

Nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PK Ab, which detects M2-PK (see below). IL-3 stimulation induced increases in the amounts of PK in the nucleus within 30 min (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The total expression levels of PK did not change by IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 3A, lower panel), suggesting that the increase in the amounts of PK in the nucleus is not caused by the increase in the expression levels of PK. In contrast to IL-3, EGF stimulation did not increase the amounts of PK in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). To further confirm nuclear translocation of M2-PK by IL-3 stimulation, a retroviral vector expressing GFP fused with the C-terminal of the full-length M2-PK (M2-PK-GFP) was transduced into Ba/F3 cells. Expression of the M2-PK-GFP fusion protein was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-PK Ab (Fig. 3C, left panel). GFP (+) cells were sorted, growth factor-starved, and then stimulated with IL-3 for 30 min. IL-3 stimulation induced increases in the amounts of M2-PK-GFP in the nuclear extracts (Fig. 3C, right panel, upper). The total expression levels of M2-PK-GFP did not change by IL-3 stimulation (lower panel), suggesting that the increase in nuclear amounts of M2-PK-GFP reflects its nuclear translocation. Next, Ba/F3 expressing M2-PK-GFP were IL-3-starved for 5 h and stimulated with IL-3 for the indicated time intervals. Nuclei were purified and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. IL-3 stimulation increased the fluorescence intensities of GFP (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, subcellular localization of M2-PK-GFP was examined by fluorescent microscopy. In the absence of IL-3, M2-PK-GFP was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 3E). In contrast, M2-PK-GFP distributed ubiquitously in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus in IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these analyses showed nuclear translocation of M2-PK by IL-3 stimulation. Treatment with AG-490, an inhibitor of Jak2 (24Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), completely inhibited nuclear translocation of PK by IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 3F), suggesting that IL-3-induced nuclear translocation of PK is dependent on Jak2 activation. Functional Role of Nuclear M2-PK in Cell Proliferation—To examine the functional significance of IL-3-induced nuclear translocation of M2-PK, we generated constructs encoding HA-tagged M2-PK (HA-M2-PK) and HA-tagged M2-PK fused with NLS from SV40 T-antigen at its N terminus (Fig. 4A, HA-NLS-M2-PK). These constructs were inserted into the pMXs-IG retroviral vector containing an internal ribosome entry site-GFP sequence, which permits simultaneous expression of a cloned gene and GFP (12Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Changes in the percentages of transgene (+) cells can be easily quantified by analyzing GFP (+) cells. The retroviral constructs were transduced into BB13 and cultured in RPMI medium containing EGF. As expected, in the absence of IL-3, HA-NLS-M2-PK was readily detected in the nucleus of GFP (+) BB13 cells, while marginal amounts of HA-M2-PK were detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the proliferation of BB13 constitutively expressing M2-PK in the nucleus by monitoring the percentages of transgene (+) (GFP (+)) cells in EGF-containing medium. The percentages of GFP (+) cells in cell populations transduced with HA-M2-PK/pMXs-IG or pMXs-IG decreased gradually (Fig. 4C), indicating that neither transgene enhances proliferation. In contrast, the percentages of GFP (+) cells in the cell population transduced with HA-NLS-M2-PK/pMXs-IG increased markedly in EGF-containing medium (Fig. 4C). After 30 days of culture, the percentage of GFP (+) cells expressing HA-NLS-M2-PK increased 3-fold (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that nuclear M2-PK enhances EGF-induced proliferation. We also observed enhanced proliferation of clones expressing HA-NLS-M2-PK (data not shown). It is noteworthy that enhanced proliferation of cells expressing HA-NLS-M2-PK in the presence of IL-3 was not observed (supplemental Fig. S1), consistent with the idea that IL-3 stimulation induces nuclear translocation of sufficient amounts of M2-PK for maximal cell proliferation. In addition, because survival of cells expressing HA-NLS-M2-PK was still dependent on EGF or IL-3 (supplemental Fig. S2), the nuclear localization of M2-PK alone is not sufficient for cell proliferation and survival. Here, we showed that M2-PK translocates into the nucleus by IL-3 but not by EGF stimulation (Figs. 2 and 3). Because sequence identities of isoforms of mouse PK are high, it is likely that other isoforms (L, R, and M1) of PK can also translocate into the nucleus by IL-3. It has been recently shown that growth factors, including IL-3, influence cell growth and survival through effects on glucose metabolism (25Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Our data show that growth factors also modulate localization of PK, a key enzyme in glycolysis, suggesting a novel link between growth factor stimulation and the glycolytic pathway. PK proteins consist of the N-terminal domain, the A domain subdivided into A1 and A2 subdomains, the B domain, and the C domain (Fig. 2E) (26Munįoz M.-E. Ponce E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2003; 135: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ADP/ATP binding site lies in subdomain A2 near the domain C (26Munįoz M.-E. Ponce E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2003; 135: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The binding site of phosphoenolpyruvate is located in the loops that connect subdomain A1 and B and strands in subdomain A2 (27Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Schiltz E. Schmitt W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The active site lies in a pocket between domains A and B (27Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Schiltz E. Schmitt W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), where there is a high degree of identity among the 50 PK sequences of organisms from bacteria to human (26Munįoz M.-E. Ponce E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2003; 135: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C domain is variable among species (26Munįoz M.-E. Ponce E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2003; 135: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We showed that the C domain contains an inducible NLS(s) (Fig. 2). On-line motif analysis with the PSORT II program (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) did not detect any classical and bipartite NLS rich in Arg and Lys (28Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) in the C domain of PK. In this regard, it is known that signaling proteins that inducibly translocate into the nucleus in response to extracellular stimuli such as Stat proteins do not necessarily contain Arg- or Lys-rich NLS (29Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Instead, their signal-induced conformational changes can be recognized by nuclear importer proteins such as importin/karyopherins. Nuclear translocation of PK may also be mediated through signal-induced conformational changes but not by classical/bipartite NLS. We showed that IL-3-mediated nuclear translocation of PK is dependent on activation of Jak2 (Fig. 3F). At this stage, it is not clear how Jak2 activation induces nuclear translocation of PK. IL-3-induced activation of Jak2 induces activation of Stat5 as well as other signaling molecules such as Ras (30Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and Akt (31del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and they may be involved in the regulation of nuclear translocation of M2-PK. Alternatively, Jak2 may directly phosphorylate PK to induce its nuclear translocation. The nuclear localizing M2-PK significantly enhanced EGF-mediated cell proliferation in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 4). It is not clear how nuclear M2-PK enhances cell proliferation. EGF-stimulated cells did not induce Stat5 target genes even when HA-NLS-M2-PK was expressed (Fig. 4E), excluding a possibility that nuclear M2-PK induces or enhances activation of Stat5. M2-PK may provide ATP for nuclear functions, including transcription. Alternatively, PK may function as a signaling molecule to modulate nuclear function. Further studies will be required to elucidate how nuclear M2-PK enhances cell proliferation. We thank Drs. T. Kitamura and A.

https://openalex.org/W2093395445,"Procollagen C-proteinase enhancers (PCPE-1 and -2) are extracellular glycoproteins that can stimulate the C-terminal processing of fibrillar procollagens by tolloid proteinases such as bone morphogenetic protein-1. They consist of two CUB domains (CUB1 and -2) that alone account for PCPE-enhancing activity and one C-terminal NTR domain. CUB domains are found in several extracellular and plasma membrane-associated proteins, many of which are proteases. We have modeled the structure of the CUB1 domain of PCPE-1 based on known three-dimensional structures of CUB-containing proteins. Sequence alignment shows conserved amino acids, notably two acidic residues (Asp-68 and Asp-109) involved in a putative surface-located calcium binding site, as well as a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-67). In addition, three residues (Glu-26, Thr-89, and Phe-90) are found only in PCPE CUB1 domains, in putative surface-exposed loops. Among the conserved residues, it was found that mutations of Asp-68 and Asp-109 to alanine almost completely abolished PCPE-1 stimulating activity, whereas mutation of Tyr-67 led to a smaller reduction of activity. Among residues specific to PCPEs, mutation of Glu-26 and Thr-89 had little effect, whereas mutation of Phe-90 dramatically decreased the activity. Changes in activity were paralleled by changes in binding of different PCPE-1 mutants to a mini-procollagen III substrate, as shown by surface plasmon resonance. We conclude that PCPE-stimulating activity requires a calcium binding motif in the CUB1 domain that is highly conserved among CUB-containing proteins but also that PCPEs contain specific sites that could become targets for the development of novel anti-fibrotic therapies.

Although the roles of the CUB domains are largely unexplored, a number of them have been shown to be involved in oligomerization and/or recognition of substrates and binding partners.The protein families from which the CUB domain derives its name are the complement serine proteases C1r, C1s, MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3 and the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid metalloproteases BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 (or their counterparts xolloids, tolloids, and SpAN/BP10 in Xenopus, Drosophila, and sea urchin, respectively). Each consists of a catalytic domain (either N-terminal in tolloids or C-terminal in complement proteases) together with several CUB domains interspersed by calcium-binding EGF domains. In the case of the complement proteases, the CUB domains mediate dimerization and binding to the collagen-like regions of C1q (for C1r/C1s) and MBL or L- and H-ficolin (for MASP-2). The three-dimensional structures of the CUB1-EGF fragment of C1s, its homologue in MASP-2 (which also occurs as the alternatively spliced product MAp19) as well as the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 fragment of MASP-2 have been determined (20Gregory L.A.

In the case of BMP-1, this C-terminal region has the domain organization CUB1-CUB2-EGF1-CUB3, whereas in the longer mTLD splice variant it is CUB1-CUB2-EGF1-CUB3-EGF2-CUB4-CUB5. Variants mTLL-1 and mTLL-2 share the same domain structure as mTLD but are products of separate genes. These proteinases cleave a large number of substrates, including the fibrillar procollagens I, II, III, V, and XI, the non-fibrillar procollagen VII, prolysyl oxidases, the laminin 5 γ2 chain, dentin matrix protein-1, precursor forms of the small leucine rich proteoglycans biglycan and osteoglycin, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, growth factors myostatin and GDF11, the growth factor antagonist chordin (24Ge G.

Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).There is increasing evidence that tolloid proteinase activity is subject to regulation by a variety of extracellular proteins. During developmental patterning, for example, it has recently been shown that the frizzled-related protein sizzled is an endogenous inhibitor of BMP-1 (3Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B.

Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Maas S.A. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Procollagen C-proteinase enhancers (PCPE-1 and -2) also stimulate the activities of tolloid proteinases, in a substrate-specific manner (28Moali C. Font B. Ruggiero F. Eichenberger D. Rousselle P.

PCPE-1 has no effect on cleavage of several BMP-1 substrates (28Moali C. Font B. Ruggiero F. Eichenberger D. Rousselle P. Francois V. Oldberg A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol.

In contrast, both PCPE-1 and -2 have been shown to stimulate the activities of tolloid proteinases during cleavage of the C-propeptide regions of the major fibrillar procollagens (types I, II, and III) (28Moali C.

Targeted deletion of the PCPE-1 gene has recently been shown to lead to aberrant collagen fibril formation and impaired biomechanical properties of bone tissue (32Steiglitz B.M. Kreider J.M. Frankenburg E.P. Pappano W.N. Hoffman G.G. Meganck J.A. Liang X. Hook M. Birk D.E. Goldstein S.A. Greenspan D.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).PCPEs are extracellular glycoproteins, devoid of intrinsic proteolytic activity, consisting of two CUB domains followed by a C-terminal NTR domain (31Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Enzymatic removal of the NTR domain has no effect on enhancement of tolloid proteinase activity, showing that this is a property of the CUB domain region (33Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Hulmes D.J.S. Mould A.P. Kessler E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of action of PCPEs is not well understood, this probably involves binding to the substrate, because maximum enhancing activity is found for PCPE: procollagen molar ratio of at least 1:1. BIAcore studies have shown that PCPE-1 binds to both the C-propeptide region as well as elsewhere in the procollagen molecule (35Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D.

Recent studies using a miniprocollagen III substrate have shown that enhancing activity is unaffected by removal of essentially all of the triple-helical region using highly purified bacterial collagenase (28Moali C. Font B. Ruggiero F. Eichenberger D. Rousselle P. Francois V. Oldberg A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24188-24194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that PCPE-1 binds to the non-triple-helical telopeptide region N-terminal to the BMP-1 cleavage site, in addition to the C-propeptide region, thereby inducing a conformational change that facilitates the action of BMP-1. It is also possible that PCPE-1 binds to tolloid proteinases, as recently shown for mTLL-1 (36Ge G. Zhang Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10786-10798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism of action of PCPE-1, it is important to identify recognition sites within the CUB domains involved in enhancing activity. Here, we show that these involve a putative calcium binding site in the CUB1 domain, as well as a site specific to the CUB1 domain of PCPEs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling—The three-dimensional model of the CUB1 domain of human PCPE-1 (residues 12–124, numbered from the N terminus of the mature protein, i.e. after cleavage of the signal peptide) was built with the comparative molecular modeling program Geno3D (37Combet C. Jambon M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), using the CUB domain structure with the highest sequence homology, namely the CUB2 domain of rat MASP-2 (22Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ten three-dimensional structures were generated and superimposed with the ANTHEPROT three-dimensional package (38Deleage G. Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Comput. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The quality of the models was assessed using PROCHECK, and the most representative model, with the lowest energy, was selected.Recombinant Proteins—The BMP-1 FLAG construct was obtained by PCR using the BMP-1 cDNA inserted in pCEP4 as a template (28Moali C.

After sequencing and transfection in 293-EBNA cells, a clone was selected that gave the highest BMP-1 level of expression. This clone was used for further amplification and production of the protein.For site-directed mutagenesis and production of PCPE mutants, an 8-histidine tag was inserted by PCR into the human PCPE-1 cDNA (28Moali C.

This construct was used as a template to generate all the PCPE-1 mutants using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Overlapping oligonucleotides (Table 1) were purchased from MWG-BIOTECH (Courtaboeuf, France). The mutated inserts were then subcloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) using the KpnI and BamHI sites for semi-stable transfections into 293-EBNA cells (28Moali C. Font B. Ruggiero F. Eichenberger D.

BMP-1-FLAG-containing fractions (according to SDS-PAGE) were dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) plus 0.25 m NaCl, and loaded onto an Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with Buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, bound BMP-1-FLAG was eluted using 0.25 mg/ml FLAG peptide dissolved in Buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, then extensively dialyzed against the same buffer without peptide. We checked that the purified protein was devoid of endogenous PCPEs.For His-tagged PCPE-1 and its mutants, conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove cell debris and incubated with nickel-agarose equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl (buffer B). The resin was then packed into a column and washed with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 0.25 m imidazole in buffer B, and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline.Enzymatic Activities—BMP-1 activity was measured as previously described (28Moali C.

Proteins (0.3–1 mg/ml) were analyzed at 25 °C in 20 mm KH2PO4/NaOH, 150 mm NaF, pH 7.2. Spectra were measured with a wavelength increment of 0.2 nm, integration time of 1 s, and bandpass of 2 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (using absorbances calculated for each mutant based on the amino acid sequence) as well as by the Bradford assay, normalizing the latter to a known concentration of wild-type PCPE-1. Secondary structure analysis was carried out on the DICHROWEB server (39Whitmore L.

Emission was recorded between 295 and 400 nm after excitation at 280 nm (excitation slits: 8 nm; emission slits: 4 nm) with a scanning rate of 1 nm/s. PCPE-1 was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl and diluted to 2.5 μm in a total volume of 500 μl of the same buffer. EGTA and CaCl2 were added in 1-μl volumes. Fluorescence spectra were recorded 5 min after each addition and corrected for fluorescence of the buffer (containing or not EGTA and/or calcium). The effect of EGTA and calcium was also measured on a control solution of 5.4 μm N-acetyltryptophan amide (NATA) to check that changes in fluorescence were not due to absorption by added compounds (40Divita G. Di Pietro A. Roux B. Gautheron D.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5791-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance analyses were carried out on a BIAcore 3000 instrument. Mini-procollagen III was covalently coupled to a CM4 sensor chip after activation with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (amine coupling) and injection in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. Unreacted groups on the surface were neutralized with ethanolamine hydrochloride. The whole procedure was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A control flow cell was prepared similarly except that the mini-procollagen III solution was replaced by 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. The signal recorded on the control flow cell was automatically subtracted from those of the other flow cells. Prior to analysis, ligands were dialyzed against HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% P20 surfactant), and binding was monitored at 25 °C in the same buffer (containing or not 5 mm CaCl2) at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. Regeneration was carried out with 2 m guanidinium chloride when experiments were run in the absence of added calcium or with sequential injections of 0.25 m EDTA and 2 m guanidinium chloride in the presence of 5 mm calcium.

Relatively few electron transport pathways to P450s have been characterized in bacteria, particularly streptomycete species. One of the 18 P450s in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), P450 105D5, was found to bind fatty acids tightly and form hydroxylated products when electrons were delivered from heterologous systems. The six ferredoxin (Fdx) and four flavoprotein Fdx reductase (FDR) proteins coded by genes in S. coelicolor were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to characterize the electron transfer pathway. Of the many possibilities, the primary pathway was NADH → FDR1 → Fdx4 → P450 105D5. The genes coding for FDR1, Fdx4, and P450 105D5 are located close together in the S. coelicolor genome. Several fatty acids examined were substrates, including those found in S. coelicolor extracts, and all yielded several products. Mass spectra of the products of lauric acid imply the 8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-hydroxy derivatives. Hydroxylated fatty acids were also detected in vivo in S. coelicolor. Rates of electron transfer between the proteins were measured; all steps were faster than overall hydroxylation and consistent with rates of NADH oxidation. Substrate binding, product release, and oxygen binding were relatively fast in the catalytic cycle; high kinetic deuterium isotope effects for all four lauric acid hydroxylations indicated that the rate of C–H bond breaking is rate-limiting in every case.

Many of the bacterial P450s catalyze reactions of environmental or medical significance. The actinomycete species produce a wealth of natural products, including about two-thirds of the antibiotics used in medical practice today. These antibiotics are presumably produced by these bacteria as a defense mechanism against neighboring microorganisms in the environment; various other roles have been postulated for the other natural products.

Various bacterial P450s accept electrons from either flavoproteins or Fdx proteins (which receive them from FDRs) (9Paine M. Scrutton N.S. Munro A. Gutierrez A. Roberts G. Wolf C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 115-148Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In one seemingly unusual case in Sulfolobus solfataricus, a pyruvate oxidase (containing thiamine pyrophosphate) transfers electrons to a Fdx, which in turn reduces P450 119A1 (10Puchkaev A.V. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The streptomycete species examined thus far contain a plethora of Fdx and FDR proteins, and attempts to discern the relevant electron transfer pathways have not been carried out in sufficient detail. Nearly all of the conclusions about the catalytic activities of Streptomyces P450s have come from studies in which electrons are shuttled from heterologous electron transfer components (11O'Keefe D.P. Gibson K.J. Emptage M.H. Lenstra R. Romesser J.A. Litle P.J. Omer C.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), most commonly commercially available spinach FDR and Fdx. We expressed and purified an S. coeliclor P450, P450 105D5, and 10 potential electron transfer proteins, including four FDR and six Fdx proteins. With these, we established the primary electron transfer pathway used by this P450 in the hydroxylation of fatty acids, including several present in the organism that may be considered as potential physiological substrates. Chemicals—Streptavidin-peroxidase, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, spinach Fdx and FDR, lauric acid, myristic acid, [1-14C]myristic acid (specific activity 24 mCi mmol–1), palmitic acid, [1-14C]palmitic acid (specific activity 56 mCi mmol–1), oleic acid, [1-14C]oleic acid (specific activity 54 mCi mmol–1), linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, [1-14C]arachidonic acid (specific activity 50 mCi mmol–1), 12-hydroxylauric acid, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were purchased from Sigma. [1-14C]Lauric acid (specific activity 55 mCi mmol–1) was from GE Healthcare. [1-14C]Linoleic acid (specific activity 51 mCi mmol–1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d23-Lauric acid was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). N,O-bis-(Trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane) and succinimidyl-6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamidohexanoate were from Pierce. Oligonucleotides for cDNA synthesis were purchased from Operon (Huntsville, AL). All oligonucleotides were of salt-free quality and were used directly without further purification. Pseudomonas putida PDR and Pdx were kindly donated by Dr. T. Poulos (University of California). Escherichia coli flavodoxin reductase was prepared as described elsewhere (12Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli Flx was purified as described earlier (12Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from sources described previously or were of the highest quality commercially available. Synthesis of 11-Hydroxylauric Acid—The material was prepared by the treatment of 11-decenoic acid (Indofine, Hillsborough, NJ) with mercuric acetate followed by NaBH4 (13Brown H.C. Geoghegan Jr., P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 1522-1524Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Reich N.O. J. Biol.

Gene Synthesis and Cloning of FDR4—The genetic sequence information for FDR4 (designated as SCO2106/SC2C1A.02 in the genome) was obtained from the Streptomyces genome sequence data base (available on the World Wide Web at streptomyces.org.uk), and automatic codon optimization for E. coli (and oligonucleotide design for PCR-based gene synthesis) was performed using DNAWorks 3.1 (available on the World Wide Web at helixweb.nih.gov/dnaworks/) as described previously (15Wu Z.-L. Sohl C.D. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thirty-four overlapping oligonucleotides for the synthesis of the FDR4 gene were selected using the DNA-Works program (supplemental Table S1). To facilitate the sub-cloning, NdeI and HindIII restriction sites were inserted at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and a sequence coding for a C-terminal His5 protein tag (5′-CACCACCATCACCAT-3′) was added before the TAG stop codon in order to use Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography for protein purification. Oligonucleotide assembly was performed by PCR, using the 34 designed primers (supplemental Table S1), with 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 120 s. Using the assembled oligonucleotides, the FDR4 cDNA was amplified using a sense primer (5′-TAGGAGGTCATATGGTCGTTGTAGGTGCAGGCATGGCGGGAGT-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TACCAAGCTTCTAATGGTGATGGTGGTGTGCTGTAGCCGCGGTAGCTGCTTTCAGCGG-3′) with 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. PCR fragments were excised from the gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified PCR fragment was subcloned in a pET-17b prokaryotic expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using NdeI and HindIII sites. The cloned plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The cloned plasmids were isolated, and the correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed using an Applied Biosystems model 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Vanderbilt facility. Expression and Purification of Recombinant S. coelicolor FDR1 and FDR4—The plasmids coding for FDR1 and FDR4 (designated as SCO2106/SCF15.02 and SCO2106/SC2C1A.02 in gene annotation tables, respectively) were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. A single ampicillin-resistant colony of the transformed cells was selected and grown in overnight culture to saturation at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. A 10-ml aliquot was used to inoculate each liter of Terrific Broth medium, which contained 0.2% bactopeptone (w/v), trace elements, and 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. Upon reaching an A600 of 1.0, the cells were induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 1 μgml–1 chloramphenicol. The temperature was cooled to 25 °C, and the cells were further cultured for 24 h with shaking at 180 rpm in a New Brunswick Inova shaker (New Brunswick, Edison, NJ). After incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6.5 × 103 × g for 20 min. Spheroplasts were prepared using lysozyme and disrupted by sonication. The cellular sonicates were centrifuged at 104 × g for 20 min, and the cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 105 × g for 90 min (to remove insoluble material). The cytosolic fraction was applied to a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5% Tween 20 (v/v), and 0.10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was washed with 50 column volumes of the same buffer followed by a second wash with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The FDR proteins were eluted using a stepwise gradient increasing from 40 to 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 20% glycerol (v/v) and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The FDR proteins were eluted using a linear gradient increasing from 0 to 0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further resolved on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) with the same buffer. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. FDR1 and FDR4, as well as FDR2 and FDR3, were electrophoretically homogeneous and showed the expected flavin spectra (Fig. 1). Pooled fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore) and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.10 mm dithiothreitol at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Other Recombinant Proteins—S. coelicolor P450s, FDRs, and Fdx proteins were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) (4Lamb D.C. Skaug T. Song H.-L. Jackson C.J. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kell D.B. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24000-24005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Four histidine residues were engineered into the C terminus of the recombinant proteins for ease of purification. In the cases of expression of Fdx1, Fdx3, and Fdx6, an automatic codon optimization to suit the codon preference bias of E. coli and oligonucleotide design for PCR-based gene synthesis was performed commercially by DNA 2.0, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA). The P450 105D5 (3SCF60.06c) (supplemental Fig. S1) 107U1 (SCE41.08c), 154A1 (SCE6.21), 154C1 (SC6D11.13c), 158A2 (2SCG58. 07); FDR2 (SCO7117/SC4B10.18c), and FDR3 (SCO2469/SC7A8.08c) (Fig. 1); and Fdx1 (SCO7110/SC4B10.11), Fdx2 (SCO5135/SC9E12.20), Fdx3 (SCO7676/SC4C2.11), Fdx4 (SCO0773/3SCF60.05c), Fdx5 (SCO3867/SCH18.04c), and Fdx6 (SCO1649/SCI41.32) (supplemental Fig. S2) proteins (S. coelicolor annotated gene names in parentheses) were expressed essentially by the methods described above, except that the chaperone groEL/ES was also co-expressed in these systems, and the expression was conducted at 22 °C for 30–40 h after treatment with 1 mm isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 4 mg ml–1 l-(+)-arabinose. The cytosolic fraction of the cell lysates obtained after centrifugation at 8 × 104 × g (60 min) was applied to the Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol (v/v). The column was washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% sodium cholate (w/v), and 8 mm imidazole, and the His-tagged proteins were then eluted with the same buffer containing 80 mm imidazole. The eluates were directly applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Fast-flow) column that had been equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.10 mm EDTA, and 0.10 mm dithiothreitol. After the column was washed with the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, the proteins were eluted with this buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The purified P450 and FDR enzymes were dialyzed three times against 100-fold volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.10 mm EDTA, and 0.10 mm dithiothreitol. Fdx proteins were stored at –80 °C without dialysis because of the low Mr. Assays of Rates of Electron Transfer to Artificial Acceptors—Rates of FDR electron transfer were determined by measuring cytochrome c reduction or NBT reduction. Cytochrome c reduction assays were done in 0.30 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) containing 100 nm FDR and 40 μm horse heart cytochrome c. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADH and followed by the increase in absorbance at 550 nm using an Aminco DW-2a/OLIS spectrophotometer. For measurement of rates of NBT reduction, the reactions were done in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 nm FDR and 200 μm NBT. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 200 μm NADH (or NADPH) and followed by the increase in absorbance at 535 nm. Concentration changes were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 18.3 mm–1 cm–1 for NBT. Protein-Protein Interactions—Interactions between P450, FDR, and Fdx proteins were examined using a streptavidin-biotin method as described elsewhere (16Shimada T. Mernaugh R.L. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 435: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, varying concentrations of purified enzymes, in 50 μl of PBS, were applied to the wells of a Nunc 384-well polystyrene plate (Fisher) and incubated in a humid atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature. After binding of enzymes to the wells, unreacted material was removed by extensively washing the wells with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v). Biotinylation of purified enzymes was done by incubating proteins with a 2-fold molar excess of succinimidyl-6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamidohexanoate in PBS at room temperature for 2 h in the dark. Samples were diluted (166-fold) with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm glycine (volume 50 μl) to quench the residual succinimide reagent, and the biotinylated proteins (in a 50-μl volume) were applied to the wells in which the free enzymes had been attached. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the unbound biotinylated proteins were removed by washing the wells six times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v). A streptavidin-peroxidase solution (50 μl) was added to the wells, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed again with PBS. Peroxidase substrate (50 μl of a solution of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.2) containing 90 mm 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and 0.05 mm H2O2) was added to each well, and substrate color intensities were measured at 405 nm using an ELX800NB plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Spectral Binding Titrations—Purified P450 105D5 was diluted to 1 μm in 0.10 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and divided between two cuvettes. Spectra (350–500 nm) were recorded with subsequent additions of fatty acids, using an Aminco DW-2a/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). The difference in absorbance between the wavelength maximum (390 nm) and minimum (418 nm) (ΔA390 – A418) was plotted versus the substrate concentration to estimate Ks, with analysis using hyperbolic or quadratic equations as appropriate (17Johnson K.A. Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2003: 1-18Google Scholar, 18Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Spectral dissociation constants (Ks) were estimated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) with fits to a quadratic equation using the following form, Ks=([E]total-[EL])([L]total-[EL])[EL](Eq. 1) with E denoting enzyme and L denoting ligand, and Equation 2, [EL]=0.5(Ks+Et+Lt)-0.5((Ks+Et+Lt)2-4EtLr)1/2(Eq. 2) with the following expression, Y=B+(A/2)×(1/E)×((KS+E+X)-((KS+E+X)2-(4×E×X))) utilized in Prism whenever a preliminary hyperbolic fit yielded an apparent Ks value less than 3-fold greater than the total enzyme concentration. Enzymatic Assays for Fatty Acid Hydroxylation—The hydroxylation of fatty acids was generally measured by incubating purified P450 105D5 (1 μm) with either Fdx, Pdx, or Flx (1 μm) and either FDR, PDR, or flavodoxin reductase (1 μm), respectively, in a standard reaction mixture containing substrates (e.g. [1-14C]oleic acid (8 μm, 0.2 μCi) or [1-14C]lauric acid (7.3 μm, 0.2 μCi)) in 0.10 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mm NADH or NADPH. After 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of a 1 m HCl, 2 m NaCl solution. The products and residual substrate were extracted twice with 0.7 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was reduced to dryness under an N2 stream, and the residue was dissolved in CH3CN for HPLC analysis. The products and residual substrate were separated using a 3-μm Prodigy octadecylsilane (C18) HPLC column (4.6 × 150 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase (0.2% CH3CO2H in H2O/CH3CN mixtures, v/v) program began with a 20:80 ratio of the two solvents (v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min–1, followed by a linear gradient to 10:90 (v/v) H2O/CH3CN for 10 min, and then followed by a linear gradient to 100% CH3CN for 2 min and held at 100% CH3CN for 20 min. The chromatography apparatus was attached to a β-RAM Flow-Through System model 2 (IN/US Systems, Tampa, FL) flow counter. Characterization of Hydroxylated Fatty Acids by GC-MS—In vitro incubations were carried out under the same conditions as described above except using 100 μm concentrations of fatty acid substrates. After drying the extracts under a stream of N2, each residue was mixed with 100 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (w/v) at 60 °C for 1 h. After derivatization, the samples were directly analyzed on a ThermoFinnigan TRACE GC 2000 gas chromatograph coupled to a Finnigan Trace GC DSQ mass-selective detector (ThermoFinnigan, Austin, TX). The capillary column Omegawax 320 (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) was obtained from Supelco (Bellefont, PA). The temperature program for this analysis had an initial temperature of 80 °C, held for 1 min, and was then increased at 15 °C per min to 140 °C, at 5 °C per min to 180 °C, at 25 °C per min to 280 °C, and then held at 280 °C for 3 min. Mass spectra were recorded in the scanning EI mode. For the in vivo analyses, S. coelicolor was grown on yeast extract malt extract medium for 3 days. The cells were separated from the media by centrifugation, washed with H2O twice, suspended in 0.5 ml of H2O, and sonicated for 3 min using the probe tip of a VWR sonicator. The cell pellet suspension was adjusted to pH 1–2 using concentrated HCl. A Folch solvent (1.0 ml of a CHCl3/CH3OH mixture, 2:1, v/v) was used twice to extract the fatty acids from the cell pellet. The combined Folch extract, containing the fatty acids, was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 0.5 ml of CH2Cl2, to which was added 40 μl of diisopropylethylamine and 10 μl of pentafluorobenzyl bromide. The derivatization reaction temperature was 60 °C, and the reaction time was 60 min. The organic phase was collected and evaporated under a N2 stream. The sample was reconstituted in 200 μl of hexane for GC-MS analysis (EI negative ion mode) using a column described for TMS esters (see above), with a temperature program beginning at 150 °C and increasing to 280 °C over 10 min (and then held at 280 °C for 6 min). Stopped-flow Kinetics—All reactions were measured at 23 °C using an OLIS RSM-1000 system (OLIS, Bogart, GA) in the rapid scanning mode (103 scans s–1) or occasionally at a single wavelength, with a fixed slit. In the anaerobic studies, samples were deaerated in glass 90-ml tonometers using intermittent cycles of vacuum and equilibration with argon gas that had been scrubbed through copper catalytic traps (and a bubbler containing photoreduced safranin T dye) in a manifold system described elsewhere (19Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Except in the case of samples that were mixed with O2 in reactions, the tonometers contained an O2-scrubbing system composed of 0.3 μm glucose oxidase, 0.02 μm catalase, and 0.13 m glucose. The deaerated samples were transferred to the syringes of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer after previous treatment (of the stopped-flow syringes) sequentially with 0.1 m Na2S2O4 (overnight), safranin T, and anaerobic buffer solutions (20Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

In most cases, the results are expressed as means ± S.D. calculated from three or more measurements, and representative traces are presented. The results were processed with the OLIS software, usually extracting kinetic traces from the collection of traces obtained using rapid scanning at the wavelengths showing maximum amplitude changes. In some cases, global fitting/singular value decomposition was used in the analysis. Deuterium Isotope Effects—Incubations were done with the substrate lauric acid (d0 or d23) at a concentration of 50 μm with the reconstituted FDR1/Fdx4/P450 105D5 enzyme system. The products were extracted, derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (w/v) (see above), and analyzed by GC-MS as described (see below). Other Assays—Protein concentrations were estimated using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). P450 concentrations were estimated using previously reported methods (22Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FDR concentrations were estimated from the flavin absorption spectra, using a general ∈450 value of 11.3 mm–1 cm–1. For measurement of NADH oxidation, P450 105D5 was preincubated with Fdx and FDR for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of lauric acid (20 μm). Reactions were initiated with the addition of 200 μm NADH, and the decrease in A340 was monitored using a Cary14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems). Rates were calculated using the extinction coefficient Δ∈340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1. 7-Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (23Prough R.A. Burke M.D. Mayer R.T.

Interaction of Fatty Acids with P450 105D5—The initial studies on the separation and reconstitution of the mammalian P450 system were done using fatty acid hydroxylation (26Lu A.Y.H. Coon M.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2078952999,"In humans, the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and the potent chemotactic lipid leukotriene B4 (LTB4) are important mediators of innate immunity and host defense. Here we show that LTB4, at very low (1 nM) concentrations, strongly promotes release of LL-37 peptides from human neutrophils (PMNs) in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and antibacterial activity. The LTB4-induced LL-37 release is mediated by the BLT1 receptor, and protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) inhibits the release by suppressing the BLT1-mediated exocytosis of PMN granules. Conversely, LL-37 elicits translocation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) from the cytosol to the perinuclear membrane in PMNs and promotes the synthesis and release of LTB4, particularly from cells primed with LPS or GM-CSF. Furthermore, LL-37 stimulates PMN phagocytosis of Escherichia coli particles, a functional response that is enhanced by LTB4, especially in GM-CSF pretreated cells. In these cells, LL-37 also enhances LTB4-induced phagocytosis. Hence, in human PMNs, positive feedback circuits exist between LL-37 and LTB4 that reciprocally stimulate the release of these mediators with the potential for synergistic bioactions and enhanced immune responses. Moreover, these novel lipid-peptide signaling pathways may offer new opportunities for pharmacological intervention and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2157645762,"The target calcium store of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), the most potent endogenous calcium-mobilizing compound known to date, has been proposed to reside in the lysosomal compartment or in the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum. This study was performed to test the hypothesis of a lysosomal versus an endoplasmic reticular calcium store sensitive to NAADP in T-lymphocytes. Pretreatment of intact Jurkat T cells with glycyl-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide largely reduced staining of lysosomes by LysoTracker Red and abolished NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling. However, the inhibitory effect was not specific since Ca2+ mobilization by d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose was abolished, too. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the lysosomal H+-ATPase, did not block or reduce NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling, although it effectively prevented labeling of lysosomes by LysoTracker Red. Further, previous T cell receptor/CD3 stimulation in the presence of bafilomycin A1, assumed to block refilling of lysosomal Ca2+ stores, did not antagonize subsequent NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling. In contrast to bafilomycin A1, emptying of the endoplasmic reticulum by thapsigargin almost completely prevented Ca2+ signaling induced by NAADP. In conclusion, in T-lymphocytes, no evidence for involvement of lysosomes in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling was obtained. The sensitivity of NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling toward thapsigargin, combined with our recent results identifying ryanodine receptors as the target calcium channel of NAADP (Dammermann, W., and Guse, A. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 21394–21399), rather suggest that the target calcium store of NAADP in T cells is the endoplasmic reticulum. The target calcium store of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), the most potent endogenous calcium-mobilizing compound known to date, has been proposed to reside in the lysosomal compartment or in the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum. This study was performed to test the hypothesis of a lysosomal versus an endoplasmic reticular calcium store sensitive to NAADP in T-lymphocytes. Pretreatment of intact Jurkat T cells with glycyl-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide largely reduced staining of lysosomes by LysoTracker Red and abolished NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling. However, the inhibitory effect was not specific since Ca2+ mobilization by d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose was abolished, too. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the lysosomal H+-ATPase, did not block or reduce NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling, although it effectively prevented labeling of lysosomes by LysoTracker Red. Further, previous T cell receptor/CD3 stimulation in the presence of bafilomycin A1, assumed to block refilling of lysosomal Ca2+ stores, did not antagonize subsequent NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling. In contrast to bafilomycin A1, emptying of the endoplasmic reticulum by thapsigargin almost completely prevented Ca2+ signaling induced by NAADP.

Although InsP3 and cADPR are firmly established as second messengers, receptor-mediated formation of NAADP has yet been shown in a limited number of cellular systems only (7Masgrau R. Churchill G.C.

The search for the target organelle and the molecular receptor for NAADP has attracted much attention in the last years. Lee et al. (10Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated different subcellular localizations of the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ pool versus the InsP3- and cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ pools in stratified sea urchin eggs. This NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ pool was identified as the reserve granule in sea urchin eggs, an organelle related to lysosomes (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A.

In addition, pharmacological and partial biochemical characterization suggests expression of a novel NAADP receptor/Ca2+ channel in sea urchin eggs (1Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol.

In a few higher eukaryotic cell types, evidence for the involvement of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling has been published. NAADP activated purified RyR from heart and skeletal muscle in lipid planar bilayers (16Mojzisova A. Krizanova O. Zacikova L. Kominkova V. Ondrias K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

In addition, NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from the nuclear envelope of pancreatic acinar cells and from permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells was blocked by RyR antagonists (18Gerasimenko J.V.

In human Jurkat T-lymphocytes, we have demonstrated: (i) TCR-CD3-mediated formation of NAADP (9Gasser A. Bruhn S. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), (ii) Ca2+ signaling induced by microinjection of NAADP in a concentration-dependent fashion (6Berg I. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), (iii) that NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling consists of both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry (6Berg I. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and (iv) involvement of RyR in both local and global Ca2+ signaling (20Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Dammermann W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21394-21399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we confirm that lysosomes can be functionally destroyed using either hypertonic swelling and physical destruction by glycyl-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) or inhibition of the lysosomal H+-ATPase using bafilomycin A1 (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although GPN pretreatment resulted in loss of Ca2+-mobilizing activity of all three second messengers, NAADP, cADPR, and InsP3, there was no inhibitory effect of bafilomycin A1 on any of the Ca2+-mobilizing compounds, even when endogenous Ca2+ stores were previously emptied by TCR-CD3 stimulation in the presence of bafilomycin A1. In contrast, emptying the endoplasmic reticular (ER) Ca2+ store by thapsigargin almost completely prevented Ca2+ signaling induced by NAADP. Taken together, our data indicate a major role for the ER, but not for lysosomes, in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in T cells. Materials—NAADP, GPN, GdCl3, and bafilomycin A1 (lot 1) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). cADPR was obtained from Biolog (Bremen, Germany). Fura-2/AM, bafilomycin A1 (lots 2 and 3), cathepsin inhibitor 1, and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. InsP3 was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). The anti-CD3 mouse monoclonal antibody OKT3 was purified from hybridoma supernatant on protein G-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). LysoTracker Red DND-99 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell Culture—Jurkat T-lymphocytes (subclone JMP) were cultured as described previously (22Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging—The cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM as described (22Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and kept in the dark at room temperature until use. Thin glass coverslips (0.1 mm) were coated first with bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) and subsequently with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). Silicon grease was used to seal small chambers consisting of a rubber O-ring on the glass coverslip. Then, 60 μl of buffer A containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 40 μl of cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) suspended in the same buffer were added into the small chamber (6Berg I. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the coverslip was mounted on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMIRE2). In some experiments, GdCl3 (10 or 100 μm) was added to buffer A to block capacitative Ca2+ entry; in these experiments, buffer A without Na2HPO4 was used to prevent precipitation of GdPO4. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed as described recently (23Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used an Improvision imaging system (Tübingen, Germany) build around the Leica microscope at 100-fold magnification. Illumination at 340 and 380 nm was carried out using a monochromator system (Polychrom IV, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Images were taken with a gray-scale CCD camera (type C 4742-95-12ER; Hamamatsu, Enfield, United Kingdom) operated in 8-bit mode. The spatial resolution was 512 × 640 pixels at 100-fold magnification. Camera exposure times were 12 ms (at 340 nm) and 4 ms (at 380 nm). The acquisition rate was adjusted to ∼14 ratios/min. Raw data images were stored on a hard disk. Confocal Ca2+ images were obtained by off-line deconvolution (no-neighbor algorithm) using the volume deconvolution module of the Openlab software as described recently for 3T3 fibroblasts (24Bruzzone S. Kunerth S. Zocchi E. De Flora A. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The deconvolved images were used to construct ratio images (340/380 nm) pixel by pixel. Finally, ratio values were converted into Ca2+ concentrations by external calibration (23Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Data processing was performed using Openlab software, version 3.0.8 or 1.7.8 (Improvision). Microinjection—Microinjections were carried out as described (25Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used an Eppendorf system (transjector type 5246, micromanipulator type 5171, Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, Hamburg, Germany) with Femtotips I and II as pipettes. NAADP, InsP3, or cADPR were diluted to their final concentration in intracellular buffer (20 mm HEPES, 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and filtered (0.2 μm) before use. Injections were made using the semiautomatic mode of the system with following instrumental settings: injection pressure 60–90 hectopascals, compensatory pressure 30–50 hectopascals, injection time 0.3–0.5 s, and velocity of the pipette 700 μm/s. Staining of Lysosomes—Lysosomes were labeled by incubation of cells with 75 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were added into small chambers (see above), and fluorescence was determined at excitation and emission wavelengths of 575 and 590 nm using the Improvision imaging system as described above. Then, cells were treated either with 50 μm GPN, 10 μm cathepsin inhibitor 1, plus 50 μm GPN or with Me2SO (0.1% v/v or 0.2% v/v) for 15 min at room temperature. To analyze the effect of bafilomycin A1 on LysoTracker staining, untreated cells were incubated with different concentrations of bafilomycin A1 or 0.1% v/v Me2SO as control for 15 min at room temperature, and afterward, lysosomes were labeled with Lyso-Tracker Red DND-99 as described above (26Sun-Wada G-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 277: 18098-18105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of Bafilomycin A1—RP-HPLC analysis of bafilomycin A1 was performed on a 250 × 4.6-mm Multohyp BDS C18-5μ column (CS Chromatographie Service, Langerwehe, Germany) equipped with a 4.0 × 3.0-mm guard cartridge containing a C18 (ODS) filter element (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with phosphate buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 6) containing increasing amounts of methanol. The gradient used for separation was as follows (number in parentheses represents the percentage of methanol): 0 min (5), 2 min (5), 16 min (100), 20 min (100), 22 min (5), 25 min (5). Bafilomycin A1 was detected using a Diode Array Detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) at 246 nm. To analyze whether in Jurkat T-lymphocytes lysosomes represent a Ca2+ store sensitive to NAADP, we treated intact cells with GPN, a substrate of cathepsin C. Via osmotic lysis, the metabolic products of GPN selectively disrupt lysosomal membranes (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27Jadot M. Comant C. Wattiaux-de Conick S. Wattiaux R. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resulting significant loss of lysosome staining by LysoTracker Red was confirmed in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1A). GPN increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by lysing the lysosomes (Fig. 1, B–D, right panels). As described for sea urchin eggs (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), GPN also abolished NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release in T cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). However, Ca2+ release by InsP3 or cADPR was eliminated, too (Fig. 1, C and D, right panels). Therefore, we used cathepsin inhibitor 1, which is known to reduce the damaging effect of GPN by inhibition of cathepsin B, L, and S and also papain released from the lysosomes. Since cathepsin inhibitor 1 does not inhibit cathepsin C, the disruption of lysosomes by GPN should be unaffected (19Gerasimenko J.V. Sherwood M. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This was indeed confirmed since the intensity of lysosomes labeled with LysoTracker Red after incubation with cathepsin inhibitor 1 (10 μm) plus GPN (50 μm) was reduced similarly as compared with the control (Fig. 1A). However, treatment with cathepsin inhibitor 1 and GPN not only blocked NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release, but also, Ca2+ release by InsP3 or cADPR was abolished in Jurkat T-lymphocytes (data not shown) as shown above for GPN alone. Thus, although GPN appears to be a powerful tool to destroy lysosomes, the release of lysosomal proteases or other hydrolases seems to interfere with all Ca2+ release systems present in T cells. Since cADPR and InsP3 are supposed to target the ER, the data obtained with GPN do not allow a clear-cut decision as to whether NAADP solely acts on lysosomes. As a second approach, we investigated the effect of bafilomycin A1 on global Ca2+ signals induced by NAADP. Bafilomycin A1 is an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-pumps powered by ATP (28Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), prevents organelle acidification, and blocks the Ca2+ reuptake into lysosomes via Ca2+/H+-exchanger since this transport protein requires a proton gradient (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). As LysoTracker Red DND-99 is a weak base and accumulates in acidic compartments, preincubation with bafilomycin A1 concentration-dependently reduced or abolished labeling of lysosomes with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (26Sun-Wada G-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 277: 18098-18105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a result that was confirmed in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2A). For our experiments, we used different lots of bafilomycin A1 purchased from different suppliers. Identity, purity, and content were confirmed by HPLC (Fig. 2B). Then, cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of bafilomycin A1 or vehicle (Me2SO 0.1% v/v) and microinjected with 100 nm NAADP (Fig. 2, C–G). No reduction of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling was observed after preincubation with bafilomycin A1 at concentrations up to 1 μm (Fig. 2, C–G). In contrast, a slight increase of the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ peak at 250 nm bafilomycin A1 was detected as compared with the control (Fig. 2, E and G). Bafilomycin A1 at a concentration that almost completely abolished the lysosome H+ gradient did not affect InsP3- or cADPR-mediated Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 3). Since InsP3 and cADPR have been shown to release Ca2+ from the ER, this control experiment suggests that bafilomycin A1, in contrast to GPN (Fig. 1), in principle can be used to analyze the role of lysosomes in T cell Ca2+ signaling.FIGURE 3Effect of bafilomycin A1 (Baf) on Ca2+ release by InsP3 and cADPR in intact Jurkat T-lymphocytes. A–D, Jurkat T cells were loaded with Fura-2 and subjected to combined Ca2+ imaging and microinjection as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The time points of microinjections are indicated by arrows. Cells were preincubated with Me2SO (DMSO) (0.1% v/v, A and C) or 12.5 nm bafilomycin A1 (B and D) and microinjected with 4 μm InsP3 (A and B) or 100 μm cADPR (C and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lysosomes are supposed to be very tight Ca2+ stores, with almost no passive leak of Ca2+ ions into the cytosol (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T-lymphocytes, TCR-CD3 stimulation is known to increase intracellular NAADP levels (9Gasser A. Bruhn S. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If lysosomes are the organelles targeted by NAADP, stimulation via the TCR-CD3 complex in the presence of bafilomycin A1 should lead to Ca2+ depletion of lysosomal stores. As bafilomycin A1 inhibits the Ca2+ reuptake in lysosomes, a second increase of the NAADP level via microinjection should show a reduced or abolished NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release. However, Ca2+ signaling by NAADP after preincubation with bafilomycin A1 and subsequent stimulation via TCR-CD3 was not different from untreated controls, indicating no major role for bafilomycin A1-sensitive compartments in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 4). Since no evidence for an involvement for lysosomes in NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling was obtained, the alternative hypothesis (the ER as NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores) was taken into account. Although the specific inhibitor of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA), thapsigargin (29Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar), is an effective and specific tool to deplete ER/SR-type Ca2+ stores, in intact, electrically non-excitable cells, there is often the problem of capacitative Ca2+ entry being switched on immediately (30Gouy H. Cefai D. Christensen S.B. Debre P. Bismuth G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Thus, to avoid any effects of capacitative Ca2+ entry, all further experiments were conducted in the presence of GdCl3 in the extracellular buffer. Under these conditions, microinjection of 100 nm NAADP resulted in transient elevations of [Ca2+]i with most of the cells returning to basal values within a few hundred seconds (Fig. 5A). Also, the mean amplitude of the initial peak induced by NAADP was significantly decreased in the absence of Ca2+ entry (compare Fig. 5A, right panel, with Fig. 2C, right panel). Thapsigargin also induced a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i, indicating rapid depletion of the ER and no concomitant activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fig. 5B). A second activation of thapsigargin confirmed that the ER Ca2+ stores have indeed been depleted (Fig. 5B). Then, ER Ca2+ stores were depleted by thapsigargin, and NAADP was subsequently microinjected (Fig. 5C); almost none of the cells responded to NAADP (7 out of 9 cells). In a complimentary approach, the intracellular store sensitive to NAADP was partially depleted by microinjection of NAADP in the presence of GdCl3; then, the filling states of both the ER and the lysosomes were analyzed by the addition of either thapsigargin or GPN (Fig. 6). When compared with controls (injections of intracellular buffer instead of NAADP), the filling state of the ER was decreased slightly (Fig. 6, A, B, and E), whereas the content of the lysosomal store was unaffected (Fig. 6, C–E), indicating that NAADP releases Ca2+ from the ER rather than from the lysosomes.FIGURE 6Effect of NAADP on Ca2+ release by thapsigargin (Tg) or GPN in intact Jurkat T-lymphocytes. Jurkat T cells were loaded with Fura-2 and subjected to combined Ca2+ imaging and microinjection as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” All experiments were conducted in the presence of GdCl3 (10 μm) to block capacitative Ca2+ entry. The time points of microinjections and additions of thapsigargin or GPN are indicated by arrows; the time points of thapsigargin or GPN additions were synchronized. After microinjection of 100 nm NAADP or intracellular buffer (IC) as control, thapsigargin (A and B; 1 μm) or GPN (C and D; 50 μm) was added. A quantitative comparison of mean [Ca2+]i at the peak after the addition of thapsigargin or GPN is shown in E; data represent mean values ± S.E. from the time point 400–550 s (mean values and S.E. were calculated from each individual tracing as shown in the overlays).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although not confirmed in a great variety of cells, NAADP has been proposed to be an important second messenger in glucose-stimulated pancreatic β-cells (7Masgrau R.

Thus, at least in these selected cell types, the NAADP/Ca2+ signaling system may play an important role for cellular function. Therefore, important modules of this signaling system are the target organelle and target Ca2+ channel of NAADP. There has been much debate as to whether NAADP acts on a novel receptor/Ca2+ channel or whether RyRs respond to NAADP directly or indirectly, e.g. via a separate binding protein (reviewed in Ref. 32Galione A. Petersen O. Mol. Interv. 2005; 5: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For T cells, we recently demonstrated that functional RyR are required for both local and global Ca2+ signals induced by NAADP (20Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell.

Although RyR are assumed to be localized at the ER (or SR), suggesting that the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ pool is located there, convincing data from other cell systems, including sea urchin eggs (10Lee H.C.

Chem. 2007; 10.1074/jbc.M611167200PubMed Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate involvement of a lysosomal Ca2+ store in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in T cells. The first approach, lysis of lysosomes using the cathepsin substrate GPN, has successfully been used in sea urchin eggs (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and pancreatic acinar cells (33Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7234-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); in sea urchin eggs, GPN-mediated bursting of lysosomes selectively abolished Ca2+ signaling by NAADP but not by InsP3 or cADPR (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This result could not be reproduced in T cells; the Ca2+-mobilizing effects of all three messengers, NAADP, InsP3, or cADPR, were massively reduced. Since bursting of lysosomes is assumed to release proteases and other hydrolases into the cytosol, it is well imaginable that proteolytic attack of the InsP3 receptor or the RyR is the reason for the lack of effect of InsP3 or cADPR. Thus, although the method may work well in other cell types, such as sea urchin eggs, it appears to be not suitable for T cells. The second approach, bafilomycin A1, yielded an even better loss of staining of the lysosomes in intact Jurkat T cells (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 2A), indicating that the H+ gradient across the lysosomal membrane was effectively destroyed. Lack of lysosomal staining was almost completed at 25 nm bafilomycin A1. However, NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling was not affected by up to 1000 nm bafilomycin A1 in T cells. In contrast, in sea urchin eggs, bafilomycin A1 inhibited Ca2+ release induced by NAADP in experiments where NAADP was liberated from caged NAADP subsequently two times. Interestingly, the Ca2+ release induced by the first uncaging of NAADP was not influenced, whereas the second one was largely reduced (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Churchill et al. (11Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) suggested, “that the lysosomal Ca2+ store is replete and non-leaky in resting cells, and that bafilomycin sensitivity is only revealed once the store is mobilized, making its inhibition use-dependent.” However, in higher eukaryotic cell types, e.g. in pancreatic acinar cells, bafilomycin A1 inhibited cholecystokinin-induced Ca2+ spiking without prior emptying of stores (33Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7234-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, glucose-induced Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic β-cells (MIN6 cells) was abrogated by bafilomycin A1 (33Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7234-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, in higher eukaryotic cells, the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores obviously are not very “non-leaky.” Consequently, the lack of inhibitory effect of bafilomycin A1 on NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals in T cells (Fig. 2) strongly indicates that the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ store of T cells is not the lysosomal compartment. To be on the safe side, and assuming that T cells are more similar to sea urchin eggs than to pancreatic cells concerning a non-leaky NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ store, a further crucial experiment was performed (Fig. 4); T cells were first stimulated via the TCR-CD3 complex in the presence of bafilomycin A1, and then NAADP was microinjected. TCR-CD3 stimulation elevates NAADP in a biphasic manner (9Gasser A. Bruhn S. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and thus, Ca2+ present in NAADP-sensitive stores was released. Due to the presence of bafilomycin A1, any reuptake of Ca2+ into acidic stores was inhibited. Nevertheless, there was no inhibition of subsequent Ca2+ signaling induced by microinjection of NAADP, ruling out the possibility that T cells possess a very tight (= non-leaky) NAADP-sensitive lysosomal Ca2+ store. In contrast to the idea that pancreatic acinar cells exclusively possess a lysosomal Ca2+ store sensitive to NAADP, Gerasimenko et al. obtained evidence for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release from the nuclear envelope (18Gerasimenko J.V. Maruyama Y. Yano K. Dolman N.J. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and partially from both the ER and acidic organelles (19Gerasimenko J.V. Sherwood M. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a similar approach in which the activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry was blocked by GdCl3, we emptied ER Ca2+ stores by the addition of thapsigargin. Since subsequent microinjection of NAADP did not induce Ca2+ release in most of the cells investigated, it is very likely that NAADP indeed acts on an endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ store in T cells. In contrast, in the complimentary experiment (prior microinjection of NAADP followed by the addition of thapsigargin), the effect of thapsigargin was reduced as compared with prior microinjection of intracellular buffer (Fig. 6). These data indicate that indeed the filling state of the ER was decreased by approximately 35% by prior injection of NAADP. A similar experiment carried out using GPN instead of thapsigargin to analyze the filling state of the lysosomes resulted in no difference regardless of whether the cells had been microinjected by NAADP or intracellular buffer. Taken together, our results demonstrate a major role for the ER, but not for lysosomes, in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in T cells."

Among human fungal pathogens, Candida albicans plays a dominant role. This opportunistic yeast is responsible for ∼8% of all hospital-acquired fungal infections and poses a serious health risk to immunocompromised individuals, including AIDS patients, cancer patients, diabetics, newborns, and the elderly (1Schaberg D.R. Culver D.H. Gaynes R.P. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: S71-S75Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The remarkable ability to survive and proliferate in a radically changing environment has placed C. albicans as the fifth leading cause of microbial infections in hospital settings (2d'Enfert C.

In contrast, humans lack riboflavin biosynthesis enzymes and must obtain the vitamin from dietary sources. Therefore, the enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway represent potential targets for antibiotic agents. Despite the fact that studies of riboflavin biosynthesis have a long and successful history, the three-dimensional structure of only one C. albicans enzyme involved in riboflavin biosynthesis is available in the Protein Data Bank (8Echt S.

In the following step one riboflavin molecule 4 is synthesized from two molecules of 3 (Fig. 1). Condensation reaction of 2 with the second substrate 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (1) is catalyzed by lumazine synthase (LS). 2The abbreviations used are: LS, lumazine synthase; CALS, C. albicans lumazine synthase; RS, riboflavin synthase; MbtLS, M. tuberculosis lumazine synthase; TS13, 1,3,7-trihydro-9-d-ribityl-2,4,8-purinetrione-7-yl; TS44, 3-(1,3-dihydro-9-d-ribityl-2,4,8-purinetrione-7-yl)propane 1-phosphate; GJ43, 4-(6,7(5H,8H)-dioxo-8-d-ribityllumazin-5-yl)butane 1-phosphate; JC33, [4-(6-chloro-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidin-5-yl)butyl] phosphate. Finally, the dismutation reaction of two molecules of 3 resulting in one molecule of riboflavin and one molecule 1 is catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (RS). LS, which catalyzes the penultimate step in riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, is the target of our interest. This enzyme has been observed in pentameric assembly form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Magnaporthe grisea, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as dimers of pentamers in Brucella abortus and as icosahedral capsids consisting of 60 subunits (12 pentamers) in Bacillus subtilis, Aquifex aeolicus, and Spinacia oleracea (9Meining W.

The comparison of known three-dimensional structures of LS from different species showed a homologous flavodoxin-like fold regardless of the quaternary structures of the enzymes. The folding pattern comprises a central four-stranded β-sheet flanked on both sides by two and three α-helices, respectively. In all LS structures, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentamers. The binding sites of the two lumazine synthase substrates have been identified by crystallography of complexes formed between the enzyme and metabolically stable substrate, intermediate, and product analogues. Formation of lumazine 3 consists of the following steps: substrate binding, nucleophilic attack, formation of a Schiff base intermediate, phosphate elimination, and ring closure (17Kis K. Volk R.

Protein concentration was determined by using published procedures (31Read S.M. Northcote D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE using 16% polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Laemmli with molecular mass standards provided by Sigma (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Crystallization—CALS was crystallized in sitting drops by vapor diffusion. Droplets (1 μl) containing protein solution at a concentration of 7 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 were mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 18.4% of polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.2 m potassium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Small crystals appeared after 1-2 days. After 2-3 weeks of equilibration of the drops against the reservoir solution, those crystals grew to a size of 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm. Crystals were of sufficient quality for x-ray data collection. Data Collection—An x-ray intensity data set was collected at a wavelength of 0.85 Å and an oscillation range of 1° on an MAR Research 345 Image plate detector system (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) beamline BW7B at the EMBL Outstation, Hamburg, Germany) at 100 K from a single crystal using the reservoir solution as a cryoprotectant. Data collection strategy was optimized with the program BEST (33Bourenkov G.P. Popov A.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Space group and cell parameters were determined using the auto-indexing routine in DENZO (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP as implemented in CCP4 (36CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) with the structure of the S. cerevisiae LS (PDB ID: 1EJB) as a Patterson search model. The sequence alignment of CALS with S. cerevisiae LS, performed with Clust-alW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar), revealed a sequence identity of 72.4% (Fig. 2). The asymmetric unit was found to contain three pentamers with a corresponding Matthews coefficient of 2.5 Å3/Da and 50.5% solvent content (38Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). Refinement—The initial model consisting of three pentamers was subjected to rigid body refinement with CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 5-fold non-crystallographic averaging were applied to the initial electron density with the program DM as implemented in the CCP4 package (36CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The mask covering one subunit was calculated with NCS-MASK (36CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar), and the non-crystallographic symmetry operators were improved after every cycle of averaging. This procedure dramatically improved the quality of the electron density map and allowed building of almost all residues that had been replaced by alanine in the original model. Further refinement using the TLS option and model building was carried out with the program REFMAC5 (36CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) and O (40Jones A.T. Zou J.Y. Cowtan J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), respectively. The progress of refinement was monitored by the free R-factor with 5% of the data put aside from the calculations. The solvent molecules were added with the help of ARP/WARP program as implemented in the CCP4 package. In addition to 15 CALS subunits, 15 phosphate ions, a total of 754 water molecules and 3 (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules were built into the |Fo| - |Fc| map during several cycles of ARP/WARP, REFMAC5 refinement, and manual rebuilding with O. Values of the final Rcryst and Rfree are 21.5% and 25.8%, respectively. Details of the refinement statistics are presented in Table 2. Inhibitors—1,3,7-Trihydro-9-d-ribityl-2,4,8-purinetrione(TS13), 3-(1,3-dihydro-9-d-ribityl-2,4,8-purinetrione-7-yl)propane 1-phosphate (TS44), 4-(6,7(5H,8H-dioxo-8-d-ribityllumazine-5-yl)butane 1-phosphate (GJ43), and 4-(6-chloro-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-yl)-butyl (JC33) were prepared as described elsewhere (20Cushman M. Sambaiah T. Jin G. Illarionov B. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Cushman M. Jin G. Sambaiah T. Illarionov B. Fischer M. Ladenstein R. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 709092Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Calorimetric measurements for binding analysis of each inhibitor were carried out by using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The reference cell was filled with water, and the instrument was calibrated using standard electrical pulses. All solutions were carefully degassed by stirring under vacuum before use. Binding isotherms of all ligands were measured by direct titration. A solution of CALS (0.015-0.025 mm) in 50 mm potassium-phosphate buffer at pH 7.08 in a total volume of 1.451 ml was titrated at 30 °C with 25 identical 3-μl injections at 3-min intervals. The syringe was filled with 1.4-2.4 mm inhibitor dissolved in the same buffer. The heat evolved after each injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. All data were evaluated with the Origin50 Software package (MicroCal) supplied with the calorimeter. The heat of dilution was subtracted from the observed heat in the binding experiments. The association constants, Ka, binding enthalpy, ΔH, and stoichiometry, n, were obtained by fitting the data to standard equations for the binding using a model for one set of independent and identical binding sites as implemented in the Origin50 package. The binding entropy ΔS and free energy ΔG of the binding were calculated from the basic thermodynamic equation, ΔG =-RT ln K, and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, ΔG =ΔH - TΔS. Molecular Modeling—Docking of the inhibitors to the active site of CALS was performed with AutoDock 3.0 (41Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar). The models were previously protonated by using Chimera (42Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar), and partial charges added as well as solvation parameters were defined by using Antechamber (43Wang J. Wang W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Mol. Graph Model. 2006; 25: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (3510) Google Scholar). The docking grid was centered on the center of the putative binding site. Fifty dockings were calculated for each inhibitor by using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (41Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar). All other parameters remained at their default values. The resulting inhibitor binding modes were compared with the hypothetical models built manually by the following procedure: the CALS empty active site was structurally aligned to the structures of the active sites of M. tuberculosis LS (MbtLS) complexes with TS13, TS44, and JC33, respectively. Compound GJ43 was first overlaid with 5-(6-d-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione-5-yl)-1-pentylphosphonic acid in the active site of LS from S. cerevisiae. Then, the obtained hypothetical complex was structurally aligned with the empty CALS pentamer. The structural alignment was performed with the least square option as implemented in O. The resulting structures were subjected to 1000 steps of molecular dynamics calculations followed by 500-700 steps of energy minimization. Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out with the program CNS by using a simulated annealing schedule in Cartesian coordinates at constant temperature 298 K and 0.0005-ps molecular dynamics steps. A constant dielectric constant of 1.0 was applied, and the non-bonded list cut-off was set to 13 Å as default values in CNS. All calculations were performed with fixed main-chain atoms and relaxed side-chain atoms. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Sequence homology analysis showed that the hypothetical open reading frame orf 19.410.3 of C. albicans has an exon-intron structure with one 83-bp intron close to its 5′-end. The resulting hypothetical open reading frame, which predicts a protein of 164 amino acid residues with 72.4% and 37.1% identity to lumazine synthases of S. cerevisiae and A. aeolicus, respectively (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR and was cloned into the expression vector pNCO113. A plasmid harboring the gene under the control of a T5 promoter and a lac operator directed the abundant synthesis of a protein with an approximate mass of 18.1 kDa in a recombinant E. coli strain. The recombinant protein purified by ion-exchange and gel-permeation chromatography appeared homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme sedimented at an apparent velocity of 5.2 S at 20 °C (Fig. 3a). Orthologous lumazine synthases with pentameric structure from the yeasts S. pombe and S. cerevisiae have been reported to sediment at similar rates of 5.0 and 5.5 S, respectively (44Mörtl S.

https://openalex.org/W2063933749,"Transport of DNA into preformed procapsids is a general strategy for genome packing inside virus particles. In most viruses, this task is accomplished by a complex of the viral packaging ATPase with the portal protein assembled at a specialized vertex of the procapsid. Such molecular motor translocates DNA through the central tunnel of the portal protein. A central question to understand this mechanism is whether the portal is a mere conduit for DNA or whether it participates actively on DNA translocation. The most constricted part of the bacteriophage SPP1 portal tunnel is formed by twelve loops, each contributed from one individual subunit. The position of each loop is stabilized by interactions with helix α-5, which extends into the portal putative ATPase docking interface. Here, we have engineered intersubunit disulfide bridges between α-5s of adjacent portal ring subunits. Such covalent constraint blocked DNA packaging, whereas reduction of the disulfide bridges restored normal packaging activity. DNA exit through the portal in SPP1 virions was unaffected. The data demonstrate that mobility betweenα-5 helices is essential for the mechanism of viral DNA translocation. We propose that the α-5 structural rearrangements serve to coordinate ATPase activity with the positions of portal tunnel loops relative to the DNA double helix.

The viral genome is packaged into procapsids by a DNA translocation motor that assembles at the portal vertex of the procapsid structure (step from states I to II of Fig. 1A). The motor is composed of the portal protein, an ATPase (large terminase subunit), and a third component (small terminase subunit or a pRNA) (8Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Calendar R.

Although it is well established that the ATPase energetically fuels DNA translocation, biochemical and genetic evidence shows also that the portal protein regulates ATPase activity (13Oliveira L.

However, a mechanistic role of the portal protein and the function of its cross-talk with the terminase in the DNA packaging reaction remain to be demonstrated.

Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) show that they share a very similar structure. Their most unusual feature is the presence of a prominent distortion in helix α6. Helix α6 of the SPP1 portal presents a 136° kink stabilized by hydrogen bonding with crown residues and by van der Waals interactions with the carboxyl terminus of helix α5 (see Fig. 1C) (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In isolated gp6, a 13-mer, helices α5 and α6 are connected by a loop that protrudes to the portal tunnel interior (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This region is disorganized in the phi29 portal structure (5Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H. Morais M.C. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The gp6 form found in viral procapsids is a 12-mer. Because no crystallographic structure is available for this oligomeric state, single subunits of gp6 were fitted into the cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of the portal 12-mer present in viral particles (18Orlova E.V. Gowen B. Droge A. Stiege A. Weise F. Lurz R. van Heel M. Tavares P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to produce a pseudoatomic model of the gp6 dodecamer (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The model, which fits well the electron microscopy maps, shows that the portal oligomer maintains architectural features similar to the 13-mer, except for the crown and tunnel loops that undergo positional changes (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These loops define the most constricted region of the tunnel (see Fig. 1C) (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Its ∼18-Å diameter found in the viral particle portal implies that tunnel loops must change their position during viral genome passage to avoid clashing with DNA phosphate groups (see Fig. 1C). Inspection of the structure reveals a likely conformational change, and large shifts in the loop positions could be permitted by straightening of the kinked helix α6, concomitant with small displacements of α5-disrupting van der Waals interactions between these two structural elements that stabilize the α6 kink (see Fig. 1C) (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Helix α5 is the component of this molecular lever that connects tunnel loops to the putative binding site of the viral ATPase (see Fig. 1C). To address experimentally the hypothesis that positional adjustments between α5 of adjacent subunits are required for the mechanism of viral DNA translocation, we characterized DNA traffic through a portal oligomer reversibly cross-linked through the α5 helices. The results show that DNA packaging requires motions of these helices, demonstrating for the first time the mechanistic role of the portal in the process.

The presence of deletion delX in the phage genome is necessary to obtain infectious progeny phages, because the sizA mutation, present in all gene 6 alleles studied in this work (see below), leads to undersizing of SPP1-packaged DNA molecules. Deletion of a non-essential region allows encapsidation of the complete set of SPP1-essential genes in the presence of sizA, enabling viability of the progeny (21Tavares P. Santos M.A. Lurz R. Morelli G. de Lencastre H. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). B. subtilis HA101B (sup-3) and YB886 (sup°) were the permissive and non-permissive strains used for SPP1 multiplication (22Chai S. Bravo A. Luder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain used for site-directed mutagenesis was XL-1 Blue (Stratagene). The plasmid vector used in all of the genetic manipulations is a derivative of vector pHP13 carrying the inducible promoter PN25/0 (pPT100) as described in Ref. 15Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Gene 6 bearing mutation C55S was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel method (23Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-1.45Google Scholar) in a template spanning the complete gene 6. This HpaI-SalI fragment (coordinates 2267–3917 of the SPP1 nucleotide sequence; GenBank™ accession number X97918) was transferred into the SmaI-SalI sites of pPT100, generating plasmid pAC1. In a second step, a fragment Asp-718-PstI carrying mutation N365K from plasmid pSPWA (21Tavares P. Santos M.A. Lurz R. Morelli G. de Lencastre H. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pAC1 cleaved with the same enzymes, generating pAC2. The gene 6 alleles coding for the gp6 single and double cysteine mutants were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pAC2 as the template. Complete sequencing of gene 6 alleles was carried out at the central facility of the Centre de Génétique Moléculaire (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Plasmids carrying the correct gene 6 alleles were purified using a Qiagen kit. Inducible expression from the PN25/0 promoter was controlled by the LacI repressor coded by plasmid pGB3 in E. coli XL1-blue and pEB104 in B. subtilis YB886 (15Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Assay for Disulfide Bridge Formation in gp6—Disulfide bridge formation in gp6 proteins carrying mutations to single or double cysteines was tested for the gp6-isolated form in B. subtilis extracts (16Isidro A. Santos M.A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and for gp6 assembled either in SPP1-purified procapsids (24Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or CsCl-purified phages. B. subtilis crude extracts (∼70 μg total protein) or procapsids (25 nm) were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) 5The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were treated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 h at 37 °Cto alkylate free sulfhydryl groups. Phages (∼5 × 109 infective phages) were treated with 4 mm DTT, disrupted with 50 mm EDTA, followed by incubation with 10 units of benzonase in the presence of 100 mm MgCl2, as described previously (25Vinga I.

Samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading dye lacking reducing agents, boiled for 5 min, and resolved in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After immunoblotting, gp6 was detected using an anti-gp6 polyclonal serum and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Purified gp6 cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (27Jekow P. Behlke J. Tichelaar W. Lurz R. Regalla M. Hinrichs W. Tavares P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used as the control for migration in SDS-PAGE of covalently linked gp6 13-mers. DNA Packaging in Vitro—Procapsids containing different gp6 forms were produced by trans-complementation in vivo and purified as described previously (13Oliveira L. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21914-21923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DNA packaging reactions were carried out using the SPP1 in vitro DNA packaging system with purified components (24Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Before setting up the packaging reactions, procapsids (15 nm) were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 2 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA Ejection in Vitro—Phage particles (∼109 infective particles/lane in Fig. 4) were pretreated with 10 μg/ml DNase and 0.5 mg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 1 h in ejection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). The samples were then split and reduced with 2 mm DTT or left untreated for 15 min at 37 °C. After cooling down for 15 min on ice, the SPP1 receptor ectodomain was added to a stoichiometry of 2000 YueB780 dimers (26São-José C. Lhuillier S. Lurz R. Melki R. Lepault J. Santos M.A. Tavares P.

After 15 min on ice, the samples were shifted to 15 °C to trigger DNA ejection. Reactions were stopped and then deproteinized, and DNA protected from DNase was resolved by pulsed field gel electrophoresis as described previously (25Vinga I. Dröge A. Stiege A.C. Lurz R.

Engineering of Intersubunit Disulfide Bridges in SPP1 Portal Oligomers—To check whether α5–α5 motions are required for DNA packaging, we engineered disulfide bridges to immobilize reversibly these helices (Fig. 1, D and E). To avoid undesired covalent links between one cysteine residue present in the wild-type SPP1 portal protein (Cys55) and the single or double cysteine mutants to be engineered, the Cys55 residue was replaced by a serine. Gp6C55S was fully functional (data not shown). A gp6 protein containing both the C55S and N365K (gp6SizA) substitutions was then generated. This was justified by the presence of substitution N365K in the available crystallographic structure of gp6 (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Hereinafter the gp6C55S N365K protein will be designated as control gp6. The close distance between α5 of neighbor subunits allowed designing mutations to cysteine residues whose distance and geometry are compatible with disulfide bridge formation (Table 1). Modeling was carried out both for the atomic structure of the isolated gp6 13-mer and for the pseudoatomic structure of the gp6 12-mer purified from viral particles (17Lebedev A.A. Krause M.H. Isidro A.L. Vagin A. Orlova E.V. Turner J. Dodson E.J. Tavares P. Antson A.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1984-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Five residues (Val326, Asp327, Ser328, Lys331, and Glu332) were predicted to establish different types of intersubunit disulfide bonds in the 13-mer (V326C/S328C, V326C/K331C, and V326C/E332C) and in the 12-mer (V326C/S328C, V326C/E332C, and D327C/S328C) (Fig. 1, E and F, and Table 1). Note that substitutions V326C/K331C and D327C/S328C are anticipated to form disulfide bonds exclusively in the 13-mer and 12-mer, respectively, due to structural differences between the two oligomeric states. Single and double mutations into cysteine were next introduced in the control gp6 coding gene by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutant proteins were produced to normal amounts in B. subtilis, the bacterial host of bacteriophage SPP1 (Table 2).TABLE 1Modeling of disulfide bridges in the SPP1 portal protein Distances between the Cα atoms are from the 13-mer and 12-mer gp6 structures (17Lebedev A.A.

Purified gp6 cross-linked with 25 mm glutaraldehyde was used as the control for electrophoretic mobility of covalently bound gp6 oligomers (27Jekow P. Behlke J. Tichelaar W. Lurz R. Regalla M. Hinrichs W. Tavares P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Air oxidation was sufficient for the formation of disulfide bridges. Oxidant agents such as 55′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid or diamide did not cause a significant improvement in the reaction (data not shown). Single substitutions to cysteine led to the formation of some covalently bound dimers of gp6 subunits in a non-reducing environment (Fig. 2C and Table 2). These dimers are not an artifact due to disulfide bridge formation during sample preparation, because their presence is not eliminated by alkylation of free thiol groups with N-ethylmaleimide prior to denaturation of samples for SDS-PAGE. Formation of structurally unexpected disulfide bridges in a protein population was previously reported for other multimeric proteins (28Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Double mutants formed gp6 high molecular weight complexes (gp6HMW), similar to those of purified gp6 after glutaraldehyde cross-linking (Fig. 2C). Gp6HMW disappeared when proteins were incubated with the reducing agent DTT, indicating that disulfide bond formation in an oxidizing environment was successfully achieved (Fig. 2C and data not shown). The resolution of the gel did not allow us to conclude that these gp6HMW species correspond to covalent bonding of the complete cyclical oligomer through disulfide bridges. However, the lack of a ladder of gp6 forms resulting from a different number of subunits covalently associated, and the strong signal of the high molecular species relative to the single subunit band showed that most of the subunits of the oligomer established disulfide bonds. Note that the intensity of the band corresponding to cross-linked gp6 might, in fact, be an underestimation of this species because of the less efficient transfer of very high molecular weight proteins in the Western blot (688 kDa for the gp6 12-mer). All of the mutants modeled to establish disulfide bridges in the gp6 13-mer (V326C/S328C, V326C/K331C, and V326C/E332C) led to the appearance of gp6HMW (Table 2). Cross-linked gp6 was observed also in the case of D327C/S328C, implying a structural flexibility that allowed the two residues to move ∼2 Å toward each other for disulfide brid"

Necl-5, originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and also up-regulated in cancer cells, colocalizes with integrin αvβ3 at leading edges in moving cells and enhances growth factor-induced cell movement. Here, we show that Necl-5 interacts directly, in cis, with integrin αvβ3, and enhances integrin αvβ3 clustering and focal complex formation at leading edges in NIH3T3 cells. The extracellular region of Necl-5, but not the cytoplasmic region, is necessary for its interaction with integrin αvβ3; however, both regions are necessary for its action. An interaction between integrin αvβ3 and vitronectin and PDGF-induced activation of Rac are also necessary for integrin αvβ3 clustering. The interaction between Necl-5 and integrin αvβ3 enhances PDGF-induced Rac activation, facilitating integrin αvβ3 clustering presumably in a feedback amplification manner.

Integrins are key molecules for adhesion between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PVR, poliovirus receptor; Necl, nectin-like molecule; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DTSSP, 3,3′-dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate]; DN, dominant-negative; CA, constitutively active; nt, nucleotide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. proteins (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). They are heterodimers of α and β subunits, both of which have one transmembrane segment. The extracellular region of integrins binds to ECM proteins, whereas the cytoplasmic region is directly and indirectly associated with many F-actin-binding proteins, such as talin, vinculin, and α-actinin, and intracellular signaling molecules, such as FAK and c-Src (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 2Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3577-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins have at least two forms: conformations with either low or high affinity for their ECM binding partners (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 55-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When talin binds to the low affinity form, this is converted to the high affinity form (4Cram E.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 55-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon binding to ECM proteins, integrins transduce signals inside cells that then cause the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, eventually resulting in integrin clustering and the formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions (4Cram E.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 55-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Focal complexes are formed at leading edges in moving cells, whereas focal adhesions, also called focal contacts, are formed at sites to the rear of the leading edges (5Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 6Zaidel-Bar R. Cohen M. Addadi L. Geiger B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Focal complexes are generally smaller than mature focal adhesions, being less than 0.5 μm in diameter. Protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, are also formed at leading edges, while ruffles are formed on the dorsal surfaces of lamellipodia. Focal complexes are formed under these protrusions. Focal complexes, protrusions, and ruffles are formed by the actions of the small G proteins Rac and Cdc42; their formation is inhibited by the action of the small G protein RhoA (5Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 7Ballestrem C. Hinz B. Imhof B.A. Wehrle-Haller B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). By contrast, focal adhesions are formed by the action of RhoA. Inactivation of Rac and Cdc42 and activation of RhoA lead to the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions. The dynamic formation of all of these structures is necessary for efficient cell movement. The dynamic activation and inactivation of Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA are regulated not only by the outside-in signaling of integrins but also by growth factor-induced signaling (8Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Of the many integrins, integrin αVβ3 has a particularly important role in focal complex formation (9Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). This integrin is expressed in many cell types, such as fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells (10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J.

Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Necl-5 is expressed in many cell types, such as fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells, in which integrin αVβ3 is expressed (23Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Shingai T. Fujito T. Yamada A. Minami Y.

Necl-5 does not show homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity, but it heterophilically interacts in trans (i.e. present on a different cell) with nectin-3, a member of the Ig-like nectin family that is a Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion molecule and forms adherens junctions cooperatively with cadherins (22Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When cells come into contact with other cells, Necl-5 is down-regulated from the cell surface by trans-interacting with nectin-3 (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); however, when there is no contact with other cells, Necl-5 is up-regulated at the transcriptional level by growth factor-induced signaling (27Hirota T. Irie K. Okamoto R. Ikeda W. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2229-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Necl-5 enhances growth factor-induced cell movement, whereas down-regulation of Necl-5 reduces it (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cultured cells continue to move until they contact other cells and become confluent. They then undergo cell-cell adhesion and stop moving. This phenomenon has been known for more than fifty years as contact inhibition of cell movement (28Abercrombie M. Heaysman J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1953; 5: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Abercrombie M. Nature. 1979; 281: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have proposed that Necl-5 has a role, at least in part, in this contact inhibition of cell movement (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, we did not previously examine which structure of leading edges Necl-5 localizes to or whether, and if so how, Necl-5 regulates integrin αVβ3-based focal complex formation. We attempt to address these issues here using NIH3T3 cells as a model cell type, which express both integrin αVβ3 and Necl-5. Construction—pCAGIPuro-FLAG-Necl-5, pCAGIZeo-FLAG-Necl-5-ΔCP, and pCAGIZeo-FLAG-Necl-5-ΔEC were prepared as described (15Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M.

To obtain siRNA-resistant mutants, FLAG-Necl-5R and FLAG-Necl-5-ΔCPR were generated by mutagenesis of 5′-GGTATGTTGGCCTCACTAA-3′ to create 5′-GGTACG-TAGGATTAACGAA-3′ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) from pFLAG-CMV1-Necl-5 and pFLAG-CMV1-Necl-5-ΔCP (15Ikeda W.

Necl-5-ΔCP fused to a Myc tag at the C terminus was inserted into the vector pCAGIPuro (pCAGI-Puro-Necl-5-ΔCP-myc). Expression vectors were kindly provided as follows: wild-type human integrin αV and human integrin β3 (pcDNA3-αV and -β3) were from Dr. J. C. Norman (University of Leicester, Leicester, UK), a dominant-negative mutant of human integrin β3 (pcDNA3.1-Myc-His(+)-β3T329C/A347C) was from Dr. J. Takagi (Osaka University, Suita, Japan). GST-PAK-Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding region (pGEX-PAK-CRIB) was a kind gift from Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). pEFBOS-myc-Rac1CA and -Rac1DN were prepared as described (30Komuro R. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Orita S. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and siRNA Experiments—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Necl-5 (Necl-5-NIH3T3 cells) were obtained by transfection with pCAGIPuro-FLAG-Necl-5 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and by selection with puromycin. Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells were prepared as described (15Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For transient expression experiments, cells were transfected with various expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Knockdown of Necl-5 was performed as described (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with siRNA vector against Necl-5, pBS-H1-Necl-5, and pEGFP-tub (Clontech), because EGFP-tagged tubulin, but not EGFP, is resistant to acetone/methanol fixation. As a control, siRNA vector against luciferase, pBS-H1-control, was used. pBS-H1 vector was a gift from Dr. H. Shibuya (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Alternatively, cells were transfected with a double-stranded 19-nt RNA duplex to Necl-5 (5′-GGTATGTTGGCCTCACTAA-3′) or a similar duplex to luciferase (5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) as a control using Hyperfect reagent (Qiagen). To confirm knockdown of Necl-5 by FACS, pBS-EGFP-H1-Necl-5 and pBS-EGFP-H1-control were used. These vectors were constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the EGFP expression unit from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) into a region not related to siRNA expressions of pBS-H1-Necl-5 and pBS-H1-control, respectively. Antibodies and Reagents—A rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the extracellular region of Necl-5 (mAb-i, 1A8-8) was prepared as described (25Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K.

Hamster anti-integrin αV and β3 mAbs (H9.2B8 and 2C9.G2, respectively; for immunostaining) were purchased from BD Biosciences. The following mouse mAbs were purchased from commercial sources: anti-integrin αV, anti-integrin β3, anti-integrin α5, and anti-integrin β1 (for Western blotting; BD Biosciences), anti-talin (8D4) and anti-FLAG M2 (for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and FACS) (Sigma), and anti-actin mAbs (Chemicon). The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were purchased from commercial sources: anti-N-cadherin (TAKARA), anti-integrin αV (for immunoprecipitation), and anti-integrin β3 pAbs (for Western blotting) (Chemicon). Hybridoma cells (9E10) expressing a mouse anti-Myc mAb were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Fatty acid-free BSA, fibronectin, laminin, ConA, and cyclo-RGDfV were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorophore (FITC, Cy3, Cy5, and R-PE)-conjugated secondary Abs were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research. Human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was purchased from PEPROTECH. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma (Kohjinbio) as described (31Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linker, 3,3′-dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP), was purchased from Pierce. Directional Stimulation by PDGF—To generate a concentration gradient of PDGF, a μ-Slide VI flow (uncoated; Ibidi) was used. The μ-Slide VI flow has six parallel channels, which were coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin, 25 μg/ml fibronectin, or 80 μg/ml laminin. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells per square centimeter, cultured for 16 h, and starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h. The concentration gradient of PDGF was made using DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and 30 ng/ml PDGF according to manufacturer's protocol. After 30 min, cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), incubated with 1% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with 20% BlockAce in PBS, prior to immunofluorescence microscopy (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscope systems, digital eclipse C1si-ready (NIKON), and LSM510 META (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with various combinations of plasmids, cultured for 24 h, detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, and treated with a trypsin inhibitor. To make predominantly high affinity integrin αVβ3, cells were cultured in suspension with Ca2+-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% BSA, 1 mm MnCl2, and 50 μg/ml cyclo-RGDfV for 1 h, collected by centrifugation, washed with Wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and lysed with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm APMSF). To make predominantly low affinity integrin αVβ3, cells were cultured in suspension with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h, collected by centrifugation, washed with Wash buffer and lysed with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm APMSF). The lysates were rotated for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h, incubated with the anti-FLAG mAb at 4 °C for 4 h, and then incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A or B, bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS Sample Buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. To examine the interaction between endogenous Necl-5 and endogenous integrin αVβ3, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using NIH3T3 cells. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells per square centimeter on vitronectin-coated dish, cultured for 16 h, starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h, and then stimulated with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and/or 3 ng/ml PDGF. After 30 min, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 2 mm DTSSP in PBS at 4 °C for 2 h. To quench the cross-linking reaction, 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added at a final concentration of 50 mm. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Buffer B. The lysates were rotated for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h, incubated with the anti-integrin αV pAb at 4 °C for 16 h, and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. In Vitro Binding of Necl-5 to Integrin αVβ3—Necl-5 EC was prepared as described (25Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To obtain integrin αVβ3 EC, CHO-lec 3.2.8.1 cells expressing integrin αVβ3 EC were cultured, and the culture supernatant containing soluble integrin αVβ3 EC was collected (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). This cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. J. Takagi (Osaka University, Suita, Japan). The culture supernatant was applied to Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with Buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer C and then Buffer C containing 0.6 m NaCl, bound integrin αVβ3 EC was eluted with Elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 500 mm imidazole at pH 8.0) and the eluate was dialyzed with Buffer C. The protein concentration of integrin αVβ3 EC was determined with BSA as a reference protein by SDS-PAGE. To examine the binding of Necl-5 EC to integrin αVβ3 EC, integrin αVβ3 EC (6 pmol) was immobilized on Ni-Sepharose beads and soluble Necl-5 EC (60 pmol) was incubated with integrin αVβ3 EC-immobilized Ni-Sepharose beads or Ni-Sepharose beads alone in 0.3 ml of Buffer C containing 1% BSA. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer C, bound proteins were eluted with Elution buffer. The eluate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Assay for Bead-Cell Contact—Latex-sulfate microbeads (4.55 × 106; 10-μm diameter; Polyscience Inc.) were washed, resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS, and incubated with 10 μg of vitronectin, 50 μg of fibronectin, or 160 μg of laminin with gentle mixing at room temperature. After the incubation, the beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS and resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA. ConA-coated beads were prepared as described (32Tran H. Pankov R. Tran S.D. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used as control beads. Cells were starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 18 h. After serum starvation, cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and then treated with a trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells per square centimeter on laminin-coated coverglass, cultured for 3 h, and incubated with vitronectin-, fibronectin-, laminin-, or ConA-coated beads for 1 h. Cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), incubated with 1% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with 20% BlockAce in PBS, followed by immunofluorescence microscopy (26Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Assay for Rac Activation—The assay for Rac activation using GST-PAK CRIB was performed as described (33Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3, Necl-5-NIH3T3, or Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells were cultured on vitronectin-coated dishes for 16 h, starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h, stimulated with 3 ng/ml PDGF, and then subjected to the assay for Rac activation. For analysis of Necl-5-knockdown cells, NIH3T3 cells were twice transfected with siRNA oligo every 24 h, cultured for 24 h, and subjected to the assay. Co-localization of Necl-5 with Integrin αVβ3 at Peripheral Ruffles and Focal Complexes—NIH3T3 cells were sparsely plated on μ-slide VI flow dishes precoated with vitronectin, an ECM protein that binds to integrin αVβ3 (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), starved of serum, and directionally stimulated by PDGF. Most cells became polarized and formed lamellipodia with peripheral ruffles at leading edges, in the direction of higher concentrations of PDGF. The immunofluorescence signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at the peripheral ruffles of the leading edges in the middle section of the cells (Fig. 1Aa), consistent with earlier observations (15Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the basal section of the cells, the signal for integrin β3 was observed as dot-like structures under the peripheral ruffles. The signal for Necl-5 was also observed as fuzzy dot-like structures and mostly overlapped with the signal for integrin β3. In addition, the signal for integrin β3, but not that for Necl-5, was observed as dot-like structures at sites to the rear of the leading edges. Essentially the same results were obtained when integrin αV was stained instead of integrin β3. 3Y. Takai, unpublished data. Indeed, unless otherwise specified, essentially the same results were obtained for both integrin αV and integrin β3 in the experiments that follow. The dot-like structures under the peripheral ruffles (which were immunopositive for Necl-5, integrin αV, and integrin β3) were smaller in size than those at sites to the rear of the leading edges (which were immunopositive for integrin αV and integrin β3, but not for Necl-5). The signal for talin co-localized with both types of dot-like structure, consistent with earlier observations (6Zaidel-Bar R. Cohen M. Addadi L. Geiger B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast to these signals, the signal for N-cadherin was not concentrated at any site on the entire plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S1A). Here we determine that the dot-like structures, which are immunopositive for Necl-5, integrin αV, integrin β3, and talin and locate under the peripheral ruffles, correspond to focal complexes, whereas the dot-like structures, which are immunopositive for integrin αV, integrin β3, and talin, but not for Necl-5, correspond to focal adhesions. These results indicate that Necl-5 co-localizes with integrin αVβ3 both at peripheral ruffles over the lamellipodia and at focal complexes under the peripheral ruffles of leading edges, but not at focal adhesions, in NIH3T3 cells. Integrin αVβ3 at these structures includes at least the high affinity form, because talin co-localizes with it (4Cram E.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 55-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).FIGURE1Co-localizationofNecl-5withintegrinαVβ3at peripheral ruffles and focal complexes.A, immunofluorescence images of PDGF-stimulated NIH3T3 cells cultured on vitronectin-coatedμ-slide dishes.

Interaction between CD40 and its ligand (CD40L), expressed on activated T lymphocytes, is critical for B cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that CD40 signals B cell survival in part via transcriptional activation of the RelB NF-kappaB subunit. CD40L treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells induced levels of relB mRNA. Similarly, CD40L-mediated rescue of WEHI 231 B lymphoma cells from apoptosis induced upon B cell receptor (surface IgM) engagement led to increased relB mRNA levels. Recently, we characterized a new de novo synthesis pathway for the RelB NF-kappaB subunit, induced by the cytomegalovirus IE1 protein, in which binding of p50/p65 NF-kappaB and c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 complexes to the relB promoter works in synergy to potently activate transcription (Wang, X., and Sonenshein, G. E. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 95-105). CD40L treatment of WEHI 231 cells caused induction of AP-1 family members Fra-2, c-Jun, JunD, and JunB. Cotransfection of Fra-2 with the Jun AP-1 subunits and p50/c-Rel NF-kappaB led to synergistic activation of the relB promoter. Ectopic expression of relB or RelB knockdown using small interfering RNA demonstrated the important role of this subunit in control of WEHI 231 cell survival and implicated activation of the anti-apoptotic factors Survivin and manganese superoxide dismutase. Thus, CD40 engagement of transformed B cells activates relB gene transcription via a process we have termed the de novo RelB synthesis pathway, which protects these cells from apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1982440970,"Accumulating evidence suggests that heterotrimeric G protein activation may not require G protein subunit dissociation. Results presented here provide evidence for a subunit dissociation-independent mechanism for G protein activation by a receptor-independent activator of G protein signaling, AGS8. AGS8 is a member of the AGS group III family of AGS proteins thought to activate G protein signaling primarily through interactions with Gβγ subunits. Results are presented demonstrating that AGS8 binds to the effector and α subunit binding “hot spot” on Gβγ yet does not interfere with Gα subunit binding to Gβγ or phospholipase C β2 activation. AGS8 stimulates activation of phospholipase C β2 by heterotrimeric Gαβγ and forms a quaternary complex with Gαi1, Gβ1γ2, and phospholipase C β2. AGS8 rescued phospholipase C β binding and regulation by an inactive β subunit with a mutation in the hot spot (β1(W99A)γ2) that normally prevents binding and activation of phospholipase C β2. This demonstrates that, in the presence of AGS8, the hot spot is not used for Gβγ interactions with phospholipase C β2. Mutation of an alternate binding site for phospholipase C β2 in the amino-terminal coiled-coil region of Gβγ prevented AGS8-dependent phospholipase C binding and activation. These data implicate a mechanism for AGS8, and potentially other Gβγ binding proteins, for directing Gβγ signaling through alternative effector activation sites on Gβγ in the absence of subunit dissociation.

When bound to specific ligands, G protein-coupled receptors facilitate exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit, leading to conformational changes in the Gα“switch” regions (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). These changes decrease the affinity of Gα for Gβγ and are thought to result in subunit dissociation such that Gα and Gβγ subunits are free to interact with downstream effectors (3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In this model, structural elements in Gα and Gβγ that bind downstream effectors are masked at the interface between the Gβγ and Gα subunits and revealed upon subunit dissociation. Alternatively it has been argued that subunit dissociation is not a required step in the G protein activation cycle, instead, a distinct GTP-bound conformation of the αβγ complex may represent the activated form of the G protein (4Levitzki A. Klein S. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Considerable experimental evidence has accumulated in favor of this idea. Most recently, cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bioluminescence energy transfer analyses suggest that G protein heterotrimers may not dissociate upon activation but rather undergo specific conformational rearrangements (5Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Frank M. Thumer L. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Other evidence includes: A covalently linked Gα-βγ fusion protein is signaling competent in yeast (8Klein S. Reuveni H. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3219-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the kinetic coupling model for G protein activation suggests that, in the presence of regulators of G protein signaling proteins, GTP hydrolysis is too rapid to allow subunit dissociation prior to effector activation (9Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) and the β2-adrenergic receptor can activate adenylyl cyclase without causing nucleotide exchange implying that subunit dissociation is not required for adenylyl cyclase activation by this receptor (10Ugur O. Oner S.S. Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Sayar K. Onaran H.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A potential barrier to acceptance of the model is that it is not clear how conformational rearrangements of the subunits would allow for productive engagement of key signaling surfaces at the Gα-βγ interface with effectors. One proposal is the “clam shell” hypothesis where Gα-βγ contacts are maintained by contacts between the amino-terminal helix of the Gα subunit (Gα-NT) 4The abbreviations used are: α-NT, Gα subunit animo-terminal helix; bβγ, biotinylated βγ; AGS, activator of G protein signaling; GRK2, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PLC, phospholipase C; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); b, biotinylated; wt, wild type; tt, trypsin-treated. with the side of the Gβ subunit β-propeller, while other regions at the Gα-βγ interface are exposed for effector activation. G protein-coupled receptor-independent mechanisms for G protein activation have been discovered in recent years. For example, activators of G protein signaling (AGS proteins), discovered in a yeast-based screen for receptor-independent activation of the pheromone pathway, are a group of proteins that stimulate G protein signaling (11Blumer J.B. Cismowski M.J. Sato M. Lanier S.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 470-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Sato M. Blumer J.B. Simon V. Lanier S.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 151-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The best characterized of the AGS proteins act through interactions with G protein α subunits to dissociate the G protein heterotrimer either through nucleotide exchange-dependent (Class I AGS proteins) or -independent mechanisms (Class II AGS proteins). Here we explore the mechanism for G protein activation by a recently described AGS protein, AGS8, which binds to G protein βγ subunits (13Sato M. Cismowski M.J. Toyota E. Smrcka A.V. Lucchesi P.A. Chilian W.M. Lanier S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AGS8 forms a complex interacting with Gα and Gβγ simultaneously, occupies the Gβγ“hot spot,” a critical effector binding and signal transfer region on Gβγ (14Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shektar L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.-S. Iyengar R. Miller R. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 15Scott J.K.

In complexes between Gα, βγ, and AGS8, a signal transfer region on Gβγ that does not involve the hot spot is critical for signaling to phospholipase C (PLC) β. This introduces a concept for G protein βγ subunit signaling where amino acids outside the Gα-βγ subunit interface drive Gβγ signaling and provides a model for how non-dissociated G protein complexes can activate downstream targets and a potential modified alternative of the clam shell hypothesis. Materials—Peptides (SIRK, SIRKALNILGYPDYD; SIGK, SIGKAFKILGYPDYD; and SIRK(L9A) SIRKALNIAGYPDYD) were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostics International, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography to >90% purity, and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylethanolamine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen, GTPγS was from Sigma, glutathione-Sepharose and anti-GST antibody were from GE Healthcare, TetraLink™ tetrameric avidin resin was from Promega (Madison, WI), anti-Gαi antibody was from Oncogene. Purification of βγ and α Subunits—Gβ1γ2 or biotinylated Gβ1γ2 (bGβ1γ2) subunits were purified from 2 liters of Sf-9 cells triply infected with His6-Gαi1, wild-type, or bGβ1 subunits, and Gγ2 subunits essentially as described (18Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All of the alanine-substituted Gβ1 subunit mutants used in this study were modified with a biotin acceptor peptide at the amino terminus and were biotinylated. These mutants were expressed with Gγ2 in 200 ml of SF9 cells and partially purified exactly as described in a previous study (16Davis T. Bonacci T.M. Sprang S.R. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10593-10604Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Experiments comparing alanine-substituted bGβγ activities to wt bGβγ utilized wt bGβγ subunits partially purified in parallel with the mutants for direct comparison. Myristoylated Gαi1 was purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (19Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and bound GTPγS (0.5 mol/mol of protein) was determined by an Amido Black protein assay. Expression and Purification of GST-tagged cAGS8—The coding sequence of cAGS8 (A1359-W1730 (cDNA#1-16)) was fused in-frame to GST in the pGEX-4T vector (GE Healthcare) and expressed and purified from E. coli BL21/DE3 cells as previously described (13Sato M. Cismowski M.J. Toyota E. Smrcka A.V. Lucchesi P.A. Chilian W.M. Lanier S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with some modification. Overnight cultures grown in Luria broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) were diluted to an A600 equal to 0.5-0.6 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Fusion proteins from a 1-liter culture were purified following the previously described protocol except prior to elution the glutathione-Sepharose column was washed with 5 mm ATP and a denatured E. coli protein extract to remove contaminating GroEL. The resulting eluted protein was 80% pure and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by Amido Black protein assay, and purified proteins were snap frozen and stored at -80 °C. Protein Binding Assays—GST-cAGS8 or GST was incubated with either purified Gαi1, or bGβ1γ2, or various bGβ1 mutants in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% C12E10 (polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether), 1mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP). The binding mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. 40 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose was added to the binding mixture, and the mixture was further rotated for 1 h. The glutathione matrix was washed with three rounds of centrifugation/washing in binding buffer. Identical conditions were used for avidin-agarose isolations of bGβ1γ2 except avidin-agarose was used. Proteins bound in precipitates were identified by immunoblotting following PAGE. In some cases immunoblots were quantitated by chemiluminescence imaging with a charge-coupled device camera. This has a much larger dynamic range than film and overcomes issues with signal saturation observed with x-ray film. Gel-filtration Chromatography—Various combinations of GST-cAGS8, Gαi1, Gβ1γ2, and PLCβ2 (100 nm each) were incubated in 500 μl of gel-filtration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% C12E10, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the mixture was applied to tandem Superdex 75/200 columns (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel-filtration buffer and resolved at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. 1-ml fractions were collected. An aliquot of each fraction (20 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining. No binding of any of the proteins to GST was detected in the gel-filtration assay (data not shown). GTPγS Binding Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (20Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar) except without membranes or receptors. Briefly, 120 nm Gαi1 (6 pmol), in the presence or absence of 180 nm GST-cAGS8 and with or without 240 nm Gβ1γ2 subunits, were incubated with 0.4 μm GTPγS([35S]GTPγS, ∼5000 cpm/pmol specific radioactivity in the assay) in the presence of 2 μm GDP to suppress the basal rate of nucleotide exchange by Gαi1. Bound [35S]GTPγS detected by binding to nitrocellulose filters. PLC Assay—PLC assays were performed as described previously (21Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in the figure legends. Measurement of Gα-βγ Interactions by Flow Cytometry—Equilibrium binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated Gαi1 to bGβ1γ2 subunits was measured using flow cytometry as has been previously described (22Ghosh M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding, determined by the simultaneous addition of 300 pm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated Gαi1 and 50 nm myristoylated Gαi1 subunits to the bGβγ bound beads, was 10-20% of the total signal and was subtracted from the mean channel numbers from each experiment unless otherwise indicated. Trypsin Digestion of Gαi1—3 μg of Gαi1 was mixed with 0.15 μg of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (New England Biolabs Inc.) and incubated in 100 μl of digestion buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF) at 25 °C for 1 h. The digestion reaction was terminated by adding 5 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. The digestion was analyzed by PAGE and visualization with Coomassie Blue staining. The protein concentration after digestion was determined with an Amido Black protein assay. To confirm that trypsin-treated Gαi1 still bound to cAGS8, binding to GST-cAGS8 was analyzed in a GST pulldown assay as has been described in parallel with undigested Gαi1. AGS8 Binds to a Site on Gβ1γ2 That Overlaps the Gα Binding Site Yet Does Not Affect Binding of Gα to Gβγ—The carboxyl-terminal domain of AGS8 (amino acids A1359-W1730, cAGS8) binds to βγ and activates Gβγ signaling in yeast and in mammalian cells transfected with G protein subunits (13Sato M. Cismowski M.J. Toyota E. Smrcka A.V. Lucchesi P.A. Chilian W.M. Lanier S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism for how a protein can bind to Gβγ and simultaneously propagate Gβγ signaling, we investigated the molecular nature of the interaction between Gβγ and cAGS8. To initially identify and characterize a binding site for cAGS8 on Gβγ we used peptide competition and mutagenic analyses. The peptides SIGK and SIRK bind to a hot spot on Gβ1γ2 that interacts with multiple effectors, including PLCβ2, and corresponds to the Gα subunit switch II binding site (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 14Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shektar L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.-S. Iyengar R. Miller R. Jan L.Y.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). SIGK and SIRK compete for binding of both α subunits and PLCβ2 to Gβ1γ2 (15Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Goubaeva F. Ghosh M. Malik S. Yang J. Hinkle P.M. Griendling K.K. Neubig R.R.

These peptides also blocked binding of cAGS8 to Gβ1γ2 indicating the binding sites for the peptides, PLCβ2, Gα subunits and cAGS8 overlap on the surface of Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 1A). A control peptide that does not bind Gβ1γ2, SIRK (L9A) (15Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), had little effect on cAGS8-Gβ1γ2 interactions. To identify specific amino acids within the Gβγ hot spot site required for cAGS8 interactions, GST-cAGS8 binding to a series of alanine-substituted bGβ1γ2 subunit mutants within the hot spot was tested (Fig. 1, B and C; see Fig. 10). Compared with wild-type Gβ1γ2,Gβ1W99A, Gβ1D186A, Gβ1M188A, and Gβ1H311A (Gβ1H311 is outside the hot spot and is a control) mutations did not affect binding to cAGS8, whereas Gβ1K57A, Gβ1Y59A, Gβ1M101A, Gβ1L117A, Gβ1Y145A, and Gβ1N230A mutations all significantly inhibited binding of Gβ1γ2 to cAGS8. These data complement the peptide competition data and clearly demonstrate that cAGS8 interacts with the hot spot on Gβ1γ2. Many of these amino acids are required for activation of effectors, including PLCβ2, and are directly at the Gα-βγ binding interface (Fig. 10) (3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 26Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Thus binding of cAGS8 to this region would be expected to preclude Gα subunit binding and effector activation. We used flow cytometry to analyze Gα-βγ interactions as previously described (22Ghosh M. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As previously shown, the hot spot-binding peptide, SIGK, competes with Gαi1 for binding to Gβ1γ2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) consistent with its apparent Kd for Gβγ of ∼1 μm (22Ghosh M. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 273: 34747-34750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, cAGS8 did not inhibit Gα binding to Gβγ, despite apparently binding to the same site as SIGK and Gα subunit switch II. The highest concentration of cAGS8 tested, 1 μm, was higher than concentrations shown to have maximal functional effects on Gβγ signaling (see Figs. 5B and 9C for examples) and higher than the concentration required for strong binding in the GST pulldown assay and formation of stable complexes by gel filtration.FIGURE 5Gβγ and Gαβγ activate PLCβ2 in the presence of cAGS8. A, cAGS8 does not affect Gβ1γ2-dependent PLCβ2 activation. 2 ng of PLCβ2 was mixed with phospholipid vesicles containing 50 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, 200 μm phosphatidylethanolamine, and 8000 cpm/assay[3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, 100 nm free Ca2+, and 30 nm β1γ2, in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SIGK peptide (▴) or cAGS8 (▪). The effect of cAGS8 on basal activity of PLCβ2 in the absence of βγ was also studied (▵). Data were generated from experiments performed at least three times. B, cAGS8-stimulated Gβγ-dependent PLC activity from an αβγ heterotrimer. PLC assay conditions are as in A in the presence or absence of 30 nm Gαi1-GDP and the concentrations of cAGS8 as indicated.

Pulldown assay with avidin-agarose was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of three independent experiments. Western blots of PLCβ2 from two separate experiments as in A were quantified by chemiluminescence imaging, and the data were pooled and calculated as a percentage of lane 7, PLCβ2 binding to wt Gβ1γ2 alone: lane 8, Gβ1(23-27)γ2 plus PLCβ2 (97 ± 2%); lane 9, wtGβ1γ2 plus PLCβ2 plus GSTcAGS8 (98 ± 4%); lane 10, Gβ1(23-27)γ2 plus PLCβ2 plus GSTcAGS8 (12 ± 1%). Data are means ± S.E. B, Gβ1(23-27)γ2 does not form a complex with PLCβ2 in the presence of cAGS8.

PLC assays were performed as described in Fig. 5 with 1 ng of purified PLCβ2/assay, 30 nm Gβ1(23-27)γ2 (▴), or 30 nm wt Gβ1γ2 (▪), in the presence of varying concentrations of AGS8. In this experiment basal PLC activity was 5.4 mmol/mg/min and with wt bGβ1γ2-stimulated activity was 25 μmol/mg/min, and bGβ1(23-27)γ2-stimulated activity was 42 μmol/mg/min (as previously reported, bGβ1(23-27)γ2 stimulates PLC activity more effectively than wt bGβ1γ2 (29Bonacci T.M.

How could cAGS8 occupy the same binding site on Gβγ yet not compete for Gα subunit binding to Gβγ? We hypothesized that, if cAGS8 bound both Gβγ and Gα simultaneously, then the complex would not be disrupted. It had previously been shown that Gαi did not bind strongly to cAGS8 (13Sato M. Cismowski M.J. Toyota E. Smrcka A.V. Lucchesi P.A. Chilian W.M. Lanier S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but perhaps a weak interaction was not detected that might be significant to formation of this complex. Indeed, Gαi1 bound to GST-cAGS8 in the absence of Gβγ in a manner independent of the Gαi1 activation state, because inclusion of AIF4− did not affect the binding (Fig. 2B lanes 3 and 4). As a control to demonstrate that Gαi is activated by AIF4− in this assay, the Gαi subunit was tested for AIF4− activation-dependent protection from trypsin digestion. In the absence of AIF4− treatment there is no detectable binding of Gαi pretreated with trypsin, because the inactive conformation of Gα is not resistant to trypsin digestion and is degraded prior to binding, while a stable proteolytic fragment of Gαi is formed in the presence of trypsin and AIF4−> that binds to GST-cAGS8 (27Neer E.J. Pulsifer L. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8996-9000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the Gαi1 subunit is activated by AIF4− treatment. The overall conclusion is that the AIF4−-dependent activation does not significantly alter binding of Gαi to AGS8. GST-cAGS8 also did not affect the rate of binding of GTPγS to Gαi1 or Gαi1β1γ2 indicating that AGS8 is not a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with the observation that the cAGS8-mediated activation of G-protein signaling in the yeast-based functional screen was independent of guanine nucleotide exchange (13Sato M. Cismowski M.J. Toyota E. Smrcka A.V. Lucchesi P.A. Chilian W.M. Lanier S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To assess binding of cAGS8 to G protein heterotrimer, 30 nm Gαi1GDP and 30 nm Gβ1γ2 subunit were incubated together with varying concentrations of cAGS8 and compared with binding to either subunit alone. Gαi1 and Gβ1γ2 subunit bound simultaneously to substoichiometric concentrations of GST-cAGS8 (Fig. 3, lane 9, with 10 nm cAGS8 and 30 nm for each subunit), and binding as a function of GST-cAGS8 concentration was more efficient for both subunits together than for either of the subunits alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 6-9 compared with lanes 2-5, Fig. 3B, lanes 6-9 compared with lanes 2-5). The data in Fig. 3 (C and D) are compiled from quantitative analysis of chemiluminescence intensities from three separate binding experiments each. We could not estimate an accurate Kd for complex formation from this analysis, but GST-cAGS8 consistently gave stronger binding signals with the heterotrimer than with either subunit alone. The simplest explanation for this data is that cAGS8 binds to a complex of α and βγ and that the affinity for this complex is greater than for either subunit alone. To provide further evidence for formation of the ternary complex we performed gel-filtration chromatography to evaluate the size and composition of potential complexes between Gαi1-GDP, Gβ1γ2, and GST-cAGS8 (Fig. 4). All of the individual proteins and the heterotrimer elute at approximately their predicted molecular masses, including GST-cAGS8, which elutes as an apparent monomer (monomeric molecular mass predicted to be 75 kDa). Incubation of GST-cAGS8 with either Gαi1-GDP or Gβ1γ2 resulted in the appearance of cAGS8 and either Gαi1 or Gβ1γ2 in an earlier fraction (fraction 24) than either of the G protein subunits alone (fraction 27) at a molecular weight indicative of formation of a 1:1 complex between GST-cAGS8 and either Gαi1 or Gβ1γ2. The proportion of cAGS8 associated with a Gβ1γ2 subunit complex appears to be greater than the proportion of cAGS8 with Gαi1 consistent with higher affinity binding of cAGS8 to Gβ1γ2 relative to Gαi1. When cAGS8 was mixed with Gαi1 and Gβ1γ2 together, the three proteins eluted earlier (fraction 23) than the individual cAGS8-Gα or cAGS8-Gβγ complexes at a position consistent with the predicted molecular weight of a 1:1:1 complex, indicating formation of a stable ternary complex containing GST-cAGS8, Gαi1, and Gβ1γ2. cAGS8 Binds to a Rearranged Gαβγ Complex—Experiments were conducted to determine how the complex between GST-cAGS8 and the G protein heterotrimer is assembled. There are two interaction sites between Gα and Gβγ: the Gα switch II interacts with the hot spot on Gβ, and the amino-terminal helix of Gα (α-NT) interacts with blade 1 of the Gβ propeller (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) (see purple helix, Fig 10A). We hypothesized that cAGS8 binding competes for α subunit switch II interactions with the hot spot, but interactions of Gα-NT with the Gβ blade region are maintained. In the complex, simultaneous"

Complexity in a dynamic system is characterized by mutually interacting components (nonlinear network dynamics), hypersensitivity to initial conditions (deterministic chaos), and long-term memory processes (power-law scaling) (1Goldberger A.L.

Because of the fact that multiple enzymes, cofactors, and signaling molecules contribute to efficient cell survival amid spatially/temporally varying stimuli, metabolic networks in a living cell are unique biological candidates for studying the role that complexity plays in regulatory enzyme kinetics. Mitochondria serve dual roles in cellular metabolism; that is, as the hub of cellular energetics as well as the centers of programmed cell death (3Skulachev V.P.

Earlier studies in isolated mitochondria from young/aged animals were unable to provide a realistic picture since they ignored physiologically relevant regulatory cross-talks between mitochondria and cytosol/nucleus. On the other hand lifespan measurements at the whole animal level may indicate specific conditions (such as calorie restriction) in which lifespan can be increased or decreased, but they do not give any clue on the cellular mechanism involved in the aging process per se. It is, therefore, imperative to develop strategies to probe single-cell responses that can report the mitochondrial dynamics in relation to other relevant metabolic networks in living cells rather than in isolated conditions. Furthermore, it is possible to dissect single cell responses under controlled perturbations, and one can obtain mechanistic insights into the complex dynamics of metabolic networks in living cells. With this motivation we sought to ask how the aging process contributes to modifications in subtle dynamics in metabolic networks and how these modifications determine the overall cellular responses during normal substrate metabolism and under oxidative stress. We used liver cells (primary hepatocytes) isolated from young (5 month) and aged (28 month) mouse models as our experimental model system and employed a unique combination of spatially resolved single cell chemical kinetics, scaling analysis, and biochemical assays. We observed that young liver cells manifest nonlinear dynamics for efficiently regulating ROS generation/removal machinery and that these regulatory correlations in free radical dynamics are diminished in aged cells, suggesting that the aging process modulates chemical dynamics (complexity) in liver cell energy metabolism. As a direct consequence of modulated redox/ROS dynamics, the aged cells up-regulate uncoupling protein homolog possibly for mitigating increased oxidative stress, which in turn contributes to diminished bioenergetics during substrate metabolism. Complex behaviors have been reported recently in various physiological signals such as heart beat intervals, gait dynamics, and respiratory signals, thus challenging the classical paradigm of homeostatic regulation (2Stanley H.E.

Our data demonstrate for the first time that similar physiologically relevant nonlinear dynamical features are operative at the level of single cells for efficient regulation of energy metabolism. Hepatocyte Isolation and Cell Culture—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice (wild type, young and aged; obtained from NIA, National Institutes of Health) by perfusing the liver as described (14Zhang Y. Chong E. Herman B. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/small animal Rompun mixture, and liver was perfused through the hepatic portal vein with 0.5 mm EGTA in Ca2+-free Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) for 5 min followed sequentially by wash buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin and 1.8 mm CaCl2 in Ca2+-free EBSS) and by collagenase buffer (0.06% collagenase, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm CaCl2 in Ca2+-free EBSS) for 10-15 min. The liver was then further perfused with wash buffer for 5 min, and hepatocytes were collected. After washing three times with cold wash buffer, the hepatocytes were cultured in William's E media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 μg/ml insulin, 1000 unit/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B in collagen-coated chambered cover glasses (Nalge Nunc International, Napervile, IL). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% of CO2 and 95% air. To minimize the de-differentiation effects due to cell culture, all the experiments were performed within 9-14 h after isolation, and the results reported in this article correspond closely to in vivo conditions. All animal surgeries were performed according to the institutional animal protocol guidelines. Single Cell Kinetics Imaging and Time-series Data Acquisition—Isolated hepatocytes were cultured in 2-well imaging chambers with a glass coverslip bottom at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 8-14 h. Before imaging, medium with serum was replaced by Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) with low glucose. Cultured cells were labeled with two ROS probes: MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen #M36008; 514-nm excitation; 580-nm red emission) and CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen #C6827; 488 nm excitation; 520-nm green emission) in HBSS devoid of any serum. These probes are known to selectively label mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals, respectively. All the cells considered in these experiments showed distinct mitochondrial labeling. Hepatocytes are abundant in mitochondria for the energy requirements, and the basal ROS levels in hepatocytes were almost equal in both young and aged hepatocytes. There was no statistical difference observed between the dye uptake of young and aged hepatocytes. These probes were reported earlier to have high response time so that in the time scales of measurement it is ensured that these probes sense the free radicals in real time. Because both these probes yielded identical results, only Mitosox Red data are presented for the sake of simplicity. Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (63×, 1.3 NA, oil immersion; 25 °C) was used to measure the time-course kinetics of ROS intensity. For monitoring redox (NAD(P)H) kinetics, the cells were imaged in HBSS medium in a homemade two-photon imaging system with the following imaging conditions: 730 nm two-photon excitation; 440/90 nm emission (15Ramanujan V.K. Zhang J-H. Biener E. Herman B. J. Biomed. Opt. 2005; 10: 51407-1-51407-11Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) In a typical kinetics run, a field of view with 6-8 cells were chosen, time-lapse (n = 100 XY scan images) imaging was carried out at regular intervals (∼5 s/acquisition for each channel), 5 mm pyruvate/glutamate (PG) mixture (mitochondrial substrate) was added at n = 20, and the rest of the time-lapse was obtained. There was no focus drift due to the addition of PG substrate (10 μl in a 1-ml volume), and the transient rise in ROS levels was solely due to PG substrate metabolism and not due to the buffer. It is known that pyruvate and glutamate can rapidly enter the liver cells through monocarboxylate transporters (16Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After the data acquisition, small regions of interest (∼20 × 20 pixel size) were selected, each containing nearly 6-8 mitochondria. Average ROS/redox intensity in these regions were calculated using Zeiss 510 software or Fluoview software and transferred to an excel spread-sheet for further analysis. Time-course intensity profiles for individual regions were normalized to the intensity at t = 0 for monitoring fractional changes in ROS kinetics. Further similar kinetics profiles were observed in flow cytometric experiments where typically 106 cells were assayed, suggesting that the kinetics profiles reported in the paper are representative of whole cell population (data not shown). ROS time-series in young and aged hepatocytes were acquired as follows; a field of view with ∼4-6 cells was chosen before measurements. Instead of XY frame-scan, a line scan was performed so that the chosen line spanned all the cells and nearly 50-80 mitochondria. Zeiss LSM510 data acquisition software allows time-lapse acquisition of the line scan. Because the speed of acquisition was critical, only Mitosox fluorescence was monitored for the fluctuation experiments. n = 6000 time points (Δt = 30-100 ms; pixel dwell time = 30-50 μs) were acquired for the chosen line scan. It was ensured to have minimal laser excitation (∼0.5-1% of maximum 20 milliwatt) so that photobleaching was nil or minimum. Rate Constant Analysis—A biphasic pharmacokinetics model was adopted for analyzing the single cell kinetics data. The rationale for this choice is that liver cells displayed a rapid, instantaneous absorption and an immediate fast decay followed by a slower decay, indicating that there are two distinct phases, the first denoting instantaneous response (α phase) and the other denoting steady-state response (β phase). It is known that hepatocytes express monocarboxylate transporters in their plasma membrane which facilitate rapid pyruvate/glutamate transport into the cytosol thereby justifying the assumptions of well mixed container and rapid mixing while analyzing the substrate-induced redox/ROS kinetics (16Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The reversibility of the fluorogenic probe Mitosox Red was tested in a separate experiment where repeated substrate-stimuli yielded identical response times. ROS (elimination) decay was assumed to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics, Kel =-d[I]/dt = Kel. From this differential equation, it is clear that the rate (dI/dt) changes as the concentration changes; however, for a linear model, the rate constant Kel is constant. For statistical comparison of young/aged groups, a one-way analysis of variance test was adopted, and statistical significance was set for values p < 0.05. Scaling Analysis; Detrended Fluctuation Analysis—The major premise of scaling analysis can be summarized as follows. Any cellular process is a manifestation of interactions among many interdependent chemical reactions. If the cellular process is regulated by specific metabolic components (for example, oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes together regulate substrate metabolism in mitochondria), then monitoring the process-specific fluorescence signals can shed light on the underlying regulatory dynamics. Scaling analysis is an elegant way to probe real-time regulatory dynamics by analyzing subtle signal fluctuations (fluorescence fluctuations in the present case) that attempts to look for time-correlations between the signal (or process) at any instant and the same signal (or process) at some other instant. If there are no apparent correlations between the signal in various time-windows, then the underlying process can be assumed to be a “random” process. Brownian diffusion is a classical example of a random process (brownian noise) with no apparent long-range time correlations. On the other hand, a non-random scaling behavior may indicate positive regulatory correlations in timescales that are relevant to the cellular process that is being probed. In the recent past, new analytical strategies have been developed to look for scaling behaviors in physiological signals such as heart beat interval, gait dynamics, etc. In the present work we attempt to undertake a novel application of similar strategies to ROS dynamics at the level of single cells as described below. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a modified root mean square fluctuation analysis of random walk originally developed by C.-K. Peng et al. (17Peng C.K. Havlin S. Stanley H.E. Goldberger A.L. Chaos. 1995; 5: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2902) Google Scholar) to quantify statistical correlations in time-series signal. The original time-series (of length N) is first integrated and then divided into boxes of equal size (n). In each box the integrated profile is fit to a polynomial that gives a local trend in that box. Next, this local trend is subtracted from the integrated profile in each box which is termed “detrending.” Finally, root mean square fluctuation F(n) is calculated from the integrated and detrended signals in each box. These steps are repeated for different values of box size (n) to generate F(n) for broad range of scale sizes n. Intuitively F(n) will increase as n increases, and for scale-invariant signals with power-law correlations, there is a scaling relationship F(n) = nα. In a nutshell, DFA dissects the original time series data into many windows with progressively increasing scale size (n) and calculates the root mean square fluctuations F(n) for every scale size (n) to yield a scaling function F(n) = nα. The scaling exponent α is a quantitative measure of extent of correlations in the signal. α can characterize randomness (α = 0.5 for white noise; α = 1.5 for Brownian noise) or correlations (α < 0.5 for anti-correlations, and 0.5 < α < 1.5 for persistent power law-like correlations) regardless of the nature or source of the fluctuations. Similar crossover in exponents has been noted in earlier studies of physiological signals. An important advantage of the DFA algorithm over other time-series analysis methods is that it can be reliably used for non-stationary signals also since local detrending eliminates the errors associated with being non-stationary. Although this algorithm has been successfully used in quantifying correlations in physiological signals such as heartbeat dynamics and human gait dynamics, to the best of our knowledge there is no systematic application of time-series analysis in single cell dynamics as presented in this paper. We further verified that the DFA plots for simulated noise functions, microscope photomultiplier tube noise, and a fluorescent solution specimen (rhodamine 6G in water) yielded α = 0.5, indicating that the observed correlated dynamics in intact cells is mitochondrial regulation-specific and not due to instrument artifacts. More details about this algorithm can be found in Peng et al. (17Peng C.K. Havlin S. Stanley H.E. Goldberger A.L. Chaos. 1995; 5: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2902) Google Scholar), and source code can be obtained from the webpage of National Research source. Further information on application of this algorithm to mitochondrial signals was recently reported (18Ramanujan V. Biener G. Herman B.A. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: L71-L73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Scaling Analysis; Fast Fourier Transform—Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is another well established power spectrum analysis method to quantify correlations in a time-series signal. The basic idea is to convert the signal in time-domain (s) to frequency domain (Hz) and compute the different frequency components in the signal. A periodic wave (sine wave for example) oscillating with a period T in time-domain will have a single frequency component f = 1/T in FFT amplitude output. Usually time-series analysis output is represented as power spectral density, which is the square of the FFT amplitude. For an uncorrelated noise input, the power spectral density will be flat for the entire frequency scale implying that all frequencies have almost equal amplitudes. This flat power spectral density output is the source of the name “white noise” for uncorrelated randomness. To quantify correlations in an unknown signal, the FFT power spectral density is plotted as a function of frequency (log-log scale). Power spectral density follows a scaling relationship, P(f) = 1/fβ, where the exponent β characterizes randomness (β = 0 for white noise, and β = 2 for Brown noise). FFT plots were obtained by using the FFT tool in Origin 5.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). These plots clearly indicate long-range correlations in redox/ROS fluctuations and further substantiate the results obtained independently from detrended fluctuation analysis. Scaling Analysis; Poincare′ Phase-Plane Plots—Poincare′ plot analysis is a quantitative visual technique whereby the shape of the plot is categorized into functional classes (19Brennan M. Palaniswami M. Kamen P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: 1873-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The Poincare′ plot is a scatterplot of the current ROS fluctuation (instantaneous value) plotted against the preceding instantaneous ROS fluctuation. The plot provides summary information as well as detailed instant-to-instant information on the behavior of the ROS dynamics. Points above the line of identity indicate ROS fluctuations that are longer than the preceding ROS fluctuation, and points below the line of identity indicate a shorter ROS fluctuation than the previous one. Accordingly, the dispersion of points perpendicular to the line of identity (the “width”) reflects the level of short-term variability. This dispersion can be quantified by the S.D. of the distances the points lie from the line of identity. This measure is equivalent to the S.D. of the successive differences of the ROS fluctuations. ATP Measurements—Isolated hepatocytes were transferred to William's E medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For different treatments mentioned in the text (complex inhibition, glycolytic inhibition, and OxPhos uncoupling), separate microcentrifuges each containing ∼1 million cells/ml were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The serum-containing medium was removed, and the cell pellet was washed twice in HBSS before resuspending in 1 ml of HBSS. The cellular ATP extraction was carried out as described earlier (23Starkov A.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, the control and inhibitor-treated cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C to obtain a solid cell pellet. The cellular ATP was then extracted by adding 1 ml of boiling water to the pellet. After vortexing and centrifugation (12,000 × g; 5 min; 4 °C), the supernatant was carefully removed and immediately transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge maintained in ice. Bioluminescent detection of ATP was carried out by using Enliten ATP assay system (#FF2000, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) which detects ATP by using the reaction ATP + d-luciferin + O2 → oxyluciferin + AMP + pyrophosphate + CO2 + light (560 nm). When ATP is the limiting component in the luciferase reaction, the intensity of the emitted light is proportional to the concentration of ATP. Luminescence measurements were carried out by using a luminometer (TD20/20, Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). ATP standards were prepared and measured in identical conditions to yield a standard curve. Results presented are representative of three different experiments performed in identical conditions, each in duplicate. Western Blots—Proteins in whole cell lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blotted for molecules of interest with anti-UCP2 (1:500; Calbiochem), anti-complex II (1:10,000, MitoSciences), anti-cytochrome c (1:1000, MitoSciences), anti-SOD2 (1:250, SantaCruz Biotechnologies) overnight. The bound primary antibodies were detected using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection with a SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Student's t test was employed where necessary to obtain statistical significance (p < 0.05) in densitometry. Young and Aged Cells Show Significant Differences in Single Cell ROS/Redox Kinetics—To establish and validate single cell chemical kinetics approach, we first monitored redox (NADH/NAD+) and ROS kinetics in intact hepatocytes. Fig. 1 shows representative fluorescence intensity images of young and aged hepatocytes showing superoxide-selective Mitosox Red labeling (confocal) and two-photon excited autofluorescence (NAD(P)H) emission signals. Average kinetics profiles (redox and ROS) in young and aged hepatocytes from 6-8 independent experiments are shown, and as can be seen, young and aged cells show distinct kinetics profiles upon mitochondrial substrate stimulus. In addition to the transient increase and a subsequent decay in redox signals, aged cells show an additional broad peak that was absent in young cells. Similar to redox kinetics, there is a corresponding increase in steady-state ROS levels in both young and aged cells. However, aged cells clearly show the difference in removal rates of steady-state ROS levels indicating differences in antioxidant responses to transient perturbations in young and aged hepatocytes. A biphasic pharmacokinetics model (α, initial substrate oxidation phase; β, steady-state substrate oxidation phase) was adopted to analyze the ROS removal kinetics, and these parameters are summarized in Fig. 1, d and e. We observed that aged cells have a slower ROS removal rate than young cells. To investigate the effects of respiratory chain inhibition on ROS kinetics parameters, we selectively preconditioned the young and aged cells with respective inhibitors. Fig. 1 summarizes the pharmcokinetics parameters obtained after respiratory chain inhibition at complex I site (10 μm rotenone) or complex III site (10 μm antimycin A) before carrying out the substrate-induced ROS kinetics. This quantitatively verifies that young and aged cells differ in their ability to respond to transient perturbations to steady-state ROS levels. It is interesting to note that transient perturbations in fact enable the cells to explore new steady states when challenged with a stimulus of mitochondrial substrates. Quantitative analysis of basal NAD(P)H oxidation kinetics (Fig. 2a) revealed that young cells have a significantly higher oxidation rate than aged cells, which may indicate an impaired complex I function in aged cells. Fig. 2b shows the cellular response to multiple PG stimuli, demonstrating rapid substrate mixing in cells and, thus, justifying the assumed biphasic pharmacokinetics model. Young cells also differ from aged cells in their response to complex inhibitors in real-time as exemplified by rotenone-induced NAD(P)H kinetics. Interestingly, aged cells show a higher redox signal when stimulated by complex II substrate (Fig. 2d) succinate, in contrast to the case where the cells were stimulated with complex I substrates (pyruvate/glutamate), and this feature will be discussed in a later section of this article.FIGURE 2Redox metabolism in hepatocytes. a, statistical comparison of basal NADH oxidation rate in young and aged hepatocytes. b, multiple substrate stimuli have equivalent response time (as seen by the fast rise in NADH) indicating that the substrate transport within the cells is very rapid to be analyzed as an instantaneous event.c, effect of complex I inhibition (10 μm rotenone) on NADH levels in young and aged hepatocytes. d, effect of succinate oxidation (complex II activity) in young and aged hepatocytes. The increase redox levels in aged hepatocytes is in consensus with the higher complex II expression in aged hepatocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aged Cells Show Characteristic Reduction in Nonlinear Scaling Behavior in ROS Dynamics—ROS-sensitive fluorescence labeling in cultured hepatocytes was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3a shows representative time-series data indicating ROS-sensitive signal fluctuations. Self-similarity of fluctuations can be seen in different time-windows as indicated. Fig. 3b shows a summary of scaling behavior obtained from DFA of the time-series data in intact cells (representative of n = 6 experiments). Short-term (0 < log n < 1.5) scaling behavior resembles white noise limit (scaling exponent α = 0.5). However, there is a distinct crossover at larger time scales (1.5 < log n < 4) where both young and aged cells display scaling exponent α ∼ 1.1 that is much lower than the brown noise limit of 1.5, indicating that both young and aged hepatocytes display non-random, positive correlations during resting metabolic status. Also shown in the figure is the summary of scaling behaviors in young and aged cells when metabolizing mitochondrial substrate pyruvate/glutamate. Under these conditions of transient metabolic perturbations, the young cells maintain their scaling integrity (α = 1.16), whereas the aged cells display a reduction in scaling behavior as manifested in the long-term scaling exponents (α = 1.38). DFA scaling plot of the randomized time-series ROS data in both young and aged hepatocytes yielded a value of α = 0.5 as shown in the figure. This indicates that the observed scaling exponents in hepatocytes are genuinely related to intrinsic dynamics and not an analytical artifact. Because white noise (α = 0.5) and brown noise (α = 1.5) limits can be interpreted as measures of uncorrelated randomness, any deviation from these values will indicate the extent to which a system exhibits nonlinear dynamica"
https://openalex.org/W2079066724,"The collision of two ultracold atoms results in a quantum mechanical superposition of the two possible outcomes: each atom continues without scattering, and each atom scatters as an outgoing spherical wave with an s-wave phase shift. The magnitude of the s-wave phase shift depends very sensitively on the interaction between the atoms. Quantum scattering and the underlying phase shifts are vitally important in many areas of contemporary atomic physics, including Bose-Einstein condensates, degenerate Fermi gases, frequency shifts in atomic clocks and magnetically tuned Feshbach resonances. Precise experimental measurements of quantum scattering phase shifts have not been possible because the number of scattered atoms depends on the s-wave phase shifts as well as the atomic density, which cannot be measured precisely. Here we demonstrate a scattering experiment in which the quantum scattering phase shifts of individual atoms are detected using a novel atom interferometer. By performing an atomic clock measurement using only the scattered part of each atom's wavefunction, we precisely measure the difference of the s-wave phase shifts for the two clock states in a density-independent manner. Our method will enable direct and precise measurements of ultracold atom-atom interactions, and may be used to place stringent limits on the time variations of fundamental constants."
